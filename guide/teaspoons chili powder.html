tablespoon olive oil 1 pound ground chuck, 85% lean<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 small onion, chopped<br> 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder<br> 2 tablespoons tomato paste<br> 1 cup tomato sauce<br> 1 tablespoon light brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce<br> 1 teaspoon soy sauce<br> 4 sesame seed topped hamburger buns, lightly toasted<br> 1/3 cup Fruit Drink Pickles, recipe follows One 24-ounce jar dill pickle chips One .23-ounce packet powdered fruit drink, such as Kool-Aid (any flavor)<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and some salt and pepper and cook, breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon, until brown, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, pepper, and chili powder and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce, sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire, soy sauce and 1/2 cup water and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve the meat on the buns topped with Fruit Drink Pickles. Drain the brine from the pickles into a bowl. Add the fruit drink packet and sugar and stir until dissolved. Add the brine back to the jar (discard any that doesn&#39;t fit). Refrigerate at least 2 days and up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 51199,&quot;Peruvian-Style Spatchcock Chicken with Creamy Cilantro Sauce One 3- to 4-pound whole chicken, spatchcocked (have your butcher do it) 3 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon cl sambal<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon pasilla or ancho powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt Zest and juice of 2 limes Freshly cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> Creamy Cilantro Sauce, recipe follows, for serving 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves 2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves 1 tablespoon honey<br> 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 3 serrano chiles, seeds and ribs removed, chopped<br> Zest and juice of 2 limes<br> 1 clove garlic 1/2 cup mayonnaise Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Gently separate the skin of the chicken from the meat with your fingers. Whisk together the soy, sambal, mustard, pasilla/ancho powder, cumin, salt, lime zest and juice and a few cracks of black pepper. Pour into a ziptop bag, add the chicken and marinate, refrigerated, overnight. When ready to cook, place a cast-iron skillet on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry. Carefully remove the hot skillet and lower the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Add the vegetable oil to the skillet, place the chicken breast-side down in it and return it immediately to the oven. Roast until well browned, 20 to 30 minutes. Gently flip the chicken and cook until the breast registers 160 degrees F, about another 10 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes on a cutting board. Slice and serve with Creamy Cilantro Sauce. Put the cilantro, oregano, honey, mustard, cumin, serrano, lime zest and juice and garlic in a food processor. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides to evenly distribute. Add the mayo and pulse until combined. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 51200,&quot;Guacamole with Sour Cream 2 large Hass avocados 2 tablespoons medium salsa 1 tablespoon sour cream 1 tablespoon jalapeno juice Salt Instructions: Peel avocado and remove pit. Place in a bowl and mash. Stir in salsa, sour cream, and jalapeno juice. Add salt, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51201,&quot;Rhode Island Quahog Chowder 7 1/2 pounds red bliss potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice Water, to cover 1 heaping tablespoon white pepper 1 heaping tablespoon salt 1 1/2 pound ground salt pork 1 1/2 Spanish onion, diced 1 quart chopped quahogs 1 quart quahog juice 1 heaping tablespoon fresh thyme Instructions: In large stock pot, cover potatoes with water by 2 inches. Add salt and pepper, and bring to boil then reduce to a simmer. In large skillet, heat the salt pork. Add the onion and saute. When onions are translucent, add to the simmering potatoes. Add quahogs, quahog juice, and thyme to the potatoes. Simmer for 30 minutes or until potatoes are cooked through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Chenin Blanc, Sparkling wine]&quot; 51202,&quot;Fried Chicken 1/4 cup berbere spice mix or mild cl powder (such as ancho cl powder) 1/4 cup hot smoked paprika 2 tablespoons celery salt 2 tablespoons freshly ground white pepper 2 tablespoons ground cumin<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder Kosher salt Kosher salt 4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds) 4 skin-on chicken drumsticks (about 1 pound) 1 quart buttermilk 3/4 cup coconut milk 6 cloves garlic (2 minced, 4 unpeeled) Peanut or canola oil, for frying 2 to 3 sprigs rosemary 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup semolina flour 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon freshly ground white pepper Instructions: Make the spice blend: Combine the berbere, paprika, celery salt, white pepper, cumin, garlic powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a bowl. Brine the chicken: Stir 1 cup salt and 8 cups cold water in a large bowl until the salt dissolves. Add the chicken to the brine, cover and refrigerate 1 hour, 30 minutes. Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry. Marinate the chicken: Whisk the buttermilk, coconut milk, minced garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon of the prepared spice blend in a large bowl. (Reserve the remaining spice blend for sprinkling.) Submerge the chicken in the marinade; cover and refrigerate overnight. Heat the oil: Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it almost come to room temperature, about 1 hour. Fill a large cast-iron skillet about halfway with peanut oil; add the rosemary and whole garlic cloves. Heat over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F, or until a pinch of flour added to the oil sizzles and rises to the surface. Bread the chicken: While the oil heats, mix the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, cornstarch and white pepper on a baking sheet. Remove the chicken from the marinade with tongs, letting the excess drip off. Roll the chicken in the flour mixture to coat thoroughly, then sprinkle more of the flour mixture on top. Fry the chicken: Shake off any excess flour from the chicken, then, using tongs, carefully lower each piece into the hot oil. Fry, turning occasionally, until just cooked through, about 7 minutes. (Reduce the heat to medium if the crust starts to brown too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and let rest, 10 minutes. Discard the garlic cloves and rosemary. Fry again: Reheat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees F to 380 degrees F. Fry the chicken again, this time in 2 batches to avoid crowding the pan, until the breading is crisp and deep golden brown, about 1 minute. Season the chicken: Transfer the chicken to the rack to cool slightly, and sprinkle with the reserved spice blend. Keep the fried chicken warm in a 250 degrees F oven for up to 1 hour before serving, or let cool and pack for a picnic. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 51203,&quot;Sweet and Crunchy Broccoli Salad 4 cups chopped broccoli in 1/2-inch pieces (from about 2 heads) 8 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/3-inch dice<br> 1/2 cup mascarpone 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup dried cranberries<br> 1/2 cup walnuts, toasted, chopped<br> 1/2 cup crumbled aged gorgonzola<br> Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of ice water alongside. Add the broccoli to the pot and blanch for 1 to 2 minutes, just until bright green and crisp. With a slotted spoon, remove the broccoli to the ice water to shock. Drain well. Place the pancetta in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until crispy and browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels, reserving 1 tablespoon of the fat. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, use a rubber spatula to mix together the mascarpone, mayonnaise, cider vinegar and salt. Add the broccoli, pancetta, reserved fat, cranberries, walnuts and gorgonzola. Toss well to coat and combine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 51204,&quot;\The Best Mashed Potatoes<br> 2 1/2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, well scrubbed and cut into quarters Kosher salt 1 stick unsalted butter 3/4 cup half-and-half 1 cup shredded smoked gouda Freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup thinly sliced chives Instructions: Slip the potatoes into a large pot of cold salted water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the butter and half-and-half in a small pot until the butter melts and the mixture is hot.

Transfer to a medium bowl and run under cold water until almost all the white starch comes off and the water runs clear. Drain the potatoes well and pat very dry with paper towels. Dry the bowl as well. Return the dry potatoes to the bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper until evenly coated. Preheat the air fryer of a smart countertop grill to 315 degrees F. Shingle the potato slices in the bottom of the basket; it&#39;s OK if there are two layers. Cook until the potatoes are golden around the edges and crisp, tossing every 5 minutes with tongs to evenly cook, 20 to 25 minutes. If you notice a few chips are finished cooking and completely crisp before others, remove to a bowl and continue air frying the remaining slices. (Do not cook longer than 25 minutes, they will continue to crisp as they cool.) Meanwhile, thinly slice both beets on the mandoline, about 1/16 inch thick. Transfer to another medium bowl and toss with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper until evenly coated. Return the air fryer to 320 degrees F. Shingle the beet slices in the bottom of the basket; it&#39;s OK if there are two layers. Cook until the beets are darkened around the edges and crisp, tossing every 5 minutes with tongs to cook evenly, about 30 minutes.

In a hot cast-iron skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Sear the fish on both sides until the flesh is opaque about 3 minutes each side. Combine the Hollandaise Sauce with chili-garlic sauce, chipotle powder and crabmeat. Serve each fillet with 1/4 cup sauce. Combine all the ingredients and mix. Store in a sealed container. Melt the butter and margarine in a 1-quart saucepan over low heat. Raise the heat and bring to a rapid boil. Remove from the heat and cool, about 5 minutes. Skim the foam from the top and discard. Pour the butter into a large glass measuring cup and set aside. Meanwhile, in a medium stainless steel mixing bowl or in the top of a double boiler, combine all the remaining ingredients. Mix together with a metal whisk until blended. Place the bowl over a pan of slowly simmering, but not boiling, water. The bowl must never touch the water. Vigorously whisk the egg mixture, picking up the bowl frequently to let the steam escape. Whip until the egg mixture is very light and creamy and has a sheen, 6 to 8 minutes. This amount of beating is important so that the cooked eggs will better be able to hold the butter. Remove the bowl from the pan of hot water. Gradually ladle about 1/4 cup of the butter mixture (use the top butterfat, not the butter solids on the bottom) into the egg mixture while vigorously whipping the sauce. Make sure the butter you add is well mixed into the sauce before adding more. Continue gradually adding the surface butterfat until you&#39;ve added about 1 cup. So that you can get to the butter solids, ladle out and reserve about 1/2 cup surface butterfat into the sauce, whisking well. Use any remaining bottom solids in another dish. Then, gradually whisk in enough of the reserved top butterfat to produce a fairly thick sauce. The butterfat thickens the sauce, so you may not need to use it all. Serve immediately (or as soon as possible, keeping the sauce in a warm place, such as on top of the stove, until ready to serve). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51227,&quot;Chilled Roasted Red Pepper Soup with Avocado-cl Salsa 1 tablespoon extra-virgin oil 1 small onion, minced 3 cloves garlic, chopped 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 cup Marsala 6 red bell peppers, roasted, peeled, seeded, and diced 2 1/2 cups rich chicken stock or vegetable stock, or more as needed 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 onion, minced 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 Anaheim chiles, roasted, peeled, seeded, and chopped 1 dried ancho cl, roasted and pulverized 2 avocados, cut into small dice 2 limes, juiced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream Cilantro sprigs, for garnish Instructions: To make the soup, heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat until very hot.

Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water. The dryer the cabbage the better. In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock. Cook a tester to check the seasoning. For the dough: In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt. Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4 cup increments. Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long &#39;noodle&#39;, 1-inch in diameter. Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter.<br> Making the dumplings: Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half-moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up.<br> Cooking the dumplings: In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp up again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51233,&quot;Pumpkin Pie Cocktail 2 1/2 cups whole milk 6 large egg yolks 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup Butternut Squash Simple Syrup, recipe follows 1 cup rye whisky Ice 1 cup whipped cream, homemade or store-bought Ground cinnamon, for garnish 1 cup butternut squash juice (processed using a juicer) 1/2 cup sugar 3 allspice berries 1 cinnamon stick 1 clove Instructions: Pour the milk into a medium saucepan and place over medium-low heat.

Put a baking sheet on the rack in the center of the oven and close the door. Drizzle both sides of the fish with olive oil and season the inside and outside with salt. Stuff the cavity with the lemon slices and the leftover fennel stalks and fronds. Open the oven door and carry the fish over squarely in both of your hands. Put the fish in the center of the hot sheet pan and quickly close the door so minimal heat escapes. You should hear the fish sizzle slightly as it hits the hot sheet pan. Reduce the heat to 450 degrees F and cook for about 20 to 25 minutes, then open the door to look at the fish. The eyes will turn white when it s cooked. Touch the fish near the head. It should feel fairly firm, if cooked. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and allow it to rest a few minutes as is. Use 2 spatulas, 1 under the head and the other under the midsection, to transfer the fish to a serving platter. Use a paring knife to gently cut around the head and the tail. Cut down the length of the back until you can insert 1 of your spatulas down the length of the top fillet and lift it off the bone. Then, lift the head and the full backbone off the fish, unveiling the second fillet. Season the fish with a pinch of salt and lemon juice.

For the peaches: Over high heat, in a saute pan, heat the butter. When the butter is hot add the sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the peaches and saute for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the sugar starts to turn dark amber in color. Incorporate the brandy into the peach mixture. Carefully ignite the brandy and flambe the peaches. Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 10 minutes. For the custard: In a mixing bowl, whisk all the ingredients together until fully incorporated. In an unbaked pie crust, spoon the brandied peaches over the pie crust. Place the crust in the oven and pour the custard into the shells. This prevents spilling the custard in the oven. Bake for 1 hour or until the custard sets. Place foil around the crust for the first 30 minutes and then remove. This keeps the crust from getting too brown. Allow to cool for about 30 minutes. Place a slice of the pie on the plate and garnish with powder sugar, whipped cream, and fresh mint. For the crust: In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt and sugar. Add the shortening and work it through with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and work it in with your hands until you have a smooth ball of dough. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface. This recipe will make two pie crusts. For the individual crust: Divide the dough into fourths. Roll out the dough on the floured surface into a circle about 5 inches in diameter and 1/8-thick. For the whole pie crust: Roll out the dough on the floured surface into a circle about 14 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick. Gently fold the circles of dough in half and then in half again so that you can lift it without tearing it, and unfold into a 9-inch pie pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 51247,&quot;Cherry Gin-gria 2 ounces gin 2 ounces cherry syrup 5 to 6 ounces club soda 1-ounce red wine Maraschino cherries and fresh or frozen raspberries, for garnish Instructions: Fill a tall glass with ice cubes.

Whisk in 3 tablespoons of the oil, the parsley and scallions. Season with salt and pepper. Heat an outdoor grill or large cast-iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush the pork tenderloin with 1 more tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Grill until charred on all sides and the internal temperature on an instant-read thermometer registers 135 degrees F, 12 to 16 minutes. Meanwhile, brush the cut side of the plums with 1 more tablespoon of oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place the plums, cut-side down, on the grill and cook until charred and the top of the flesh is just softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Some of the flesh might stick to the grill but that is okay, the plums will still have a nice, slightly charred flavor. Remove the pork from the grill and rest for 10 minutes. Slice thinly on a diagonal against the grain. Sprinkle the slices lightly with salt. Toss the baby arugula with the remaining oil and the lemon juice in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. To plate, divide the arugula salad among 4 plates, keeping the salad on 1 side of the plate. Smear some goat cheese sauce on the other side of the plates.

In a small bowl toss the breadcrumbs with 1/3 cup cold water to re-hydrate. In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, pork, veal, beef, Parmesan, Pecorino, parsley, salt, onion, garlic, and egg and mix until combined. Season the meat mixture with pepper. Using your hands, gently form the meat mixture into 18 slightly larger than golf ball-sized balls. (Packing the meat mixture too tightly together will result in tough meatballs). Refrigerate for at least an hour or up to 24. Heat half the oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer the meatballs to a plate. Drain the oil and wipe out the skillet, return to the heat, and repeat with the remaining oil and meatballs. Drain and wipe out the skillet again. Return all the meatballs to the skillet and pour in the marinara sauce. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, swirling the pan occasionally, until the meatballs are cooked through about 15 minutes. The cheese in the meat balls will start to melt when the meatballs are ready. Serve immediately with spaghetti or on sandwiches. These meatballs can be stored, covered in the refrigerator for 3 days or frozen for up to 6 weeks. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute the onion and garlic, stirring, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and the herb sprigs and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Remove and discard the herb sprigs. Stir in the salt and season with pepper to taste.

Let it boil for 2 minutes, then remove the pot from heat and add polenta flour by the handful, beating constantly. Continue to add the flour slowly, controlling the flow to a thin stream through your fingers to avoid lumps. Return the pot to the stove and bring to low simmer. Continue cooking for about 40 minutes, stirring constantly. Polenta will be done when it cleanly pulls away from the sides of the pot. Stir in the butter, heavy cream and cheese. Once combined, carefully pour the polenta onto a large sheet pan (12 by 18-inch). Spread it out evenly and let it cool completely until firm to the touch, about 1 1/2 hours. Sauce: In a large saute pan over high heat, add the butter, chopped garlic, porcini mushrooms, and salt and pepper, to taste. Cook without stirring until the water from the mushrooms has been released and has evaporated. Add the Marsala wine, and parsley and begin stirring with a wooden spoon. Once the ingredients are incorporated, add the cream, reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking until the cream is reduced by half and has a thick consistency. Remove from the heat and keep covered. Set aside. Heat the canola oil over high heat in a large deep pot or a deep-fryer. Meanwhile, slice the cooled polenta into desired size and shape. Once the oil has reached frying temperature, add the polenta, in batches, and deep-fry until golden brown. Arrange the polenta on serving plates and spoon the desired amount of sauce over the top.

In a medium bowl combine the ricotta, 1 cup of the grated cheese, eggs, and pepper. Fill each crepe with approximately 1/4 cup of the cheese mixture centering it in a straight line down the middle. Top with the shredded mozzarella. Take one end of the crepe and fold over the cheese filling. Then take the other end and pulling slightly, fold over in a wrapping motion overlapping the stuffed portion of the crepe. Repeat until all 12 crepes are filled. Spread one cup of the sauce in the bottom of a large baking pan that has been sprayed with a non-stick cooking spray. Place the filled manicotti in the pan, seam down, side-by-side. Do not overlap, and do not layer them. Spoon the remaining sauce over the manicotti. Be sure to cover all the pasta. Sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese. Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for approximately 30 minutes or until the sauce is hot and bubbling. Remove from the oven and let stand for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before serving. This will give the manicotti time to settle which will make for easy serving. The manicotti will fall apart if served immediately. In a pan heat the olive oil. Add onions and cook until translucent. Add garlic and cook for a few minutes on medium heat. Do not let garlic burn. Add tomatoes, basil, oregano, and pepper.

When working with the phyllo dough, only remove the sheets you immediately need, keeping the other sheets covered in plastic wrap, then a damp cloth. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) of the butter in a small saucepan. Toss together the chopped pecans and cinnamon in a bowl. Set aside. Thoroughly butter a rectangular baking pan with the melted butter. Make sure the sheets of phyllo will generally fit in the pan. (If they&#39;re a little bigger, that&#39;s okay; if they&#39;re much bigger, just trim them with a sharp knife.) Butter the top sheet of phyllo with melted butter, then grab it and the unbuttered sheet below it. Flip the sheets over and set them in the pan buttered-side down. Press them lightly into the pan. Repeat this twice more, so that you have 6 sheets of phyllo in the pan, 3 of the sheets buttered. Sprinkle on enough pecans to make a single layer. Butter 2 sheets of phyllo and place them on top of the pecans buttered-sides down. Add more pecans, then 2 more buttered phyllo sheets. Repeat this a couple more times, or until you&#39;re out of pecans. Top with 4 more buttered phyllo sheets, buttered-sides down. Butter the top of the final sheet. Cut a diagonal diamond pattern in the baklava using a very sharp knife. Bake until very golden brown, about 45 minutes. While the baklava is baking, combine the honey, sugar, vanilla, 1/2 cup water and the remaining 1 stick butter in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. When you remove the baklava from the oven, drizzle half of the honey mixture evenly all over the top. Allow it to sit and absorb for a minute, then drizzle on a little more until you think it&#39;s thoroughly moistened. You&#39;ll likely have some of the honey mixture leftover, which you can drink with a straw. Just kidding. Allow the baklava to cool, uncovered, for several hours.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a small baking sheet or glass baking dish with vegetable oil cooking spray. Set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, 3 tablespoons of olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper until smooth. Pour the mixture into a sealable plastic bag or a glass baking dish. Add the halibut and coat it with the lemon mixture. Refrigerate for 35 minutes. Remove the halibut from the marinade and arrange them on the prepared baking sheet.

When the oil begins to smoke, add the egg and swirl the skillet to make a flat egg pancake that&#39;s only half set, about 10 seconds; scoop out onto a plate. Add the shrimp to the skillet, sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Add the remaining tablespoon oil, then add the watercress, carrots, peas, garlic, soy sauce, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the watercress wilts and the peas heat through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice, stirring to break up any clumps, and spread it out in the skillet. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.

Add pistachios, shaking the skillet frequently so that nuts don&#39;t burn. Toast until the pistachios turn a little brown. They should smell delicious too. Quickly remove the pan from the heat and transfer the nuts to a bowl; otherwise they&#39;ll keep cooking and burn. Add the pistachios to a blender along with the garlic, half of the lemon juice, the hot sauce, if using, hot water, a sprinkle of salt and pepper and the canola oil. Blend until smooth. If it doesn&#39;t form a paste, add more water and more oil and blend until smooth. The consistency should be like a thin hummus; don&#39;t worry if you feel like you&#39;re adding a lot of oil. Taste and add a little extra-virgin olive oil and more lemon juice if you want more zing, which I recommend. It cuts the oils from the pistachios. Set aside once you&#39;re happy with it. Wash the spinach and dry thoroughly, so the leaves can be coated with the dressing. Toss the spinach, apple, and celeriac in a large serving bowl and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Pour 1/2 of the dressing over the salad and toss again. If you prefer more dressing, add it all, which I recommend. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then garnish with pistachios and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 51280,&quot;White Chicory Salad with Apricot Dressing and Grilled Whole Wheat Pita Croutons 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br> 2 tablespoons apricot puree<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 whole-wheat pitas Canola oil, for brushing Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 heads frisee, sliced 4 ounces baby arugula<br> 1/3 cup Marcona almonds<br> 4 ounces young fontina cheese, grated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives<br> Instructions: For the apricot dressing: In a bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, apricot puree, honey and some salt and pepper.

Line 4 baking sheets with parchment paper. Use an apple corer to remove the seeds and cores of the apples. Trim a small sliver off the bottom of each apple to create a flat bottom, so that they can&#39;t roll. Cut the apples into thin slices, about 1/8-inch thick. Place the apple slices in a large mixing bowl. Pour in the lemon juice and toss gently to combine. Combine the sugar and cinnamon with a pinch of salt in a small mixing bowl.

Allow to rest for 30 minutes. Over a pot of salted boiling water, pass the dough through a perforated pan or spaetzle maker. Once the dumplings float, strain out of the water and place them on a tray until room temperature. Moisten with a little oil and store for up to 2 days, refrigerated. In a pot place 2 tablespoons of butter, 2 shallots, 1 cup of leeks and 1 cup of mushrooms and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. Then add the fish stock and reduce by half. Add your 1-quart of cream and reduce by another two thirds. Place in a blender until smooth and pass through a strainer. Adjust with salt and pepper. You will need 2 pans for cooking and a small pot for your sauce. In a pan on medium-high heat, add the oil and allow 30 seconds to heat up. Then place the fillet of fish away from you in a pan so it doesn&#39;t splash you. While the fish is cooking, put the other pan on high heat, place half of the butter and allow to brown slightly. Once slightly brown add the spatzle and allow to cook for about 1 1/2 minutes. At this stage add the fava beans and lobster; allow to cook for no more than 2 minutes. Your fish should be almost cooked by this point with a nice golden brown crust, flip and finish for 1 minute. Place the sauces on warm plates with the spatzle saute in the middle and the drained fish on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 51294,&quot;Ham and Cheese Galette 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 1 9-ounce box frozen artichoke hearts 1 small leek (white and light green parts only), sliced 1 4-ounce piece Black Forest ham, chopped 1 1/2 cups chopped broccoli florets Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 round refrigerated pie dough (half of a 14-ounce package) 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 cup grated gruyere cheese 6 radishes 5 cups mixed baby greens (about 3 ounces) 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450?.

If you&#39;re cooking outside you can cook over the grill flames. Add the pancetta to the pot and crisp it up, 3 to 4 minutes, add the onion to the pot and season with salt and pepper - go heavy on that pepper. The black pepper will really balance out the sweetness of your sauce later on. Add the bay leaf to the pot. While the onions cook, place the ground chicken in a bowl and add fennel seed, red pepper flakes, allspice, orange zest, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper, to taste, and cheese. Mix the meat with seasonings and form 4 large patties. Make a shallow dent in each patty at the center of it to prevent the burger from bulging up as it cooks. Wash up and drizzle the patties liberally with extra-virgin olive oil. Place the patties on the grill and cook 6 to 7 minutes on each side. When the onions are very soft and begin to caramelize, remove the bay leaf and add the Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, honey or sugar, and orange juice. Let the sauce thicken up and sweeten up 6 to 7 minutes until the liquids are syrupy. Adjust the black pepper level to your taste. Mix the chopped endive, shredded arugula and chopped radicchio together. Pile the chopped lettuces on the bun bottoms top with burgers and lots of onion barbecue sauce.

Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the beans, ham hock, and cilantro. Pour in enough water to cover the ingredients by 2 inches. Toss in the bay leaves and bring the water to a boil, then adjust the heat so it is boiling gently. Cook the beans until tender, about 2 hours. Keep an eye on the beans; they should always be covered by liquid. When the liquid meets the level of the beans, top it off with cold water. Toward the end of cooking, ease up on the liquid you add; the goal is to have the beans barely covered with liquid by the time they&#39;re tender. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid. Discard the turkey wing or ham hock and the bay leaves. (Leave the cilantro in with the beans.) Put the bean mixture in a food processor and process, gradually adding enough of the reserved liquid, until the beans are the consistency of mashed potatoes. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Mound the beans on a platter and garnish with tortilla chips and radish slices, if using. (The beans can be prepared up to 30 minutes in advance.

Preheat a 14-inch skillet or medium roasting pan over medium heat on your largest burner. Mix grill seasoning, cumin, paprika and coriander together. Place the thyme, cilantro or basil, parsley and pistachios in the food processor and process into a paste. Remove bowl from processor and remove blade from bowl. Have a rubber spatula on hand. Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil generously over the breasts to coat the skin. Loosen skin of the breasts with a small sharp knife. Divide the herb and nut paste between the flesh and skin on each breast. Use your hands to move the paste around under the skin to evenly distribute the mixture. Coat the extra-virgin olive oil coated skin with the spice mixture. Set the coated breasts into the large skillet or roasting pan. Wash hands. Set a second slightly smaller skillet or pan on top of the breasts and weight down with a couple of bricks covered in foil. Crisp the skin 8 to 10 minutes then transfer meat to oven and roast 35 to 40 minutes, until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 165 to 170 degrees F. While turkey roasts, heat a second large, deep skillet over medium to medium-high heat with 5 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces. To melted butter, add bay, celery, apple, 1/2 of the onion and zucchini. Season the vegetables liberally with salt and pepper. Cook 10 minutes or until softened. Add crumbled muffins and sunflower seeds to the pan and combine with the vegetables. Season the stuffing with poultry seasoning then adjust salt and pepper. Dampen the stuffing with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of stock. Pile the stuffing into a serving dish. Place in oven to just crisp up the top along with turkey or, if the pan does not fit, when the turkey comes out, switch on the broiler and crisp the top of stuffing - it should only take a couple of minutes, tops. In a sauce pot, melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat and add the finely chopped remaining 1/2 of the onion. Sweat the onion out 5 to 6 minutes to make it nice and sweet. Add the flour to the skillet and whisk 1 minute. Add in the chipotles and their sauce then whisk in 4 to 4 1/2 cups chicken stock. Thicken the gravy 2 to 3 minutes then season with salt, to taste.

Add turkey and gently combine, being careful not to overwork the meat. Shape into golf-size balls. In a large skillet heat the oil over medium high heat. When almost smoking, add meatballs and without moving or turning the meat, allow it to brown for about 3 minutes. Turn meatballs and brown other side. Continue to cook until all sides are golden brown, about 8 minutes total. Add tomato sauce and bring to a boil. Lower heat and allow meatballs to simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off heat and keep warm on stove. Be careful not to over handle the meatballs since they are soft and fragile. In a large pot, bring to a boil 6 quarts of salted water. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain pasta in a colander. Do not rinse pasta with water since you want to retain the pasta&#39;s natural starches so that the sauce will cling to the penne. Remove meatballs from sauce and place in serving bowl. Pour some tomato sauce over meatballs, but leave about 2/3 cup of sauce in skillet. Place the cooked penne into the skillet with the remaining sauce and toss well. Pour sauced pasta in a large serving bowl. Serve alongside the meatballs.

Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51338,&quot;Tomato Bon Bons 1/2 seedless cucumber, minced 24 grape tomatoes, cored 1 ounce Asiago cheese, cut into 24 small cubes 3 eggs 1 pound ground sausage 1 cup flour Breading, recipe follows 4 cups vegetable oil 1 cup fresh tomato salsa 1 cup ranch dressing 1 cup shredded Asiago cheese 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Dash cayenne pepper Instructions: Stuff each of the tomatoes with a cube of Asiago cheese. Beat 1 egg in a medium bowl. Mix the sausage in until the egg is completely incorporated. Lay a 12 by 12-inch piece of plastic wrap on your workspace. Break off about 3/4 of an ounce of the sausage mixture and make a small pancake in the palm of your hand. Put the stuffed tomato in the middle of the pancake and wrap the sausage around it, rolling it in your palms to create a meatball, making sure the entire tomato is covered with the sausage mixture. Set it on the plastic wrap and continue with the remaining tomatoes. Beat the 2 remaining eggs in a small bowl. Put the flour and Breading in separate small bowls. To set up your breading station, place the 3 bowls in this order: flour, egg, and breading mixture. Lay another 12 by 12-inch piece of plastic wrap on your work space. With one hand (the wet hand), place a bon bon into the flour. With the other hand (the dry hand), roll it around gently until it is lightly coated. Pick it up and place it into the egg bowl. With your wet hand, roll it around gently until it is lightly coated with the egg. Place it into the breading bowl. With your dry hand, sprinkle some Breading over the bon bon, and then begin to gently roll it around to coat it. Place it on the clean piece of plastic wrap. Continue until all of the bon bons have been breaded. If needed, you can roll the bon bons around gently in your clean dry hands to ensure that they&#39;re perfectly round. Let sit while the oil is heating. Using a candy thermometer, heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a pan that is deep enough that the bon bons will be completely submerged. Fry the bon bons 6 at a time until they are completely golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels. (The bon bons can be made ahead and warmed on a sheet pan in a 325 degree F oven for 5 to 7 minutes before serving.) Process the salsa and ranch dressing in a small food processor for about 30 seconds. Pour into a bowl and stir in the cucumber. Serve with the bon bons. Mix all the ingredients well. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51339,&quot;White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake 1 cup slivered almonds 2 cups graham cracker crumbs (7 ounces) 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, melted 8 ounces fine-quality white chocolate 4 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 4 whole large eggs 2 large egg yolks 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 cups fresh raspberries (11 ounces) Fresh raspberries, for garnish Instructions: Make crust: Finely grind almonds and crumbs in a food processor and add butter, blending until combined.

Cut the tip of the choke off. Artichokes have a lot of waste, accept it and move on. Very carefully, using a mandoline, very thin shave the artichokes and put them immediately into the lemon water. The artichokes are best when done at least a couple of hours ahead because they tenderize a little. To assemble the salad: Put the artichokes in a salad spinner to remove they excess water.

Examine steaks for pin bones by rubbing fingers over surface of meat. If found, remove with bone tweezers or pliers reserved for culinary uses. Using a sharp paring or boning knife, trim bones from the cavity side of the steak. Trim the stomach flaps so that 1 side is missing about 2 inches of skin and the other, 1 inch of meat. Roll the skinless section up into the hollow of the cavity, then wrap the other around the outside to form a round resembling a filet mignon. Tie in place with 2 passes of butcher&#39;s twine. (Do not tie it too tight or fish will pop out during cooking.) Combine cumin, coriander, fennel and peppercorns on a double thick piece of aluminum foil and toast over grill, shaking gently until seeds become fragrant. Crush seeds in mortar and pestle or pour into spare pepper grinder. Coat steaks lightly with oil, season with salt, then liberally grind toasted seeds on both sides of steaks.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Sear the beef on all sides until well browned, about 5 minutes total. Let cool, then refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the filling: Place the spinach in a clean kitchen towel and wring out as much liquid as possible. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the spinach, artichokes, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the spinach and artichokes are dry and no liquid remains in the skillet, about 4 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a food processor and let cool to room temperature. Add the garlic-and-herb cheese spread and Parmesan to the cooled spinach mixture and process to a paste. Refrigerate the filling until you are ready to assemble the beef.<br> To assemble: Remove the beef from the refrigerator and brush all over with the Dijon mustard. Beat the egg and milk together in a small bowl. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and roll out 1 sheet of pastry to a 14-by-14-inch square. Transfer the pastry to a sheet of parchment paper or foil. Brush the pastry with egg wash, leaving a bare 1-inch border on all sides. Place the ham in a single layer over the egg wash. Spread the spinach-artichoke filling over the ham. Place the beef at the bottom of the pastry and roll it up with the parchment or foil, using the pastry to surround the beef with the spinach and ham. Peel the pastry layer back down onto the counter, leaving the ham-encased beef now at the top. Roll the beef back towards yourself, this time enclosing it in the pastry. Press the seam to seal and fold up the sides like a present. (Use egg wash if necessary.) Set the beef Wellington seam-side down on a rimmed baking sheet and brush all over with egg wash. Roll the second piece of pastry into a 12-by-12-inch square. Cut the pastry into ten 3/4-inch-wide strips with a fluted wheel cutter. (There will be some leftover pastry.) Lay 5 strips diagonally on top of the roll, pressing at the bottom to adhere. Lay the 5 remaining strips over top those to form a cross hatch pattern and press to adhere. Trim away or tuck in any excess pastry at the bottom. Brush all over with egg wash, and sprinkle the roll all over with flaky sea salt, if desired. Refrigerate until the pastry is very cold and firm, at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Bake until pastry is crisp and golden and the center of the meat registers 120 to 125 degrees on a digital thermometer for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Remove to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes. Use a serrated knife to cut into slices and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51358,&quot;Apricot Breakfast Muffins Crisco?

Equally divide the caramel into 10 to 12 (3 1/2-inch) ramekins and set aside. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Using an electric mixer, beat the softened cream cheese with the eggs on low speed to combine. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until completely incorporated. Add the condensed milk, evaporated milk, whole milk and vanilla extract and continue to beat together until everything is well incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, about 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle the custard over the caramel into the ramekins filling them up to 1/2-inch from the rim. Place a kitchen towel in a deep baking dish or roasting pan and place the ramekins in 2 rows on top of the towel. Place the baking dish in the oven and using a pitcher, pour enough hot water into the baking dish to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins, taking care not to get water in the ramekins. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the flan is just set, about 30 minutes. When you tap the edge of the ramekin the flan should still wobble in the center. Carefully remove the baking dish from the oven, remove the foil and let the ramekins cool slightly. Using tongs remove the ramekins from the water and set on a towel to cool for at least 2 hours before serving. Once cooled completely, the flan can be refrigerated for up to 3 days before un-molding and serving.

Add all the remaining ingredients except for the mozzarella and work them in gently by hand. Divide the mixture into 12 equal pieces. Flatten each piece into a round patty. Top 6 of the patties with a piece of mozzarella and then with a second patty, making 6 polpettones. By hand, press the edges together to seal them and to make patties of even thickness. Sprinkle both sides of the patties with salt and pepper. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over moderate heat. Add olive oil to a depth of 1/8-inch. When the oil is hot, add the 6 patties. Cook on 1 side until lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes, then turn and cook on the second side until browned, 1 to 2 minutes longer. While the patties are cooking, heat the marinara sauce in a deep skillet. Add the cooked patties to the sauce. (Or drain the oil from the skillet and add the tomato sauce directly to the patties.) Put a few tablespoons of grated mozzarella on top of each patty. Simmer the patties in the sauce for about 4 minutes, until the cheese is melted. Assemble the sandwich: Put a few tablespoons of sauce and 1 polpettone on a split roll. Top with a little more sauce and serve immediately. Michael&#39;s Notes: For the lightest polpettone, work the mixture as little as possible. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 51379,&quot;Put the Lime in the Coconut Cake 1 cup butter 2 cups sugar 1 teaspoon coconut oil 4 eggs 2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup sour cream or yogurt 1 cup sugar 2 limes, zested and juicd 1/4 cup coconut milk 1 cup shredded coconut 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup shortening 4 ounces cream cheese 1 pound box plus 1 cup powdered sugar 1/4 cup coconut milk 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 cups shredded coconut Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and grease and flour 2 (9-inch) cake pans.

Line a cupcake pan with 12 paper liners. Heat the milk in a small saucepan to just below a simmer. Pour over the cocoa powder in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Let cool slightly. Stir together the flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl and set aside.<br> Whisk the sugar, oil, egg and vanilla into the cooled cocoa mixture until smooth. Add the flour mixture and whisk just until smooth. Divide the mixture among the paper liners. Bake until a tester inserted in the centers comes out clean, 20 to 23 minutes. Cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> For the frosting: Put the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 30-second intervals, stirring well with a rubber spatula between each, until completely melted and smooth. Cool slightly.<br> Beat the butter on medium high speed with an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and smooth, about 1 minute. Add the cooled chocolate and beat until combined. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and cocoa and beat on low to combine. Add 1 tablespoon milk and the vanilla. Beat on high until light and fluffy, adding the last tablespoon of milk, if needed, to make a smooth, pipeable frosting. Starting with about 1/8 teaspoon, beat in black gel coloring to tint the frosting nearly black (you may need up to 1 teaspoon total).<br> For assembly: Line a baking sheet with parchment and clear space in your refrigerator or freezer to accommodate the level pan. Combine the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a medium microwave-safe bowl and heat in 30-second intervals, stirring well between each, until completely melted and smooth. Let cool slightly. While the chocolate cools, use a paring knife to gently saw off the tip of each ice cream cone (about 3/4 inch) at an angle to make the bent tips of the hats.<br> Use a small spoon to coat the cut end of a cone with melted chocolate and lay it flat on the prepared baking sheet. Attach the tip piece at an angle so it looks like the point of the hat is bent and paint with a little more chocolate to seal the two pieces together. Repeat with the remaining cones and refrigerate or freeze until set, 5 to 10 minutes.<br> Once the cones are fused together, pour the sprinkles into a shallow bowl or small sheet pan. Working one at a time, lightly coat the cones in melted chocolate and roll in the sprinkles. Set upright on the lined baking sheet. Refrigerate the cones until set, 5 to 10 minutes.<br> Put the frosting in a piping bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe a round of frosting in the center of each cupcake and press on a hat to adhere. Cut the sour belts to wrap around the base of the hats about 1/2 inch from the bottom. Use a little frosting to adhere the ends to the hat, if needed. Pipe frosting around the perimeter of the cupcakes to make a brim for each hat. Stick a yellow candy on each sour belt to make a hat buckle, gently pressing it into the frosting so it sticks.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 51381,&quot;Garlic Shrimp 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 dried chiles de rbol<br> 1 1/4 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined Kosher salt 6 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons dry sherry<br> 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for topping Lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Put in a food processor with the basil, pine nuts, garlic, and salt and pepper, to taste. Keep in mind you will add Parmesan as well, so be careful not to oversalt. With the machine running, slowly add the cup of olive oil. When the sauce is about the consistency of mayonnaise, it has enough oil. Pulse in the Parmesan. Thin with water if necessary to achieve a slick, saucy pesto. Scrape into a bowl or jar, cover, and refrigerate until needed. You should have about 3 cups. (Keeps about 2 to 3 days, refrigerated.) Put the potatoes in a pan of salted cold water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and let cool for a few minutes. If the potatoes are larger than about 1/2 inch in diameter, cut in half. Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the potatoes and cook until browned and crispy all over, about 5 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Add basil, toss with potatoes and set aside. While the potatoes are browning, return the water used for cooking the asparagus, if reserved, to a boil or brint a new pot of water to a boil. Add more salt and the pasta and cook until al dente, about 12 minutes. Drain through a colander, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Pour the pasta into a warm serving bowl, add the potatoes, about 1 cup of the asparagus pesto, several twists of pepper, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan. Toss well, thinning with the pasta cooking water as necessary. Dust with a light grating of Parmesan (a microplane grater works well for this) before serving and pass the remaining cheese and a bowl of pesto at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 51392,&quot;Pear-Lemon Martinis 1 lemon, sliced into half moons 1/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 4 ounces pear-flavored vodka 1 ounce dry vermouth 1 ounce pear nectar Pear slices and lemon twists, for garnish Instructions: Combine the lemon slices, sugar and vanilla in a resealable container; cover and shake vigorously until the lemon slices are coated.

Coat an 8-by-2-inch round baking pan with flour-based baking spray. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Add the water, granulated sugar, oil, vinegar and vanilla. Mix on low until combined.<br> Divide the batter among 3 bowls. Tint one bowl with the red food color, one bowl with the orange and one with the yellow. Pour half of each color of batter alternately in the prepared baking pan, then continue with the remaining batter, alternating colors. Swirl the colors together using a skewer or butter knife. Bake the cake until the center springs back when pressed in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the cake from the pan to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> Using a serrated knife or cake leveler, level the cake and reserve the scraps. Cut the leveled cake layer in half.<br> For the buttercream frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment, beat the butter until fluffy. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix on low speed until just combined. Increase the mixer speed and add the vanilla and milk or cream one tablespoon at a time until the mixture thins to piping consistency.<br> Spread about 1/4 cup of the frosting on one half of the cut cake layer and top with the second half. Set aside. Crumble the cake scraps in a bowl using your fingers. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of frosting to the scraps and mix well using your hands. Place about 5 tablespoons of the cake mixture on a parchment-lined baking sheet and form it into a small baton shape with one rounded end for the turkey&#39;s head and neck. Refrigerate to chill, about 15 minutes. (The leftover cake mixture can be used for cake pops.)<br> Fit a piping bag with a plain 1/2-inch round decorator piping tip. Fit 2 piping bags with large open star decorator piping tips. Fit 2 piping bags with large closed star decorator piping tips.<br> Divide the remaining frosting into 5 separate bowls. Tint one bowl with the red food color, another bowl with the orange and another bowl with the yellow. Combine another bowl of frosting with the cocoa powder to create a pale tan color and mix the melted chocolate with the last bowl to create chocolate frosting.<br> Transfer the red bowl of frosting to the piping bag fitted with the plain 1/2-inch round tip. Transfer the yellow and orange frostings into each of the piping bags fitted with the large open star tips. Transfer the light tan and chocolate frostings into each of the piping bags fitted with the large closed star tips.<br> For the assembly: Dip the chilled head and neck piece in the melted chocolate chips and place on the parchment-lined baking sheet using 2 forks. Chill until firm, about 15 minutes. Reserve the leftover melted chocolate for later use.<br> Using the piping bag filled with the red frosting, pipe 1-inch dots of frosting around the top rounded edge of the cake. Place the bowl of a spoon in the center of each dot and pull the frosting down toward the bottom flat edge of the cake.<br> Using the piping bag filled with the tan frosting, pipe shells in a downward motion that overlap the red frosting layer. Use a spoon to remove some of the bottom edge of the shell row to make room for the next layer.<br> Using the piping bag filled with the chocolate frosting, pipe shells in a downward motion that overlap the tan shell layer. Use a spoon to remove some of the bottom edges of the shell row to make room for the next layer.<br> Using the piping bag filled with the yellow frosting, pipe shells in a downward motion that overlap the chocolate frosting layer, but do not remove any of the frosting using a spoon as with the previous rows.<br> Using the piping bag filled with the orange frosting, pipe a final layer of shells at the bottom center of the cake. Remove the chocolate-covered cake piece from the refrigerator and place it in the middle center of the cake. Turn the cake upright so that it sits on its flat cut edge. Using the piping bag filled with chocolate frosting, pipe a shell border on the top edge of the cake so that the shell tips point to the unfrosted side. Using the piping bag filled with the orange frosting, pipe a row of shells that overlaps the row of chocolate frosting shells. Using the piping bag filled with yellow frosting, pipe a row of shells that overlaps the orange frosting. Finish the back of the cake by piping rows of shells using the tan frosting.<br> Reheat the reserved melted chocolate if necessary. Dip the candy bead into the chocolate and adhere to the turkey&#39;s head. Cut the lemon chew in half so that you have 2 triangles. Use the back of a small knife to score a line onto one of the triangles, from the pointed triangle end to the cut edge. Use a small brush to cover the cut edge of the candy with melted chocolate and press onto the rounded edge of the chocolate-covered cake piece to form a beak.<br> Cut a large teardrop-shaped piece from the fruit tape using kitchen-dedicated shears and peel away the backing. Adhere it to the candy chew with chocolate so that it falls behind the beak. Cut a smaller teardrop-shaped piece from the fruit tape and adhere with chocolate, so that it falls in front of the beak. Let stand until set, about 10 minutes.<br> Place the gingersnaps on a baking sheet. Dip the backs of the candy corn pieces into the melted chocolate and arrange 3 on one side of each gingersnap. Let stand until set, about 10 minutes. Insert each cookie upright into the top of the cake so that the candy corn pieces are showing to the front of the turkey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51406,&quot;Tuna in Tomato-Tarragon Broth 6 tuna fillets (about 5 ounces each) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 cup reduced-sodium vegetable or chicken broth 1 cup diced Roma tomatoes 1/4 cup minced shallots 2 tablespoons freshly chopped tarragon leaves 1 cup rice, regular or instant, cooked according to package directions 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: Season both sides of tuna with salt and black pepper.

Reserve the remaining tuna for melts, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 51407,&quot;Edible Blood-Sucking Chocolate Tarantulas with Raspberry Coulis Blood 1 (12-ounce) can condensed milk 1 cup superfine sugar 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted 2 tablespoons 2 percent milk 1 cup marshmallow creme (recommended: Marshmallow Fluff) 1 cup finely shredded unsweetened coconut 1/2 cup coarsely crushed wheat crackers (recommended: Triscuits) 1/2 cup coarsely crushed salted potato chips 2 pounds dark chocolate compound discs (non-tempering chocolate), divided 6 drops caramel oil (available in the candy section of craft stores) Edible gold sparkle, for decorating Raspberry Coulis, recipe follows 1/2 cup superfine sugar 3 tablespoons water 1 pound fresh red raspberries 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Instructions: For the caramel: Place the unopened can of condensed milk in a saucepan and cover with water. Boil for 4 hours, keeping the water level constantly above the top of the can. Remove from the pan and allow to cool for 30 minutes before opening. Cool to room temperature (about 70 degrees). For the coconut paste: Mix all of the ingredients together, stirring well using a wooden spoon. Reserve half (for closing the holes later). Roll the paste into 12 (1 1/2-inch) balls for the spider bodies and 12 (3/4-inch) balls for the spider heads. Make a 3/4-inch hole in the center of the larger balls. Place the condensed milk/caramel into a piping bag and fill the hole. Seal the top by adding more coconut paste, enclosing the caramel. To assemble: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt 1 pound 13 ounces chocolate slowly in a double boiler to 100 degrees (slightly warmer than body temperature). Add the caramel oil and stir gently. Stir in the coconut, giving the chocolate a hairy appearance. Enrobe the spider bodies and heads in the melted chocolate. Join the head and body together before the chocolate sets. Place on the prepared baking sheet and put in the refrigerator to set completely, about 10 minutes. Melt the remaining 3 ounces chocolate and place into a piping bag. Cut a hole in the point of the piping bag to the size of a number 2 piping tip. Pipe 56 (1 1/2-inch) long and 24 (1-inch) long z-shaped spider legs onto the parchment. Allow the legs to set at room temperature. (Do not refrigerate or the legs will curl unnaturally.) Remove the spiders from the refrigerator. Using a dot of melted chocolate, attach the legs to the body, 4 long legs to the side of the body and 2 short legs to the front of the head. Pipe chocolate stripes onto the body. Pipe 2 eyes onto the head and, while wet, sprinkle edible gold sparkle onto the eyes. Place 2 tablespoons Rasberry Coulis on the center of each plate to represent blood. Serve the spiders on pools of Raspberry Coulis. Heat the sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves completely, about 5 minutes. Put the raspberries and the sugar syrup in a blender and puree, pulsing for 6 second intervals. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to remove the seeds.

Clean the chicken and sprinkle the entire bird, inside and out, with salt and pepper. Stuff the bird with the oranges, garlic, onions, celery, rosemary and thyme. Place the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan and bake for 20 minutes. If the chicken is browning too quickly, turn the oven down to 375 degrees F and cook until the internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven, tent with foil and let rest 30 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, work on the garnishes. For the snow peas and carrots: Fill a large pot with water, season with salt and bring to a boil. Prepare an ice bath by placing ice cubes and water in a bowl. Set aside. Dump the snap peas into the boiling water and cook until al dente. Be sure to test the peas as they are cooking to prevent them from overcooking. Use a slotted spoon to remove the snow peas from the water and plunge into the ice bath. Remove from the ice when cool and reserve until service. Put the carrots, ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons butter and brown sugar in a saute pan and add water until the carrots are barely covered. The carrots should be in a single layer. Put on high heat and cook until all the water is nearly evaporated. Cover and set aside for service. For the star anise sauce: Combine the stock, soy sauce, anise seeds, honey, vinegar, sesame oil and thyme and reduce until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Once the chicken has rested, carve the bird by removing the legs from the thighs and slicing the breasts in half.

Meanwhile, pour the milk into a pie plate or shallow bowl and sprinkle with the gelatin in an even layer. Let sit until the gelatin looks completely damp, like wet sand. When the cream just reaches a boil, remove it from the heat and immediately add the chocolate, stirring to mix through. Let sit for a few minutes to melt the chocolate. Lightly coat an 8-inch springform pan with nonstick spray. Pulse the cookies in a food processor until very fine, almost powdery. Add the cookie crumbs to a large bowl and mix in the butter with a wooden spoon until the mixture holds together when pinched. Transfer the crust mixture to the prepared springform and pat evenly into the bottom and sides of the pan. Set aside. Whisk the hot cream and melted chocolate until smooth. Add the gelatin mixture, stirring well to melt the gelatin. Let cool slightly before pouring the filling through a sieve into the crust. Freeze for at least 2 hours or overnight. (To freeze for more than a day, wrap the entire springform in plastic wrap and then foil, and freeze for up to 1 month.)

Add the flour, yeast and salt and mix with the dough hook on low until it comes together, then let the machine knead it for about 5 minutes. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured counter just long enough to coat a mixing bowl with oil, then return the dough to the oiled bowl to rise until doubled, about 2 hours. For the filling and assembly: Butter a 13-by-9-inch (or equivalent size) baking dish, or coat it with nonstick spray. Combine the cream cheese, granulated sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl (I just use a fork to mix this). On a very well-floured counter, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 16 inches wide (on the side facing you) and as far away from you as it comfortably goes, usually 13 to 15 inches. Spread the cream cheese mixture all over the rolled dough. Dollop the jam over it and spread it smooth. Roll the dough into a snug spiral; it will stretch to about 18 inches wide. Cut the log very gently--it&#39;s going to be a soft mess, so use a sharp serrated knife or dental floss--into 1 1/2-inch segments. Arrange each in the prepared baking dish. Brush the tops of the buns with the egg wash and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight, along with the leftover egg wash (also covered). The next morning, remove the buns from the fridge and let warm up for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the tops of the buns with the egg wash again and sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake until the buns are bronzed all over and have an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving. For the glaze (if using): Whisk the powdered sugar together with 3 tablespoons lemon juice until smooth, drizzling in an additional tablespoon of lemon juice as needed to loosen. Drizzle this over the buns, or serve it alongside with a spoon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51428,&quot;Roasted Baby Turnips with Miso Butter and Fried Eggs 3 bunches (about 1 pound) baby turnips (ping pong ball size), greens and soft stems reserved 8 small baby red creamer potatoes (about 1 pound), halved 1 large red onion, peeled with root intact, cut into 6 wedges 1/4 cup vegetable oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons yellow miso 2 cloves garlic, finely grated One 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated 4 scallions, thinly sliced (white and green parts kept separate) 4 to 6 large eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F with a rack set on the middle shelf. Heat a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Gently toss the baby turnips, potatoes and onion wedges with 2 tablespoons of the oil and a light sprinkle of salt and pepper. Carefully add to the hot pan and put in the oven to roast until the vegetables are golden brown and the potatoes are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. While the vegetables are roasting, prepare the miso butter. Stir together the butter, miso, garlic, ginger and half of the scallion greens. Thickly slice the reserved turnip greens and stems (about 1/2-inch pieces). Remove the vegetables from the oven and turn off the heat. Gently stir in the reserved turnip greens and scallion whites until just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the miso butter to the pan and gently toss to coat the vegetables. Return to the oven to keep warm while you cook the eggs. Heat the remaining oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Crack 4 to 6 eggs into the pan; if they stick together, that&#39;s OK. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Cook until the whites start to set, 2 to 3 minutes, and then cover with a lid and continue cooking until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 1 to 2 minutes. To serve, top the roasted vegetables with the fried eggs and garnish with the remaining sliced scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 51429,&quot;Almond Cookies ? cup (115 g) light or regular butter spread ? cup (60 ml) egg substitute or 1 large egg ? cup (100 g) granulated sugar 1 Tablespoon milk ? teaspoon almond extract ? cup (94 g) all-purpose flour ? cup (90 g) whole wheat flour ? teaspoon salt ? teaspoon baking soda ? cup (50 g) slivered almonds Instructions: 1.Preheat oven to 350F (180C). 2.Place butter spread, egg, sugar, milk and almond extract into the Vitamix container in the order listed and secure lid. 3.Select Variable 1. 4.Turn machine on and slowly increase speed to Variable 4 or 5. 5.Blend for 10-15 seconds or until ingredients are creamed.

Cool and peel. While the garlic is roasting, lay the onion out on a small square of foil, set on the griddle and let sear, brown and soften, about 5 minutes on each side. Roast the tomatoes on a baking sheet set 4 inches below a very hot broiler until blackened in spots and soft, about 6 minutes; flip and roast the other side. Cool and peel, collecting all the juices with the tomatoes. The sauce: Combine all the roasted ingredients in a food processor or blender, along with the pepper, cloves and 1/4 cup water. Process to a medium-smooth puree. In a very large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When hot enough to make a drip of the puree sizzle noisily, add it all at once. Stir for several minutes as the mixture sears and darkens then reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring regularly, until very thick, about 5 minutes. A tablespoon at a time, stir in the Chipotle Seasoning Salsa (or chopped chipotle), tasting until the thick salsa suits your own penchant for spiciness. Taste, season with salt and remove from the heat. The shrimp: Peel and devein the shrimp, leaving the final joint and the tail intact. Return the skillet with the sauce to medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, then slowly stir and turn for about 3 to 4 minutes, until the shrimp are just cooked through. Season with salt if needed. Serve the shrimp with the rice.

Place meat mixture into a 9 by 13-inch baking dish and shape into a loaf about 11 inches long and 4 inches wide. It is important to form it like this so that it cooks evenly throughout. The loaf should be in the middle of the pan with room on both sides for the sauce to pool. Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Cover the meatloaf with the sauce and allow excess sauce to pool around the meatloaf. Cover pan with aluminum foil but avoid contact with meat loaf by leaving at least a couple inches of space between the top of the meatloaf and the foil.

Wrap the chilies in a towel and place them in a plastic bag for about 10 minutes. Remove the chilies and with the help of a kitchen towel rub the skins off. The chilies should be firm. Cut them in 1/2-inch strips discarding all the seeds and the ribs. Do not rinse them. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chilies and the onions at the same time. Stir often. When everything is soft add all the sour cream and the chicken bouillon granules to taste. When the cream is hot turn off the burner and add the cheese. Cover immediately. Enjoy with warm tortillas and white rice. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 51485,&quot;Stuffed Halibut Two (1 pound each) halibut steaks (3/4-inch thick) About 1/4 cup green olive paste (olivada) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil to drizzle over the top Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove skin from steaks and the flesh away from the bone; you&#39;ll end up with 4 pieces of fish from each steak so you have 8 small fillets in all. Cut a slit on the side of each piece and stuff with some of olivada. Lightly season the two sides of the steaks with salt and pepper. Transfer them to a baking pan, drizzle the top with olive oil and bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until just cooked through. Keep your eye on the fish; you really don&#39;t want to overbake it or it will dry out; the insides should have a trace of translucence in them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 51486,&quot;Sweet Potato Creme Brulee 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, baked, peeled, and pureed 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 quarts heavy cream 1 vanilla bean, split in half 16 large egg yolks Instructions: In a medium bowl, mix together the pureed sweet potatoes, 1/4 cup of the sugar, and the lemon juice until combined. Butter 8 8-ounce custard cups or ramekins. Spoon 2 to 3 tablepoons of the sweet potato mixture into each cup to form a 1/4-inch layer. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, vanilla bean, and 3/4 cup of the remaining sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Remove the pan from the heat. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and another 3/4 cup sugar. Gradually pour the egg mixture into the saucepan, whisking constantly. Return the saucepan to the stove and cook on low heat for 3 minutes, or until the mixture thickens. Fill the custard cups with enough of the cream mixture so they are about seven-eighths full. Place the filled cups in a baking pan that is large enough to hold them all. Add enough hot water to come within 1 inch of the top of the cups. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the custards are barely set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out a little wet. Remove the custards from the baking pan and place them in the refrigerator. Refrigerate overnight. Preheat the broiler. Lightly sprinkle the surface of each custard with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the remaining sugar. Place the custards under the broiler for about 30 to 60 seconds and let them brown. Keep an eye on the custards, as this happens quickly. Remove the custards from the heat, and once the sugar has hardened (1 to 2 minutes), serve the creme brulee. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 51487,&quot;Golden Gravy 1 medium onion, finely sliced 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 (2 ounces) stick butter 3 tablespoons all purpose flour 1 cup vegetable stock Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.

Cook for 5 minutes. Add the vinegar and salt, raise the heat and bring to a boil, stirring until the salt dissolves. Remove from the heat. In 2 clear 1-quart jars, place a few sprigs of dill. Divide the seeds and peppercorns between the jars. Using tongs, remove the garlic from the brine and place 5 cloves in each jar. Then pack the jars full of cucumbers, carrots, scallions or green beans, cauliflower and chiles. You want them to be tightly stuffed. Bring the brine back to a boil, pour it over the vegetables to cover completely, let cool, then cover and refrigerate. The pickles will taste good in just a few hours, better after a couple of days. And they&#39;ll keep for about 3 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51492,&quot;Puerto Rican Remoulade (Mayoketchup) 2 cups mayonnaise 1 cup tomato ketchup 1/4 cup granulated garlic 1/4 cup minced garlic 3 tablespoons Sofrito, recipe follows 2 tablespoons adobo seasoning 2 tablespoons Cajun spice 2 tablespoons granulated onion 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1/2 onion 1 onion, sliced 1 green bell pepper, stemmed and seeded 2 cups sweet mini peppers, stemmed<br> 1 cup whole or minced garlic<br> 8 bunches cilantro<br> Instructions: Combine the mayonnaise, ketchup, granulated garlic, minced garlic, Sofrito, adobo seasoning, Cajun spice, granulated onion, cayenne, black pepper and onion in a blender.

Place the standing rib roast upright onto a half sheet pan fitted with a rack. The rack is essential for drainage. Place dry towels loosely on top of the roast. This will help to draw moisture away from the meat. Place into a refrigerator at approximately 50 to 60 percent humidity and between 34 and 38 degrees F. You can measure both with a refrigerator thermometer. Change the towels daily for 3 days. Place a 16-inch round azalea terra cotta planter into a cold oven. Invert the planter to become a lid over a pizza stone or the bottom of the planter. The oven should be cold to start, to avoid any cracking in the terra cotta pieces. Turn the oven to 250 degrees F. Remove the roast from the refrigerator and rub with canola oil. Remember to rub the bones with oil, as well. Once the roast is completely coated with oil cover the roast with kosher salt, about half a teaspoon per bone. Next, rub with freshly ground pepper to coat the surface. Place the roast over a glass bake-ware dish slightly smaller than the length of the roast. This will catch the drippings needed for the sauce. Finally, place a probe thermometer into the center of the roast and set for 118 degrees. Put the roast and the bake-ware dish onto the pizza stone, cover with the terra cotta pot, and return to the oven. Turn the oven down to 200 degrees F and roast until internal temperature is achieved. Remove the roast and turn oven up to 500 degrees F. Remove the terra cotta lid and recover with heavy-duty foil. Allow the roast to rest until an internal temperature of 130 degrees F. is reached. Place the roast back into the preheated 500 degree F oven for about 10 minutes or until you&#39;ve achieved your desired crust. Remove and transfer roast to a cutting board. Keep covered with foil until ready to serve. Degrease the juices in the glass pan. Place the pan over low heat and deglaze with 1 cup of water. Add the wine and reduce by half. Roll the sage leaves in between your fingers to release the flavors and aroma. Add to the sauce and cook for 1 minute. Strain and serve on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Nebbiolo]&quot; 51496,&quot;Gussied Up Gravy 2 cups caramelized mirepoix from Delicious Doctored Dressing, recipe follows 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh sage<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme<br> Two 12-ounce jars store-bought gravy<br> 1 cup pan juices from a roast turkey<br> 1/4 cup chicken broth<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped 2 tablespoons butter, plus more for the baking dish 2 tablespoons oil 2 cups finely diced celery<br> 2 carrots, peeled and finely diced<br> 1 large onion, finely diced<br> 1 fennel bulb, finely diced<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 cup cubed peeled celery root 1 cup cubed peeled parsnips 1 cup cubed peeled turnips One 12-ounce package herb seasoned cubed stuffing mix, such as Pepperidge Farm<br> 2 cups chicken broth, plus 1/2 cup more if reheating 1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Add the caramelized mirepoix, sage and thyme to a saute pan, mix together and heat over medium until hot. Add the gravy, turkey pan juices, chicken broth, salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer--don&#39;t boil it--and simmer until reduced slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a dish, let cool and then cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. When ready to serve, bring the gravy back to a simmer. Stir in the chopped eggs and pour into a pitcher. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. In a saute pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon each of the butter and oil. When the butter is melted, add the celery, carrots, onion and fennel (mirepoix) and saute until caramelized, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and stir through. Scoop out 2 cups of the caramelized mirepoix and reserve for the gravy. Put the remaining caramelized mirepoix in a large bowl (you should have about 4 cups). Heat a second saute pan over medium heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon each butter and oil and heat until the butter is melted. Add the celery root, parsnips and turnips and saute until caramelized, about 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the bowl with the mirepoix and add the stuffing mix. Add the chicken broth, parsley, salt and pepper and toss together. Transfer the stuffing mixture to the prepared baking dish. If baking right away, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cover with foil and bake until the stuffing is heated through, about 1 hour. If making ahead of time, cover the unbaked stuffing with foil and refrigerate overnight. The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bring the stuffing to room temperature, then drizzle with 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Bake, covered with foil, until heated through, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 51497,&quot;Soul Sweet &#39;Taters 4 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 3/4 pounds) 1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup milk 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup packed dark brown sugar 1 cup pecans, chopped 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the sweet potatoes on the oven rack and bake until fork-tender, about 45 minutes. When the potatoes are finished cooking, let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Slice them open lengthwise and scrape out the flesh with a fork into a large bowl. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Add the granulated sugar, milk, eggs, vanilla and salt to the bowl with the sweet potatoes. Mash the mixture with a potato masher until combined and slightly lumpy-you don&#39;t want it to be perfectly smooth. Now, in a separate bowl, mash the brown sugar, pecans, flour and butter with a pastry cutter or fork until thoroughly combined. The mixture should resemble a crumble. Spread the sweet potato mixture in a 14-cup oval-shaped baking dish and sprinkle the crumb mixture all over the top.

Cook until the mushrooms give up their juices, season with salt and pepper, and roast in the oven until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove and let cool to room temperature. While the vegetables are roasting, begin the sauce. Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves, nutmeg, thyme, parsley stems, and mint stems in a heavy-gauge, non-corrosive saucepan over medium heat. In a separate pan create a roux by cooking the butter and flour for a few minutes, stirring continuously, without browning, until it emits a nutty aroma, and then remove from the heat. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the roux, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat, strain and whisk in yogurt and Parmesan cheese. Season, to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Place a piece of plastic wrap on the surface and set aside. Roll out the pastry dough and, using an appropriately sized cereal bowl or small mixing bowl as a template, cut 6 rounds 8-inches in diameter.

Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 51506,&quot;Pesto-Rubbed Baked Salmon with Smashed Cucumber and Green Apple Salad Unsalted butter, softened, as needed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Six 6-ounce skinless salmon fillets, preferably wild<br> 3 tablespoons prepared pesto<br> 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br> 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice<br> 1 English cucumber, peeled Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup finely diced pitted Medjool dates (about 6) 2 green apples, cored and cut into 1/4-inch dice<br> 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts<br> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint<br> Juice of 1 lemon<br> Instructions: For the salmon: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Brush a baking dish with a thin coat of softened butter and sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the surface. Set the salmon fillets upright (flat-side down) on the baking dish, brush a little soft butter over each fillet and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, whisk the pesto, mustard and lemon juice together and season it with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture evenly over the salmon, covering the top surface only. Bake until the desired doneness, about 14 minutes for medium rare for 1 1/2-inch-thick fillets (cook longer for thicker pieces). For the salad: Meanwhile, put the cucumber into a clean towel on a cutting board and smash it with the heel of your hand. Unwrap the cucumber and slice it crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces; transfer them to a mixing bowl and sprinkle a little salt over them. Add the dates and apples and stir to mix. Add the pine nuts, olive oil, mint and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper, and toss until evenly combined. Serve the salmon fillets on warm plates with the salad on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 51507,&quot;Salted Caramel Apple Tart Tatin Nonstick vegetable oil spray 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small cubes Crystal flake sea salt (recommended: Maldon) 7 to 8 medium Golden Delicious apples 1 lemon, juiced 1/2 (17.3-ounce) package or 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed Flour, for dusting Vanilla ice cream, for serving, optional Instructions: Position the oven rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Spray an 8 by 3-inch round cake pan with nonstick spray. Combine the sugar and 6 tablespoons water in a heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. You will not stir the sugar after this point. Increase the heat and bring to a boil. Do not stir. Cook until the syrup is a deep amber color, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Carefully add the butter (the caramel will bubble vigorously). Stir to blend, then add the flaked sea salt. Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan. Let cool 5 minutes. Peel, quarter and core the apples. Cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. You don&#39;t want to cut the slices too thin because they will fall apart or break down when cooked - the 1/2-inch slices will hold their shape. Fill a large bowl with water and add the lemon juice. Place the apple slices in the acidulated water and set aside. This will keep the apples white. Place the cake pan over a stovetop burner, but don&#39;t turn the burner on. Lay 2 apple slices in the center of the pan on top of the caramel. Arrange the remaining apple slices in a circle, overlapping one another so that the end result looks similar to a rose. While layering, occasionally press down on the apples to make sure they all fit into the pan. If the caramel starts to set, turn the heat on very low to help loosen it up. With an oven mitt (the pan may be hot), pop the pan into the oven. Bake until the apples are tender and the caramel bubbles thickly, about 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Using a clean 9-inch round cake pan bottom as an aid, trace and cut out a 9-inch round from the pastry. Remove the pan from the oven. Top the apples with the pastry round, pressing down and tucking in the edges. Pierce or dock the pastry all over with a fork. Return the pan to the oven and bake until the pastry is golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool the tart completely in the pan. Invert a platter or cake stand over the cake pan. Hold the platter and the pan and invert. The tart will fall out onto the platter. If the tart does not cooperate, run the edge with a knife and place over medium heat until slightly warmed, then invert the pan onto the platter. Cut into wedges and serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51508,&quot;Brandied Peach Fool 2 cups peeled and sliced peaches 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup brandy 2 cups whipped cream 4 thin peach slices Instructions: In a saucepan, combine the peaches, sugar and brandy.

For the pork chops: Place the flour and some salt in one bowl, eggs in another, and the panko and coconut in another. Dredge the pork chops in the flour, then the egg, and then the panko mixture. Repeat with other pork chop. Heat some olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. When hot, fry the pork chops until golden brown on both sides and 145 degrees F at the center, 7 to 10 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and rest for about 5 minutes. Serve the pork chops alongside the relish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51510,&quot;Cheesy Skillet Taco Mac 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 cup diced onion 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 pound ground chuck 1 tablespoon Miss Brown\u2019s House Seasoning, recipe follows 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 tablespoon chili powder 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 1/2 cups beef stock 8 ounces elbow pasta, cooked according to package directions One 8-ounce block sharp Cheddar, shredded Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Sour cream and chopped green onions, for serving, optional 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon paprika 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground pepper Instructions: Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat.

Dip white bread in warm water to soften. Squeeze out excess moisture. Add to the liver and garlic along with 2 cups marinated ground meat, allspice, nutmeg, and brandy. Stir to combine. Transfer to a food processor, add eggs, and puree until a smooth paste is formed. This paste will bind the pate. Place puree in a large bowl, add remaining ground meat, and combine well. (We recommend using your hands, not a spoon, to combine this dense mixture.) Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a 9 by 5 by 3 inch glass or ceramic loaf pan with bacon slices so they overhang lengthwise, about 3 inches on each end. Slice ham and tongue into 4 by 1/2 by 1/2 inch julienne strips. Spread about a cup of pate evenly over the bacon to cover the bottom. Arrange alternating strips of ham and tongue lengthwise, over the pate. Repeat this procedure, alternating pate with strips of ham and tongue, until pan is filled and top layer is pate. (When the loaf is sliced you will see a regular pattern of solids and pate.) Fold overhanging bacon over the top. (The pate may rise slightly over the top of the pan. That&#39;s OK.) Tap pan against a counter to firmly pack. Garnish top with bay leaves and garlic cloves. Cover with 2 layers aluminum foil, tucking edges under to completely seal. Place inside a larger pan and pour in boiling water until it rises halfway up the sides of the pate. Bake 2 hours 15 minutes. Set aside to cool. Place cooled pate on a baking sheet and cover with another baking sheet. Top with some 3 pounds of weights (canned goods or milk cartons are good) and refrigerate overnight or as long as 2 weeks. This compacts the pate and makes it easier to slice. To serve, remove and discard the bay leaf and garlic garnish. To loosen, dip pan&#39;s bottom in warm water and run a knife along inside edges. Invert onto a serving platter. Cut into 1/2 inch slices and serve on lettuce leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51528,&quot;Orangutang 1 bottle very cold light beer (Amstel Light or Bud Light) 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 2 tablespoons simple syrup equal parts sugar and water heated until sugar dissolves; cool) Dash grenadine Orange slice Mint sprig Instructions: In a frosted beer mug, gently stir together the beer, orange juice, simple syrup and grenadine.

Stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast and allow it to stand for about 3 minutes. Whisk the unbleached flour, cocoa powder, the remaining 1/3 cup sugar and the salt together in a medium bowl. Set them aside. Using your hand, stir the coffee, the egg yolk, and the butter into the dissolved yeast. Gradually add the flour mixture, stirring until a shaggy mass forms and all of the flour is moistened. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 7 to 8 minutes, until it is silky smooth and elastic. This dough should be nice and moist, so add flour sparingly as you work. Shape the dough into a loose ball cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for about 10 minutes to relax the gluten strands. Flatten the dough and stretch it gently with your fingers to form a rectangle about an inch thick. Spread the chocolate chips evenly over the rectangle. Fold the dough into an envelope and knead gently for 2 to 3 minutes, until the chips are well distributed. The dough should be soft, smooth, and springy. If the dough resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading it. Some of the chips may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again after the first rise when the dough has softened. Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Turn to coat the top of the dough with oil, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until the dough has doubled in volume, about 2 hours. Line two 12 by 17-inch baking sheets with parchment paper. Gently pour the dough onto the floured work surface pressing any loose chocolate chips into dough. Flour your hands lightly divide the dough into 12 equal pieces (each weighing about 2 1/2 ounces). Shape the pieces into rolls and place 6 on each prepared baking sheet leaving several inches between the rolls so they won&#39;t grow together as they rise. Cover them loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let them rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. While the bread is proofing make a cornstarch wash: Put the cold water in a small saucepan and whisk in the cornstarch. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently until it thickens. Remove from the heat and cover to keep a skin from forming. Set aside to cool. About 15 minutes before you&#39;re ready to bake, place one oven rack in the top third of the oven, and another in the bottom third, and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. When the buns have doubled, use a pastry brush to paint them with a thin coating of the cornstarch wash. Brush gently so you don&#39;t deflate them. Place one pan on each oven rack. Using a plant sprayer, immediately mist the top and sides of the oven 6 to 8 times and quickly close the oven door. Repeat this misting procedure two more times at 1-minute intervals. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and rotate the pans from top to bottom and front to back to ensure even baking. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until the tops of the buns feel firm but not hard when you press them slightly, and the bottoms are very lightly browned. These rolls should have a thin soft covering, not a hard crunchy crust. Remove from the oven and use the pastry brush to paint the top of each bun quickly and evenly with the cornstarch wash. Transfer the rolls to a rack and allow them to cool before serving. These are best eaten the day they are baked. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chianti]&quot; 51530,&quot;NYC Bagel and Egg Sandwich 1 cup Greek yogurt (full fat) 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling 2 teaspoons honey<br> 1 large egg, beaten 1 tablespoon sesame seeds<br> 6 strips bacon 5 large eggs 1/2 cup grated Cheddar 2 tablespoons creme fraiche (or sour cream)<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar (or any white vinegar)<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 cups arugula<br> Instructions: For the bagels: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the butter. Pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add the ice water and pulse until moist clumps form. Gather the dough into a ball; flatten into a disk. (If the dough still crumbles and does not form into a ball, add another tablespoon of ice water.) Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Combine the apples, 1/4 cup of the sugar and lemon juice in large bowl; toss gently to blend. Set aside for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour and roll out the dough on the paper to an 11-inch round. Transfer the dough and parchment paper to a large heavy baking sheet. Spoon the apple mixture over the dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round, leaving the apples exposed in the center. Pleat loosely and pinch the dough to seal any cracks. Brush the crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar. Bake the crostata until the crust is golden and the apples are tender, about 40 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack; cool for 10 minutes. Slide a metal spatula under the crust to free the crostata from the parchment. Cool the crostata to lukewarm.

Serve with pancakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 51537,&quot;Pot de Creme 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into small pieces 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup milk 5 egg yolks 1/4 cup granulated sugar Pinch salt White Chocolate Whipped Cream, recipe follows Grated chocolate, for garnish 2 ounces white chocolate, finely chopped 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, chilled Instructions: Place rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl set over gently simmering water. When the chocolate is almost melted, turn off the heat and let stand until completely melted. Meanwhile, in a medium saute pan, scald the cream and milk. Watch carefully as cream will boil over. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and salt until the sugar is completely dissolved. Slowly whisk the hot cream mixture into the yolks. If you add the hot cream mixture too quickly, the egg yolks could cook and leave undesirable cooked egg particles. Remove the melted chocolate from the stove and pour the hot cream mixture through a fine mesh strainer into the melted chocolate. Whisk until well combined and smooth. Ladle the mixture into 6 (3/4-cup) ramekins. Line the bottom of a baking pan with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Place the filled ramekins in the baking dish on the towel. Pour in enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the entire pan with aluminum foil and place in the oven. Bake until mixture around the edges of the ramekin is firm when lightly shaken, about 35 minutes. (Baking time will vary depending on depth and width of ramekins.) The center of the Pot de Cremes may still jiggle slightly when shaken, but that is okay, it will firm up as it chills. Carefully remove the ramekins from the baking pan, wipe dry and allow to cool. Once cooled, refrigerate until firm, about 2 to 3 hours. To serve, spoon some White Chocolate Whipped Cream into the ramekin and garnish with some grated chocolate. Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler over barely simmering water, stirring occasionally. Once melted, remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Whip the cream in a chilled bowl to soft peaks. Fold in the cooled chocolate and beat to stiff peaks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 51538,&quot;Whole Red Snapper -en Crusta- for Lovers Savory Roasted Garlic, Olive and Tomato Compote and Citrus Mustard 2 (3 pound red snapper) gutted, skin and scales on 2 sprigs rosemary 2 sprigs lemon thyme 1 box kosher salt 2 1/2 to 3 cups cold water Zest of 1 lemon Zest of 1 lime Zest of 1 blood orange Coarsely ground black pepper 1 teaspoon capers 10 nicoise olives 1/4 cup olive oil 2 cloves roasted garlic, minced 1 tomato, finely chopped Pinch cayenne pepper 1 lemon 1 lime 1 blood orange 1 tablespoon pommary mustard 1/2 cup olive oil Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Dust a work station with flour and cut the dough in half. When the dough is at room temperature, stretch it or roll it out using a rolling pin; you want a thin pizza dough, approximately 1/4-thick at the most. (A pizzette is a rustic oval shape though it will work in the more traditional circle.) Place the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper on a sheet tray and bake in the oven until the dough has set and started to brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and spread a thin layer of Red Onion Marmalade. Crumble the House Sausage over the pizza and spread out evenly. Place back into the oven and bake until the dough has hardened and you can lift one side of the pizza without it bending, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and drape with Smoked Slaw. Cut and enjoy. Cut the top and bottom off the onion and peel the skin. Cut vertically straight down through the middle, exposing a crescent moon shape, not rings. Place the onion, cut side down, on the board and slice into julienne. Repeat with all the onions. Place the onions into a saucepan and put over a low heat on your stovetop. Sprinkle with a little salt and stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, allowing the onions to sweat out their liquid until they all become translucent (being careful not to caramelize or burn the onions), about 20 minutes. Add in half the balsamic and reduce over low heat until the liquid coats the back of a spoon, 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve. In a separate pan over high heat, pour the sugar into the center of the pan and surround with water. Stir the sugar into the water to moisten. Occasionally shake the pan to evenly disperse the heat. Keep a close eye on the sugar-water mixture as the moisture is expelled. First the bubbles will be smaller and more consistent, like syrup. Then the sugar will start to change color as it caramelizes. When it is a light amber color, remove from the heat and stir in the remaining balsamic vinegar until incorporated. Add the caramel sauce to the cooked onions and season with salt. Cool and serve. Add all the ingredients except the pork into a large bowl. Whisk together and let rest for 10 minutes. Add in the ground pork. Break the pork apart gently and toss to distribute ingredients. Mix by kneading the mixture, but do not over mix. Cook a small piece of sausage to test for seasoning. If needed, add salt and a splash more vinegar. For pizza preparation, render the sausage until lightly browned and strain excess fat. Cool and reserve for assembly. Remove the core from the cabbage and julienne. To assemble the smoker, place the wood chips into a half hotel pan over high heat. After 2 minutes, the chips will start to smolder. Place some ice into a perforated pan of the same size and cover with a layer of plastic wrap. Place the perforated pan with the ice and the cabbage onto the pan with the chips and cover with tin foil. Allow the smoke to permeate the cabbage for 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and place directly into a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Cool and reserve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 51544,&quot;Seared Halibut with Parmigiana Asparagus 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 (6-ounce) halibut steaks Sea salt White pepper 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 16 young asparagus 1 small shallot, minced 2 garlic cloves, minced 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3/4 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: For halibut: Preheat a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat. Add extra-virgin olive oil and butter. Season halibut with salt and pepper and dust with the flour, shaking off the excess. As your butter starts to brown, gently lay each steak in your pan. Allow to cook until golden brown on both sides and cooked through, approximately 3 to 4 minutes on each side. For asparagus: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Trim and clean your asparagus. In a large bowl add cleaned asparagus, minced garlic, minced shallots, and extra-virgin olive oil. Season, to taste. Lay prepared asparagus on a half sheet pan and roast until tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Cover and let sit at room temperature until bubbly and increased in volume by about 20 percent, about 8 hours. For the dough: Add the all-purpose flour, water and whole-wheat flour to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Weigh out 7 ounces of the levain (about 1 cup) and add to the mixer (discard any remaining levain). Mix on low until a shaggy dough forms. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br> Add the salt to the dough and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes; the dough should feel a bit sticky and wet but look smooth and very stretchy. Scrape the dough into a plastic or glass container about twice its size. Cover and let sit at room temperature until puffed, about 45 minutes.<br> Put the dough on a floured work surface, flatten it gently, then fold in thirds like a business letter. Transfer it back to the container. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.<br> Repeat the folding process one more time, transfer back to the container, cover and let sit at room temperature for another 45 minutes. After the third 45-minute rest, the dough should feel soft and pillowy; when pressed with a finger, it should leave an indentation that begins to spring back.<br> Gently scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide in half using a bench scraper. Shape each piece loosely into a round by gently tucking the edges under. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.<br> Drape 2 kitchen towels into 2 medium (8-inch) bowls and dust very generously with flour. Dust the top of the dough rounds very lightly with flour and flip over using a bench scraper. Flatten one piece of dough into a circle, then fold the left and right sides of the dough over the center. Keeping tension in the dough, begin folding down from the top edge in 3 segments, sealing the bottom edge with the last fold. Loosely cup the dough and, using your hands and the tension between the board and the dough, pull the bread very slowly towards yourself while creating a taut ball. Gently flip the dough ball over and into one of the prepared bowls. Cover loosely with another kitchen towel. Repeat the process with the second piece of dough. Place both in a warm place to rise until about 1 1/2 times their size, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.<br> About 20 minutes before baking, position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven, put a 4-quart Dutch oven and lid on the rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. When preheated, carefully transfer the hot Dutch oven to a heatsafe surface with oven mitts (leave the lid in the oven). Flip one round of dough over into the Dutch oven. Using a sharp knife, scissors or bread lame, score the top of the bread in a cross or desired pattern. Return to the oven, immediately cover with the lid and bake for 20 minutes. Lower the temperature to 425 degrees F, uncover and bake until dark brown, about 10 minutes more. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack to cool completely. Return the empty Dutch oven to the oven, raise the temperature to 500 degrees F and let heat for 10 minutes before repeating the baking process with the second dough round. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51564,&quot;Miso Butter Green Beans 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon miso paste (yellow or white)<br> 1 clove garlic, grated<br> 1 scallion, finely chopped<br> 1/2 pound green beans, trimmed<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil<br> Kosher salt<br> Store-bought crispy onions, for garnish<br> Instructions: Make the sauce: Whisk together the melted butter, miso paste, garlic, scallion and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl until combined.

Leave the drippings from the turkey in the pan and place the roasting pan over medium heat. Add the broth and wine at the same time. Whisk to combine, scraping the bottom of the pan until all of the bits have come loose. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes in order to reduce the mixture slightly. Transfer the liquid to a fat separator and let sit for 5 minutes to allow fat to separate. Return 2/3 to 3/4 cup of the fat to the roasting pan and place over medium-high heat. Discard any remaining fat. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook, whisking continuously, until the mixture starts to thicken and become smooth, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Once this happens, gradually add the liquid back to the pan and whisk until smooth and you have reached your desired consistency, approximately 5 to 6 minutes. Remember, your gravy should be slightly thin in the pan as it will thicken once you serve it. Add the herbs and whisk to combine. Season with salt and pepper. 2 to 3 days before roasting: Begin thawing the turkey in the refrigerator or in a cooler kept at 38 degrees F. Combine the vegetable stock, salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice berries, and candied ginger in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve solids and bring to a boil. Then remove the brine from the heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate. Early on the day or the night before you&#39;d like to eat: Combine the brine, water and ice in the 5-gallon bucket. Place the thawed turkey (with innards removed) breast side down in brine. If necessary, weigh down the bird to ensure it is fully immersed, cover, and refrigerate or set in cool area for 8 to 16 hours, turning the bird once half way through brining. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Remove the bird from brine and rinse inside and out with cold water. Discard the brine. Place the bird on roasting rack inside a half sheet pan and pat dry with paper towels. Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon stick, and 1 cup of water in a microwave safe dish and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add steeped aromatics to the turkey&#39;s cavity along with the rosemary and sage. Tuck the wings underneath the bird and coat the skin liberally with canola oil. Roast the turkey on lowest level of the oven at 500 degrees F. for 30 minutes. Insert a probe thermometer into thickest part of the breast and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Set the thermometer alarm (if available) to 151 degrees F. A 14 to 16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2 hours of roasting. Let the turkey rest for at least 15 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51567,&quot;Jalapeno Shrimp Popper Cupcakes 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup yellow cornmeal 1/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons baking powder 2 cups buttermilk 1/2 cup pickled jalapeno pepper juice 4 tablespoons minced pickled jalapeno peppers 2 tablespoons seeded and minced fresh jalapeno peppers 3 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten 2 sticks unsalted butter, melted 1 cup grated extra-sharp Cheddar 24 sheets red colored soy paper, cut to desired width and size 1 jar (at least 6 ounces) jalapeno jelly, favorite brand 12 ounces cream cheese, cold 2 tablespoons tomato paste<br> 1 tablespoon shrimp paste<br> 1 tablespoon hot jalapeno sauce Freshly ground pepper<br> Nonstick oil spray One 6-ounce bag shredded Parmesan 6 cups sugar 3 jalapeno peppers 48 small shrimp, peeled, deveined and precooked Nonstick oil spray 3 tablespoons jalapeno jelly Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using a whisk, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar and baking powder in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, combine the buttermilk, pickled jalapeno juice, pickled and fresh jalapenos, eggs and butter. With a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry until most of the lumps are dissolved. Don&#39;t over mix! Fold in the grated Cheddar. Line two 2 dozen mini-cupcake pans with the edible soy paper wrappers (or use paper wrappers). No need to spray the pans.<br> Fill the prepared pans with the batter three-quarters of the way full using a small ice cream scoop. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 9 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the pans when cool to the touch. Heat the jalapeno jelly in small pot until melted. Using a pastry brush, glaze the cupcakes with the jalapeno jelly, making sure not to glaze the wrappers. Set aside until assembly. For the mousse: In large bowl, beat the cold cream cheese using a hand mixer until smooth. Add the tomato paste, shrimp paste, jalapeno sauce and black pepper to taste. Mix until thoroughly incorporated. Taste and adjust the seasoning. (No need to add salt! Shrimp paste is salty enough.) Place in a pastry bag fitted with a small star tip and chill in the refrigerator until ready for assembly. For the tuiles: Heat a large nonstick saute pan sprayed with a thin layer of oil spray on medium heat. With your fingers, lay out in a single layer 1-inch diameter circles (about 1 tablespoon) of the Parmesan. Heat until they bubble and are golden yellow around the edges. Carefully lift out of the pan with a spatula, set off to a silicone baking mat and reserve until ready to garnish. For the candied jalapeno: Combine 3 cups of the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until the temperature reaches 230 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 3 minutes. Wearing gloves, cut the jalapenos lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips. Place in a medium pot and cover with 4 cups cold water. Heat on high until the water comes to a boil. Allow to boil until the peppers are vibrant green, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to the sugar syrup. Simmer until the jalapenos are tender to the bite, blistered and emerald green, about 15 minutes. Remove from the syrup. Cover a baking sheet with the remaining 3 cups sugar and roll the jalapenos until covered in sugar. Allow to dry in the sugar until hard. Set aside for assembly. For the shrimp: Thaw, rinse, drain and pat the shrimp dry. Heat a large nonstick saute pan sprayed lightly with oil spray. Add the jalapeno jelly and heat until liquid. Add the shrimp and toss until warmed through and thoroughly glazed. Set aside to cool or they will melt the savory cream cheese mousse. Reserve for assembly. To assemble: Pipe the glazed cupcakes with cream cheese tomato shrimp mousse. Top with a cheese tuile, sauteed glazed shrimp and finish with a candied jalapeno. Serve on a small clear plastic plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 51568,&quot;Apple and Prune Stuffed Pork Loin Extra-virgin olive oil 4 slices bacon, cut crosswise into lardons 1 small red onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice Kosher salt 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch dice 1/2 cup prunes, quartered 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped, divided 1/2 cup brandy or Calvados 1 (3 to 4-pound) boneless pork loin 1 cup chicken stock Instructions: Coat a large saute pan lightly with olive oil. Add the bacon and bring the pan to a medium heat. When the bacon is crispy and has released a lot of fat, add the onions and season with salt. Cook the onions until they are soft and aromatic, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the apples, prunes, and half the chopped rosemary. Cook the apples, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften, about 5 minutes. Pull the pan off the heat and add the brandy. Return to the fire and flambe, or let the alcohol just burn off. Remove from the heat and let cool. Lay out a length of plastic wrap about 2-feet in length. Spoon the apple mixture onto the plastic and make a log down the center that is about the same length as the pork loin. Roll the plastic tightly around the apple mixture and twist at the ends to secure. The log should be about 1- inch in diameter. Place the log in the freezer and let it freeze solid. This can and should be done ahead of time. To stuff the pork: Insert a long, thin knife into the center of one end of the pork loin; repeat this process at the other end. Wiggle the knife back and forth to create a place big enough to accommodate your frozen stuffing log. After cutting with the knife, you can use the handle of a long wooden spoon to make sure the incision goes all the way through the pork loin. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Get the stuffing log from the freezer and remove the plastic wrap. Slide the stuffing log through the pork loin - it might need a little encouragement but it should go the length of the loin. Season the outside of the pork generously with salt and sprinkle it with the remaining chopped rosemary. Coat a roasting pan with olive oil and bring the pan to a high heat. Add the pork to the pan and sear it on all sides until it is brown. Remove the pork to a plate and ditch the fat in the roasting pan. Add the pork back to the pan pour in the chicken stock. Place it in the oven for 25 to 35 minutes, depending on how you like your pork. I personally like it pinker and would remove it from the oven when a meat thermometer reaches 130 degrees F. Turn it over halfway through the cooking time. Remove it from the oven, cover it with foil, and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</li></ol><p>&quot; 51569,&quot;Deli Stuffed Eggwiches 3 eggs Splash milk or cream Splash hot sauce Salt Freshly ground black pepper 8 slices white or wheat bread 4 rounded tablespoons apricot or raspberry preserves 4 rounded tablespoons grainy Dijon mustard 4 slices ham 4 slices Swiss cheese 4 slices herb roast turkey 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: Beat eggs, milk or cream and hot sauce with salt and pepper.

Place the strawberries, hulled-tops down, on a cutting board. Cut each strawberry into thin slices and lay them in a single layer on the plates. Save any strawberry scraps or unevenly cut pieces in a medium bowl. Intersperse the raspberry halves in the gaps on the plates. Reserve any raspberries that are too soft in the bowl with the strawberry scraps. Refrigerate the plates of berries. Make the dressing: Press down on the berry scraps with the back of a spoon as if you were muddling fruit for a drink. Whisk together the cranberry juice, olive oil, honey and ginger in a small bowl along with the zest and juice of the lime. Add to the berry scraps and taste for seasoning. Serve: Remove the plates from the fridge, then drizzle the dressing over the fruit and sprinkle with a light, even layer of the sugar. Garnish with the basil and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 51571,&quot;Kids Pissaladiere 1 1/4 cups warm (100 to 110 degrees F) water 2 envelopes dry yeast 1 tablespoon honey 3 tablespoons good olive oil 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for kneading 2 teaspoons kosher salt Cornmeal, for baking 5 tablespoons tomato paste 3 plum tomatoes, sliced 1/2 pound mozzarella, sliced 1/2 pound grated white Cheddar 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves Instructions: For the dough, combine the water, yeast, honey, and olive oil in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. (If the bowl is cold, start with warmer water so it&#39;s at least 100 degrees F when you add the yeast.) Add 3 cups of the flour, then the salt, and mix on medium-low speed. While mixing, add 1 more cup of flour, or just enough to make a soft dough. Mix the dough on medium-low speed for about 10 minutes, until smooth, sprinkling it with flour to keep it from sticking to the bowl. When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured board and knead it by hand a dozen times. It should be smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl and turn it to cover lightly with oil. Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel. Allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts, rolling each 1 into a smooth ball. If you&#39;re only making 1 pissaladiere, place 1 ball on a baking sheet and cover it loosely with a damp towel. Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes. (If you&#39;re not using the other dough, wrap it well and refrigerate or freeze it for the next time.) Roll the dough lightly with a rolling pin, then stretch it to a 10 by 15-inch rectangle and place it on a baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Spread the tomato paste onto the dough, leaving a 3/4-inch border all around. Artfully arrange the sliced tomatoes and sliced mozzarella on top. Sprinkle with the Cheddar, pepper, and thyme. Brush the edge of the dough with olive oil, and bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust is crisp. Serve hot on a cutting board. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 51572,&quot;Chocolate-Raspberry Waffle Cake One 16.25-ounce box chocolate cake mix plus the ingredients for baking it 2 cups freeze-dried raspberries 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for dusting, optional 1/2 cup mascarpone cheese 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 6 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup fresh raspberries Instructions: Preheat a waffle maker that makes round waffles on medium. Prepare the boxed cake mix according to the package directions. Pour 1/3 cup of the batter into the center of the waffle maker, close the lid and cook until the cake is lightly browned and springs back when you touch it, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Remove the cake from the waffle maker using a fork and set aside on a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining batter; you should have 8 waffled cakes total. Let them all cool completely.<br> Pulse the raspberries with the confectioners&#39; sugar in a food processor until it looks like dust. Add the mascarpone, vanilla and 1 cup cream and pulse until thick and creamy.<br> Put the chocolate chips in a medium bowl. Heat the remaining 1/2 cup cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until small bubbles form and it just begins to simmer. Pour the cream over the chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Put 1 waffled cake on a cake stand or plate. Use an offset spatula to evenly spread a 1/4 cup of the raspberry-cream mixture over the cake, pushing most of it to the edge of the cake, leaving a small well in the middle. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the chocolate ganache into the well and top with another waffled cake. Repeat with remaining waffled cakes, raspberry cream and ganache, finishing with some raspberry cream on top. Decorate the top with the fresh raspberries and drizzle with the remaining ganache (microwave the ganache for a few seconds and stir if it needs to be loosened). If desired, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 51573,&quot;Rack of Lamb 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary leaves 3 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 2 racks of lamb, \frenched\ (see note) Instructions: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, process the salt, rosemary, and garlic until they&#39;re as finely minced as possible.

Place in a large resealable plastic bag, container or vacuum seal bag. Blend the oil, soy sauce, Worcestershire, lime juice, pepper, garlic powder, dehydrated onion and paprika in a blender. Pour the marinade over the steak and seal the bag. Let sit in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours. For the jalape?o avocado a?oli: Remove the seeds from the jalape?o and dice. Remove the pit and skin from the avocado and add to a blender. Add the jalape?o, cilantro, lime juice, salt and pepper to blender. Blend until it has a smooth, thick paint-like texture. If it&#39;s too thick, add a little cold water until the texture is thick and a little bit runny, like paint. Transfer to a container, bowl or squeeze bottle. For the corn pico de gallo: Grill the corn (or roast over the open flame of a gas stove) until nice and charred. Cut the kernels from the cobs into a large bowl. Add the tomatoes, onions, cilantro, lime juice, salt and pepper. Mix well with a spoon or by hand, making sure to not smash the tomatoes. For the blue corn tortillas: In a large bowl, add the masa. Pour in the water and stir to combine. Knead the dough with your hands in the bowl until it is smooth and no longer sticky, 1 to 2 minutes. If you have time, cover the dough and let rest up to 30 minutes. Pinch off a piece from the dough and form a round ball around the size of a golf ball. Cut a resealable plastic bag open along the sides. Open the tortilla press and lay the opened bag on the top and bottom. Coat the plastic slightly with oil if desired to reduce friction. Place the dough ball between the plastic. Press down until the dough has spread about 6 inches and reaches the desired thickness. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the freshly pressed tortilla and cook for about 1 minute before flipping and cooking another minute. Stack the tortillas in a clean kitchen towel so they stay warm and steamy. Repeat with the remaining dough. For the steak: Take the steak out of the bag and cook on a hot grill or griddle to medium or preferred temperature. Cut into strips. For the tacos: Place the warm tortilla(s) on a plate. Add 2 ounces steak to each, followed by the corn pico de gallo, a sprinkling of Cotija and a drizzle of jalape?o-avocado a?oli. Serve with Mexican rice and whole or refried beans.

Leaving them whole, place them in a large pot and fill with cold water, covering them over with 1 inch of water. Add salt and cook the potatoes for 25 to 30 minutes until fork tender. Drain and quickly peel the potatoes while they are still warm. Once they are peeled, pass them through a ricer. Add 1/2 of the butter and stir until completely incorporated. Using a tamis or fine metal mesh sifter, pass the potato puree once more to create a smooth texture. Place the potato puree in a pot and add the remaining butter. Over low heat, add the milk slowly, continuously mixing. Finish, by adding a pinch of salt for flavor.

Keep in mind that when you add the solid ingredients the water level will rise, so don&#39;t fill the pot up more than halfway. Squeeze the lemons into the water, tossing in the halves too. Add the bay leaves, salt, seasoning, thyme, onions, chiles and garlic; bring the broth to a boil over medium-high heat and simmer for 10 minutes. You want a very aromatic broth with plenty of salt and spices. Taste it; don&#39;t be afraid to make it strong so some of the flavor can penetrate and get absorbed by the potatoes and other ingredients. Adjust seasoning with salt. Add the potatoes to the pot to give them a head start; simmer for 20 minutes. Now add the corn and sausage; cook another 5 minutes, making sure everything stays covered with the liquid. Add the clams and boil for 8 to 10 minutes until they open. Then toss in the shrimp and shut off the heat. Cover the pot and let the shrimp steep in the flavor for 15 minutes. Drain and spread the shrimp, sausage, clams, corn, potatoes, and onions out on a newspaper-covered table. Serve with lemons and plenty of napkins.

Keep warm until serving. &quot;,&quot;[Hefeweizen, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gouda]&quot; 51582,&quot;Banana Splitsville 2 cups sugar 1 cup water 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 batch caramel 2 cups heavy cream 4 bananas Sugar for coating Ice cream of your choice Instructions: Combine the sugar, water, and corn syrup in a small, heavy saucepan and place over high heat. As soon as the sugar has dissolved, heat your thermometer under warm tap water (to prevent thermal shock) and attach to side of pan, making sure that the bulb is completely submerged. Do not stir the mixture or agitate the pan at this stage. When the mixture reaches 230 degrees, reduce the heat to medium and allow the sugar to color gradually. As the temperature approaches 300 degrees the color will start to turn to amber. At this point, it&#39;s safe to swirl the pan gently to help distribute the heat evenly. As the caramel heads towards 340 degrees, it will reach a deep amber color. Remove the pan from the heat and slowly stir with a metal spoon, allowing it to cool until the caramel falls from the spoon in a solid stream, like a string. When it does, it&#39;s doodad time. Form doodads by holding the spoon 12 to 16 inches over the caramel and drizzling the patterns on the parchment. (Hint: allow the spoon to unload into the pan for a few seconds before attempting doodad. This will allow a narrower stream.) Quick back and forth motions or side to side movements are best. It&#39;s all in the wrist. Allow doodads to cool for 15 minutes then peel the paper off (not the other way around). Stack in an airtight container with wax paper between each piece. After making 15 to 20 doodads, you should have sufficient caramel remaining to move on to the sauce phase. So, return the remaining caramel to medium high heat and continue cooking until you see the first sign of smoke. Immediately remove from the heat, and add the cream, all at once, at arms length. (It will boil furiously.) Once the mixture calms down, return to medium heat and boil 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool to room temperature, move to squirt bottle and refrigerate for up to a week. To make the bananas brulee, quarter the bananas (peel on) and rub into sugar to coat thoroughly. Remove peel and place on cooling rack over several layers of foil. (Don&#39;t try this on your dining room table.) Don your safety goggles and fire up your torch. Hold the torch so that the very tip of the flame barely touches the banana, and move quickly back and forth until the sugar melts, turns brown, and bubbles. As soon as it looks like caramel, move on. You know you&#39;ve got it down when a solid, glasslike sheet of gold (no graininess) has formed on the banana. To do the split (so to speak), squirt a pattern of caramel sauce on a chilled plate, top with 4 banana pieces (Lincoln log style), top with the ice cream of your choice (we like our peachy vanilla from Churn Baby Churn), and finally, a doodad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 51583,&quot;Carbonara Pigs in a Blanket 2.5 ounces sliced pancetta, diced One 8-ounce tube refrigerated crescent dough<br> 24 mini hot dogs<br> 1 egg 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese<br> 1/2 cup store-bought Alfredo sauce, for dipping<br> Instructions: In a large skillet over medium-low heat, cook the pancetta until cooked through but not too crispy, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a sheet tray with parchment paper. Separate the dough into individual triangles. Cut each triangle lengthwise into 3 narrow triangles. Place a mini hot dog on the wide base end of a triangle. Starting at the base end of the triangle, roll up toward the pointed end, to wrap the hot dog. Place on the prepared sheet tray. Repeat with the remaining dough and mini hot dogs. In a small bowl, beat together the egg and Pecorino Romano cheese. Using a pastry brush, brush the pigs in a blanket with the egg mixture. Sprinkle with the diced pancetta. Bake until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Arrange on a platter and serve with the Alfredo sauce for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 51584,&quot;Peach Melba 3 cups water 3 1/2 cups sugar 1 vanilla pod, split lengthwise 2 tablespoons lemon juice 8 peaches 3 cups raspberries 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 large tub vanilla ice Instructions: Put the water, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla pod into a wide saucepan and heat gently to dissolve the sugar. Bring the pan to the boil and let it bubble away for about 5 minutes, then turn the heat down to a fast simmer. Cut the peaches in half, and if the stones come out easily then remove them, if not then you can get them out later. Poach the peach halves in the sugar syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side depending on the ripeness of the fruit. Test the cut side with the sharp point of a knife to see if they are soft, and then remove them to a plate with a slotted spoon. When all the peaches are poached, peel off their skins and let them cool (then you can remove any remaining stones). If you are making them a day in advance then let the poaching syrup cool and then pour into a dish with the peaches. Otherwise just bag up the syrup and freeze it for the next time you poach peaches. To make the raspberry sauce, liquidize the raspberries, confectioners&#39; sugar, and lemon juice in a blender or a food processor. Sieve to remove the pits and pour the puree into a jug. To assemble the Peach Melba, allow 2 peach halves per person and sit them on each plate alongside a scoop or 2 of ice cream. Spoon the raspberry sauce over each. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 51585,&quot;German Apple Strudel 5 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, halved and thinly sliced<br> 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, plus more for sprinkling<br> 1/2 cup apple juice<br> 1/2 cup golden raisins<br> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup chopped pecans<br> 7 sheets phyllo dough, thawed<br> 2 to 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> Whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. How to Make a Cornet(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations.<br> Cut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of one hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side.<br> Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the two corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be one point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 51593,&quot;Spinach and Blue Cheese Salad with Sliced Apples and Spiced Caramelized Pecans 1 apple, chilled 1 small lemon, juiced 8 ounces spinach, washed, thoroughly dried, and stemmed 1 small head (about 3 ounces) radicchio, cut into chiffonade 5 ounces blue cheese, crumbled Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper 1/2 cup Spago House Dressing, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups Spiced Caramelized Pecans, recipe follows 2 large shallots, minced (1 heaping tablespoon) 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons zinfandel vinegar 2 tablespoons sherry wine vinegar 1/2 cup olive oil 1/2 cup vegetable oil Salt Freshly ground white pepper 3 cups peanut oil 2 cups pecan halves 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 cup sifted confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Cut the apple into quarters, remove the stem and the seeds, and cut into very thin slices.

Line two 12-cup standard muffin tins with paper cupcake liners and set aside. In a bowl, using an electric mixer, mix the cake mix, 1 1/3 cups water, oil and eggs on medium speed until moistened and smooth. Stir in 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, stirring it occasionally to redistribute the chocolate chips. The batter will nearly fill each liner to the top. Evenly sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips over the tops of the cupcakes. Bake until the cupcakes spring back when lightly touched, or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. When cool, put the White Faux Buttercream out with spoons or small spatulas along with bowls of the cupcake toppings for the kids to decorate their own cupcakes. In the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, whip the butter on high speed until very soft. Meanwhile, place a large sheet of parchment paper on a work surface. Using a large sifter, sift the confectioners&#39; sugar onto the parchment. This helps prevent clumping and makes the mixing easier. Lower the speed of the mixer and, using the parchment as a funnel, pour half the sugar into the bowl and mix slowly until combined. Add the milk and mix until combined. Once combined, add the remaining sugar with the vanilla and mix. Once it is combined, turn the mixer speed up and beat the icing until very light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. If desired, divide the icing into smaller batches and color with food coloring. Spread the icing on cooled cupcakes while at room temperature. Refrigerate any leftover icing, but be sure to let it come back to room temperature before using. Re-whip the icing to make it fluffy again. Makes 4 cups (enough for 24 cupcakes).

Pulse the pickles and brine in the carafe of a blender, then blend until pureed, about 1 minute. Strain the puree and discard any pulp. You should have about 1/3 cup pickle liquid.<br> Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the condensed milk and pickle liquid to the cream cheese and continue to mix until smooth. Whip the heavy cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, about 2 minutes. Fold about 1 cup of the whipped cream into the condensed milk mixture with a rubber spatula until combined; this lightens it and allows the mixture to stay fluffy. Fold this lightened mixture into the whipped cream until well blended. Pour into the chilled loaf pan and freeze, covered, until scoopable, about 5 hours.

Leave 1 tablespoon of the drippings in the pan (there probably won&#39;t be much more than that, but discard any extra if there is). Season the scallops with salt and pepper, to taste. Increase the heat under the skillet to medium-high, add the butter, and sear the scallops until brown and glossy, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer the scallops to a plate and set aside. Remove pan from heat and add the vermouth and lemon juice. Now return the skillet to the heat and stir with a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Stir in the water. While the sauce reduces, slice the scallops in half vertically. Slip them into the reduced sauce with the tarragon, parsley, and bacon bits and give the skillet a swirl to bring everything together. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if desired. Divide the scallops with their sauce among small plates or Asian soup spoons and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 51599,&quot;Bread Pudding 4 cups whole milk 1 cup granulated sugar 1 vanilla bean 6 large eggs 4 large egg yolks 1 large loaf Brioche or croissants 1 cup hydrated raisins, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 315 degrees F. For the custard: Pour the milk and half of the sugar into a non-reactive, 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan. While the milk is heating over medium-high heat, use a sharp paring knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the bean with the knife. Place the skin and seeds in the heating milk. Scald the milk mixture by heating it until bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan. Remove from heat. Place the remaining sugar, the whole eggs, and egg yolks in a large mixing bowl and whisk until well incorporated. When you add sugar to eggs (especially to egg yolks), it is important to create an emulsion quickly or else a chemical reaction that produces heat will occur. If you do not whisk immediately, this heat will cook the egg yolks and cause lumps in the custard. Continue to whisk while slowly pouring the hot milk into the egg mixture and whisking until the mixture is smooth and homogenous in color. Try not to create air bubbles on the surface of the custard when you whisk, as these can form a crust on the baked custard. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the vanilla bean pieces and any overcooked eggs. If you are using raisins, evenly distribute them on the bottom of each mold. Slice the brioche into 3/4-inch-thick slices and remove the crust. Dice each slice into 1/2-inch cubes. Fill 6 (8-ounce) molds about half-full with the brioche cubes. Fill the molds half-full with the custard and set them in a roasting pan in the oven (it is much easier to transfer the pan with the molds only half-full). Fill the molds to the top with the custard. It is important to fill the molds completely since the custard loses volume as it bakes. Traditionally, custard is baked in a hot water bath to insulate it from the direct heat of the oven and to keep the eggs from cooking too fast, which would cause them to separate. Use hot water from the tap and pour enough water into the roasting pan to reach halfway up the sides of the molds. When baked correctly, the custard should tremble slightly when gently shaken. In a conventional oven, this should take about 1 hour 15 minutes for a large mold, 45 minutes for individual molds. If you detect any liquid under the skin, the custard is under baked. Put it back in the oven and shake it every 5 minutes until it is ready. If the custard begins to bubble during baking, reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees F (14 degrees C). Remove the mold from the oven and the water bath and place on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving; it will finish setting in the refrigerator. Let the water bath cool before removing it from the oven. To unmold: Carefully run a sharp paring knife around the inside of each mold to loosen the custard. Invert a flat plate over the bread pudding. Place 1 hand on either side, grasping both plate and mold, and flip them both so that the mold is on top. Gently lift off the mold. You may need to tap the bottom of the mold to release the custard. Sometimes I like to decorate the plate by alternating drops of Creme Anglaise sauce and raspberry sauce around the bread pudding. Then I swirl the sauces together with the tip of a paring knife. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 51600,&quot;Rib-Eye Steaks with Savory Chocolate Sauce 4 rib-eye steaks (1 1/2 to 2 pounds) 2 tablespoons canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 shallots, finely chopped 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can beef broth 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauces 1 tablespoon brown gravy mix 1/4 cup grated dark chocolate 2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, for garnish Sauteed Mushrooms and Onions, recipe follows 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 (8-ounce) package sliced shiitake mushrooms 1 (8-ounce) package sliced baby portabella mushroom 1 cup frozen onions, thawed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup Canadian whiskey 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves chopped 1 cup heavy cream Instructions: Let the steaks sit out for 30 minutes before cooking to come to room temperature. Heat the canola oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Season the steaks with salt and pepper. Place them in the hot pan. Cook for about 3 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove the steaks from the pan, cover them loosely with foil, and let them rest for 5 minutes before slicing while you make the sauce. Turn the temperature on the skillet down to medium. Add the shallots and cook until they soften a bit, about 2 minutes. Pour in the broth and Worcestershire sauce and bring it up to a simmer. While the broth comes to a simmer, add the gravy mix to a small bowl and mix with 2 tablespoons water. Add to the broth, stir, and let simmer until thickened. Stir in the chocolate and cold butter to thicken the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Place the steaks onto a serving platter, pour the sauce over top (or serve on the side), and garnish with parsley. Serve with Sauteed Mushrooms and Onions. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the mushrooms and onions and season with salt and pepper. Cook until they begin to soften and the mushrooms release their juices, about 7 minutes. Take the pan off of the heat and add the whiskey. Place back on the heat, add the thyme, and cook until the moisture has evaporated and the pan is almost dry, about 3 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Cook until the cream thickens a bit, 4 to 5 minutes.

Season all over with salt, black pepper, and oregano. Heat the oil in a paella pan or wide skillet. Brown the chicken on all sides, when nearly cooked through, add the chorizo links and brown. Remove the chicken and sausage from the pan. Cut the sausages into slices and set aside. Drain out excess oil but don&#39;t clean the pan. Make a sofrito by sauteing the garlic, onion, and tomatoes, cook until the mixture caramelizes a bit and the flavors meld. Season with salt, black pepper, and paprika. Add the rice, stirring to coat the grains. Steep the saffron in 1/4-cup hot water for 5 minutes then stir it into the rice. Add the stock/water and simmer for 10 minutes, gently moving the pan around so the rice cooks and absorbs evenly. Do not cover or constantly stir like risotto. Add the shellfish and the reserved chicken and sausage. Simmer, without stirring, until the rice is al dente and the mussels have opened. (Do not eat any mussels that do not.) Scatter the peas on top and continue to cook until the liquid is absorbed. The ideal paella has a toasted rice bottom called socarrat. Allow to rest off the heat for 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with lemon wedges and strips of pimento. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 51608,&quot;Chapati: Indian Flatbreads 3/4 cup whole-wheat flour 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing Instructions: Combine the flours and salt in a bowl.

Add the chopped onions and 1 teaspoon of the pepper. Cook the onion down a little, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chopped cabbage, sauerkraut, remaining 1 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Let the mixture cook, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how done you like the cabbage. Strain and let cool. For the dough: Put the yeast and sugar in a 4-cup measuring cup and add warm water to the 1-cup mark. Stir together and let sit until the yeast rises to twice its original size. Put the powdered milk in another 4-cup measuring cup and add water to the 2-cup mark. Stir together. In a large mixing bowl, add the flour, salt and shortening. Cut the shortening into the flour by hand. Next, make a well in the flour and add the eggs, yeast mixture and the powdered milk mixture to the flour. Work it all together until the dough comes away from the bowl (you may need a touch more flour or water). Oil the dough slightly on each side, cover and let rise, for 10 minutes. Pinch and let rise another 15 minutes. To assemble the Lauer-Kraut burgers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lightly flour a work surface and put the dough on the flour. Begin to roll the dough as close to a rectangle as you can, roughly 24-by-30 inches. Once the dough is rolled out, cut the dough into squares, roughly 6-by-6 inches. Take a square of dough and roll it out a little bigger, roughly 8-by-8 inches. Turn the re-rolled square over and add a full cup of filling mixture into the middle of the dough. Bring the opposite corners of the square together, and then bring the other 2 opposite corners together. You should have all 4 corners drawn together. Pinch down the 4 seams of the dough. Once you pinch all the seams, push down slightly on the kraut burger. This will release extra air and help you find any place you missed sealing the kraut burger. Turn the sealed pocket over and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Zinfandel]&quot; 51611,&quot;Butternut Squash and Bacon Lasagna 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 6 slices thick-cut bacon, diced<br> 1 small onion, chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage 3/4 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 2 1/2 cups whole milk 1 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1/2 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, shredded 1/2 pound fontina cheese, shredded 21 sheets no-boil lasagna noodles (from two 1-pound boxes) 2 butternut squashes, peeled, halved, seeded and sliced 1/4 inch thick 1/4 cup breadcrumbs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 ?

Add the eggs and olive oil and pulse untilthe dough gathers around the blade, 40 to 60 seconds. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead a few times, then shape it into a smooth ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature, 30 minutes. (The dough can be made a day ahead and refrigerated; bring it to room temperature before rolling.) Prepare the filling: Remove the mushroom stems and set aside for the broth; finely chop the caps. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped mushroom caps and season lightly with salt; cook until they release their liquid, about 2 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high and cook until the pan is dry and the mushrooms are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely, then stir in the ricotta, chives, parsley, parmesan, egg yolk and nutmeg. Make the broth: Combine the reserved mushroom stems in a large Dutch oven with the porcini, onion, carrot, celery, parmesan rind, parsley and thyme sprigs, peppercorns, 1 teaspoon salt and the lemon zest. Add 10 cups cold water and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the broth is dark and reduced by half, about 1 1/2 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot and season with salt; set aside. Meanwhile, fill and shape the pasta: Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time (and keeping the other pieces wrapped), flatten and shape the dough into a 3-inch square with your hands. Dust a clean work surface with flour; using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a 10-inch square, about 1/8 inch thick. Trim the edges so they are straight, then cut the dough into sixteen 2-to-2 1/2-inch squares. Place a heaping teaspoonful of filling in the center of each square. With damp fingers, lightly moisten the edges of the dough; fold the square diagonally to form a triangle, pressing out any air pockets around the filling. Bring the 2 opposite points of the triangle together around your finger to form a ring; lightly moisten and pinch the points together to seal. Transfer to a well-floured baking sheet as you go. Repeat to form the remaining tortelloni. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Bring the prepared mushroom broth to a simmer. Add the tortelloni to the boiling water. After they float to the top, cook until al dente, 3 to 4 more minutes. Divide the mushroom broth among 6 bowls. Drain the tortelloni in a colander, then divide among the bowls. Top with chopped chives and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 51615,&quot;Rancho Viejo Breakfast Burritos 2 poblano chiles, made into rajas 2 tablespoons butter 8 eggs 4 scallions, sliced thin 3 ounces fresh goat cheese 16 medium flour tortillas, warmed Instructions: To make the rajas: Place the poblano chiles over an open flame or under a broiler and char all sides.

If you&#39;re serving them right away, lay half of the graham crackers on a cookie sheet. Top with chocolate pieces to cover, then pipe \kisses\ of marshmallow to cover the chocolate. (If using store-bought marshmallows, place 3 marshmallows on top of the chocolate layer. Leftover homemade marshmallows should be stored in airtight containers.) Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake until the marshmallow is puffed and golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with the remaining graham crackers, pressing down slightly to make a sandwich. Serve immediately, while still warm. Combine the water, the corn syrup, and the sugar in a saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Bring to a boil and boil to \soft-ball\ stage, or about 235 degrees F.<br> Meanwhile, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Sprinkle the gelatin over the 2 tablespoons cold water and let dissolve. When the syrup reaches 235 degrees F, remove it from the heat, add the gelatin, and mix. Pour the syrup into the whipped egg whites. Add the vanilla and continue whipping until stiff and mostly cooled. Transfer to a pastry bag with a large plain tip. In a food processor or the bowl of an electric mixer, mix together the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Add the cold butter and mix or process until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the honey, molasses, water, and vanilla.

Line an 8-inch square baking dish with a sheet of aluminum foil, making sure to cover the corners and sides. Lightly butter the aluminum foil, including corners and sides. In the bowl of a double boiler set over simmering water, combine the butter and chopped unsweetened chocolate. Stirring often, heat until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar and salt. Add the eggs and vanilla and stir until well blended. Fold in the sifted flour and stir just until the flour disappears. Stir in the semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chunks. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread evenly. Bake approximately 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Baking time will be longer if you are using a metal pan. Do not overbake. Transfer the dish to a wire rack and cool completely. Make the Carmel-Cashew Topping: Pour the cream into the bowl of a double boiler set over simmering water. Unwrap caramels and put them into the bowl. Stirring frequently to prevent sticking, combine the cream and caramels until the mixture becomes homogeneous and smooth. Take the mixture off the heat and keep stirring until the caramel becomes a little thicker and the mixture begins to cool down. Add a pinch of salt and the vanilla and stir. Coarsely chop the cashews and fold them into the caramel mixture until nuts are completely coated with caramel. Pour mixture over the top of the cooled brownies and spread evenly. Refrigerate the brownies until the caramel is set, about 30 to 45 minutes. Remove brownies from the pan by grabbing the sides of the aluminum foil and lifting them from the pan. With a serrated knife, cut the brownies into 2-inch squares. These can be stored in an airtight container for 2 days or in a covered container in the refrigerator for 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 51625,&quot;Peanut Butter and Jelly Bars 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 2 cups (18 ounces) creamy peanut butter (recommended: Skippy) 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 cups (18 ounces) raspberry jam or other jam 2/3 cups salted peanuts, coarsely chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

For the Greek yogurt whip: In a medium mixing bowl, add the Greek yogurt, honey and lime zest. Stir to combine. Set aside. In a separate large mixing bowl, add the heavy cream, confectioners\u2019 sugar and vanilla. Using a hand mixer on medium speed, beat for 3 to 5 minutes until stiff peaks form (whipped cream will hold its peak on the whisk when held upright). Using a rubber spatula, fold the honey-lime Greek yogurt into the whipped cream. Crumble 24 large or 36 small Graham Bears into the whipped cream mixture. Add 1/2 cup of the gummy bears. Gently fold in to fully incorporate. Transfer the bear salad into a serving bowl. Top with the remaining 12 large or small Graham Bears and the remaining 1/2 cup of gummy bears, and drizzle with extra honey. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the butter, brown sugar and honey. Mix on medium speed for 3 to 5 minutes or until butter is light and smooth. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl to evenly incorporate. Mixing on low speed, add the dry mixture and milk, alternating a little at a time, and mix for about 2 to 3 minutes until a shaggy dough forms. Continue to mix by hand until smooth. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour. Place an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. On a well-floured work surface, roll the dough to 1/8-inch thick (it should be slightly thicker than average graham crackers) and cut out bear shapes with a 1 3/4- or 2 1/2-inch bear-shaped cookie cutter. Gather the dough scraps and roll back out to yield 36 large bears or 48 smaller bears. (You can continue to re-roll the dough to yield the full amount or freeze leftovers for another time. You should get anywhere from 60 to 84 bears, depending on the size of your cookie cutter.) Transfer the bears to the prepared baking sheets, keeping minimal space between them as they don\u2019t spread. Use a chopstick to dock the bears with a nose and belly button. Add 2 mini chocolate chips to each bear for eyes. Refrigerate one baking sheet while the other is in the oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cookies are semi-firm and golden brown.

Using a mandolin, V-slicer or the slicing attachment on a food processor, slice the potatoes approximately 1/8-inch thick. (If you don&#39;t want to slice all the potatoes at once, slice them one at a time and build the gratin as you go.) Create the first layer by laying the slices in overlapping rows. Once the first layer is down, season lightly with salt and pepper, then scatter with mushroom slices and a couple tablespoons of the cheese. (Don&#39;t over-do it on these layers, if you create a barrier between the adjoining potato layers, the gratin won&#39;t set.) Continue building layers until you&#39;re out of potatoes or out of room to build, but be sure to save 1/2 cup of the cheese for the top. Pour 2/3 cup of the half and half over the gratin then spread both hands over the surface and push down to work the air out from the layers. Add remaining liquid only if half and half does not come to the surface when you push down. Sprinkle the gratin with cheese, cover loosely with foil and place in middle of oven for 1 hour. Check for doneness by inserting the point of a paring knife straight into the gratin.

Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper. Set a turkey roaster pan over 2 burners on medium heat and add the canola oil. Brown the chicken, skin-side down first, 3 to 4 minutes, then turn and brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Remove from the pan and set aside.<br> Add a little more of the oil to the pan on high heat and add the mushrooms, garlic and onions. Season with salt and cook just long enough to get some color on the mushrooms, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and thyme and cook about 1 minute longer. Place the chicken pieces back into the pan skin-side up and spread them out evenly, pushing them down into the mushrooms and onions. Add the marsala, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan, and add the chicken broth. Place the whole pan in the oven and cook until the tops of the chicken are golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.<br> Use tongs to remove the chicken from the pan and transfer onto a serving platter and keep warm. Set the roasting pan back over the burner on high heat. Bring the contents to a boil and cook the liquid until it is reduced and the flavors become concentrated, 3 to 4 minutes. Shut off the heat, add the butter cubes and stir gently to melt the butter evenly. This will thicken the marsala sauce and give it a rich flavor. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add a squeeze of the lemon juice and fold in the parsley. Pour over the chicken and serve with Chardonnay. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 51663,&quot;Quick Rotisserie Chicken Gumbo 8 ounces andouille sausage, cut into 1/4-inch slices 8 ounces kielbasa, cut into 1/4-inch slices<br> 1/2 cup peanut oil<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup chopped celery 1 cup chopped yellow onion<br> 1 cup chopped green bell pepper<br> 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons Creole seasoning<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 5 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br> One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, undrained<br> 1 1/2 cups frozen cut okra<br> 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce<br> 4 cups shredded rotisserie chicken (1 large rotisserie chicken)<br> 4 cups hot cooked white rice<br> 1/4 cup sliced scallions<br> Hot sauce, for serving, optional<br> Instructions: Cook the andouille and kielbasa in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned, about 8 minutes.

Then add the hot water until you have a thick, smooth mayonnaise (it is important to add the oil slowly and steadily in this way, rather than all at once, or you may run the risk of the mixture curdling). Season with pepper to taste. Reserve.<br> Just before serving, assemble the Tartare: Remove the lobster from the marinade, cut it into cubes of a similar size to the asparagus and cucumber and combine all three together in a bowl. Add the anchovy mayonnaise and season with pepper (the anchovies will probably make the mixture salty enough). Mix thoroughly. To serve, either pile the mixture into shallow bowls or plates of for a neater presentation, place a 2 1/2-inch diameter pastry cutter in the center of each bowl or plate. Pack each ring with the lobster and asparagus mixture, pressing down as you do so. Neaten off the top, then carefully lift off the pastry rings. Garnish each serving of tartare with a good sprig of chervil and serve with the bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Vermentino]&quot; 51679,&quot;Frisee aux Lardons 1 to 2 chicken livers 2 ounces Balsamic Vinegar 6 ounces blended oil 1 shallot minced Salt and pepper 1 pound large cut country bacon (about 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch) 2 heads frisee, washed and trimmed Roquefort or chevre cheese 4 slices of baguette, toasted Instructions: For the dressing, saute the chicken livers until cooked through.

On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 7 by 14-inch oval. Lightly brush both sides of the dough with olive oil and place on hot grill. Grill until lightly charred and the dough begins to puff up, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip dough and grill on the second side until charred and just cooked, 2 minutes. Remove pizza from grill and set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the tomatoes, basil, artichokes, and just enough of the artichoke marinade to coat the mixture. Toss gently and scatter over the pizza. Top with basil, Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve immediately. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together yeast, warm water, sugar and olive oil. Let sit for about 3 minutes to fully dissolve and activate the yeast. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour and salt. With a rubber spatula, gradually mix the yeast mixture into the flour until just combined and dough barely holds together. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter surface dusted with flour. Knead the dough with flour-dusted hands until the dough has become smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. The surface should be tight and silky and bounce back slightly when pressed. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough in it. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Once doubled, punch the dough down and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Knead each 1 slightly to form a uniform ball. Set aside and cover them with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap to rest for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 51683,&quot;Pork Chops with Apples and Onions 1 tablespoon grape seed oil 1/2 cup thin-sliced (height wise) red or Vidalia onion 1/4 cup thin-sliced bacon 1 cup thin-sliced apple (1/4-inch by length) 1/4 cup white wine, sauvignon blanc or riesling 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, optional 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, optional 2 tablespoons grape seed oil Eight 4-ounce fresh boneless pork loin chops 1 teaspoon ground pepper 1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt 1 teaspoon fresh mint, chopped Potatoes of choice, for serving Instructions: For the apple compote: In a large saute pan over high heat, add the oil and allow to heat to the verge of smoking. Then add the onions and reduce the heat to medium. Allow the onions to cook, stirring throughout, until light brown in color, about 2 minutes. Then add the bacon and allow to cook until the bacon has begun to brown. Then add the apples. After adding the apples, allow all the ingredients to blend in flavor for a final 2 minutes. Add the wine to deglaze the pan and allow the alcohol to cook off. After reducing the wine, reduce the heat to low and whisk in the butter and optional spices, stirring for 1 to 2 minutes to create a sauce. Finish with the mint and hold warm until serving.<br> For the chops: In large a saute pan over medium-high heat, add the oil and allow to warm.

Soak the leek briefly in water to remove sand and grit, then drain. Heat a heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat, and butter and sweat celery and leeks in the butter until very soft DO NOT BROWN. Add the roasted chestnuts and chicken stock and bring to a simmer. If you are using frozen chestnuts, simmer for approximately 20 minutes, or until the starch begins to develop and the soup begins to thicken. If fresh chestnuts are used, simmer for approximately 30 minutes or until the starch begins to develop and you can easily crush the nuts against the side of the pot with a spoon. Turn off heat and allow the soup to cool slightly, otherwise the stream from the hot soup may cause the blender to malfunction. Pour the soup into a blender (or use an immersion blender right in the pot) blend until there are no longer any large pieces of chestnut, celery and leeks and the soup is somewhat smooth. Very small pieces of chestnut should remain. Return soup to pot and bring to a simmer again, add the cream and the port. Reduce until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If the soup becomes too thick, adjust the consistency by adding a bit of water. The soup should be stirred well before serving, if it is in a thermos, shake it very well before pouring into bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Rioja, Tempranillo]&quot; 51689,&quot;Corn Pudding 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, for the baking dish 1/2 cup fine bread crumbs, toasted 3 cups corn kernels (from about 6 ears corn), or use best quality canned corn 1 cup milk 1 cup water 1/3 cup instant polenta 6 large eggs 2 teaspoons sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 small bunch cilantro, leaves only, finely chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Using a 4-inch ring mold, cut out 4 circles of puff pastry. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and a splash of water. Brush the top of each pastry round with the egg wash and place on the lined baking sheet. Bake until the rounds puff up and the tops are light golden, about 15 minutes. Remove and set aside. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. For the beef: In a large pan over medium heat, add the butter, olive oil and beef, broken up in small chunks. Sprinkle over 1 tablespoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer the beef to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish using a slotted spoon. Pour the pan juices into a bowl and reserve. For the mushrooms: In the same pan, add the butter and olive oil and heat over medium heat until the butter melts. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their liquid, wilt and gain a bit of color, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and onion and season with salt and pepper. Cook until fragrant, about 4 more minutes. Add the mushrooms to the baking dish on top of the beef layer. For the sauce: Combine the butter and flour in a microwave-safe mug and microwave on high for 1 minute and 30 seconds. In a pan over medium heat, add the mustard, flour-butter mixture and reserved beef drippings and whisk together. Add the stock, plenty of black pepper and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer; simmer until the sauce thickens, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley. Pour the sauce on top of the dish, over the mushrooms and beef. Place the pastry rounds on top. Bake, uncovered, until the dish bubbles, 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 51701,&quot;Candied Yam Souffle 1 stick butter 1 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup chopped pecans 2 large (40-ounce) cans large yams or sweet potatoes, drained 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 (12-ounce) jar marshmallow topping Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

From Food Network Kitchens &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 51704,&quot;Southwestern Quesadilla 12 (10-inch) flour tortillas 2 pounds turkey sausage, recipe follows 1 1/2 pound mozzarella, shredded 3/4 cup roasted red bell peppers, cut into 1/4-inch long strips 1 cup basil pesto, recipe follows 2/3 cup chicken broth 2 ounces chipotle chiles in adobo sauce 2 pounds ground turkey 1 tablespoon ground sage 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon ground cumin 3 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 1 cup fresh basil leaves, firmly packed 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup pecans or pine nuts 1/4 cup Parmesan, grated 1 tablespoon salt Instructions: Arrange flour tortillas on a table. Six of the tortillas will be sandwich tops and 6 will be bottoms. Sprinkle the turkey sausage evenly on 6 bottom tortillas. Next, sprinkle 4 to 5 ounces of mozzarella cheese over the turkey sausage. (As the quesadillas cook, the cheese will melt and act as glue to hold the quesadilla together.) Add 5 or 6 strips of red bell pepper over the mozzarella and turkey sausage. Finally, spread a thin layer of basil pesto on each of the remaining 6 flour tortilla tops and press it firmly on top of the bottom tortilla section. Preheat your grill to low heat. Place the quesadillas on the grill and cook until grill marks are present and the quesadilla turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. The inside should be warm and the cheese should be melted. Once finished cooking, remove the quesadilla from the grill, cut into 6 wedges, and serve with your favorite salsa. Place the chicken broth and chipotle chiles with adobo sauce in a blender, and puree until smooth, about 1 minute. In a large skillet over medium high heat, begin cooking the turkey sausage. Then add in the chipotle cl mixture and cook until the meat is crumbly and well done, about 10 to 15 minutes. Toward the end of the cooking, add in your sage, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper. Cool the sausage mixture before spooning it onto the tortillas. Put the basil and olive oil into a food processor and blend until smooth. Next, add the pecans, Parmesan, and salt. Continue to blend until smooth, adding more olive oil, if necessary, to achieve a smooth consistency. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 51705,&quot;Dark Salty Caramels 14 1/2 ounces sugar 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 cup heavy cream, room temperature 2 teaspoons soy sauce 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces, at room temperature 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt Instructions: Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper. Combine the sugar, water, corn syrup, and cream of tartar in a heavy 4-quart saucepan and put over high heat. Stir occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Cover and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the heavy cream and soy sauce in a liquid measuring cup. Have this and the butter standing by. Remove the lid from the sugar mixture, and attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. When the sugar mixture reaches 230 degrees F, reduce the heat to medium and cook, without stirring, until the syrup is a golden color and is approaching 300 degrees F, about 6 to 7 minutes. At this point, there is less likelihood of any crystallization, so gently swirl the pan to break up any hot pockets. When the temperature approaches 350 degrees F, it will turn deep amber. Remove the pan from the heat, and gently swirl again to break up all of the hot pockets. Cool for 2 minutes. Carefully incorporate the cream and soy mixture and the butter into the pan. Stir to combine. Return the caramel to medium heat, stir until the butter is completely melted, and continue cooking until it reaches 255 degrees F. Remove from the heat and pour into the parchment-lined pan, tap gently to release air bubbles. Cool on a cooling rack for 30 minutes, and then sprinkle evenly with the salt. Continue cooling on the rack for an additional 3 1/2 hours. Cut into 1-inch pieces and wrap individually in parchment.

Spread the pine nuts on one side of a baking sheet and the cumin seeds on the other side, not mixing the two together. Toast the nuts and spices until fragrant and browning in spots, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let cool. Cut the tops off the carrots and reserve. Peel the carrots and chop them into 1-inch pieces. Fill a medium wide-mouthed pot with 2 inches of water. Set a collapsible steamer basket insert into the pot, then bring to a simmer over high heat. Put the carrots in the steamer basket and cook, covered, until the largest pieces are tender when pierced with a knife, 10 to 12 minutes. Puree the carrots and chickpeas with a food processor until blended. Add the orange juice, tahini, reserved cumin seeds and 2 teaspoons salt and continue to process until the mixture is smooth and light and very well blended, about 5 minutes, scraping down the bowl as necessary. Transfer the carrot hummus to a medium bowl and reserve. Pick 1/2 cup packed leaves off of the stems of the carrot tops and reserve. Discard the stems. Pulse the garlic and all but 1 teaspoon of the pine nuts in a food processor until coarsely ground. Add the carrot top leaves, mint, 1/4 teaspoon salt and all but 1/4 teaspoon of the orange zest and pulse until finely chopped. With the processor on, slowly drizzle in the oil and process until blended well. Spread half of the carrot hummus in the bottom of a medium glass serving bowl. Spread 1/2 cup Greek yogurt on top.

Temper the chocolate: Melt about 2/3 of the chocolate in the microwave on low power, checking and stirring occasionally to be sure it does not burn. It will take about 1 1/2 minutes. Alternatively, place 2/3 of the chopped chocolate in a bowl set over a pot of simmering water until it melts. Be sure no water touches the chocolate at any point. Stir in the remaining chopped chocolate and continue to stir until completely melted. Touch the skin just below your lower lip with a dab of chocolate: it should feel cool to the touch. If not, stir in a large chunk of chocolate to cool it down further, and then remove it. Stir in 2/3 cup of almonds and 2/3 cup of dried cherries. Using 2 teaspoons, drop clusters of the chocolate mixture onto the prepared sheet tray. Put an almond and one or two dried cherries on top of each cluster.

Let the duck cook, undisturbed, until crispy on one side, then flip with a spatula and crisp on the reverse side, about 6 minutes total. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Heat the sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat and add the shiitakes and takana. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the Tonkotsu Broth and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, bring some water to a rolling boil in a stockpot and add the ramen. Cook for 60 seconds, then drain and add directly to the simmering broth. Cook the broth and ramen for an additional minute, stirring. (I like to use chopsticks here -- they&#39;re a great tool, and why not keep it authentic!) Transfer the ramen and broth to a bowl and top with the crispy duck and soft-boiled egg. Garnish with the bok choy, green onions and sesame seeds. Slurp and enjoy! Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the duck quarters with the salt and add them to a 4-inch-deep roasting pan. Add the garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns and thyme. Add the blended oil and duck fat to the pan so that the duck quarters are submerged in oil. Cover the pan and roast until the meat is falling off the bone, about 3 hours. Remove from the oven; let cool for 15 minutes before straining the duck. Pick the duck meat, discarding the skin, bones, garlic, peppercorns, thyme and bay leaves, and being careful not to leave any bones. Set aside until ready to use; refrigerate if using later. Fill a stockpot two-thirds full with water; add the pork trotters and chicken bones. Boil the bones until red blood ceases to come out of them, about 20 minutes. Strain the bones and clean the pot. Thoroughly rinse the bones, removing any residual blood. Add the rinsed bones to the stockpot and fill with water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming off any residual foam that rises to the top. Add the scallion ends, garlic, mushroom stems, ginger and salt. Cover and simmer until the broth is flavorful, 3 to 4 hours, checking the water level occasionally and adding water as necessary to make sure the bones remain covered. About 30 minutes before the broth is finished cooking, add the ground pork fat and continue to simmer. Strain the broth into a large stockpot and skim off any excess fat. Set aside until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51714,&quot;French Meringue 4 egg whites 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar, optional 4 ounces sugar 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 4 ounces confectioners&#39; sugar 3 ounces nut powder, optional (Nut powder is equal volume by weight of confectioners&#39; sugar and a roasted nut of your choice.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the brown sugar and cook, stirring, to combine (it may look separated, that&#39;s ok). Remove from the heat and whisk in the honey, cream, water, and salt. Strain to remove any undissolved lumps of brown sugar. Let cool for about 30 minutes, or until cooled to room temperature. You should have about 3 cups. (The mixture can be made up to 2 weeks in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.) Divide the dough in half. Use half for this recipe and reserve the other half for another use. On a floured work surface, roll out the brioche into rectangle about 12 by 16 inches and 1/4-inch thick. It will have the consistency of cold, damp Play-Doh and should be fairly easy to roll. Position the rectangle so a short side is facing you. In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and half of the pecans. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Starting from the short side farthest from you and working your way down, roll up the rectangle like a jelly roll. Try to roll tightly, so you have a nice round spiral. Trim off about 1/4- inch from each end of the roll to make them even. Use a bench scraper or a chef&#39;s knife to cut the roll into 8 equal pieces, each about 1 1/2-inches wide. (At this point, the unbaked buns can be tightly wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for up to 1 week. When ready to bake, thaw them, still wrapped, in the refrigerator overnight or at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours, then proceed as directed.) Pour the goo into a 9 by 13-inch baking dish, covering the bottom evenly. Sprinkle the remaining pecans evenly over the surface. Arrange the buns, evenly spaced, in the baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and put in a warm spot to proof until the dough is puffy, pillowy, and soft and the buns are touching-almost tripled in size, about 2 hours. Position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat to 350 degrees F. Bake until golden brown, about 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool in the dish on a wire rack for 20 to 30 minutes. One at a time, invert the buns onto a serving platter, and spoon any extra goo and pecans from the bottom of the dish over the top. The buns are best served warm or within 4 hours of baking. They can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 day, and then warmed in a 325 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes before serving. Using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the all-purpose flour, bread flour, yeast, sugar, salt, water, and 5 of the eggs. Beat on low speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until all the ingredients are combined. Stop the mixer, as needed, to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure all the flour is incorporated into the wet ingredients. Once the dough has come together, beat on low speed for another 3 to 4 minutes. The dough will be very stiff and seem quite dry. With the mixer on low speed, add the butter, 1 piece at a time, mixing after each addition until it disappears into the dough. Continue mixing on low speed for about 10 minutes, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. It is important for all the butter to be thoroughly mixed into the dough. If necessary, stop the mixer occasionally and break up the dough with your hands to help mix in the butter. Once the butter is completely incorporated, turn up the speed to medium and beat until the dough becomes sticky, soft, and somewhat shiny, another 15 minutes. It will take some time to come together. It will look shaggy and questionable at the start and then eventually it will turn smooth and silky. Turn the speed to medium-high and beat for about 1 minute. You should hear the dough make a slap-slap-slap sound as it hits the sides of the bowl. Test the dough by pulling at it; it should stretch a bit and have a little give. If it seems wet and loose and more like a batter than a dough, add a few tablespoons of flour and mix until it comes together. If it breaks off into pieces when you pull at it, continue to mix on medium speed for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until it develops more strength and stretches when you grab it. It is ready when you can gather it all together and pick it up in 1 piece. Put the dough in a large bowl or plastic container and cover it with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the surface of the dough. Let the dough proof (that is, grow and develop flavor) in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or up to overnight At this point you can freeze the dough in an airtight container for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51716,&quot;Beef and Beer Stew with Root Vegetables 2 pounds beef stew meat, chuck, shoulder or bottom round 2 bay leaves 1 tablespoon dry thyme 1 tablespoon dry rosemary 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup onions, peeled and diced 1/4 cup flour 12 ounces dark beer 1 quart hot beef broth 1/2 cup crushed tomatoes 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons ground black pepper 1/2 cup carrots, peeled and diced 1/2 cup celery, peeled and diced 1 cup rutabaga (wax turnips), peeled and diced 1 cup parsnips, peeled and diced Instructions: Season the beef with salt and pepper.

Steam spinach and let cool. Lay a long piece of plastic wrap over your cutting board and tuck it underneath the sides of the board. The chicken breasts should be placed on the covered cutting board, skin side down, with enough space between them so they can lay flat after you butterfly them. To make the butterfly cut, carefully slice open (without slicing the chicken all the way through) and spread the flesh of the chicken out so you will be able to pound it out into a single thin piece on which you will place stuffing and then roll up. Season the breasts with salt and pepper. Then put another length of plastic wrap over the seasoned chicken breasts and flatten with meat mallet to integrate the seasoning into the chicken. *Cook&#39;s Note: Covering the chicken with the plastic will also keep the mess down when you pound with the meat mallet. Pound chicken thin and remove plastic. In a small mixing bowl, mix together, blue cheese, ricotta cheese, Parmesan, lemon zest and white wine. Place equal amounts of the cheese mixture on each breast, followed by equal amounts of the steamed spinach. Fold in each end and roll tightly, securing with toothpicks as needed, and placing on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and brush with remaining olive oil. Place in the oven (leaving an oven rack available for the hash) and roast for 45 to 50 minutes, or until internal temperature registers 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove stuffed chicken from oven and allow to rest. For the tapenade: Finely chop olives and plums and combine with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add 2 ounces of blue cheese and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper. For the Hash: In a large oven-safe skillet, add half the oil (1/4 cup) and warm the pan over medium low heat. Add the pieces of blanched asparagus and diced onion, and saute together for about 5 minutes until the asparagus feels cooked to the bite. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large bowl toss the zucchini, diced white potatoes and diced sweet potatoes with the remaining 1/4 cup of oil and season them with salt and pepper. Get a nice even coating of oil on the zucchini and potatoes and place them onto a large roasting tray. Top with the asparagus and onion mixture and place in the oven for 35 to 45 minutes. For the Demi-Glace: Prepare demi-glace while the chicken and hash are in the oven, by melting the butter over medium heat in a saucepan and sauteing onion until tender. Whisk together cornstarch and red wine to make slurry, and add to onion along with veal stock. Let simmer over medium heat until reduced by 1/3, stirring occasionally. Once the hash is complete, toss 2 ounces of blue cheese with warm hash mixture and using a 3-inch circle mold or biscuit cutter as a mold, form a circle of the hash in the center of serving plate. Place stuffed chicken on top of hash, and spoon some of the tapenade onto the chicken breast. Drizzle demi-glace over chicken and hash. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barolo]&quot; 51722,&quot;Italian Sausage, Spinach, and Ricotta Cannelloni 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, diced 8 ounces sweet Italian sausage, casings removed or bulk sausage meat 1 (10-ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry 1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese 1 1/2 cups plus 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 3 large eggs Salt and freshly ground black pepper Fresh Pasta Dough, rolled out and cut into 6 by-7-inch rectangles, recipe follows 4 cups Simple Tomato Sauce, recipe follows Fresh basil, for garnish 2 cups flour 3 eggs 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, diced 3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or 1 tablespoon dried basil 2 (28-ounce) cans diced tomatoes Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and saute the onion until fragrant and translucent. Add the Italian sausage meat, breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon and brown it until no longer pink, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the excess fat from the sausage meat, and set aside to cool. In a large mixing bowl stir together the drained and squeeze-dried spinach, ricotta, 1 1/2 cups Parmesan, eggs, cooled Italian sausage and onion mixture, salt, and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Place the oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the fresh pasta rectangles for 1 minute and remove with a slotted spatula. Set aside. In a 9 by 13-inch baking dish, spread 2 cups tomato sauce. Working with 1 pasta rectangle at a time, spread 6 tablespoons filling along one edge and roll the pasta sheet up tightly, leaving the ends open. Repeat until you have 8 cannelloni. Arrange the prepared cannelloni, seam-side down, in a single layer in the baking dish. Spoon the remaining 2 cups tomato sauce evenly over the cannelloni. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup grated Parmesan over top. Bake the cannelloni for 20 minutes and let it stand for 10 minutes before serving. Serve the cannelloni with extra tomato sauce from the baking dish and garnish with fresh basil. To make fresh pasta dough: Mound the flour on a clean work surface. Hollow out the center making a well in the middle of the flour with steep sides. Break the eggs into the well. Add the salt, and olive oil to the hollow center and gently mix together with a fork. Gradually start incorporating the flour by pulling in the flour from the sides of the well. As you incorporate more of the flour, the dough will start to take shape. With your hands or a bench scraper continue working the dough until it comes together. If the dough is too dry, add a little water; if too wet or sticky, add a little flour. Begin kneading the dough and keep kneading until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. At this point, set the dough aside, cover it with plastic, and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes. You can store the dough in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours, but allow it to return to room temperature before rolling it out. Divide the pasta dough into 4 even sections. Keep each section covered with plastic wrap or a clean towel while you work with each one. Flour the dough, the rollers of a pasta roller (or your rolling pin), your hands, and the work surface. If using a pasta machine: Flatten 1 of the of the dough pieces between your hands or with a floured rolling pin until it forms a thick oval disk. Dust the disk, the roller, and your hands with additional flour. Flour a baking sheet to hold the rolled out finished pasta. With the roller on the widest setting, pass the pasta through the machine&#39;s rollers a few times until it is smooth. Fold the dough over into 1/3, and continue to pass through a few more times until the pasta is smooth again. Begin adjusting the pasta machine settings to become thinner, passing the dough through a few times at each setting. If rolling the pasta by hand: Flatten a dough piece into a thick oval disk with your hands. Flour a baking sheet for the rolled out finished pasta. Place the oval dough disk on a floured work surface, and sprinkle with additional flour. Begin rolling out the dough with a floured rolling pin working from the center of the dough outwards, constantly moving the dough and lifting it to make sure it&#39;s not sticking. To make Simple Tomato Sauce: In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, and garlic and cook until soft and golden brown. Add the basil and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes with their juices and bring to a boil, stirring often. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. With a potato masher, break up the tomatoes to achieve a sauce-like consistency. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve. Cook&#39;s Note: Tomato sauce will last 1 week in the refrigerator and up to 6 months in the freezer. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 51723,&quot;Chicken Piccata Pasta Toss 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/3 pounds chicken breast tenders, cut into 1-inch pieces Salt and pepper 1 1/2 tablespoons butter 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 shallots, chopped 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 cup white wine 1 lemon, juiced 1 cup chicken broth or stock 3 tablespoons capers, drained 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped 1 pound penne rigate pasta, cooked to al dente Chopped or snipped chives, for garnish Instructions: Heat a deep nonstick skillet over medium high heat.

Transfer to a medium mixing bowl and reserve. In a small skillet or saucepan, melt the butter. Saute the remaining spinach just until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Coarsely chop and let cool. In a small skillet, toast the pine nuts over medium heat, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes. Cool and fold into the cheese mixture with the cooled spinach, mozzarella, goat cheese, egg, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and set the mousse aside. Cut the pasta dough into 4 pieces. On a surface dusted lightly with flour, with a pasta machine or by hand, roll out the first piece to a rectangle 20 inches long and 4 inches wide, keeping the remaining dough covered until needed. Trim the rectangle as needed to even the sides. Spread 1/4 of the mousse over the lower part of the length of the dough. Roll the dough over the filling, enclosing it completely, forming a 20-inch by 1-inch pasta roll. Cut the roll into approximately 1-inch pieces, yielding 20 slices. Repeat with the remaining dough and mousse. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter and brush 8 (4-inch) tart pans with the butter. Arrange 10 of the pasta slices in a circle, cut-side up, in each pan (it will be a tight squeeze, but it can be done) and sprinkle each circle with grated Parmesan. Set the pans on a baking tray for easier handling and bake for 15 minutes. Invert each of the pasta rounds out of the tart pans onto the tray and continue to bake until both sides are golden brown. This should take another 15 to 20 minutes. The pasta will be crisp. To serve, heat the Tomato Garlic Basil Sauce, and spoon a little in the center of each of 10 warmed plates. Set 1 of the rounds on the sauce and serve immediately. Pass the remaining sauce in a small bowl. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, egg yolks, salt, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of water. Process until the dough begins to hold together, then stop the machine, and pinch the dough to test it. If it&#39;s too dry, add up to 1 more tablespoon of water and process until it forms a moist ball. Turn out on a lightly floured smooth work surface and knead by hand, until a smooth ball is formed. Loosely wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the other pieces covered in plastic while you roll out 1 piece at a time, by hand with a rolling pin or through the rollers of a pasta machine, stretching the dough to the desired thickness. If using a pasta machine, set the rollers at the widest opening. Flatten the first piece of dough into a thick strip no wider than the machine, to enable it to pass through the rollers. If necessary, dust the pasta very lightly with flour. Run the pasta through the machine. Fold in thirds, crosswise, and run through the machine again. Repeat this procedure at least twice more, or until the dough is smooth and somewhat elastic. Set the machine to the next smaller opening and run the dough through the rollers. Continue rolling and stretching the dough, using the smaller opening each time, until the next to the last or the last opening is reached, dusting lightly with flour only as necessary. (The strip of dough will be long. If you don&#39;t have enough space on your worktable, halfway through the rolling process cut the strip of dough in half and continue to work with each piece separately, keeping the unused dough covered). Adjust the cutting mechanism to the desired width, cut the noodles, and allow them to dry before cooking. A convenient way to dry pasta is to arrange the cut pasta on a pastry tray sprinkled with flour, preferably semolina flour. As 1 layer is completed, sprinkle flour over the noodles, place a piece of parchment paper over them, and continue layering with noodles and flour. Dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Prepare the herb tea: In a very small saucepan, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil. Add the herbs and bring back to a boil. Lower the heat and reduce to 1/4 cup. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let steep for 15 minutes. Cool. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, egg yolks, salt, olive oil, and herb tea. Process until the dough begins to hold together, then stop the machine, and pinch the dough to test it. If it&#39;s too dry, add 1 tablespoon of water and process until it forms a moist ball. Turn out on a lightly floured smooth work surface and knead by hand, forming a smooth ball. Loosely wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water. The dryer the cabbage the better. In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock. Cook a tester to check the seasoning.; GUEST CHEF: MING&#39;S MOM (IRIS LEE TSAI) . In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt. Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4 cup increments. Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long &#39;noodle&#39;, 1-inch in diameter. Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter. MAKING THE DUMPLINGS: Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up. COOKING THE DUMPLINGS: In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again. Combine all and serve in a small bowl. PLATING: Serve pot stickers on a large platter lined with lettuce with a bowl of dipping sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51736,&quot;Cemitas Puebla Steak Tacos with Salsa Verde 6 tomatillos, husks removed 4 garlic cloves, peeled 2 jalapeno chiles 1 ripe avocado, pitted, peeled, and coarsely chopped 1/2 cup water 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/2 large bunch of cilantro, stems and leaves coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves Pinch of ground cinnamon 8 limes, halved 2 pounds skirt steak, 3/4 to 1 inch thick 16 corn tortillas, heated in the skillet or microwave Diced white onion Chopped fresh cilantro leaves Instructions:</p><ol><li>For the salsa verde: Heat a griddle, grill, or skillet over high heat and add the tomatillos, garlic, and jalapenos all at once.

Add all the mushrooms and the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Season with salt and pepper and cook until mushrooms are soft. Add the milk and reduce by half. Add the provolone and melt. The consistency we&#39;re looking for is similar to that of a potpie. On a buttered sheet pan layer two crepes. This way if the bottom one sticks you can still remove your \cake\ from the pan. Spread a thin layer of the filling onto the crepe. Sprinkle a few chives on each layer. Top with another crepe and spread more mushroom filling on top. Repeat this method until you are out of filling. Top with another crepe and sprinkle on Parmesan. Place under broiler until Parmesan is melted and golden brown. Place onto a cutting board and slice into wedges. Serve immediately. In a blender, combine all of the ingredients (excepting the butter for coating the pan) and pulse for 10 seconds. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours. Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone.

Grease an 8-inch cake pan with cooking spray. In a mixing bowl, whisk the pumpkin, heavy cream, sour cream, egg, vanilla, sugar, bourbon, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, salt and allspice. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Bake until just set, 10 to 12 minutes. The filling will be baked again inside the cookies, so be sure not to overbake here. Remove from the oven, let cool to room temperature, then wrap and refrigerate overnight. The filling needs to be cold before using. For the dough: Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice and salt until blended. Add the butter and mix on low speed until small pieces of butter are visible. Combine the cold apple juice with the vinegar and add to the flour mixture. Mix on medium speed until moist crumbles of dough form. Scrape the dough onto a work surface and knead 6 to 8 times until the dough comes together. Cut the dough into two equal pieces (weigh the dough if you have a scale), and shape each half into a rectangle. Don&#39;t overwork the dough. Work with one piece of dough at a time, keeping the second piece wrapped in plastic at room temperature. Roll out one piece of dough between two pieces of parchment into a 10-by-14-inch rectangle that&#39;s 1/8-inch thick, stopping occasionally to peel away the paper, dust lightly with flour, and flip over. Keep the rectangle neat-this will help with the cookie count. Chill the first sheet of dough, still sandwiched by the parchment. Repeat with the second sheet. Chill both for at least 1 hour or overnight. Remove one sheet of dough from the refrigerator at a time. Peel off the top piece of parchment and trim the dough to 10-by-14 inches. (Use a ruler and a pizza cutter to trim the dough.) Cut the dough into 2-by-2-inch pieces, yielding 35 pieces. Return the cut dough to the fridge and repeat with the second sheet of dough. Chill until firm, about 1 hour. Assemble the cookies and bake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F and line two sheet pans with parchment. With a spatula, carefully lift the cut dough, piece by piece, onto the lined pans, 2 inches apart. Once the bottom 20 pieces are on the pans, the \pies\ are ready to be assembled. Remove the pumpkin filling from the refrigerator and spoon it into the piping bag. Brush the edges of the dough pieces with the egg wash. Pipe a mound of filling in the center of each pie, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges of the dough. Carefully arrange another piece of dough over the filling, lining up the edges. Using your fingertips, lightly press around the filing, removing any air pockets as you press. Using the tines of a fork, lightly press the edges of each pie to seal. Brush the entire top of each pie with more of the egg wash, carefully avoiding excess wash. Chill the pies until firm, about 30 minutes. For the topping: In a small bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon. Remove the pies from the fridge and sprinkle each one with the cinnamon sugar. With the tip of a small knife, prick the dough, giving each pie a small air vent. Bake until the dough feels baked and turns golden brown and the bottom of the pies are lightly golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely on the pans. Store for up to 1 day in an airtight container at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51762,&quot;Hot &amp; Spicy Party Mix 1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 2 to 3 teaspoons Original TABASCO? brand Pepper Sauce 1 1/4 teaspoons seasoned salt 8 cups of your favorite Chex? brand cereals (corn, rice and/or wheat) 1 cup mixed nuts 1 cup pretzels 1 cup bite-size cheese crackers Instructions: Combine butter, Worcestershire sauce, TABASCO?

Carefully and slowly add the heavy cream, stirring with a whisk, then add the butter, vanilla and salt. Bring back to a boil and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Cool the caramel for 10 minutes, then add the orange oil and food coloring. Cool completely before using. For the gummy tails: In a small liquid measuring cup, bloom the gelatin in 1/2 cup cold water for 5 minutes. Warm the mixture in a microwave on high until the mixture is liquid and smooth, 15 seconds. Add the orange oil, mixing it in well. For the shells: Temper the chocolate. Fill the mouse molds with the chocolate and knock them carefully on a hard surface to release any air bubbles. Pour out the excess chocolate back into the bowl of tempered chocolate.<br> Scrape the flat portion of the mold to clean off the excess chocolate. Cool the mouse shells to harden completely. Place the cold caramel in a piping bag, with a small hole cut in the end. Pack the pumpkin seeds into the body cavities of the chocolate shells, then pipe in the caramel until the filling is 1/16-inch below the top. Pour more tempered chocolate over the filling, and scrape the excess again, then let cool and set up completely. Carefully dig out any chocolate that may have gotten into the tail portion of each mouse mold. Clean them with cheese cloth until shiny. Pour the liquid gelatin mixture into the tail portion of each mouse mold. Let cool and set up completely. Release the mice from their molds by gently tapping the mold, right-side up, until they all come out. If any of the gelatin tails do not adhere to their chocolate bodies, use a small amount of tempered chocolate to glue them back on. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51764,&quot;Braised Chard Stems with Saffron and Tomato 1 pound chard stems 1 quart water simmering with 1 bay leaf, 2 onion slices, 2 thyme sprigs, juice of 1 lemon Salt and freshly milled pepper, to taste 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 small onion, finely diced 2 tablespoons approximately, basil leaves, torn into small pieces, plus extra for garnish Pinch of saffron threads 2 tomatoes, seeded and finely diced 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Preheat the broiler on low.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Microwave the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon in a medium microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 1 minute. Cut the apples, crosswise, into slices between 1/4-and-1/2-inch thick, using only full size slices from the center of the apple. You should get 4 slices from each apple, each about 2 inches in diameter. Remove the cores from the apples with a small round cutter or apple corer to make rings. Add the apples to the butter mixture and turn to coat well, taking care not to break the slices. Unroll the pie crusts and roll each on a floured surface into 13-inch rounds. Use a 4 inch round cutter to cut 8 rounds from each piece of dough (gathering the scraps and rerolling the dough as needed). (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Arrange half of the rounds on the prepared baking sheets and brush all over with the egg. Center an apple slice on each round and spoon any juices left in the bowl in the center of the slice. Place a caramel piece in the center of each slice.<br> Lay the remaining dough rounds over each apple slice and press the edges gently to seal, then crimp the edges with a fork. Cut small slits in the dough for air vents. Brush the tops with beaten egg and sprinkle generously with granulated sugar.<br> Bake, rotating the trays from top to bottom halfway through baking time, until the crust is golden brown and crisp,18 to 20 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet at least 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51776,&quot;Loin Lamb Chops with Olives Olive oil to saute 4 loin lamb chops, trimmed of excess fat Flour for dusting 1/2 cup pitted sliced olives (cured or Kalamata or good green ones), coarsely chopped Dried or fresh oregano to taste About 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice or to taste Salt and crushed red pepper Instructions: Heat olive oil in a large skillet.

Add the flour all at once and stir vigorously until mixture forms a ball and smells like toasted flour. Transfer to the bowl of a mixer and paddle the dough while adding the eggs one at a time, allowing machine to incorporate each egg before the next addition. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl often, and then add the vanilla. Lastly, add the dulce de leche and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Transfer the mixture to a container and refrigerate until ready to fry. Heat vegetable oil for frying in a pot. Place the churro batter in a pastry bag fitted with a large star tube. When the oil is 375 degrees F, drop 2-inch-long churros from the pastry bag into the oil and fry until well browned and floating, about 4 minutes. Centers will still be a tiny bit gooey because of the dulce de leche in the batter. Remove the churros to a paper-lined plate. Combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon and toss with the hot churros. To serve, place the churro tots on a small plate or in a shallow bowl accompanied by a dollop of Whipped Cream for dipping. Combine the milk, sugar and baking soda in a large, heavy saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until the mixture becomes a caramel color and is thick enough that you can see the bottom of the pan as you stir, 45 minutes to an hour. By volume it should be reduced to about 1 cup. Cool to room temperature and use immediately, or store in refrigerator until ready to use. Combine the cream and sugar in a cold mixing bowl and whip until stiff peaks form. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51779,&quot;Andrea&#39;s Hand Cranked Coffee Cavatelli 8 ounces extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons sliced garlic 8 ounces freshly sliced porcini mushrooms 6 to 8 ounces diced and blanched calabaza 1 pound cooked Espresso Cavatelli, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups light chicken stock 8 ounces butter 6 to 8 ounces fontina cheese, grated 1 orange, zested 2 tablespoons fresh chopped chives 16 leaves fresh arugula Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 16 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring work surface Pinch kosher salt 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder 12 ounces ricotta cheese 1 whole egg 1 1/2 to 2 ounces milk Instructions: In a large saute pan over a medium heat, add olive oil and garlic. Once garlic begins to brown slightly, add porcini mushrooms and allow to brown with the garlic.

Add chicken stock and butter and reduce until 1/3 of the original liquid remains. Add remaining ingredients and toss until well incorporated. Adjust seasoning as desired and serve in pasta dish. This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant. The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe, in the proportions indicated, and therefore, we cannot make any representation as to the results. In a large bowl, combine flour, salt and espresso and mix well. Make a small well in the center and add ricotta, egg and milk and start to mix all the ingredients together. Once combined, take dough mixture and begin kneading it on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes until firm and smooth. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Wrap dough in moist towel and let rest in a warm location for 10 minutes. Roll dough through a pasta machine starting at the largest setting and slowly working to the number 4 setting. Take the sheet of dough and cut into strips about 1/2-inches wide by 10 inches long, then pass through cavatelli machine. Place the pasta on sheet tray and freeze until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 51780,&quot;Olie-Koecken 3 packages dry yeast 1/2 cup warm (105-115 degrees) water and a pinch of sugar for the yeast 8 tablespoons butter 1 3/4 cups raisins 4 cups flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon cloves 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1 1/2 cups milk 3 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled and cut into small slivers 1 cup whole almonds without brown skins Oil, for deep-frying Instructions: Sprinkle the yeast in the water in a small bowl and sprinkle with the sugar. Let it stand for a moment, then stir to dissolve the yeast. Set aside in a warm place. In the meantime melt the butter and cool. Place the raisins in a saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil. Allow them to boil for a minute and then turn off the heat. Let them stand for 5 minutes and drain. Pat them dry with paper towels and mix them with 1 tablespoon of flour. Place the rest of the flour in a large bowl, stir in the salt, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger, make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast. Stir from the middle and slowly add the melted butter and the milk. The dough should be very thick and hard to stir. Then add raisins, apples, and almonds and combine thoroughly. Allow this batter to rise for about 1 hour. When doubled in bulk, stir down the dough. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Scoop out a heaping tablespoon of dough and push it off the spoon with the aid of another spoon and let it (carefully) drop into the hot oil. They should be at least 2-inches in diameter. Fry the olie-koecken for about 5 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels. The original recipe does not tell us to sprinkle or roll them in the sugar. They are very good plain, but if you prefer you can dust them with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 51781,&quot;Tropical Teriyaki Pork Marinade 1/2 cup pineapple juice 1/2 cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons coconut oil<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger<br> 2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon minced garlic<br> 1 tablespoon dark sesame oil<br> Instructions: Whisk together the pineapple juice, soy sauce, coconut oil, ginger, honey, garlic and sesame oil in a medium bowl.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Separate the chocolate candy balls into larger and smaller balls. The larger balls will make up the spider bodies and the smaller balls the heads.<br> Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Cream the sugar and butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and egg and mix until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Add the peanut butter and mix until creamy, about 1 minute. Turn the mixer speed down to low and add half of the flour mixture. Beat on medium until incorporated, then turn the speed down to low again and add the rest of the flour mixture. Beat on medium until incorporated. Roll the dough by hand into 1-inch balls, place about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets and bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the cookies are light golden brown and have spread to about 2 inches wide, about 16 minutes. The cookies are done when they smell very peanut buttery and the tops feel dry and slightly firm when pressed with fingers. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate over a double boiler. Remove from the heat and let cool briefly so that it is slightly thickened but still pipe-able. When the cookies are done, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a cooling rack. Immediately push 2 chocolate candies directly into each hot cookie, putting a smaller chocolate ball toward the edge of the cookie and a larger chocolate ball directly behind it in the center of the cookie. When the melted chocolate has thickened slightly, put it into a plastic bag and cut a small hole in the corner to create a piping bag. Pipe 8 legs on each cookie, starting from the point where the 2 chocolate candies meet. Pipe the front 4 legs so that they curve up toward the head and the back 4 legs so that they curve backward beyond the body. Reserve the remaining chocolate in the piping bag for the pupils of the eyes.<br> To make eyes, pipe two 1/4-inch circles on the \heads\ of each spider with the cake decorating gel. Pipe a tiny dot of the reserved melted chocolate in the center of each to make the pupils. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51809,&quot;Lizzie&#39;s Pasta Salt 1 pound dry pasta (I&#39;m using spaghetti) 2 tablespoons cracked black pepper 1 teaspoon cl flakes, optional 1/4 cup oil (I&#39;m using extra-virgin olive oil) 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 cup grated hard cheese (I&#39;m using a mix of pecorino and Parmesan) 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, optional Instructions: Bring a pot of water to a boil and salt liberally.

Line a 9-inch square baking dish with foil, leaving an overhang on all sides. Coat the foil with cooking spray. For the peanut butter cookie layer: Beat the peanut butter, sugar and salt in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high until smooth. Beat the eggs in one at a time and then the vanilla. Adjust the speed to medium-low, add the flour and beat until incorporated. Press the batter into an even layer in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; set aside. For the brownie layer: Combine the flour, cocoa powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Melt the butter and chopped chocolate in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring, until smooth, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat; let cool slightly, then stir in the sugar. Mix in the eggs until combined. Stir in the flour mixture and then the chocolate chips until just combined. Pour the brownie batter over the peanut butter layer. For the macaroon layer: Whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until frothy. Toss the coconut, sugar, vanilla and salt together with your hands in another large bowl; add the egg whites, and stir until the coconut mixture is coated. Scatter the coconut mixture in an even layer on top of the brownie layer (there shouldn&#39;t be any brownie peeking through). Bake until the center doesn&#39;t jiggle when the pan is shaken and the coconut is golden brown, 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. (A knife inserted in the middle will still come out wet, because the brownie layer is super fudgy. The jiggle cue is the key to determining doneness.) Transfer the pan to a rack, and let the bar mixture cool completely, preferably overnight. Lift it out of the pan, and peel off the foil. Trim the bar mixture to make neat edges, and cut into very small squares, about the size of fudge. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 51811,&quot;Cajun Rice Salad with Shrimp and Okra 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 teaspoon dried oregano (crushed between fingers) 1 teaspoon hot paprika 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice, optional Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup uncooked brown rice 1 pound raw peeled, tail-off shrimp (31 to 40 shrimp per pound), thawed if frozen 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cups (7 ounces) fresh or frozen okra, sliced 3/4-inch thick (if frozen, do not thaw) 1 large orange or yellow bell pepper, chopped 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley<br> Instructions: For the Cajun seasoning: Combine the garlic powder, oregano, paprika, allspice, if using, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.
