Cut the onions and turnips into quarters. Toss the onions, and turnips, carrots, and fennel lightly in oil and place them on baking sheets. Roast the vegetables for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. When vegetables are a dark caramel color, remove them from the oven. Reserve 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, and the stalk of fennel; set aside. Put the remainder of the vegetables in a large pot with the chicken stock, garlic, orange juice, apple cider, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, star anise, cumin seeds, orange zest, salt and pepper. Cook the broth over high heat until reduced by about half. While the broth is simmering, remove the skin and excess fat from the leg of lamb and cut the meat into 1-inch cubes. Put the cubes on a wire rack to drain or on a clean towel to soak up excess moisture. Add some of the cooking oil to a large heavy skillet and heat over high heat. When the oil is hot, carefully add the diced lamb. Cook the lamb, in batches as necessary, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer the lamb to a roasting pan. Add the wine to the skillet that the lamb was cooked in and cook, over high heat, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook the wine until reduced by about half and the solids have come up off the pan. Pour the reduced wine over the lamb. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Strain the broth and discard the solids. Pour the broth over the lamb in the roasting pan. Cover the pan with a lid or parchment paper and braise until the lamb is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Once the lamb is tender, remove it from the oven and add the reserved roasted vegetables to the pan. Place the roasting pan over medium heat on the stovetop and bring to a simmer. Add salt, pepper, and fresh herbs, to taste. Serve the stew with rustic bread on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 29385,&quot;Spicy Chicken with Plantains and Ginger Pineapple Sauce 4 6-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breasts Kosher salt 2 teaspoons jerk seasoning 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 ripe plantains, peeled and sliced 1/2 inch thick 1 small red onion, thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, diced 1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger 1/2 Scotch bonnet cl pepper, halved lengthwise (remove seeds for less heat) 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar Heaping 1/3 cup pineapple preserves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Season the chicken on both sides with salt and the jerk seasoning. Set aside while you cook the plantains. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the plantains in a single layer and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and season with salt. Keep warm in the oven. Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the same skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, about 7 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board to rest. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the skillet and increase the heat to medium high. Add the red onion, bell pepper, ginger, cl and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables just start softening, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water, the vinegar, pineapple preserves and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer 3 minutes. Discard the cl and stir in 1 tablespoon cilantro. Slice the chicken and divide among plates along with the plantains. Spoon the vegetables over the chicken using a slotted spoon. Top with the remaining 1 tablespoon cilantro. Serve the pineapple sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 29386,&quot;Butterscotch Bird Nests 3/4 cup blanched almond slivers 10 ounces vanilla \make your own\ almond bark 1 cup butterscotch chips 2 cups pretzel sticks, broken in half 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut chips (often found in the health food aisle) 1 cup candy-coated mini chocolate eggs (about 50) Instructions: Heat a large, dry saute pan over medium heat. Add the almond slivers and toast, shaking the pan every minute, until they are fragrant and begin to darken in areas, 3 to 5 minutes. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Melt the almond bark in a microwave-safe bowl according to package instructions. Stir in the butterscotch chips. Microwave another 30 seconds, and then stir until smooth. Stir in the almonds, pretzels and coconut, coating evenly. Drop the mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, onto the prepared baking sheets. Nestle in 1 or 2 of the mini eggs. If the mixture starts to cool and become too firm to work with, microwave for 30 seconds and stir gently. Let the nests cool at room temperature until solid. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 29387,&quot;Hot and Sour Fresh Noodles with Zucchini 2 tablespoons peanut oil 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped One 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated 1 medium green cl, seeded and finely chopped 1 medium red cl, seeded and finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon whole Sichuan peppercorns, plus more, cracked and toasted, for garnish, optional 2 whole dried red chiles, such as Arbol 1/2 cup light soy sauce 1/2 cup black rice vinegar 1/4 cup chili oil, plus more for garnish 3 zucchini, about 6-inches long, sliced lengthwise into thin strips with a vegetable peeler 1 pound fresh wheat-flour noodles, cooked according to package instructions and rinsed 1 small handful chopped fresh cilantro Toasted sesame oil, for garnish, optional Instructions: Heat a wok over medium-high heat until smoking. Pour in the peanut oil and swirl in the pan until hot. Stir-fry the garlic, ginger, and fresh green and red chiles until softened, about 1 minute, and then toss in the whole peppercorns and dried chiles and stir-fry briefly to toast. Pour in the soy sauce, rice vinegar and chili oil, reduce the heat to medium low and bring to a simmer.<br> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini and cook until crisp-tender and bright green, about 30 seconds. Drain the zucchini strips in a colander, shaking well to remove excess water, and then add to the wok along with the cooked noodles. Stir gently until warm and evenly dressed with the fragrant oil.<br> Transfer the noodles to a serving platter and garnish with cilantro, cracked toasted peppercorns, if using, and a drizzle of sesame oil, if using. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 29388,&quot;Four Fruit Pie Bars 1 (17.5 oz.) pkg. Pillsbury? Sugar Cookie Mix 1/2 cup Pillsbury BEST?

Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until it becomes foamy on top. Meanwhile, in a large bowl or the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix together the flour, kosher salt and remaining 1/4 cup sugar. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the oil and 4 of the eggs. When the yeast is foamy, add it to the dry mixture immediately followed by the egg mixture and stir to combine. Knead, either by hand on a floured surface or with a dough hook, adding more white flour as necessary (but resist any urge to add too much!), until you have a smooth and slightly sticky dough, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours. It will take slightly longer if you&#39;re using whole wheat flour. Alternatively, you can stick it in the refrigerator overnight and then let it sit at room temperature for about an hour before shaping. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Roll out each piece into a large strip, 1/2 to 1/4 inch thick and about 3 inches wide. Brush down each center with melted butter. Down the center, add the chopped onions and garlic. Roll each piece to seal in the onion mixture. Braid 3 of the pieces together, tucking the ends underneath to seal. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces to make a second loaf. Place on the lined baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Scrape into a small ramekin and refrigerate until ready to serve. For the lobster: Preheat grill over medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates. To kill the lobsters humanely, set each of them side by side on a board in front of you, claws facing towards the right. On top of the lobster shell, you&#39;ll see a cross shape just below the head. Stick the point of a sharp, heavy knife at the cross and push it through to the board. The lobster will be killed instantly. Afterwards, take the knife and slice down the middle of the lobster, lengthwise. Repeat with the second lobster. Look at the insides of the lobsters. Remove and discard what you see in the sac behind the eyes, then you will see the little pale-colored claws. Pull those from the shells, and discard them as well. Remove, and reserve the green stuff, which, despite appearances, is a delicacy called the tomalley, the lobster liver. Cook&#39;s Note: You&#39;ll need to saute the tomalley gently if you want to eat it, as it will simply burn on the barbecue or griddle. Treat similarly any coral sac you may find, as this is the lobster roe. Remove the claws as they cook since they coagulate at different rates compared to the rest of the lobster. Crack them open by hitting them with a sharp knife to help the heat penetrate the flesh. Place the lobster claws on the searing-hot grill, and cook for 6 minutes, then turn and add the lobster halves, cut-side down, to the grill. Cook the halves for 3 minutes, then turn them, and cook for another 2 minutes. The claws take another 6 minutes on their second side, so the pieces should be ready at the same time. If you are using a griddle, get your griddle pan as hot as possible, and paint the lobsters with oil before setting them in the pan. The cooking times will be the same. The lobster will turn from bluish-black to bright orange when cooked. Serve the finished product with lemon or lime wedges. For the prawns: Mix together the oil, vinegar, garlic, parsley, and adjust the seasonings with salt, and black pepper. Pull the heads from the prawns and remove the little legs. Cook&#39;s note: You can either discard these trimmings or use them to make fish stock. With a sharp knife, make a shallow cut down the back of each prawn and, with your finger or a cocktail stick, discard the black vein. Add the tails to the oil and vinegar mixture, cover, and leave them to marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. Meanwhile, if you intend to cook the prawns on wooden skewers, soak the skewers in cold water while the prawns marinate to prevent the skewers from burning on the grill. Preheat the broiler or preheat a griddle on medium-high heat. Remove the prawns from their marinade, and cook them either on the soaked wooden skewers on a very hot grill or under a hot broiler. Alternatively, grill them in a searing griddle pan. In either case, the prawns should cook for 3 minutes per side, and baste them with the marinade throughout the process. Serve the prawns or shrimp with lemon or lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 29452,&quot;Roasted Tapenade Crusted Salmon 7-ounce salmon filet Salt and pepper to taste 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup white wine 1 tablespoon Kalamata Olive Tapenade, recipe follows 3 ounces sauteed spinach 4 ounces Champagne Vinaigrette, recipe follows 1 chervil leaf for garnish 1/4 pound kalamata olives, pitted 2 garlic cloves 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt to taste 2 ounces chicken broth 2 ounces champagne vinegar 1 teaspoon dijon mustard 1 shallot, minced 1 garlic clove, minced 1-ounce olive oil 1 teaspoon honey 1-ounce salad oil Salt and white pepper to taste 1-ounce tomato concasse 1-ounce Italian parsley, finely chopped 1/4 ounce chervil, finely chopped 1/4 chives, finely chopped 1/4 ounce tarragon Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Cut off the bottoms and stems of the eggplants. Peel them using a vegetable peeler and slice them into 1/2-inch slices. In a heavy bottomed pan heat some olive oil and fry the eggplant slices for about 4 to 5 minutes (if you prefer a healthier version of the dish, you can grill the eggplants). Place the cooked slices on some paper towels to drain any excess oil. In a large bowl combine the butter, freshly grated Parmesan, and salt, to taste. Add the roughly shredded fresh basil leaves. Place the angel hair pasta or spaghetti into a pan of boiling water, bring back to the boil and cook until al dente. Drain. Add the cooked pasta into the big bowl with the butter mixture and combine. Take a small portion of the pasta and place it on top of an eggplant slice. Roll the eggplant around the pasta and place it in an oven-proof dish. Repeat this process with all the eggplants slices. Pour some pureed tomato sauce, or passata, over the eggplant rolls. Place slices of cacioavallo on the top. Finally cover the dish with more freshly grated Parmesan. Place the dish in oven for around 20 minutes, or until sauce is bubbly. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Priorat]&quot; 29455,&quot;Tarte Tatin 2 1/2 cups sugar 12 Granny Smith apples<br> One 1/2-pound sheet store-bought puff pastry, thawed<br> All-purpose flour, as needed for dusting 1 pint vanilla ice cream<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the sugar to a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Cook gently, swirling often until the sugar melts and becomes golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. Peel, core and halve the apples. Begin arranging the apple halves in a circular shape around the border of the skillet, standing them on the core ends. Fill the center part of the skillet with a smaller circle of the apples. Fill in any gaps with the smaller top and bottom pieces. Because the fruit will shrink considerably as it cooks, it is better to crowd the pan with fruit. Place the skillet back on the stovetop on a fairly high heat and cook until the fruit starts to become tender and soak up the caramel at the bottom, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat again and rotate each apple piece halfway so the tops of the fruit are now sitting in the caramel on the bottom. Return the skillet to the heat and cook for an additional 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. Roll the puff pastry dough on a lightly floured surface so it&#39;s larger than the skillet by 1 inch. Gently drape it over the skillet. Tuck the dough edges loosely inside the skillet so it covers the fruit (as if you are tucking the fruit into a pastry bed). Bake until bubbly around the edges, golden brown and delicious, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove and cool 5 to 10 minutes. Then, scoop and spoon onto plates. Serve with vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 29456,&quot;Bisquick Peach Cobbler 3/4 cup unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups baking mix, such as Bisquick Original Pancake and Baking Mix ? 1 1/2 cups milk, at room temperature 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar Three 15-ounce cans sliced peaches, drained Vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the butter in a 12-inch round cast-iron skillet or a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and place in the preheating oven to just melt the butter, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk the baking mix, milk, cinnamon and nutmeg together in a medium bowl. Toss the brown sugar and peaches together in a separate medium bowl and set aside. Remove the pan from the oven and swirl the butter or use a pastry brush to coat the bottom and sides of the pan, then pour the melted butter into the batter. Whisk until combined, then pour the batter into the buttered pan. Spoon the peaches and brown sugar syrup evenly over the top of the batter. Bake until golden brown and the peach juices are bubbling, 45 to 55 minutes.

Brush the apple slices with the vegetable oil. Lay the apples on the hot grill, and turn the slices over after achieving golden grill marks. Transfer the apple pieces to a baking dish. Melt the butter, brown sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a pan over medium heat, stirring until the brown sugar has dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat. Pour the glaze over the apples and bake until the slices have softened, approximately 10 minutes. In a separate bowl, sprinkle the sugar and remaining cinnamon over the whipped cream. Gently fold the cream to combine the flavors. Arrange the grilled apples on a dessert plate and dress them with a dollop of the spiced whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 29460,&quot;Thai Noodle Bowl with Chicken 1 tablespoon roasted peanut oil 2 tablespoons finely chopped peeled fresh ginger 1 large red onion, finely diced 1 pound ground chicken 2 teaspoons ground turmeric 2 teaspoons chili-garlic sauce (such as sambal oelek) Kosher salt 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1/2 bunch mustard greens, leaves torn 6 ounces rice vermicelli noodles 1/4 cup finely chopped pickled ginger Chopped salted peanuts and fresh cilantro, for topping Instructions: Heat the peanut oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the fresh ginger and all but 1/4 cup of the red onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add the ground chicken, turmeric, chili-garlic sauce and 1 teaspoon salt; cook, breaking up the meat, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water, the chicken broth and mustard greens (the pot will be very full, but the greens will wilt quickly). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the broth has reduced slightly and the greens are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil; remove from the heat and add the vermicelli noodles, stirring to separate them. Let the noodles soak until tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain, run under cold water and shake dry. Use kitchen shears to cut the noodles into smaller pieces. Divide the pickled ginger, noodles and chicken-broth mixture among bowls. Top with peanuts, cilantro and the reserved red onion; season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gewrztraminer, Riesling]&quot; 29461,&quot;Fresh Cucumber Carrot Salad 2 small or 1 large cucumber, peeled and seeded 2 carrots, grated 1 small or 1/2 large shallot, chopped 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 2 teaspoons Sriracha 1 teaspoon soy sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Halve and thinly slice the cucumber.

If your pan is not as deep, cut out smaller stars and make one less stripe. Make the blue stars: Lightly coat a 9-by-13-inch pan with cooking spray. Stir the blue gelatin, unflavored gelatin and 4 cups boiling water in a large bowl until dissolved. Pour into the pan. Refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours. Loosen the edges of the blue gelatin with a knife and turn out onto a cutting board. Cut out about 36 stars using a 2-inch star cutter. Refrigerate the stars until needed. Lightly coat a 9-inch-square, 2 1/4-inch-deep pan with cooking spray. Make the first red layer: Sprinkle 1 packet unflavored gelatin over 1/4 cup cold water in a bowl; let stand 1 minute. Add 1 cup boiling water and 1 box red gelatin. Stir to dissolve, pour into the square pan and refrigerate until just set, 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the white gelatin: Sprinkle the unflavored gelatin over 1/2 cup cold water in a bowl; let stand 1 minute. Combine the condensed milk and 1 cup boiling water in another bowl; stir in the gelatin. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup boiling water. Let cool 15 minutes. Remove the pan of red gelatin from the refrigerator. It should be just set but not completely firm so the layers will stick to each other. Pour 1 cup of the white gelatin onto the red layer. (Keep the remaining white gelatin at room temperature.) Immediately arrange the blue stars in the liquid white gelatin in 3 evenly spaced rows, pressing the stars against each other and leaving a 1-inch gap between the rows. Carefully transfer to the refrigerator and chill until the white layer is just set, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make another red layer (repeat Step 3). Let the red gelatin cool, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. Gently pour over the back of a spoon into the pan (this prevents damage to the layer below). Refrigerate until just set, 15 minutes. Add another white layer: Stir the remaining white gelatin until smooth. Gently pour 1 cup of the white gelatin over the back of a spoon onto the red layer; refrigerate until just set, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the third red layer (repeat Step 3). Let the gelatin cool, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. Gently pour over the back of a spoon onto the white layer. Refrigerate until just set, 15 minutes. Add the last white layer: Stir the remaining white gelatin until smooth. Pour over a spoon onto the red layer; chill until just set, 15 minutes. Make the final red layer (repeat Step 3); let cool, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes, then pour over a spoon onto the white layer. Chill until completely set. Loosen the edges of the gelatin with a knife and turn out onto a parchment-lined baking sheet; invert right-side up onto a cutting board. Trim the two opposite sides so the stars are visible. Slice between each row of stars to create 3 rectangles (use the stars to gauge where to cut). Cut each rectangle into pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29463,&quot;Fudgy Pretzel Brownies Crisco? Original No-Stick Cooking Spray 1 (19.5 oz.) pkg.

Season the inside of the chicken cavity with salt and pepper. Put the crushed garlic, chopped onion and dry herbs inside the cavity of the chicken. Using the twine, tie the legs closed. Use the olive oil to rub the entire outside of the chicken with an even coat of oil. Pick the herb from the stem and coarsely chop them before sprinkling the herb liberally and evenly on the chicken. Place the chicken into the preheated roasting pan and roast at 425 degrees for the first 45 minutes of roasting. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to roast for an additional 1 hour. Remove from the oven and pierce the thigh: if the juices run clear when pierced allow to rest on a platter for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. If the juices are still pink return to the oven for more roasting time. While the chicken is resting, place the roasting pan on top of the stove, remove any chicken fat with a spoon, and, over medium heat, deglaze the pan drippings with the chicken broth. Use a spoon to scrape up all the crusty bits (that&#39;s where the most concentrated flavor is) and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and strain the liquid into a gravy boat to pass at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29469,&quot;Collard Greens Bubble and Squeak 1 gallon chicken stock 3 cups apple juice<br> 1 cup small diced yellow onion 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning 6 slices hickory smoked bacon, diced<br> 4 heads collard greens, rinsed<br> 3 pounds peeled potatoes, medium dice 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 4 ounces unsalted butter<br> 1 tablespoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon white pepper 1/4 cup grapeseed or vegetable oil<br> Instructions: For the collards: Add the stock, apple juice, onions, Cajun seasoning, bacon and collard greens in a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 1 hour. Then remove from the heat and drain the liquid from the pot, and allow the collards to cool. For the potatoes: In a large pot bring 1 gallon of water to a boil, then add the potatoes and cook until softened, 15 to 18 minutes. Then drain. Press the potatoes, half of the flour and the butter through a food mill or ricer into a bowl. Next add the salt and white pepper, then blend with a whisk. Taste and add additional seasoning if needed. To create the cakes, blend the potatoes with the collards in a bowl. Portion into 6-ounce cakes, about 4-inch rounds. To cook, heat a pan over medium-high heat, then add the oil. Dust the cakes with some of the remaining flour. Place the cakes in the pan and cook until browned, 3 minutes.

Dust a work surface with flour, then flatten the cookie dough into a rectangle and roll to about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. (If the large piece dough is hard to work with, cut it into 2 equal pieces.) Use a 3 1/2-inch circle cutter to cut as many rounds as possible (you should get about 10). Transfer to a baking sheet. Use a 2 1/2-inch round cutter to cut the centers from the larger circles to make \O&#39;s. Using the bottom of a small gingerbread woman cutter (or other cutter with a flat base), cut the rolled center scraps into bases for the snow globes. Place the bases on the baking sheet touching the bottom of each \O\ (they will fuse together when they bake). Place the cut cookies in the freezer for 20 minutes. Pat the dough scraps into a disc and chill until you can roll again and cut out more cookies to make about 1 dozen snow globes. When ready to bake, transfer the frozen cookies to 2 room-temperature baking sheets lined with parchment paper, evenly spacing 5 cookies per sheet. Bake the cookies, rotating halfway through cooking time, until crisp and golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely. For the glass centers: Set up a workspace with your decorations and cooled cookies. (You will have to work fast once the glass syrup is made.) Transfer the cookies to clean pieces of parchment set on baking sheets. Stir together the sugar and corn syrup in a 2-cup or larger glass liquid measuring cup until it looks like wet sand. Microwave until the sugar is completely dissolved and is bubbling but still clear with no caramel color, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Stir and microwave 30 seconds more. (This will depend on the power of your microwave, you want the syrup to be bubbling rapidly, but before it begins to caramelize). Pour the syrup into the center of 2 or 3 cookies, letting it spread to fill the entire opening. Working quickly, while the syrup is still hot and has not yet begun to harden, sprinkle with the decorations of your choice. Continue, filling a few cookies at a time and reheating the syrup in the microwave for 5 to 10 seconds to keep it pourable, as necessary, until all of the glass centers have been poured. For the icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk to combine. With the mixer on low, add the lemon juice and 3 tablespoons water. Mix until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, and add about 1 to 3 tablespoons more water, a little at a time, to make an icing that drizzles slowly from a spoon dipped into the bowl. Increase speed to high and beat until the icing is very smooth, about 1 minute. Spoon half the icing into a pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip. (Alternatively, transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner.) Color the remaining icing in the bowl with red food coloring and transfer to another piping bag fitted with a small plain tip. Pipe the white icing on the top of the snow globes, leaving a little in the bag to decorate the glass, if desired. Pipe the red on the bases. If desired, use the remaining white icing to pipe small snowmen in the glass part of the snow globes. Let sit until the icing hardens, 20 to 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 29471,&quot;Crunchy Sweet Brussels Sprout Salad 1 pound Brussels sprouts 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1/2 cup dried cranberries Instructions: Shred the Brussels sprouts by removing the core and thinly slicing.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Place a wire rack on a sheet pan and set aside. For the zucchini fries: Add the milk and lemon juice to a bowl and mix. Add the cornstarch and salt to a separate bowl and mix. Place the zucchini batons first in the milk and then in the cornstarch and toss to coat. Carefully add the zucchini batons to the hot oil in 2 batches and fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes per batch. Remove to the prepared wire rack and sprinkle with sea salt. Keep warm in the oven while you make the fish goujons. For the fish goujons: Place 1/2 cup of the flour in a shallow dish, add 1 teaspoon of the salt and the pepper, then mix. Combine the cornstarch, baking powder, remaining 1 teaspoon salt and remaining 1 1/2 cups flour, then whisk together. Slowly add the brown ale and mix until just combined. Dredge the fish, one piece at a time, in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess, then dip into the batter, coating well. Lower the fish into the hot oil in 2 batches and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch, flipping halfway. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with sea salt. To serve, place the goujons on one end of a platter or board. Remove the fries from the oven and arrange on the other end. Place a ramekin of tartare sauce on the platter, then garnish with lemon wedges and the parsley to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 29516,&quot;Almond Tart with Raspberries 4 ounces/1 stick (110 grams) butter 4 ounces/generous 1/2 cup (110 grams) castor sugar 4 ounces/generous 1 cup (110 grams) ground almonds Fresh raspberries Red Currant Glaze, recipe follows 1/2 pint (300 milliliters/1 1/4 cups) whipped Jersey cream 12 ounces (350 grams) red currant jelly 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F /180 degrees C. Cream the butter well and then just stir in the sugar and ground almonds. (Don&#39;t over beat or the oil will come out of the ground almonds as it cooks.) Put a teaspoon of the mixture into 24 small patty tins, or divide between 2 by 7-inch sandwich tins. Bake until golden brown 10 to 30 minutes depending on the pans used. The tarts or tartlets are too soft to turn out immediately, so cool in the tins for about 5 minutes before turning out. Do not allow to set hard before removing to a wire rack or the butter will solidify and they will stick to the tins. If this happens pop the tins back into the oven for a few minutes so the butter melts and then they will come out easily. Just before serving, arrange whole raspberries on the base. Glaze with Red Currant Glaze and decorate with rosettes of Jersey cream. Melt the red currant jelly with the water in a small stainless steel saucepan. Stir gently, but do not whisk, or it will become cloudy. Cook it just for 1 to 2 minutes longer for the jelly to darken. Store any leftover glaze in an airtight jar and reheat gently to melt it before use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 29517,&quot;Coriander and Mustard Seed Crusted Salmon 1 cup panko breadcrumbs 1 tablespoon crushed mustard seeds 2 teaspoons cracked coriander seeds 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1/2 cup plain yogurt 1/4 cup sour cream 1/4 cup fresh watercress, minced 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh mint 1 teaspoon minced garlic Six 6 to 7-ounce salmon fillets, with skin 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil Fresh herbs, for garnish, optional Instructions: For the crust: In a bowl, blend the panko, mustard seeds, coriander seeds and parsley together. Season with salt and pepper.<br> For the wash: In a second bowl, blend the mustard with 1/2 cup water, whisking well to blend.<br> For the sauce: Whisk the yogurt, sour cream, watercress, vinegar, mint and garlic in a bowl. To ensure the spices are blended, scrape the sides and whisk a second time. Hold at room temperature if using within 30 minutes, or refrigerate for future usage.<br> For the salmon: Coat the salmon with the wash, and then finish the top side (skin side) with the crust. Repeat the process with each fillet.<br> In medium saute pan over medium heat, coat the bottom of the pan with the oil. When warmed, add the crusted side of the salmon to the pan and cook, in batches, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the fish and finish cooking until desired temperature. Remove from the pan.<br> Finally, sauce the plates with 2 ounces of the watercress/mint sauce. Top with the salmon and fresh herbs if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 29518,&quot;Swedish Meatballs with Gravy 2 slices white bread, without the crusts, torn into pieces 1/4 cup milk 3/4 pound ground beef 3/4 pound ground pork 1 small red onion, grated or very finely chopped 1 egg 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger Salt and freshly ground black pepper Butter and vegetable oil for frying meatballs 2 cups beef stock 2 tablespoons flour 1/4 cup heavy cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper Fresh parsley, for garnish Instructions: In a small bowl, soak the bread in the milk until soft. In a large bowl, combine all the meatball ingredients except the butter and oil, and add the soaked bread. Mix thoroughly until smooth, it&#39;s best to use your hands for this. Shape into small, golf-ball size meatballs (by dipping your hands in cold water, the meatballs won&#39;t stick to your hands.) Heat butter and oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs, about 8 to 10 at a time, and gently brown on all sides, about 5 to 7 minutes. Shake the skillet now and then so meatballs stay round and brown evenly. Place them on a heated baking pan in a low oven to keep warm. To make gravy, deglaze the skillet with 1 cup of the stock, letting it simmer for 5 minutes while scraping the bottom of the skillet with a spatula. Strain the gravy into a clean saucepan and add the remaining 1 cup of stock. In a small bowl, mix the flour with 1/4 cup of cold water until smooth. Whisk flour mixture into warm gravy, and let simmer, whisking constantly to prevent lumps, until thickened slightly, about 3-5 minutes. Add the cream and season with salt and pepper. To serve, arrange the meatballs on a serving platter, pour hot gravy over them, and garnish with parsley. Serve with boiled new potatoes, lingonberry sauce, and lefse. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29519,&quot;Chocolate Souffles 7 ounces finely chopped bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus for preparing the molds 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 large egg yolks 3 tablespoons warm water 1/2 cup sugar, plus 2 tablespoons 8 large egg whites, room temperature 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice Confectioners&#39; sugar for garnish Instructions: Brush 6 (6-ounce) ramekins with soft butter, then coat with sugar. Put the prepared ramekins in the freezer. (This can be done a day ahead.) Set an oven rack in lower third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Put the chocolate and butter in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Set aside. Combine the egg yolks and warm water in the bowl of a standing mixer or large bowl and beat until frothy. Gradually add 2 tablespoons sugar, and continue beating until ribbons form, about 5 minutes. Very lightly fold the yolks into the chocolate mixture. (Rinse the bowl well, if using for beating the egg whites.) Remove prepared ramekins from freezer. Put the egg whites in the bowl of a standing mixer, or large non-reactive bowl, add the lemon juice. Beat on medium until frothy; then gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and increase speed to high. Beat until the whites hold a stiff but not dry peak. Working quickly, fold about a third of the egg whites into the chocolate to lighten; then fold in remaining whites until blended. Gently ladle or spoon the souffle mixture into the ramekins, and place on a baking sheet. (Level off the surface with a straight edge, scraping any excess mixture back into the bowl.) Immediately bake until the souffle rises about 1 1/2 inches from the ramekins, and the tops are touched with brown, about 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 29520,&quot;Pork Crown Roast with Royal Glaze and Gravy 2 tablespoons grill seasoning 1 (7 to 8-pound) pork crown roast 2 1/2 cups chicken broth, divided 3 tablespoons spicy brown mustard 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 3/4 cup Canadian whiskey, divided (recommended: Crown Royal) 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 2 teaspoons chopped ginger 1/3 cup apple butter 1 bunch fresh parsley, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Sprinkle the grill seasoning over the roast, making sure it is thoroughly seasoned. Place the crown roast into a roasting pan, bone ends up. Roast, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes per pound of meat, about 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours, or when the internal temperature is 150 degrees F. Make sure to baste with any pan drippings every 20 minutes for the first 2 hours. For the last hour of cooking, baste with the royal glaze. Wrap the bone ends with aluminum foil if they begin to brown too quickly. While the roast is cooking, whisk together 1 cup chicken broth, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup whiskey, garlic, ginger, and apple butter in a saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Let simmer until thick and reduced by a third, 12 to 15 minutes. Brush the glaze onto the roast every 15 minutes for the last hour of cooking. Remove the roast from the oven, transfer to a serving platter, and let rest for 15 minutes before slicing. Garnish the platter with parsley. Place the roasting pan over medium heat and deglaze with the remaining 1/2 cup whiskey, scraping up the bits with a flat edged spoon. Add the remaining royal glaze, remaining 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, and let simmer until thickened and reduced by half. Pour into a gravy boat and serve with the roast. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Merlot]&quot; 29521,&quot;Yeast Rolls 1/2 cup sugar, plus a pinch 1/2 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees F) 2 packages active dry yeast 2 teaspoons salt 1/3 cup solid vegetable shortening 1 cup cold water 1 egg, well beaten 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons butter, melted Instructions: In a large bowl, add a pinch of sugar to the warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Stir to dissolve yeast. Beat in the remaining sugar, salt, shortening, cold water, and egg until well blended. On low speed, beat in 2 cups of flour and beat for 2 minutes. Beat in enough of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make soft dough. Place the dough in a well-greased bowl and turn to coat the dough. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down and refrigerate for 2 hours. The dough will almost double in bulk. Grease 2 (9-inch) cake pans. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Pull off pieces of the dough, about a 1/4 cup each and shape into 24 rolls. Place 12 rolls, sides touching in each of the 2 prepared pans. Brush with butter. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Bake the rolls until well browned on the top, about 15 minutes. Transfer the pan to wire racks to cool for 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29522,&quot;Mandarin Pancakes 3 cups (390 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 cup (120 grams) boiling water 1/2 cup (120 grams) cold water About 2 tablespoons (25 grams) neutral oil or sesame oil Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt and create a well in the middle. Add the boiling water, mix it in with a spatula, and then incorporate with your hands until you have a mealy shaggy mixture. Mix in the cold water and bring everything together into a dough. Turn it out onto a work surface and knead, adding additional flour if it gets too sticky to work with, until you have a smooth and slightly sticky dough, 7 to 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rest for 15 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces. Form them into balls and keep them covered when you\u2019re not working with them. Use your palms to smash 2 balls of dough into equally sized discs about 2-to-3-inches-wide. Brush the top of one disc with a thin layer of oil and stack the other disc on top of it to create one thick disc. Using a rolling pin, roll the disc into a 7-to-8-inch-wide pancake, dusting your work surface and rolling pin with flour if needed to prevent sticking. Place it in the dry skillet and cook for about a minute on each side, until splotchy with brown marks. Transfer to a plate and cover with a towel. Repeat with the remaining dough, stacking the cooked pancakes on top of one another and keeping them covered so that they steam. When they\u2019re cool enough to handle, peel the two halves of each pancake apart so that you have two very thin pancakes (NIFTY, HUH?!) and enjoy immediately while they&#39;re still warm. Leftovers that have cooled completely can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator for a few days. Reheat in the microwave covered by a damp paper towel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29523,&quot;Stuffed Yellow Squash with Stewed Tomatoes 3 medium yellow squash 4 ounces sweet butter 1/2 cup leeks, bottom part, chopped 1/2 cup onions, chopped 1 tablespoon parsley, chopped 1 teaspoon garlic, chopped 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional) 1 cup plain bread crumbs Salt and pepper to taste 1/4 cup water 3 medium vine ripened tomatoes 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup white onions, chopped 1 teaspoon garlic, chopped 1/2 cup celery, chopped 1/2 cup green peppers, chopped 3 teaspoons sugar 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped 1 bay leaf Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: SQUASH: Take 2 of the squash and cut lengthwise.

Refrigerate the egg yolk in a small bowl, covered, until ready to use. Pulse the flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, mustard, paprika and turmeric in a food processor to combine. Add the butter, Cheddar and Parmesan, and pulse until the butter is completely broken up. Pour in the egg white mixture, and pulse until the dough comes together in a ball. (It&#39;s OK if it&#39;s a little wet.) Transfer the dough to a large piece of plastic wrap, and pat it into a 1/2-inch-thick round. Wrap it up, and refrigerate to chill and firm up the dough, about 1 hour. Position 2 oven racks at the top and bottom third of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Roll the dough out on a large piece of parchment (to keep it from sticking to the counter) to about 1/8 inch thick. Cut shapes out with a 1 1/2-inch cookie cutter, and transfer the cutouts to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1/2 inch apart. Gather and reroll the scraps and cut out more crackers; repeat with any remaining scraps. (Dust the dough with flour if you find it too sticky.) Whisk 2 teaspoons water into the egg yolk. Brush the tops of each cracker with the mixture. Sprinkle each with some sesame seeds, poppy seeds and the tiniest pinch of salt. Bake 2 baking sheets of crackers at a time, until the crackers are deep golden brown on the bottom, about 20 minutes, rotating the sheets about halfway through. Let cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. Bake the remaining cutouts.

With the machine running, add the eggs, 1 at a time, allowing each to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once incorporated, slowly add the olive oil and continue blending until the mixture starts to form a ball. Remove the ball to a lightly floured work surface and knead it until it is smooth, about 10 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 1 hour. While the dough rests, make the filling. For the filling: Put the edamame, tofu, and truffle oil into the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Transfer this mixture into a large bowl and fold in the orange zest, mascarpone, crabmeat, and basil and season with salt and pepper, to taste Roll the pasta: Set the pasta roller on the widest setting. Start with half the pasta dough. Using your hands flatten the dough as much as you can to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Run the dough through the roller twice dusting it with flour in between rolls if it feels sticky. Fold it into thirds, turn it 90 degrees, and run it through the pasta machine 2 to 3 times. Continue to run the pasta through the machine, reducing the setting between each run, until you get to the second to last setting. Make the ravioli: Lay the pasta sheet on a floured work surface. With a 3-inch round cutter, cut out the ravioli circles. Spoon 1 teaspoon of filling into the center of each round. Lightly brush the edges with water, fold the circles over to form half moons, and press to seal the edges. Make sure you get out any air bubbles or your ravioli will explode when you cook them. Transfer them to a sheet tray coated with flour or semolina. Cover and set aside until you are ready to cook them. Make the sauce: In a medium saucepan over high heat, add the white wine, sherry, shallots, ginger, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and reduce until syrupy. Add the cream and cook until it is reduced slightly. Turn the heat to medium-low, remove the bay leaf, and whisk in the butter bit by bit, being careful not to let the sauce boil. When all the butter is incorporated, add the orange juice. Stir in the basil and keep warm. To serve: Cook the ravioli in a large pot of boiling salted water over medium-high heat. Drain. Arrange 2 or 3 ravioli on each pasta plate and drizzle with the Orange Beurre Blanc. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 29542,&quot;Raspberry-Almond Pie 2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, chilled, plus more for greasing tart pan 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dredging 1 cup almond flour 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 cup iced water, plus extra, as needed 1 stick unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, at room temperature One 7-ounce tube almond paste, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, at room temperature 3 large eggs, at room temperature, beaten 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons agave 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract 12 ounces (about 3 1/2 cups) fresh raspberries 1 egg, beaten Instructions: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Liberally butter the tart pan. For the crust: Pulse the all-purpose flour, almond flour and salt in a food processor. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture forms a coarse meal. With the food processor running, gradually add the iced water until the mixture forms a ball. Add extra water 1 teaspoon at a time, if the mixture is too thick. Form the dough into an 8-by-3-inch rectangle and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll the dough into a 14-by-10-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Place the dough in the tart pan and trim any excess dough from the top of the pan. Reserve the excess dough. Prick the dough all over, using the tines of a fork. Bake until the crust is light golden, about 15 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes. For the filling: Combine the butter, almond paste, eggs, flour, agave and almond extract in a food processor. Blend until smooth. Spread the filling evenly over the cooled crust, using a spatula. In a medium bowl, toss the raspberries and agave together until coated. Gently press the raspberries into the filling in a single layer. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the excess dough into an 8-inch circle, about 1/8-to-1/4-inch thick.

Arrange fruit in overlapping concentric rows, beginning at outside edge and working in towards the center. For a \fruit salad\ tart, toss fruit in a bowl with a drop of Kirsch (optional). Pile the fruit on the pastry cream. Edge the crust with the nuts and sprinkle on fruit at the edge of the tart. Either brush glaze on the fruit or sprinkle with confectioner&#39;s sugar. For the dough: Place flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse 3 or 4 times to mix. Add butter and pulse about 12 to 15 times until the mixture is reduced to a fine powder. Do not allow to become pasty. Add egg and liquid, and continue to pulse until the dough forms a ball. Remove dough from work bowl to a lightly floured work surface and pat into a 5-inch disk. Use immediately, or wrap in plastic and chill until firm before using. To make a free-form tart crust, roll dough to a 12-inch disk and transfer it to a parchment- or foil-lined cookie sheet, or the back of a jelly-roll pan. Using a plate or cardboard disk as a pattern, trim the dough to an even 12-inch diameter. Fold under 1/2-inch of dough along the edge of the dough, then flute the edge as if it were a pie, to make the edge stand up. Use the thumb and index finger of one hand on the outside of the tart shell and the index finger of the other hand on the inside and pinch gently from the outside while pressing lightly from the inside. Repeat all around the edge of the crust. Pierce the dough with a fork before baking. Place the dough on the middle rack of a preheated 400 degree oven. Lower temperature to 350 and bake for about 20 minutes. Remove the pan from oven and transfer to a rack to cool. For the Pastry Cream: Combine sugar, flour and salt in a 1 to 1 1/2-quart non-reactive saucepan. Stir with a small whisk to mix. Whisk in milk, then egg and yolk. Place over low heat, whisking constantly, until the pastry cream thickens and comes to a boil. Allow to boil 10 or 15 seconds, whisking constantly. Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla and butter. Scrape the pastry cream into a non-reactive bowl and press plastic wrap against the surface. Refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Stir in liqueur just before using pastry cream. For the glaze: In a small saucepan bring the preserves and water or liqueur to a simmer, stirring often. Strain into another pan and return to a boil. Allow to cool for 5 minutes. NOTE: If tart is mostly red fruit, use currant jelly and strawberry or raspberry preserves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29553,&quot;Rosemary Roasted Potatoes 3 pounds baby Yukon Gold potatoes 1/3 cup olive oil 4 teaspoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary (divided) Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

If the rabbit kidneys and heart are available, add the heart to the stock and reserve the kidney for later. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat so that the stock is simmering and skim any foam from the top. Simmer for 15 minutes, partially covered, then add the rabbit. Simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meat is tender. Don&#39;t allow the stock to come to a rolling boil, otherwise the rabbit will be tough. The different cuts of meat will take different times to cook, so test for doneness and when each joint is tender, remove it to a plate with tongs. When cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and cut it into large chunks. Discard the bones and set the rabbit meat aside on a plate. Strain the stock through a colander, pressing down on the all the vegetables to extract as much flavor as possible. Wash the pan and strain the stock back into it, this time through a strainer lined with a double thickness of slightly dampened cheesecloth. If necessary, add water to make the level of stock up to 8 cups. In a large heavy casserole, heat the lard over high heat. Add the orzo and cook, stirring constantly, until the pasta is golden, about 4 minutes. Add the paprika and the achiote paste mixture, mashing it well to break it up, and cook for 1 minute more. Reduce the heat to medium low, add the onion and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and salt and cook for 1 minute more, until the aroma of the garlic is released. If using the kidneys, coarsely chop and add them to the pan, then add the stock and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally all the way down to the corners of the pan to keep the orzo from sticking. Add the rabbit with all its accumulated juices, and the peas and cook for 5 minutes more. Taste for seasoning and serve, scattered with chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 29562,&quot;Striped Basstrami 1 1/2 pounds striped bass fillet, skinned 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons mustard seeds 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 1 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 lemons, juiced Instructions: Cut bass into 4 serving pieces.

Line a baking sheet with foil. Remove the leaves from the cauliflower, then trim the stem flush with the bottom of the head so the cauliflower sits flat on the prepared baking sheet. Rub the outside of each head with the cut garlic. Whisk together the oil, 3 tablespoons mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a small bowl. Put the cauliflower on the prepared baking sheet and brush the entire outside and inside with the mustard-oil mixture. Roast the cauliflower until nicely charred and tender (a long skewer inserted in the center of the cauliflower should pass through easily), 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let rest for a few minutes. Meanwhile, combine the parsley and Parmesan in a small bowl. Brush the outside of the roasted cauliflower heads all over with the remaining 1 tablespoon mustard and generously sprinkle with the Parmesan mixture. Cut the cauliflower into thick wedges and serve on plates with a sprinkle of salt, lemon wedges and any extra Parmesan mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 29565,&quot;Apple and Celery Slaw 4 stalks celery, julienned 2 green apples, julienned<br> 1 jalapeno, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced<br> 1/2 head green cabbage, thinly sliced<br> 1/2 head purple cabbage, thinly sliced 1/2 cup olive oil<br> 1/2 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 teaspoon white vinegar<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1/8 teaspoon salt<br> 1/8 teaspoon celery salt<br> 2 cups fresh cilantro leaves, barely chopped<br> Instructions: Combine the celery, apples, jalapeno and green and purple cabbage in a bowl.

Add the brown sugar, butter and 1 tablespoon water. Cook, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is bubbling. Add the apples, vanilla, salt, cinnamon and lemon juice. Mix together the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to create a slurry. Add the cornstarch mixture to the skillet and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender, about 5 minutes. Pour into a heatproof bowl and let cool completely. You can make this ahead of time and chill in the fridge a day or so in advance if needed. To make the pies, roll each biscuit into about a 5-inch circle that is about 1/8 inch thick. Spoon 2 generous tablespoons of the apple filling on each round of dough, just off center. Use your finger and run a little water around the edges to help them seal completely. Fold one half of each circle over onto the other half and seal in the apple filling, forcing out any air that you can. Press the edges together and crimp with a fork. Continue until they&#39;re all assembled. Heat the oil in a high-sided skillet over medium heat until it reaches 350 degrees F. Fry the pies 2 or 3 at a time for about 5 minutes, carefully turning them halfway through. Remove them to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. When all the pies are fried, sift the confectioners&#39; sugar over top. Serve with Cinnamon-Caramel Sauce or store-bought caramel sauce. Mix the brown sugar, half-and-half, butter and a pinch of salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, whisking gently, until it thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in the vanilla, cinnamon and a second pinch of salt and cook another minute to thicken further. Turn off the heat and allow to cool to room temperature before serving.

Snake the depositing end of the pump hose through the hole in the platter. Invert a bundt pan over the platter, snaking the hose up through the hole in the bundt. Cut a hole in the center of the tomato half, then insert the tomato cut-side up in the top of the hole in the bundt pan, pulling the hose up through the hole in the tomato and pushing down a bit on the tomato to snugly plug up the hole in the bundt pan with the tube inside. \Paint\ or \spackle\ the sides of the bundt pan with the cheese, using an offset spatula or rubber gloves. Then layer the chips on top of each other around the bundt, starting flat but angling as you go up, sticking them to the cheese. This creates a volcano look. For the decorations: Arrange your accoutrements however you like. I put a lot of diced tomatoes and beans around the top to make it look like a caldera. I also liked incorporating cilantro stems and broccoli florets at the base of the volcano, as they look like trees. For the cheese sauce: Turn a large slow cooker to low while you prepare the sauce on the stove. In a pot, combine the sodium citrate and 3 1/2 cups water over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, add the cheese in handfuls, whisking until incorporated before adding the next handful. Once all the cheese is incorporated and melty, add the sriracha and use an immersion blender to blend to a uniform consistency. Transfer the mixture to the preheated slow cooker. Place the receiving tube of the pump into the cheese sauce and slowly and carefully pump to create \lava.\ Note: The cheese sauce might splash, so use with caution and put in a safe location. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 29569,&quot;Thai Basil-Tomato Salad 2 tablespoons dijon mustard Juice of 1 lemon 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 4 large ripe tomatoes, mixed colors, 1 \ large dice 1 small red onion, 1/4\ dice 1 cup picked thai basil leaves Salt and black pepper to taste Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk together the dijon and juice.

Line container with tea towels and place all items inside. The recipe card should read as follows: To make your cinnamon-chocolate scones, start by preheating the oven to 375 degrees. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the dry ingredients. Grab a stick of butter from the refrigerator, cut it into pieces, and with the mixer running, and add the butter and mix until coarse and sandy. You should still be able to see small lumps of butter. Head back to the refrigerator and grab the milk. Measure out a cup and a quarter, then add it and mix until almost combined. Next, add the chocolate chunks and mix just to distribute them evenly through the dough. Do not overmix; there may still be some flour not mixed in. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough 10 times to bring it together and smooth it out. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough 1-inch thick. Using a the biscuit cutter, cut out circles. Using a spatula, transfer to an ungreased sheet pan. Knead the scraps together just until combined, then roll out again and continue cutting out circles until all the dough is used. Bake until light golden brown, about 15 minutes. When they&#39;re all done, serve with honey and jam.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the peaches, rhubarb, lime juice, triple sec, vanilla and 1/3 cup of the sugar. Unfold the puff pastry dough onto a floured work surface. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Using a round cutter or a 6-inch circular template, cut 4 circles into the dough and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Fold 1/2 inch of the dough over itself all around the edge of each circle, crimping it with your fingers to create a thin border. Using a fork, pierce the pastry dough all over. Using a slotted spoon to leave excess liquid behind, spoon some of the fruit mixture into the center of each circle. Using a pastry brush, brush each pastry edge with some of the remaining fruit liquid and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.

Over medium heat, stir the mixture until the sugar has dissolved, then increase the heat and bring the liquid to a boil. Regulate the heat so that the mixture is simmering, then cook for about 20 minutes, until it has reduced to about 1 1/4 cups. Set the syrup aside to cool. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the water, salt, anise seeds, and lard and bring to a boil. When the lard has melted and the liquid is boiling, remove from the heat and stir in the flour all at once. Return to the heat and continue stirring for a minute or 2 until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan. Again remove from the heat and add the eggs, beating well after each addition. The dough should be very soft and only just hold its shape. Lastly, mix the baking powder into the dough. In a large heavy skillet, heat about 1/2 inch of oil until it is smoking. Flour your hands well and break off a piece of dough. Roll it into a ball about 1 1/2-inches in diameter. Place the ball on your fingers and flatten to a cake about 3/4-inch thick. With your finger, push a large hole into the center of the dough. Make 3 more bunuelos and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes, turning over when one side is golden. While the first batch of bunuelos is frying, make 4 more and repeat until they are all cooked. You should have about 12 small bunuelos. Drain on paper towels until you have finished cooking them, then place 2 bunuelos in each of 6 warm bowls and drizzle the syrup over them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 29600,&quot;Caramelized Vidalia Onion and Potato Gratin with Fresh Sage 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 Vidalia (or other sweet variety) onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced on a mandoline Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage leaves 6 large Idaho potatoes, peeled and sliced thinly on a mandoline 2 cups heavy cream Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats; set aside. Pulse the confectioners&#39; sugar and almonds in a food processor until very finely ground. Working in batches, sift the mixture through a medium-mesh sieve into a large bowl. If you have more than 2 tablespoons of the mixture left in the sieve, return to the food processor and grind until powdery, then sift again. Repeat this process until only about 2 tablespoons are left in the sieve; discard. Rub a pinch of salt around a large bowl or the bowl of a mixer to absorb any oils, then wipe clean. Add the egg whites and another pinch of salt. Whisk with a mixer on medium speed until frothy, then gradually whisk in the superfine sugar. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and whisk until very soft peaks form, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the strawberry extract and food coloring and whisk until stiff peaks form, about 1 minute. Fold about one-third of the almond mixture into the egg whites until combined, then fold in the rest. The batter should fall off the spatula in thick ribbons and look slightly shiny. If the batter seems stiff, fold once or twice more, being careful not to overmix.<br> Transfer the batter to a piping bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. Holding the bag vertically and close to the prepared baking sheets, squeeze the bag until the batter spreads to a 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch round, flicking your wrist to the side as you finish to avoid leaving a point. Repeat to make about 24 rounds per baking sheet, about 1 1/2 inches apart. Firmly tap the baking sheets against the counter to release any air bubbles. Let sit at room temperature until the tops are slightly matte and no longer sticky, at least 45 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Make the filling: Bring the strawberries, honey and lemon juice to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally and smashing the berries, until thick and jammy, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool.<br> Bake the macarons, one pan at a time, until they are risen and firm, 18 to 24 minutes.

Place the brisket in a large disposable pan, add the marinade and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove the brisket from the marinade 1 hour before putting on the smoker. Prepare the ceramic cooker: Remove the grill grate and ceramic plate from the cooker. Add the hot hardwood charcoal and scatter the soaked wood chips over the top. Adjust the cooker to maintain a temperature of 225 to 250 degrees F. This temperature should be maintained throughout the entire smoke. Put on the ceramic plate. Put a pan with some of the apple juice on the plate, and then put on the grill grate. Sprinkle the brisket on both sides with salt and pepper. Place the brisket, fat-side up, on your smoker grate and close it up for the long smoke. Open your barbecue smoker every hour or two and spray the brisket liberally with apple juice to help keep the meat from drying out. Once the internal temperature reaches 165 to 170 degrees F on a meat thermometer, after about 7 hours at the lower temperature range, the meat starts to get tender. At this point, wrap the brisket in foil this little trick is a big help in getting the meat tender, especially for beginners. Continue to cook until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, 1 to 2 more hours. Remove and let rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Remove the foil from the brisket over a large pan or disposable pan and reserve the liquid. Slice or shred the brisket. Toss in the reserved liquid. To make the sandwiches: Split the rolls in half, oil the cut sides lightly, season with salt and pepper and grill, cut-side down, until lightly toasted. Spread some Horseradish Crema on the bun tops and bottoms. Top the bottoms with some of the meat, then some Caramelized Onion-Tomato Relish, then some lettuce. Top with the bun top and serve. Whisk together the crema, queso fresco and horseradish in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and slowly cook until caramelized, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the tomatoes and cook until they just begin to break down. Add the garlic and jalapeno and cook for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and a pinch of sugar and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the onions to a bowl and add the cilantro.

Reduce heat and simmer until ready to use. In a large heavy pot heat 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil over moderate heat. Small children can help by taking paper off butter, cutting 2 tablespoons with butter knife, and dropping it into the pot. Small children should be highly supervised over each step that involves any type of gadget or working near a heat source. Add half of the onions to the pot and cook until clear, about 5 to 8 minutes. If you have older children, they can begin wiping off the shiitake caps with a damp cloth, removing the stems, cutting off the end, slicing the stems lengthwise and then slicing the caps. Add the rice to the onions and stir to coat. Small children can do this well once they practice and learn a controlled stirring motion. \Slow and steady\ can be repeated until they get the hang of it. Add 1/3 cup white wine and stir until completely absorbed. Constant stirring will be required from here on out to make a good risotto. Have the children equipped with a long handled ladle and a deep oven mitt carefully dip the ladle into the broth and pour it into the rice. Stir continuously until the stock is absorbed. Repeat over and over using as much stock as necessary until the rice is cooked through but not mushy. The risotto should be creamy, slightly soupy but not watery. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet heat 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil until melted. Add the other half of the chopped onion and stir to coat. Have the children cut the red pepper with table knives into strips and then crosswise into small even squares. Add the diced pepper to the onion and stir to combine. Add the tomatoes and stir to combine. Add the shiitakes and cook until any liquid evaporates. Add the fresh seafood and cook until just done. Stir the sauteed seafood and vegetables into the pot of risotto. Grated Parmesan can be stirred into the risotto or served on top at the table.

Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to simmer at a low bubble, uncovered, until the chicken is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours (or longer if you have the time \u2014 up to 6 hours, topping off with more water if the stock dips below the chicken and veggies), skimming off any scum (there won\u2019t be much) and, if desired, some fat. While the stock simmers, make the noodle stars: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and nutmeg, add the eggs and water and mix to form a dough. Knead for 5 to 7 minutes, until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rest for 20 minutes. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thick, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, and cut out stars with a bite-size star-shaped cookie cutter (or other small cookie cutter). Dust the stars with flour so they don\u2019t stick together and set them aside on a sheet pan. Reroll the scraps and repeat to use up the rest of the dough. (You can also just use a knife to cut long skinny noodles.) Set aside. Strain the stock (3 1/2 to 4 1/2 quarts of stock), discarding all of the solids except for the chicken. Set the chicken aside to cool. Return the strained stock to the pot and bring it to a simmer. Add the chopped onion, sliced parsnip, sliced carrots, sliced celery, chopped parsley, chopped dill, noodles and 1 tablespoon salt. Cover and simmer until the vegetables and noodles are tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, pull the chicken off the bones and chop it into bite-size pieces. Season the chicken with salt and, when the vegetables and noodles are tender, add it to the soup along with the lemon zest and juice, nutmeg and ground black pepper. Taste and add more salt if needed. This is important: The amount of salt in a chicken soup can mean the difference between unappetizing chicken tea and the elixir of bubbe love that it should be. So don\u2019t skip this step, and don\u2019t rush it either. Taste your soup. If it doesn\u2019t make you smile reflexively, add more salt, about a 1/2 teaspoon of it, and give it a few good stirs so it can dissolve. Taste and repeat as needed until it tastes good. Garnish with fresh dill and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29614,&quot;Spring Green Risotto With Artichokes 1 1/2 tablespoons good olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 cups chopped leeks, white and light green parts (2 leeks) 1 cup chopped fennel 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice 2/3 cup dry white wine 4 to 5 cups simmering chicken (or vegetable) stock or preferably homemade 1 pound thin asparagus 10 ounces frozen peas, defrosted, or 1 1/2 cups shelled fresh peas 8 ounces frozen artichoke hearts, defrosted 1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest (2 lemons) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup mascarpone cheese, preferably Italian 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 3 tablespoons minced fresh chives, plus extra for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the leeks and fennel and saute for 5 to 7 minutes, until tender. Add the rice and stir for a minute to coat with the vegetables, oil, and butter. Add the white wine and simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until most of the wine has been absorbed. Add the chicken stock, 2 ladles at a time, stirring almost constantly and waiting for the stock to be absorbed before adding more. This process should take 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the asparagus diagonally in 1-inch lengths and discard the tough ends. Blanch in boiling salted water for 4 to 5 minutes, until al dente. Drain and cool immediately in ice water. (If using fresh peas, blanch them in boiling water for a few minutes until the starchiness is gone.) When the risotto has been cooking for 15 minutes, drain the asparagus and add it to the risotto with the peas, artichokes, lemon zest, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper. Continue cooking and adding stock, stirring almost constantly, until the rice is tender but still firm. When the risotto is done, turn off the heat and stir in the mascarpone, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice and chives. Serve hot with a sprinkling of chives and more Parmesan cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 29615,&quot;Huckleberry Pancakes 2 cups all-purpose flour 3 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup sugar 2 eggs 2 tablespoons oil 1 cup milk 4 ounces huckleberries, fresh or frozen, plus extra, for serving Whipped butter and maple syrup, as an accompaniment Instructions: Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl.

When it has bloomed, the mixture will bubble a bit. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. With the mixer running on low, drizzle in the olive oil and mix until combined. Pour in the yeast mixture and mix until a dough forms. Drizzle roughly 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium bowl and coat the sides of the bowl with it. This will prevent the dough from sticking. Tip the dough into the oiled bowl, form a ball with it and gently coat it lightly with the residual olive oil on the sides. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm place until roughly double in size, at least 1 hour. For the filling: Combine the cream cheese, Cheddar and ham in a large mixing bowl. Stir until well combined. Set aside. For the everything bagel seasoning: Mix together the sesame seeds, poppy seeds, sea salt, onion flakes, garlic flakes and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Add the honey and 10 cups water to a large pot and bring to a boil. Once the dough has risen, divide it into 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Lightly flour a work surface and use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a 4-inch circle roughly 1/4 inch thick. Top each circle with 3 tablespoons of the filling. Pull the dough up and around the filling, pinching the seam at the top. Make sure you fully encase the filling. Place the finished bombs seam-side down on a greased baking sheet. Add the bagel bombs to the boiling water in batches of 4; boil for 1 minute, flipping halfway through. Remove to a separate baking sheet and top each with a generous pinch of the everything bagel seasoning blend. Once all of the balls of dough have been boiled, transfer them to another greased baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Enjoy! Freezer Directions: Follow the steps above and allow the bagel bombs to cool completely after baking, roughly 45 minutes to 1 hour. Place in the freezer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove and individually wrap each bomb in foil. Return them to the freezer to fully freeze. When ready to eat, remove a bagel bomb (or more) from the freezer. Remove the foil and wrap the bomb in a paper towel. Microwave for 90 seconds or until cooked through. Allow it to sit for 1 minute before taking out of the microwave. Unwrap and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29618,&quot;Chilled Cucumber Soup with Shrimp 2 (17-ounce) containers Greek yogurt 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 3 hothouse cucumbers, unpeeled, seeded and chopped 3/4 cup chopped red onion 9 scallions, white and green parts, chopped 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill 3/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (6 lemons) 3/4 pound cooked large shrimp, halved Thin slices of lemon, halved, for garnish Fresh dill, for garnish Instructions: In a large mixing bowl, stir together the yogurt, half-and-half, cucumbers, red onion, scallions, salt, and pepper.

Cream the butter and both sugars on high speed in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light, about 2 minutes. Add the peanut butter and beat until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until incorporated. Beat in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture and beat on low until just combined. Divide the dough in half, form into 2 rectangles, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Cut a 12-inch peanut shape out of parchment to use as a template. Roll one piece of dough between two pieces of parchment to a rectangle a little bigger than the template. Remove the top piece of parchment and, using a pizza wheel or paring knife, cut the dough into a peanut shape. Reserve the dough scraps. Repeat with the remaining dough piece. Mold the scraps into a rectangle, wrap in plastic and chill along with the peanut shapes until firm, about 30 minutes. For the filling: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the peanut butter and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined. Slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar, about a 1/4 cup at a time, beating in between additions, until completely incorporated. To build the cookie: Roll out the chilled rectangle of dough scraps into a large rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Use a pizza wheel or sharp paring knife to cut long strips about 1/2-inch wide. Transfer the peanut-shaped pieces of dough on their pieces of parchment to 2 baking sheets. Lay the dough strips on top of one of the peanut-shaped pieces of dough in a crisscross, freeform pattern to mimic the lines on a peanut. Use a rolling pin to gently flatten and adhere the strips to the peanut. Bake the cookies until lightly golden around the edges and dry on top, about 30 minutes. Cool completely on the baking sheets on a wire rack. Turn over the cookie without lines so it sits flat-side up on a flat serving plate. Spread the filling evenly to the edges. Top with the second cookie, lined-side up. Use a serrated knife to cut into squares for serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29621,&quot;Ensenada Lobster Thermidor 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 onion, peeled and quartered 1 bay leaf 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns 1 lemon, quartered lengthwise 1/4 cup peeled garlic cloves 2 (1 to 1 1/2-pound) fresh whole lobsters Bowl with ice and cold water, big enough to fit lobsters 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon canola oil 1/4 cup Mexican chorizo 2 tablespoons diced red bell pepper, 1/4-inch diced 2 tablespoons roughly chopped garlic 1/4 cup flour 1 1/2 cups milk 1/4 cup white wine 2 teaspoons roughly chopped fresh tarragon 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs Instructions: Bring a large stock pot of water to a boil. Add the salt, onion, bay leaf, peppercorns, lemon, and garlic. Let simmer to infuse the water, about 5 minutes, and then add the lobster and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the lobster from the water and place in a bowl of ice water. When cool, remove the legs and set aside. Starting at the center of each lobster, cut in half lengthwise along the back, and clean out the tomalley, adding to the bowl with the legs. Remove the tail and claw meat and roughly chop. Save the legs, claw shells, and tomalley for another purpose, such as stock. Rinse the shells for serving. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a medium saute pan, add the butter, oil and chorizo and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the red bell pepper and garlic and saute until the garlic is cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour and cook until roux is blonde in color, 3 to 4 minutes more. Slowly stir in the milk and cook until thickened. Add the white wine, tarragon, Dijon, pepper, lemon juice and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Remove from the heat. Combine the lobster meat and sauce and fill the cleaned lobster shells with the mixture.

Press and stretch the pizza dough into a 10-by-14-inch rectangle on a floured piece of parchment; scatter the shallot on top. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and rub into the dough, gently pressing in the shallot; season with salt and pepper. Transfer the dough (on the parchment) onto the hot stone. Bake until the crust is golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the wine, 1 tablespoon olive oil and the garlic to a simmer in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the clams, cover and cook until they open, about 6 minutes; transfer to a cutting board using a slotted spoon. (Discard any unopened clams.) Continue simmering the liquid until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the clams from their shells and chop. Pulse the parsley with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the lemon zest in a mini food processor until chopped. Add the clam cooking liquid (with the garlic) and pulse until thickened. Spread the parsley sauce on the baked crust. Top with the clams and shrimp; lightly season with salt and pepper. Return to the oven until the shrimp is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Top with more parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 29636,&quot;Pineapple Upside-Down Cupcakes 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 2/3 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 2/3 cup milk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Pinch fine salt 1 large egg Filling: 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups chopped ripe pineapple (about 1/4-inch pieces) 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar Icing: 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 5 teaspoons fresh or canned pineapple juice 6 marachino cherries, halved, for garnish Pineapple wedges, for garnish Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line one 12-cup standard muffin tin with cupcake liners. Whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, milk, butter, vanilla, salt and egg in a medium bowl just until combined. Be careful not to over mix. Pour into the liners. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool on a rack 10 minutes, and then remove the cupcakes and cool on the rack completely. For the filling: Melt the butter in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the pineapple, sugar and salt and cook, stirring frequently, until caramelized and the liquid is mostly evaporated, 18 to 20 minutes. (You will be able to run your spoon through the filling and leave a streak behind that holds 1 to 2 seconds before filling back in. The consistency of the filling should be like caramel sauce.) Set aside to cool. For the icing: Melt the butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until dark golden and toasty smelling, about 4 minutes. Once you see the milk solids turning a medium brown color, turn off the heat. Cool to room temperature. Whisk in the confectioners&#39; sugar and pineapple juice to make it smooth but not too spreadable. To assemble: Using a melon baller, scoop out a hole in each cupcake large enough for 1 tablespoon of pineapple filling. Fill and press gently with the back of the spoon to level the filling. Spoon a teaspoon of icing over the hole to cover. Garnish the cupcakes as desired with cherries and pineapple. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 29637,&quot;Fried Chickpeas with Sage and Parmesan Two 14.5-ounce cans chickpeas Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 1/2 cup small- and medium-size fresh sage leaves<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan<br> Instructions: Rinse the chickpeas and drain them very well. Line a baking sheet with a couple layers of paper towels and turn the chickpeas out on top in a single layer.

In a second bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth, then whisk in the buttermilk and butter until combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix just until the batter comes together; there will be lumps. Cover and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Set a baking rack over baking sheet and place on the center rack. Preheat a waffle maker according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions and brush with melted butter. For each waffle, ladle about 1/3 cup of the batter onto the iron. Cover and cook until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes; the waffles will be a little misshapen--not perfectly square, with rounded corners. As you go, transfer the cooked waffles to the baking rack in the oven and hold there while you fry the chicken. For the fried chicken: While the waffle batter rests, place the chicken tenders in a resealable plastic bag. Add 1 cup of the buttermilk and the hot sauce, then seal the bag and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour. In a medium bowl, combine the flour with the garlic powder, onion powder, cl de arbol, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Transfer half of the flour mixture to a second bowl. In a third bowl, put the remaining 1 cup buttermilk.<br> Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat 2 inches of oil in a high-sided skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium heat until it registers 360 degrees on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, dredge the chicken in the first dish of seasoned flour, then dip in the buttermilk, letting excess drain off, and finally dredge in the second bowl of seasoned flour, tapping off excess. Fry until golden brown on both sides and just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt. To serve, put two waffles on each of four plates. Top them with three tenders and drizzle all with hot sauce, if desired, and honey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 29643,&quot;Pulled Pork and Kimchi Sandwich 5 pounds pork shoulder 1 cup/250 ml brown sugar 1 cup/250 ml sweet chili sauce 1 cup/250 ml molasses 1/2 cup/125ml soy sauce 1/2 cup/125ml rice vinegar 2 tablespoons/30ml minced peeled fresh ginger 1 clove garlic, minced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups/500ml grated mozzarella Chuck&#39;s Kimchi, recipe follows, for serving 8 thick slices egg bread 1/4 cup/60ml salt 1 large napa cabbage, cut into big chunks 1/4 cup/60ml rice flour or all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons/30ml sugar 1/2 cup/125ml red pepper powder 3 cloves garlic, minced One 1-inch piece (2 1/2cm) fresh ginger, peeled<br> 1 stalk lemongrass, tough parts discarded and inner stalk minced 1 onion, chopped 1/4 cup/60ml chopped fresh chives 1/4 cup/60ml fish sauce 2 tablespoons/30ml soy sauce 5 scallions, minced 2 to 3 large cucumbers, cubed Instructions: Soak the wood chips in water for 30 minutes, then transfer to the smoker. Smoke the pork for 2 hours according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Combine the brown sugar, chili sauce, molasses, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger and garlic in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper and whisk until combined. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and sear the pork on all sides. Pour half the molasses mixture over the pork. Cover and cook in the oven until the meat is so tender it falls off the bone, about 6 hours. Let rest for 30 minutes. Remove the pork from the skillet and use a fork to pull and shred the meat (it will come off in threads). Set aside. Skim the fat from the surface of the braising liquid. Pour the remaining molasses mixture into the skillet and cook over medium-high heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pile the pork, cheese, a drizzle of the sauce, some kimchi and more cheese between the bread slices to make 4 sandwiches. Grill in a panini press. Cook&#39;s Note: If you don&#39;t have a smoker, you can skip that step or smoke the pork in a covered grill. Dissolve the salt in 12 cups (3 liters) cold water. Add the cabbage and refrigerate for 4 hours. Rinse the cabbage thoroughly under cold running water at least 3 times. Pat dry. Bring 1 1/2 cups (375ml) water to a simmer in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk for 3 minutes. Add the sugar and continue to cook, whisking, for 1 minute more. Pulse the red pepper powder, garlic, ginger, lemongrass and onion in a food processor. Add the flour mixture and pulse to combine. Set the kimchi paste aside. Combine the brined cabbage, chives, fish sauce, soy sauce, scallions and cucumbers in a large bowl. Stir in the kimchi paste. Refrigerate until ready to use. You can eat it fresh, right after making it, or wait 24 hours until it has fermented.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a small saute pan until very hot, add the capers, and cook for 30 to 60 seconds, until they start to pop and are a little crisp. Serve the swordfish hot with the lemon wedges, frizzled capers, and the reserved Caesar sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29652,&quot;Sweet Potato Lasagna 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 small onion, diced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes<br> Two 10-ounce boxes frozen chopped spinach, defrosted 1 pound mozzarella, grated<br> 2 pounds ricotta cheese<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg<br> 2 large eggs, lightly beaten<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 pounds sweet potatoes (about 3 large)<br> Instructions: For the tomato sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and mash into a chunky puree using a potato masher. Bring to a simmer and partially cover the pan with a lid. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 30 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat. For the lasagna: While the sauce is cooking, drain the water from the spinach, place in a clean kitchen towel and wring well to remove any excess water. Break up the spinach into a large bowl. Set aside 1 cup of the mozzarella, then add the remaining mozzarella to the bowl with the spinach. Add the ricotta, Parmesan, nutmeg, eggs, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and mix with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until well combined.<br> Peel the sweet potatoes and trim a small bit from one of the longer ends on each so they will sit flat and not roll. Cut the potatoes lengthwise into 1/4-inch planks.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> To assemble the lasagna: Add about 3/4 cup of sauce to the bottom of a deep 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Place a single layer of sweet potato slices along the bottom. Top with one-quarter of the ricotta and spinach mixture and use an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread gently into an even layer. Dollop about 3/4 cup of sauce on top of the ricotta mixture. Top with another layer of sweet potato slices facing the opposite direction from the previous layer. Repeat with ricotta mixture and sauce until you have 4 layers, ending with the remaining sauce.<br> Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil, top with the reserved mozzarella and bake until the lasagna is bubbling, the mozzarella is starting to brown and the sweet potatoes are tender when a paring knife is inserted into the center, an additional 45 to 60 minutes. Let sit for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 29653,&quot;Grilled Ratatouille Salad 1 small eggplant Kosher salt 3 medium tomatoes 1 medium zucchini 1 medium red bell pepper 1 small red onion 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced Instructions: Slice the eggplant into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Soak in a bowl of lightly salted water, 15 to 20 minutes; drain and squeeze out the excess moisture. Meanwhile, slice the tomatoes and zucchini into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Stem and seed the bell pepper; slice the pepper and onion into 1/2-inch-thick rings. Heat a grill or grill pan to medium high. Brush the vegetables with the olive oil on both sides and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Grill the vegetables (in batches if necessary), turning, until soft and marked, about 6 minutes for the tomatoes, 7 to 8 minutes for the bell pepper, onion and zucchini, and about 10 minutes for the eggplant. Let cool. Drizzle the vegetables with the vinegar. Divide the zucchini and eggplant among plates and arrange in a circle, overlapping slightly. Top with the bell pepper, tomato and onion. Sprinkle with the basil.

Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and keep nearby. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, onion, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat, until the mushroom mixture is very tender, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the turkey, cream cheese, and Cheddar until well blended. Place 1 sheet of phyllo with the short side facing you on a work surface. (Cover remaining phyllo with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.) Spray the phyllo sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Then fold it in half lengthwise and spray again. Place 1 heaping tablespoon filling in the center of the bottom end of the phyllo. Fold in the sides, then roll up from the bottom to completely enclose the filling (it should look like an egg roll). Place the roll, seam-side down, on the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets, nonstick cooking spray, and filling to make a total of 16 rolls. Spray the rolls generously with nonstick cooking spray and bake until the rolls until lightly golden, about 20 minutes. Food Network Kitchens created this lightened-up recipe from a user submission.

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Set aside. In a larger bowl, whisk the sugar, vanilla, butter and eggs until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture in three batches to make a soft dough. Add your stir-ins and mix until combined. Using a medium ice cream scoop (it should hold about 3 tablespoons of dough), scoop the dough onto the baking sheets, about 3 inches apart, and gently flatten the tops. Bake until the edges are just set, 11 to 13 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time. Cool on the trays for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Cool the baking sheets and reline with new parchment. Bake the remaining cookies. Once the cookies are cooled, scoop 1/2 cup of ice cream onto the bottom of half of the cookies and top each with another cookie. Eat. Store any leftover cookies in a resealable plastic bag or container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 29658,&quot;Kung Pao Snow Peas 1 tablespoon peanut or grapeseed oil 1/2 large sweet onion, such as Vidalia or Maui, thickly sliced 8 ounces snow peas, ends trimmed (about 4 cups) 1/4 cup bottled all-natural kung pao, shiitake soy ginger or other low-sodium stir-fry sauce 2 tablespoons chopped unsalted roasted peanuts or cashews Instructions: Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat and add the oil.

Add the egg and stir to combine.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, yeast, salt and 3 tablespoons of the granulated sugar. Add the milk mixture and mix until just combined. Switch to the dough hook and knead the dough on low speed until it is smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. (You could also do all of this by hand.) Form the dough into a ball and transfer it to a buttered bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to double, about 1 hour. Butter a 12-cup nonstick muffin tin (the cups and the top) really well.<br> On a very lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to about a 12-by-15-inch rectangle. Toss the blueberries with the cornstarch. Sprinkle the dough with the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar, then sprinkle with the blueberry mixture. Roll the dough up into a tight coil, then cut into 12 equal pieces. Set a piece of dough cut-side up into each cup in the muffin tin. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge overnight.<br> About 3 hours before you want to eat, take the buns out of the refrigerator. Let stand until doubled in size, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Bake the buns until golden brown and set, 20 to 24 minutes. Transfer the muffin tin to a rack to cool for about 10 minutes, then use a small offset spatula to loosen and lift the buns out of the tin.

Place both duck breasts in a saute pan large enough to accommodate without crowding. Bring the pan to a medium-low heat to render the fat from the duck. Periodically remove the fat as a lot of it begins accumulate in the saute pan. This is a low and slow process, about 20 to 25 minutes. Once the fat has rendered and the duck skin is crispy and brown, once again remove the excess fat from the pan. Turn the heat up to medium-high and flip the duck to sear the bottom. Once the bottom is brown turn the duck so skin side is down. Add the pomegranate molasses and thyme to the pan. Cook until the molasses starts to get thick and syrupy. Turn the duck over for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the duck from the pan and let rest for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the thyme bundle and add the pomegranate seeds. If the mixture is very thick add a few drops of water to loosen things up. Once the duck has rested, slice it on the bias and serve drizzled with the reduced molasses and seeds. Just Ducky!!

In a small bowl, make a paste with garlic, shallots, salt, pepper and enough of the canola oil to bind the paste (about 1/4 cup). Place the beef in a roasting pan and rub paste onto meat. Roast in oven for about 1 1/2 hours, or until an instant-read thermometer registers an internal temperature of 120 degrees F. (Arrange the oven racks so you will have room for the potatoes and asparagus to follow.) While roast is in oven, prepare demi-glace by melting the butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan and sauteing the onion until tender. Whisk in flour with a fork to make a roux, then add red wine and veal stock. Let simmer over medium heat for about 1 hour, until reduced by 1/3, stirring occasionally. In a large bowl, coat potatoes with about 1/2 cup of the remaining canola oil and toss with salt, pepper, fresh thyme, and fresh rosemary. When the roast has been cooking for about 1 hour, place the potatoes in a baking pan and put into the oven. Place the asparagus in a single layer on another baking pan. When the potatoes have been roasting for 30 minutes, drain the oil and herbs from the potatoes and pour over the asparagus. Remove the roast, if done, and allow to rest for about 15 minutes. Return the potatoes to the oven, along with the asparagus. Roast the vegetables until tender, about another 15 minutes while the rib roast is resting. To finish the demi-glace, whisk butter into the warm reduction until combined. Slice the rib roast and arrange on a large platter. Arrange the potatoes and asparagus around the meat, drizzling demi-glace sauce on the meat. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 29668,&quot;Buttermilk Biscuits with Sausage Gravy 1 3/4 cups Southern all-purpose flour, such as White Lily, or cake flour (not self-rising), plus more for rolling out 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into bits and chilled 3/4 to 1 cup lowfat buttermilk 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 1/4 pounds lean pork, chicken or turkey sausage, casings removed Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 sweet onion, finely chopped 2 cups 2-percent or whole milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.<br> In a bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of the all-purpose flour, the whole wheat pastry flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Using a pastry cutter or two knives, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Combine the buttermilk and 1 tablespoon of the oil. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture and gently mix until just combined.<br> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead lightly using the heel of your hand to compress and push the dough away from you, and then fold it back over itself. Give the dough a small turn and repeat eight or so times. (It&#39;s not yeast bread; you want to just barely activate the gluten, not overwork it.) Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out 1/2 inch thick. Cut out rounds of dough with a 1 1/2-inch round cutter dipped in flour; press the cutter straight down without twisting so the biscuits will rise evenly when baked.<br> Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Using a wooden spoon, break up the meat into small pieces. Cook until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour off any excess rendered fat. Add the onions and cook until clear and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup all-purpose flour and stir to combine and coat. Add the milk and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to simmer. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 5 minutes.

Serve with a crisp romaine salad and whole-grain bread.</li></ul><ol><li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms, celery, carrots and shallots and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add flour, salt and pepper and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more.</li><li>Add broth and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Add rice and reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until the rice is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in turkey (or chicken), sour cream and parsley and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes more. TIP: Ingredient note: Quick-cooking or instant wild rice has been parboiled to reduce the cooking time. Conventional wild rice takes 40 to 50 minutes to cook. Be sure to check the cooking directions when selecting your rice-some brands labeled \quick\ take about 30 minutes to cook. If you can&#39;t find the quick-cooking variety, just add cooked conventional wild rice along with the turkey at the end of Step 2. Tip: To poach chicken breasts, place boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a medium skillet or saucepan. Add lightly salted water to cover and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer gently until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 12 minutes. From www.eatingwell.com with permission. 2009 Eating Well Inc.

Slice the potatoes and celeriac into disks just under 1-inch thick. Place the slices into a large pan, cover with cold water, season with salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Simmer for 5 minutes, then drain in a colander and allow the vegetables to steam dry for a minute or so. Put back into the pan with the cream, chopped garlic, sage, half the Parmesan and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Mix together, then tip into the buttered baking dish and spread out evenly. Pour any mixture left in the pan over the top. Sprinkle over the remaining Parmesan, cover tightly with aluminum foil and cook in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes until golden brown. Combing the juniper berries and rosemary, add a pinch of salt and pepper, then sprinkle over a board. Rub the venison all over with olive oil before rolling it across the board and pressing it into the flavorings. Heat an ovenproof frying pan over a high heat and add a glug of olive oil. Sear the venison for a couple of minutes on all sides, then remove the pan from the heat. Add the smashed garlic bulb and any leftover flavorings from the chopping board. Shake everything together, pour in a splash of water to cool things down and place in the oven. Cook according to your liking - about 8 minutes will give you medium venison. When the potatoes are cooked, take them out of the oven, remove the foil and sprinkle over the remaining Parmesan. Return the dish to the oven, uncovered, and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes until bubbling and golden. Take the venison out of the oven and let it rest on a plate, covered loosely with foil.

Save 1 tablespoon of the rub for sauce. Rub the rest of the mixture vigorously into the pork. Wrap the pork and refrigerate for 24 h Place vinegar, sugar, jalapeno and dry rub mixture into a medium saucepan over medium hot heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Preparation: Using only one side of the grill, build a fire with 6 to 10 pounds of charcoal. You will control the heat of the fire by restricting the air flow. Add presoaked hickory chips on the charcoal and smoke should develop. Place the pork butt on the opposite side of the grill as the fire and close the lid. Shut down all air flow possible and maintain a temperature of 225 to 250 degrees for 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours; or until the internal temperature of the meat reaches 180 degrees--this is the hard part of barbequing. Remove the pork from the grill and wrap it in heavy duty foil. Let it sit covered in foil for 30 minutes. Unwrap the pork and remove the skin and excess fat. Tear the pork into shreds with forks or your fingers. Place the shredded pork in a bowl and toss with the sauce. Pile the pork high on a bun and serve wit Wash all the potatoes. Cut the yams into quarters. Wrap the potatoes in foil. Place all the potatoes in the foil in a single layer on the grill and roast for 1/2 hour. Remove the potatoes from the grill and allow to cool. Cut the red, Yukon gold and 1/2 of the yams into 1/2-inch pieces. Take the remaining pound of yams and remove the skin. Blend the skinless yams, mustard, mayonnaise, lemon juice and celery seed until smooth. Fold in the scallions and cut potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.

Bring to a boil and reduce the heat. Simmer gently, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the port and bring back up to the boil. Immediately reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, drain the prunes, coarsely chop, and set them aside. Reserve the liquid. In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Saute the pine nuts, stirring frequently for 1 or 2 minutes, until golden. Add the prunes and the remaining 1/4 cup of port to the pan. Continue cooking and stirring until the liquid is reduced to a glaze. Stir in the salt and pepper and cool to room temperature. Cut horizontally into the edges of the pork chops almost to the bones to create a pocket for the stuffing. Stuff the chops loosely (if there is leftover stuffing reserve it for the sauce). Secure the edges of each chop with 2 toothpicks. Season the chops generously with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350 and place a roasting pan in it to heat it up. Heat a large, heavy and well-seasoned skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Sear the chops for about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Transfer the chops to the pan in the oven and finish cooking them for about 20 minutes, until the chops are done through. Meanwhile, add the oil to the skillet which you used to sear the pork. Over medium-low heat, saute the shallots for 6 to 8 minutes, until translucent. Add the port, beef broth, and the reserved prune-cooking liquid to the pan and, if there was any filling leftover after stuffing the chops, add it now. Increase the heat to high and reduce the liquid, uncovered, until it is thickened and saucy, stirring frequently. Stir in the butter and lemon juice until the butter is completely absorbed. Serve the chops immediately, spooning the sauce over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 29707,&quot;Jamaican Curry Chicken and Potatoes with Scotch Bonnet Hot Peppers 4 tablespoons olive oil 1 yellow onion, chopped 1 teaspoon freshly minced ginger 1 small Scotch Bonnet pepper, minced (do not touch face or eyes after handling; immediately wash hands) 1/2 stick butter 2 tablespoons Jamaican curry 1 1/2 pounds chicken, chopped into 1-inch pieces 2 large russet potatoes, chopped One 16-ounce can coconut milk 8 ounces chicken stock Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium-size saucepot at a medium heat.

Toss the tomatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Spread the tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until softened, about 20 minutes. Return to the bowl and stir with a wooden spoon to break up the tomatoes and make a chunky sauce. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain. While the pasta is cooking, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, about 3 minutes; add to the bowl with the tomatoes. Add the pasta to the tomato mixture and toss, adding enough of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen the sauce. Stir in the oregano and season with salt and pepper. Top each serving with the burrata, basil, a drizzle of olive oil and a few grinds of pepper. Cook&#39;s Note: Burrata is fresh mozzarella that&#39;s filled with cream and curds, so it oozes when cut.

Spray two 8-inch round cake pans and one 9-inch bundt pan with flour-based baking spray. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Add the eggs, oil, buttermilk, food coloring, vanilla and vinegar to the flour mixture. Beat the mixture on low speed until partially combined, then increase to medium speed. Beat until well blended, about 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula and beat again for 1 minute. Pour the batter into both round cake pans to three-quarters full; fill the bundt pan with the remaining batter (the remaining batter will fill the bundt pan about one-third full).<br> Bake the bundt cake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick tester comes out clean. Bake the round cakes for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick tester comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn the cakes out on a wire rack to cool completely.

Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Increase to medium high until stiff peaks are formed. Continue beating at medium-high speed until the mixture is fluffy and has cooled (the mixing bowl should feel cool to the touch), 5 to 7 minutes.<br> Turn the mixer off and switch from the whisk attachment to the paddle attachment. Turn the mixer on medium low and add the butter, a few cubes at a time, beating until well incorporated before the next addition, 3 to 4 minutes. The mixture will deflate considerably, which is normal; keep mixing and adding butter. When all of the butter is added, beat until thick and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in the almond extract.<br> For the green American buttercream: In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, mix together the butter and confectioners\u2019 sugar. Begin on low speed until crumbly, then increase to medium high, slowly adding milk or cream to thin. Add the vanilla extract and beat on high for 3 minutes.<br> Divide the American buttercream into 2 bowls. Tint one bowl with the leaf green food color and the other with the neon green food color. Add coloring a little at a time while mixing to achieve bright green hues. Fit a disposable piping bag with a large open star piping tip, one bag with a large closed star piping tip, one bag with a 1/2-inch round piping tip and one bag with a small open star piping tip. Divide the leaf green icing among the piping bags fitted with the large closed star tip, the 1/2-inch round tip and the small open star tip. Fill the remaining bag, with the large open star tip, with the neon green buttercream (you may have extra neon green buttercream).<br> Assemble the cake: Level all of the round cake layers using a serrated knife or cake leveler. Place a red velvet cake layer on an 8-inch cake board. Cover with a thin layer of the Swiss meringue buttercream. Top with a dark chocolate cake layer and repeat with the buttercream. Alternate the round cake layers and buttercream, ending with the dark chocolate layer on top. Frost the entire cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.<br> Frost the entire cake with a second layer of the Swiss meringue buttercream. Smooth the top and sides using a bench scraper or cake leveler. Refrigerate while you make the decorative elements.<br> For the decorations: To make the star decors, place the yellow melted candy in a disposable piping bag and fill the cavities of a 1/2-inch multi-cavity star candy mold. Refrigerate until set, about 20 minutes. Turn the mold over to unmold the stars. For the bow dcor, place the red melted candy in a disposable piping bag and fill the cavity of a 3-inch bow motif candy mold with the candy. Refrigerate until set, about 20 minutes. Gently turn the candy out of the mold.<br> For the gingerbread men, knead the marzipan with the unsweetened cocoa powder in a small bowl.

Roast the fruit and vegetables until caramelized, about 25 minutes. Using tongs, pull the skin off the peach halves and discard. Arrange 2 peach halves on each serving dish, cut side up, on a bed of the roasted vegetables. Note: If freestone peaches are not available, split the peaches leaving the pits intact; they can be removed easily after roasting. &quot;,&quot;[Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 29719,&quot;Marinated Beets with Charred Onion Crema 8 small beets (1 1/2 inches in diameter), in assorted colors 1 cup olive oil<br> 1/2 cup sherry vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Pickled Shallots, recipe follows 1/3 cup Charred Onion Crema, recipe follows 1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs, such as chives, cilantro, scallions 1/2 cup Harissa Breadcrumbs, recipe follows 1 large shallot 1 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1/2 cup beet juice<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 small white onion 1 cup Mexican-style crema<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 small sourdough boule 1 cup olive oil<br> 3 cloves garlic, finely minced<br> 1 teaspoon harissa paste<br> Kosher salt<br> Instructions: Scrub the beets to remove any residual dirt and trim the tops and tails but leave the skin on. Cut in half and place in a medium pot, then add water to cover by at least 1 inch. Place the pot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer the beets until fully tender, testing by piercing to the center of the largest beet with the tip of a paring knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the beets, and while they are still warm to the touch, use your not-favorite kitchen towel to rub off the skins. Cut the beets into wedges, taking care to keep the like-colored beets together, but separate from the other colors. Whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, mustard and honey in a medium bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste and whisk again to combine. Add the Pickled Shallots and the beets and marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Dollop spoonfuls of the Charred Onion Crema on the bottom of a serving platter. Top with the beets, herbs and Harissa Breadcrumbs. Cut the shallot into 1/8-inch rings and place in a medium metal bowl. Separate the layered rings with your fingers and try to keep the rings as whole as possible. Combine the apple cider vinegar, beet juice, sugar, salt and a few turns of pepper in a small pot. Whisk the mixture and bring to a boil over high heat. Whisk one more time to make sure everything is fully combined. Remove the pot from the heat and pour over the prepared shallot rings. Stir the rings to make sure they are fully covered. Allow the shallots to cool naturally, 20 to 30 minutes. Cut the onion into 1/2-inch slices or wheels. Place the onion wheels in a dry cast-iron pan set over medium heat. Allow the onions to char deeply on one side, 10 to 15 minutes, then flip them over and char the other side, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the onions to cool slightly. Place the onions in the bowl of a high-powered blender and pulse a few times to break them up and release any remaining steam. Let the onions cool down for another few minutes, then add the crema to the blender. Blend the onions and crema, then season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Peel the outer crust off the boule. Cut the remaining bread into 1- to 2-inch cubes. Place the cubes in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until you have small and consistent breadcrumbs. Pour the olive oil into a medium saute pan set over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until it becomes fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the harissa paste. Whisk in the harissa paste until it is dispersed throughout the oil. Place the untoasted breadcrumbs in a large bowl and drizzle the garlic and harissa oil over the top, stirring and flipping the breadcrumbs to ensure even coverage. Lay the coated crumbs on a sheet tray and bake until crispy and golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the toasted crumbs and scrape onto a paper-towel lined sheet tray to drain any excess oil. Season with salt while the crumbs are still warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29720,&quot;Just-Add-Water Instant Grits with Coconut and Cherries 1/3 cup instant grits 2 tablespoons coconut milk 2 tablespoons dried cherries 2 teaspoons pistachios, roughly chopped 1 1/2 teaspoons light brown sugar Pinch ground cardamom Pinch ground ginger Instructions: Put the grits, coconut milk, cherries, pistachios, brown sugar, cardamom and ginger in the container.

Grease and flour three 6-inch round cake pans. Whisk together the sour cream, buttermilk, vanilla extract, almond extract and eggs in a small bowl until well blended; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl if using a hand mixer), add the cake flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix on low speed to combine, 30 seconds. With the mixer on medium speed, slowly add the butter a few pieces at a time. Beat until the dry ingredients are crumbly and moistened by the butter, about 1 minute. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Gradually add half of the egg mixture to the flour-butter mixture and beat on medium speed until the batter is thick and fluffy, 1 1/2 minutes. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the remaining egg mixture in 2 additions, scraping the bowl and beating for 20 seconds after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and sharply tap the pans once on the counter to remove air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely on the rack. For the tiramisu syrup: Bring the sugar, water and espresso powder to a boil in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and stir in the coffee liqueur. For the Tiramisu Filling: In a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large mixing bowl if using a hand mixer), add the mascarpone, confectioners&#39; sugar, coffee liqueur and vanilla extract. Mix on medium speed until well blended. In a separate bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or a large mixing bowl if using a hand mixer), add the whipping cream and whisk until stiff peaks form. (Do not over-whisk.) Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the whipped cream. For the vanilla bean Swiss meringue icing: Place the egg whites and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixture set over a saucepan of simmering water. Whisk constantly until the sugar melts and the mixture becomes very thin and warm. Remove the bowl from the heat and add the vanilla seeds. Whisk on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Continue beating on low speed until cool. Beat in the butter, a few pieces at a time, on medium speed. (The mixture may curdle before coming together.) To assemble the cake: Using a serrated knife, level off the tops of the cake layers. Place one layer on a serving plate or board and brush some tiramisu syrup on the top. Put 1 cup of the Swiss meringue icing in a piping bag fitted with a large round tip and pipe a thin dam around the edge of the cake. Spoon a 1/2-inch layer of the tiramisu filling onto the cake and gently spread it out to the dam. Repeat with the second layer of cake. Place the final layer on top and ice the cake with the remaining Swiss meringue icing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Prosecco]&quot; 29723,&quot;Pear and Plum Fruit Leather Rollups 1 pound pears, peeled, cored and cut into 2-inch chunks 1 pound plums, pitted and cut into 2-inch chunks<br> 1/3 cup sugar<br> 4 cinnamon sticks<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper; set aside. Combine the pears, plums, sugar, cinnamon sticks, lemon juice and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Cover and cook at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is tender when pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes. Remove the cinnamon sticks and transfer the fruit and juices to a blender. Blend on high speed until completely smooth. Carefully pour the puree onto the baking sheets; use a spatula to spread into even rectangles, leaving a 2-inch border on all sides. Bake until dried completely, 5 to 6 hours. Let cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer each dried fruit sheet to a piece of wax paper cut to a slightly larger size. Use scissors to cut the fruit and wax paper into 4-inch-wide strips and roll into cylinders. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 29724,&quot;Seekh Kebabs 1 small onion, roughly chopped (about 3/4 cup) 2 to 4 Thai green chiles or 1 to 2 serrano chiles (depending on your spice level), stemmed 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, leaves and tender stems, plus extra leaves for serving 4 cloves garlic, grated (about 1 tablespoon) One 1-inch piece fresh ginger, grated (2 teaspoons) 1 pound ground lamb, mutton or chuck (about 20 percent fat content) 2 1/2 tablespoons garam masala 2 teaspoons Kashmiri red chili powder (see Cook\u2019s Note) 1/2 teaspoon kabab chini or ground allspice, optional (see Cook\u2019s Note) 2 tablespoons cashew butter, optional (see Cook\u2019s Note) Kosher salt Breadcrumbs or roasted chickpea flour, for forming the kebabs if needed Vegetable oil or other neutral-flavored oil, for the grill grates Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving Cilantro-Yogurt Chutney, recipe follows Lime wedges, for serving Pickled Red Pearl Onions (Sirke Wale Pyaz), recipe follows, optional 2 cups fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems 1/2 cup plain full-fat Greek yogurt 2 to 3 Thai green chiles or 1 serrano cl, coarsely chopped 1 clove garlic, smashed Zest and juice of 1 lime (about 2 tablespoons juice) Kosher salt 1/2 cup cider vinegar or rice vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar Kosher salt 8 ounces red pearl onions, peeled Instructions: Add the onions, chiles, and cilantro to a food processor and pulse until evenly and finely chopped, scrapping down the sides of the processor with a rubber spatula as needed. Transfer the mixture to a piece of folded over cheesecloth and add the garlic and ginger. Gather up the ends of the cheesecloth and squeeze every bit of liquid from the mixture. (A lot should come out.) This step is imperative to making a good kebab and makes it easier to skewer the meat mixture. Combine the meat, garam masala, chili powder, kabab chini (if using), cashew butter (if using) and squeezed onion mixture in a large bowl. Knead until thoroughly combined, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours. Preheat a grill to medium-high. Meanwhile, add 2 teaspoons salt to the meat mixture and knead to incorporate. (Do this just before you are ready to make the skewers.) Skewering is the only slightly tricky part of this recipe. With moist hands, form the meat into about sixteen 2-inch-wide balls. If the mixture is too moist to hold together, knead in some breadcrumbs. On a large work surface, roll each ball into a cylinder about 1-inch thick and 3 to 4 inches long. Thread the cylinders onto metal skewers. Depending on the size of your skewers, you can thread 3 to 4 cylinders on a single skewer. Don\u2019t worry too much about keeping a perfect cylindrical shape. When the grill is hot, lightly oil the grates. Lay the skewers on the grates, close the lid and cook until grill marks form on the bottom of the kebabs, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the kebabs, close the lid and cook until the meat is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more. The whole process should take no more than 6 to 8 minutes. If there are significant flare ups, move the kebabs to another part of the grill and continue cooking. Slide the kebabs off the skewers onto a platter. Garnish with cilantro leaves and lightly drizzle with Cilantro-Yogurt Chutney. Serve with lime wedges, the remaining chutney for dipping and Pickled Red Pearl Onions (if using). Combine the cilantro, yogurt, chiles, garlic, lime zest, lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender and process until smooth. It should have the consistency of a creamy salad dressing. If it\u2019s too thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water. Taste and adjust the salt and/or lime, if needed. Combine the vinegar, sugar, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and simmer until the sugar and salt are dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the onions and let come to room temperature. Transfer to a jar and refrigerate, covered, for 4 days. The pickles will keep in the refrierator for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 29725,&quot;Sole with Pesto Cream 4 sole fillets (about 5 ounces each) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup prepared basil pesto 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1 cup rice, regular or instant, cooked according to package directions Ground paprika Instructions: Season both sides of sole with salt and black pepper. In a large skillet, heat oil and butter over medium-high heat. Add sole and cook 1 to 2 minutes per side, until golden brown. In a medium bowl, whisk together heavy cream, pesto, and lemon zest. Add mixture to pan and bring to a simmer. Simmer 2 minutes, until sauce thickens. Transfer rice to a serving platter. Top the rice with fish and spoon sauce over top. Sprinkle paprika over top just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 29726,&quot;Hangover Corned Beef Hash Wrap One 10-inch soft flour tortilla 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 teaspoon yellow mustard 1 frozen hash brown patty Cooking spray 1/3 cup sliced deli or leftover corned beef, coarsely chopped (1 1/2 ounces) 1 large egg 4 to 5 dill pickle chips Squeeze of ketchup Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Brush the tortilla with 1 tablespoon of the butter, and sprinkle with some salt and pepper. Mix the mayonnaise and mustard together in a small bowl; set aside. Put the hash brown on a baking sheet, spray lightly with cooking spray and bake until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. During the last 2 minutes of baking, put the buttered tortilla on the baking sheet, and cook until warmed through and pliable. Cut the hash brown into quarters. Meanwhile, heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the corned beef, and cook, breaking it up with a spatula, until browned and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer it to a bowl, and set aside. Crack the egg into a bowl, add 1/4 teaspoon salt and a grind of pepper and whisk with a fork. Melt the remaining tablespoon butter in the skillet, reduce the heat to low and add the egg. Swirl the pan so the egg forms a thin circle, and cook until just set, about 30 seconds. Roll the egg circle into a log with a spatula, and transfer it to a cutting board. Lay the tortilla flat, and spread with the mayonnaise-mustard mixture. Arrange half the corned beef along the lower third. Top with the egg log, the remaining corned beef, the pickles, the hash browns and a squeeze of ketchup. Fold in the sides, and roll the tortilla up from the bottom. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29727,&quot;Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee with Raspberries 2 1/3 cups heavy cream 2/3 cup sugar, plus more if needed 1 vanilla bean 6 eggs 4 to 8 teaspoons sugar, divided 1 cup fresh raspberries 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon lemon zest Special equipment: 4 (6-ounce) ramekins, a baker&#39;s torch Instructions: For the custard: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place 4 (6-ounce) ramekins in a 13 by 9 by 2-inch baking pan. Fill a tea kettle or small saucepan with a spout with water and heat. Add the heavy cream and sugar to a medium saucepan and whisk to combine. Using a sharp paring knife, split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean using the back of the knife to prevent the pod from breaking. Add the seeds and bean to the saucepan. (If any of the vanilla seeds get stuck to your fingers, grab some of your extra sugar and rub the sugar between your fingers over the saucepan to remove every last bit of vanilla seeds and let fall into the cream.) Whisk over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, the vanilla seeds break up and the mixture comes to a simmer. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain into a large measuring cup or bowl with a spout and either discard the vanilla bean or reserve, dry out and add to your sugar bowl! Place a medium bowl over some wet paper towels, or form a dish towel into a circle or wreath shape and nestle the bowl in the center. This will help act as your third hand or as a base to hold the bowl in place when you start tempering in your hot liquid. Separate the eggs, add the yolks to the bowl and whisk to combine. (Reserve the egg whites for another use, or make meringues and store in an air-tight container for a sweet treat anytime!) Gradually whisk in the hot cream mixture, making sure to scrape any remaining vanilla beans into the mixture as well. Return the custard to the measuring cup. Pour the custard into the ramekins, or use either a 4 or 6-ounce ladle to help evenly distribute. Pour enough hot water from your tea kettle into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Carefully transfer the baking dish into the oven. Alternatively, to make sure none of the water from the pan ends up in the filled ramekins, you can place the pan with the ramekins in the oven, and then add the water to come halfway up the sides. Bake the custards until the center is set but still jiggles a bit when you gently shake the pan, 30 to 35 minutes. Carefully remove the ramekins from the water bath and set aside to cool to room temperature. Once at room temperature, place into the refrigerator to cool completely. For the brulee: Sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons sugar evenly over the tops of each custard, picking up the ramekin if needed. Position the flame of a baker&#39;s torch 1 to 2 inches above the surface of the custard and move the torch around in an even circle to melt and brown the sugar, moving from ramekin to ramekin. Do not allow the sugar to burn. You can even pick up and tilt the ramekin to help even out the caramelized sugar. If you don&#39;t have a baker&#39;s torch, place all the ramekins on a baking sheet and pop under the broiler. Watch the whole time, and rotate the baking sheet as needed until the sugar melts and browns evenly. For the berries: Combine the raspberries, sugar and lemon zest in a bowl. Let stand at room temperature at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. When ready to serve, spoon the berry mixture atop the custards. Cook&#39;s Note: Creme brulee is super easy and you can infuse the cream with almost any flavor. If you like coffee, add a pinch or 2 of instant coffee granules to the cream. For a lavender-scented brulee, just steep a dash of lavender in the cream, then strain as usual. Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat, open flame, and prolonged exposure to sunlight. They should only be used in well-ventilated areas. When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you. Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve. Light the gas jet, and blow out the match. Always turn off the burner valve to \finger tight\ when finished using the torch. Children should never use a propane gas torch without adult supervision. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 29728,&quot;Duck Confit 2 (5 pound) ducks 2 teaspoons salt 2 tablespoons black peppercorns, cracked 6 cups rendered duck or pork fat 12 garlic cloves, peeled 12 fresh thyme sprigs Instructions: Remove ducks&#39; legs and breasts, saving remaining bones and wings for brown duck stock. Leaving bones and skin attached, chop breasts into halves. With a cleaver, remove tips of drumsticks to use in stock. Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper, and set aside at room temperature 45 minutes. Then place duck pieces in a Dutch oven with rendered fat, garlic and thyme. Cook over low heat, uncovered, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. To test for doneness, pierce with a sharp fork. It should just fall off fork when shaken. Transfer duck pieces to a medium baking dish and add the fat. Let cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 24 hours or as long as 4 weeks. Before serving, lift duck pieces out of fat. Remove and discard skin and any excess fat by warming slightly on a rack in the oven. Serve duck hot or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Barolo]&quot; 29729,&quot;Sugared Popcorn 1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 tablespoons water Couple drops red or green food coloring 6 cups popped butter-flavored popcorn 6 paper cones 1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 tablespoons water Couple drops red or green food coloring 6 cups popped butter-flavored popcorn 6 paper cones Instructions: In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, combine the sugar, butter and water. Stirring constantly, cook until it is thick syrup, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the food coloring and popcorn and stir to coat evenly. Turn onto a sheet of parchment paper to cool. Serve in paper cones. In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, combine the sugar, butter and water. Stirring constantly, cook until it is thick syrup, about 5 minutes.

Mash squash with butter, sugar and salt and pepper. Serve with extra butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 29731,&quot;Pork Wellington 1 whole egg 1 tablespoon water 1-ounce dried apple rings 1 whole pork tenderloin, approximately 1 pound 4 1/2 ounces thinly slice prosciutto ham 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed completely 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard Instructions: Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and heat to 400 degrees F. Whisk the egg and water in a small bowl and set aside. Place the apple rings into the bowl of a mini food processor and process for 30 to 45 seconds or until they are the size of a medium dice. Set aside. Trim the pork tenderloin of any excess fat and silver skin. Slice the tenderloin down the middle lengthwise, creating 2 separate pieces. Lay the tenderloin pieces next to each other head to tail, so when laid back together they are the same size at the ends. Lay out a 12 by 16-inch piece of parchment paper on the counter and arrange the pieces of prosciutto in the center, overlapping them enough to create solid layer that is as long as the tenderloin. Top with a second piece of parchment, and using a rolling pin, roll over the prosciutto to help adhere the pieces to each other. Remove the parchment paper and sprinkle the prosciutto with the salt, pepper, and thyme. Set the tenderloin down the middle of the prosciutto. Spread the dried apples in between the 2 pieces of tenderloin and push back together so the apples are held between them. Using the parchment paper to assist, wrap the prosciutto around the tenderloin to completely enclose in a package. Sprinkle the counter with flour and roll out the pastry to 12 by 14 inches. Spread the mustard thinly in the center of pastry and lay the prosciutto wrapped tenderloin in the center of the pastry on the mustard. Fold the puff pastry up and over the top of the tenderloin, then roll to completely enclose, brushing the edges of the pastry with the egg wash in order to seal. Turn the tenderloin over so the side of the tenderloin with the double thickness of pastry is underneath. Pinch the ends of the pastry to seal. Brush the entire pastry with the egg wash. Place the tenderloin on a parchment lined half sheet pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of at least 140 degrees F. Remove the tenderloin from the oven, transfer to a cooling rack and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29732,&quot;White Sangria 1 bottle Pinot Grigio, or other dry fruity white wine 1/4 cup white rum 24 ounces lemon lime soda 1 lime, thinly sliced into disks about 1/4 of an inch thick 1 lemon, thinly sliced into disks about 1/4 of an inch thick 1 pint fresh cherries (Bing are best) 1 pint fresh strawberries if small left whole if large cut into quarters Instructions: Fill a large pitcher half way with some ice.

For the steaks: Process the pretzels in a food processor until fine. Grab 3 shallow bowls. In one, whisk together the eggs and milk. In another, mix together the flour, salt, pepper, dried fenugreek leaves, paprika, ground coriander, and ground cumin. Pour the pretzel crumbs into the last bowl. Save 2 tablespoons of the flavored flour for the gravy. Make yourself an assembly line: dip 1 steak on both sides in the flavored flour, making sure it&#39;s well coated, but dust off the excess. Then dip it quickly in the egg and lift, allowing the excess to drain back into the bowl. Finally, dunk both sides in the pretzel crumbs. Repeat with remaining steaks. Place the coated steaks on a sheet tray fitted with a cooling rack and let the steaks rest for 15 minutes to let the coating adhere to the meat. For the gravy: Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and add the onions and a pinch salt. Sweat until the onions are translucent and softened. Add the reserved 2 tablespoons of flavored flour and cook a few minutes until the flour no longer smells raw. Add the stock, mango chutney, and soy sauce. Stir, so that no lumps form, and bring to a boil. Cook until the sauce thickens to a gravy consistency, 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and re-season, if necessary. In a large cast iron skillet, add enough oil to come up the sides by 1-inch. Heat it over medium heat until shimmering; you&#39;ll know the oil is hot enough when a pinch of flour sizzles upon contact with the oil. Line a sheet tray with paper towels and place a cooling rack on top. Gently lay the steaks into the oil; you may have to do this in batches. Cook each side until golden, about 3 minutes. When both sides are cooked, lay the steaks on the paper towel-lined sheet tray and pop into the oven to keep warm while you do the next batch. Serve the steaks with gravy spooned over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 29734,&quot;Beef Negimaki 3 spring onions, root trimmed off 12 frozen asparagus spears, defrosted 12 beef sandwich slices (1/8 thin, about 4 by 6-inches) 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce, store-bought Instructions: Cut each spring onion in half lengthwise, then cut each length in half into 2 pieces, about 4 inches long.

Warmed sourdough baguette slices Instructions: To prepare the chimichurri, place all the ingredients in a food processor and process for 1 to 2 minutes until the ingredients are well combined. Can be used immediately, but for best results refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator 2 hours before serving, to allow to come to room temperature.<br> Preheat your grill pan (or outdoor grill) over medium-high heat. Brush each sweet potato slice generously with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle both sides generously with salt and pepper. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until tender when poked with a knife (you want some nice char marks on the potatoes.) You may need to grill in 2 batches. Place on a baking sheet, wrap with foil and place in a preheated to 200 degree F oven.<br> Next, in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil. When hot add the bell peppers and season generously with salt and pepper. Saute until caramelized, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for an additional 2 minutes. Turn the heat off, toss in the toasted pine nuts, basil and oregano and add a pinch more salt and pepper. Stir to combine and keep warm on the stovetop.<br> For the swordfish, again heat your grill pan (or outdoor grill) over medium-high heat. Brush both sides of the swordfish generously with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle both sides generously with salt and pepper. Grill until just cooked through, but still moist, about 3 to 4 minutes per side (being careful not to overcook the fish.)<br> To plate, first put 1/4 of the sweet potato slices onto each of 4 warmed plates. Top potatoes with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a tiny pinch of salt. Next, top the sweet potatoes, with 1/4 of the bell pepper mixture. Then place the swordfish atop that, and spoon a generous amount of the chimichurri over the middle of the fish. To garnish, top the chimichurri with a tiny sprinkling of orange zest, then just a few very thinly sliced pieces of jalapeno, and a twisted orange slice. Serve with warmed sourdough baguette slices and the additional chimichurri on the side.

Set aside. Using a paring knife, make the straw holes in the center of the lids of 2 \to-go\ cups larger by expanding the \u201cX\u201d large enough so that the top of a mini bottle of rum fits through it. Using the paring knife, make another \u201cX\ in the lid for a straw hole. Set aside. Fill the to-go cups with ice. Divide the prepared Mai Tai between the two cups. Add a cherry to each. Unscrew the cap from each mini bottle of spiced rum. Invert the prepared lid and place the nozzle of the bottle into the expanded straw hole in the center of the lid. In one quick motion, place the top of the bottle into the cocktail and secure the lid on the cup. This will create a vacuum that will distribute the spiced rum in the cocktail as you drink it.

Place 8 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate in a small bowl. Heat 3/4 cup heavy cream in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Bring to a boil. Pour the boiling cream over the chopped chocolate. Set aside for 5 minutes before stirring with a whisk until smooth. Pour the mixture (called ganache) onto a nonstick baking sheet and use a rubber spatula to spread the ganache in a smooth, even layer to within about an inch of the inside edges of the pan. Place the ganache in the freezer for 15 minutes, or in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, until firm to the touch. Line a 10 to 12-inch dinner plate with parchment paper or waxed paper. Remove the firm ganache from the freezer or the refrigerator. Portion 12 heaping tablespoons (a bit more than an ounce each) of ganache onto the paper. Wearing a pair of disposable vinyl (or latex) gloves, individually roll each portion of ganache in your palms in a circular motion, using just enough gentle pressure to form a smooth orb. This is a traditional truffle. You should refrain from indulging in them since absence of a truffle in a cake will make the heart grow darker. Return each formed truffle onto the paper lined plate, and place in the freezer while preparing the cake batter. Make the chocolate cocoa cakes. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly coat the inside of each individual nonstick muffin cup with the 2 teaspoons melted butter. Set aside until needed. In a sifter, combine 2/3 cup all-purpose flour and a 1/2 cup cocoa powder. Sift onto a large piece of parchment paper (or waxed paper) and set aside until needed. Melt 8 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate and 5 ounces butter in the top half of a double boiler over medium-low heat. Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate and butter until completely melted and smooth, about 6 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside at room temperature until needed. The chocolate and butter may also be melted in a medium glass bowl in a microwave oven set at medium power for 2 minutes. After removing the chocolate and butter from the microwave oven, use a rubber spatula to stir until smooth. Place 3 eggs, 2 egg yolks, and 1/2 cup sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on a medium-high speed for 2 minutes until the mixture is slightly frothy. Add the melted chocolate and butter and mix on low speed to combine, about 15 seconds. Continue to operate the mixer on low while gradually adding the sifted dry ingredients. Once all the dry ingredients have been incorporated, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and mix on medium to combine, about 15 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to finish mixing the batter until thoroughly combined. Portion 3 heaping tablespoons (about 2 1/2 ounces) of the cake batter into each individual muffin cup. Place the muffin tin on the center rack of the preheated oven. Bake for 5 minutes. Remove the truffles from the freezer. Remove the muffin tin from the oven, and moving quickly, place a single frozen truffle in the center of each portion of cake batter, pressing each truffle about halfway down into the batter. Immediately return the muffin tin to the center rack of the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the cake (not the truffle) comes out clean, about 17 to 18 minutes. Remove the cakes from the oven and cool at room temperature for 20 minutes. To remove the cakes from the muffin cups, hold the top edges of the baked batter part of a cake, and give each cake a slight twist to loosen it from the inside cup. Then insert the pointed tip of a knife into a top outside edge of a cake and loosen it so that you can gently pull each baked cake out of each cup. Serve immediately while still warm. After the Chocolate Heart of Darkness cakes have cooled to room temperature, you may keep them covered with plastic wrap for up to 24 hours at room temperature, or in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days. The cakes may be rewarmed in a microwave oven, and they are extraordinary. Make sure the cakes are at room temperature, then heat them 1 or 2 at a time for 30 to 40 seconds in a microwave oven set on defrost power. Instead of drying out, the cake will be warm and moist, and the truffle center will be a hot ooze of ecstasy. For extra indulgence, serve the warm Chocolate Heart of Darkness cakes with white chocolate ice cream or unsweetened whipped cream. For me, a glass (forget the golden goblet) of Warre&#39;s 1985 Porto will have a salubrious effect. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 29746,&quot;White Flour Tortillas 2 cups lard or shortening 2 2/3 cups harina de trigo (wheat flour, such as that made by Goya Foods) or white corn harina (corn flour made from hominy, such as Bob&#39;s Red Mill or Goya Foods) 1 teaspoon baking powder 2 cups chicken stock 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil, or as needed for the griddle Instructions: Melt 2/3 cup of the shortening in a saucepan and set aside. With an electric mixer, beat the other 1 1/3 cups of the shortening until fluffy and gradually and alternately begin adding the harina, baking powder, and stock, mixing well after each addition. Then gradually add the melted shortening mixing completely after each addition. Cover the bowl of dough with a damp kitchen towel and set aside in a warm place for at least 30 minutes.

Pat the tenderloins dry with a paper towel and coat each with the vegetable oil. Season liberally with salt and pepper and sear until evenly browned all over. Transfer to a plate. Add the butter and onions to the pan, season with salt and pepper and cook until lightly golden, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, mix together the maple syrup, mustard, thyme, sage and cinnamon in a small bowl. Brush over the pork. Add the fennel to the pan and continue to cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the fennel is lightly browned. Carefully deglaze the pan with the white wine and nestle in the pork. Roast the pork for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 155 to 160 degrees F (about 70 degrees C). When cooked, transfer the pork to a cutting board, cover it with foil and allow it to rest for 5 to 8 minutes. Place the onions and fennel over medium heat and add in the chicken stock. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits off of the bottom of the pan and allow it to thicken slightly until the pork has rested.

Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla and peppermint extract if using, and beat until just combined. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until combined. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead several times with your hands to bring the dough together. Divide the dough in half and wrap each half in plastic wrap. Refrigerate to chill slightly, about 10 minutes (or refrigerate half the dough and freeze the other half for later use). Generously dust a work surface with flour. Place one half of the dough on top and dust with more flour. Roll out into a round slightly less than 1/4-inch thick and about 14 inches in diameter, adding a little more flour as necessary to prevent sticking. If the dough cracks, press it back together with your fingers and smooth with the rolling pin. Use a 2 1/2- to 3-inch round cookie cutter to cut out cookies. Transfer the cookies one of the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1/2 inch between each cookie. Gather the scraps and refrigerate. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Bake, rotating the position of the baking sheets halfway through, until slightly puffed and a shade darker on the underside, about 10 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely (the cookies will crisp as they cool). Gather all of the dough scraps together and roll out in the same manner.

Flatten meatballs into circular patties using wax paper and a 6-inch pizza pan. (Patties should be no more than 1/2-inch thick.) Cut out circles of cheese stuffing using a 1-inch ring mold. (Cheese should be 1.5-ounce pieces.) Place cheese stuffing in center of a beef patty. Place a second beef patty on top of cheese stuffing. Using thumb and forefinger, crimp the two patties all the way around to mold them together, leaving no air inside and no seams in the beef. Repeat with remaining beef and cheese stuffing. Sprinkle lobster Lucy patty generously with salt and pepper. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat, add oil and lay patties in pan. Cook for 4 minutes on each side, uncovered and unpressed. Poke a hole in top of each patty after flipping it to allow air pressure out. Allow to rest off heat 2 minutes before serving. Toast hamburger buns. Place lobster Lucy patties on bottom burger bun. Top each with 1.5 ounces caramelized onions and 1 ounce lobster claw. Spread 1 ounce tarragon aioli on top bun and place over lobster Lucy to finish. Garnish with chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 29756,&quot;Thailand Scones 1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring 1 tablespoon sugar 1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 4 1/2 tablespoons cold butter, diced 1 cup fresh basil leaves 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves 3/4 cup coconut puree 1 stalk lemon grass, diced 1/4 cup coconut rape (desiccated coconut), plus more for garnish 3 inches fresh ginger, peeled and sliced 2 kaffir lime leaves 1/2 cup cream 1 3/4 cups coconut flakes 3/4 cup diced dried mango 1/2 cup diced crystalized ginger 1 egg whisked with 1 tablespoon water Instructions: Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl. Add the diced cold butter and toss with the dry ingredients. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. While the mixture chills, blanch the basil and cilantro. Prepare an ice water bath and bring a small pot of water to a boil. Immerse the basil and cilantro in the boiling water for about 1 minute, and then transfer the herbs to the icy bath. In a blender, add 1/4 cup of the coconut puree and the lemon grass and blend until smooth. Next, add another 1/4 cup of the coconut puree, the coconut rape, ginger and kaffir lime leaves and blend until smooth. Finally, add the blanched herbs and the remaining 1/4 cup coconut puree and blend until the mixture turns a light vibrant green. If at any point the mixture feels warm, transfer it to the freezer to cool off; this will keep the herbs from turning brown. Transfer 1/2 cup of this mixture to a small bowl and whisk in the cream. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a heavy-duty mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix together the chilled dry scone ingredients and diced butter on medium-low speed until the butter has broken down into pea-size pieces. Mix in the coconut flakes, dried mango and crystallized ginger. Next add the green herb-cream mixture in 1/4-cup increments until just incorporated, being careful not to over-mix the dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and roll out 1 1/4 inches thick. Cut into 3 1/2-inch squares, and then cut each square on the diagonal, forming two triangles per square. Place the triangles on a baking sheet. Brush the top of each triangle with the egg wash, and then garnish with a thin layer of coconut rape. Bake the scones until golden brown and firm to the touch, 30 to 40 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 29757,&quot;Weeknight Bolognese 2 tablespoons good olive oil, plus extra to cook the pasta 1 pound lean ground sirloin 4 teaspoons minced garlic (4 cloves) 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 1/4 cups dry red wine, divided 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes, preferably San Marzano 2 tablespoons tomato paste Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 pound dried pasta, such as orecchiette or small shells 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves, lightly packed 1/4 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground sirloin and cook, crumbling the meat with a wooden spoon, for 5 to 7 minutes, until the meat has lost its pink color and has started to brown. Stir in the garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 more minute. Pour 1 cup of the wine into the skillet and stir to scrape up any browned bits. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper, stirring until combined. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil, add a tablespoon of salt, a splash of oil and the pasta, and cook according to the directions on the box. While the pasta cooks, finish the sauce. Add the nutmeg, basil, cream and the remaining 1/4 cup wine to the sauce and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until thickened. When the pasta is cooked, drain and pour into a large serving bowl. Add the sauce and 1/2 cup Parmesan and toss well.

Butter a 9-inch springform pan and set it aside. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and sea salt, and stir to blend. Add the vanilla extract, eggs, oil, and milk, and stir until well blended. Add the apples and stir to thoroughly coat them with the batter. Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake pan. Place the pan in the center of the oven and bake until fairly firm and golden, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the topping: In a small bowl, combine the sugar, egg, and melted butter, and stir to blend. Set it aside. Remove the cake from the oven and pour the topping mixture over it. Return the cake to the oven and bake until the top is a deep golden brown and the cake feels quite firm when pressed with a fingertip, about 10 minutes. Transfer the cake pan to a rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Then run a knife around the sides of the pan, and release and remove the springform side, leaving the cake on the pan base. Serve at room temperature, cut into thin wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29759,&quot;Applesauce Cake 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature 2 cups brown sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 1/4 cups flour 2 teaspoons baking soda 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg 2 cups applesauce 1/2 cup raisins 1 cup chopped walnuts Powdered sugar, optional Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, cream the butter. Add the brown sugar and continue mixing. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and vanilla, then mix until well blended and fluffy. In a separate bowl, sift together the dry ingredients. Add to the creamed mixture alternately with the applesauce. Fold in the raisins and walnuts. Pour batter into a greased and floured loaf or tube pan and bake until firm to the touch, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool in the pan, then turn it out, and dust with powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29760,&quot;Raspberry Chocolate Parfait 2 cups milk 1 vanilla bean 3 eggs 5 egg yolks 1/4 cup potato starch 24 ounces sugar 2 ounces cocoa powder 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 4 ounces unsalted butter 2 cups heavy cream 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 10 ounces (1 bag) frozen raspberries 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate Fresh raspberries Instructions: For the Pudding: Bring to a boil the milk and vanilla bean in a large heavy bottomed pot. Meanwhile, whisk to blend the eggs, egg yolks, potato starch, sugar, cocoa powder, and flour. Remove the milk pan from heat once it boils. With the whisk in the center of the cocoa mixture, slowly pour the hot milk in and begin to combine the 2 mixtures. Finish pouring the milk in and whisk to fully incorporate. Return mixture to the pot and cook over medium heat, slowly whisking constantly to prevent scorching. The ingredients have a low burning temperature and will scorch easily so keep the whisk moving. Cook until large bubbles slowly rise to the surface of the pot. I call these \lava bubbles\ because the large steam venting bubbles make me think of flowing molten lava. The pastry cream temperature is approximately 200 degrees F. Remove pot from the heat and whisk in the butter. Remove the vanilla bean from the pudding. Pour pudding into a heat resistant bowl and cover with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic wrap touches the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. For the Whipped Cream: Combine all the ingredients in a mixer bowl and whip on medium speed. Stop the mixer when you have medium peaks and finish whipping manually with whisk. This will help avoid ruining the whipped cream&#39;s luscious texture. For the Raspberry Puree: Combine the frozen berries and sugar in a pot and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook gently for 5 minutes. Strain the berries to remove the seeds. It&#39;s easier to pour if you can put it in a squeeze bottle. Ganache: Bring the heavy cream to a boil and immediately pour over the chocolate. Stir to combine. Allow to cool for easy handling. Berries: use the freshest and plumpest berries available. Assembly: Load pudding and whipped cream into separate pastry bags. Alternately pipe into tall sundae glasses, starting with chocolate pudding, then the whipped cream, rapsberry puree and fresh berries. Repeat as needed and top the parfait with whipped cream and fresh berries. Drizzle chocolate ganache across the top for extra indulgence! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 29761,&quot;Cassata Rustica 2 pounds 3 1/4 ounces/1 kg fresh ricotta cheese 7 ounces/200 g semisweet chocolate, chopped 7 ounces/200 g candied fruit, such as oranges, chopped 5 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 store-bought pie shell, baked and cooled in pie plate<br> Sponge cake, sliced, or savoiardi cookies (ladyfinger cookies) 1/2 cup rum 3 tablespoons icing sugar Instructions: Mix together the ricotta, chocolate, candied fruit and 4 tablespoons of the granulated sugar in a mixing bowl, and then spread evenly into the pie crust.

Add the onion and stir, making sure to scrape the bottom of pot. Cook until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, chicken stock, 8 cups of water, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer. Stir the beans frequently and check the water level: If they start looking dry add a little more water. When the beans no longer float, after about an hour, reduce the heat to low. Continue cooking until the beans are soft, 25 to 30 minutes more. For the grilled fish: Heat a grill or heavy grill pan over medium-high heat. If using a grill, coat the fish with the oil, season with salt and pepper and add to the grill using tongs to adjust the fish and prevent sticking. If using a grill pan, season the fish with salt and pepper and add the oil to the grill pan (if the oil begins to smoke, reduce the heat slightly). Cook the fish until white on all sides and edges and firm to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Just before serving, add the tomatoes and arugula to the beans and stir in to heat the tomatoes and wilt the arugula, just a few minutes. Serve with the fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 29764,&quot;Pastrami Burger 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter 2 cloves garlic, minced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup canola oil 1 sweet onion, thinly sliced 12 ounces good-quality pastrami, sliced 2 pounds ground beef (80-20 blend) 8 slices muenster cheese 4 soft brioche hamburger buns, split 2 kosher dill pickles, thinly sliced 8 Boston lettuce leaves (about 1 small lettuce head) 2 heirloom tomatoes, thinly sliced Caraway coleslaw Instructions: Start a wood campfire and wait until the flames die down and the coals glow red with white ash. Lower a grilling grate so that it sits above the coals and you have nice, even medium heat. Place the butter and garlic in a large cast-iron skillet and set over the fire (or on a stovetop over medium heat). As the butter melts, the garlic will infuse the butter and become fragrant. Stir well and season with salt and pepper; transfer the garlic butter to a small bowl and set aside to cool. Place the same skillet back over medium heat to warm up. Add enough canola oil to coat the skillet, about 2 tablespoons, then add the onion. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until the onion caramelizes, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and cook until soft and evenly brown, about 3 more minutes. Transfer the onion to a plate and set aside. Raise the heat level to medium high by moving the skillet so it&#39;s directly over the coals, or lower the grate so it&#39;s closer to the coals. Add enough canola oil to coat the skillet, about 2 tablespoons. Add the pastrami and cook, turning a few times, until crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the pastrami and set aside, leaving any accumulated juices in the skillet. Divide the ground beef into 4 portions and form into 4 tight balls. Sprinkle them all over with salt and pepper. Place the hamburger balls in the skillet and sear 30 to 40 seconds, then use a strong flat metal spatula to flatten them. Continue to press with the spatula and cook until the burgers develop a crust on the bottom, about 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook to develop a crust on the second side, 1 minute. Use a spoon to baste the burgers with the pastrami fat in the pan. Top each burger with 2 slices cheese. Pour 1 tablespoon water into the skillet and cover with a lid, aluminum foil or another pan to seal in the steam (this will help melt the cheese). Leave covered 30 to 40 seconds, until the cheese has melted, then remove the lid. When the burgers are at the desired point of doneness and the cheese is melted, top each with a pile of crispy pastrami, then set the burgers aside. Brush the cut sides of the buns lightly with the garlic butter. Toast the buns directly on the grill over the campfire until golden and crisp around the edges, 15 to 20 seconds. Flip and lightly toast the outside of the buns, another 15 seconds. Assemble each burger by layering the bottom half of each bun with pickle slices and caramelized onion, then a pastrami-burger patty. Top each with lettuce, tomatoes and the top half of the bun. Serve with caraway coleslaw.

Add the butter and pulse until a coarse meal forms. Drizzle in the yolk and pulse until the mixture reaches a cornmeal-like consistency. Remove from the processor and gently divide the dough among six 6-inch pie tins. Gently press the dough into the tins and up against the edges. Poke the bottom of the crusts a few times with a fork. Butter 6 squares of aluminum foil (large enough to cover the pie crusts) and press one, butter-side down, into each crust. Freeze until hard, 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and toast in the oven, tossing once, until toasted, about 3 1/2 minutes. Bake the pie crusts in the oven until the edges are golden, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool and then carefully remove and discard the foil. Set the pie crusts aside until ready to fill. For the coconut pastry cream: Bring the coconut milk and cream of coconut to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Add the sugar and cornstarch to the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Whisk until combined, then add the egg and yolks and whisk on high speed until the mixture reaches a pale yellow color and it drops down like ribbons when you lift the whisk. Add a couple of ladlefuls of the hot coconut milk mixture to the egg mixture and whisk to temper the eggs, then pour all of the egg mixture into the coconut milk saucepan and return to medium heat. Whisk vigorously and constantly until the custard starts to boil and thicken. Place a bowl over an ice bath and strain the pastry cream into the bowl to remove any lumps. Place a layer of plastic wrap on the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate over the ice bath until cool and firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Whip the heavy cream in a medium bowl until it reaches stiff peaks, refrigerate until ready to use. For the salted lime caramel: Add the sugar to a medium saucepan. Pour 1/4 cup of water and squeeze the lime juice over the sugar, swirling the pan to fully moisten. Cook over medium-heat until bubbling and deep amber in color, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off the heat, carefully whisk in the cream. Whisk in the butter piece by piece. Finish with a sprinkling of fleur de sel. For the candied key lime slices: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat. Make a simple syrup: Heat the sugar and 1 cup of water in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let cool. Slice the key limes into 1/16-inch slices with a mandolin. Brush the slices with the simple syrup and place in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet making sure they do not overlap. Bake for 30 minutes. Allow to cool before using. For serving: Whisk the coconut custard until it is light and smooth. Gently fold in the whipped cream. Spoon the mixture into the pie crusts. Top with the toasted coconut flakes. Place a spoonful of the salted lime caramel on each plate and place a pie on it. Drizzle with more salted lime caramel and garnish with a candied key lime slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 29779,&quot;Brioche Saint-Genix 1/3 cup sugar 40 almonds 3 drops red food coloring 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3 tablespoons sugar 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/3 cup warm whole milk, or cream (100 to 110 degrees F) 6 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for greasing 2 eggs, lightly beaten, plus 1 egg 1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon rock sugar Instructions: For the pralines: Mix together the sugar, almonds, food coloring and 1/3 cup water in a pan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; do not stir until the water starts boiling, then you can start swirling the pan gently. When the liquid starts to thicken, after about 5 minutes, stir continuously until you feel a caramel texture. Take the pan away from the heat and stir until the sugar crystallizes, 12 to 15 minutes. Place the almonds on parchment paper and let them cool.<br> For the brioche: Stir together the flour, sugar, yeast and salt in a medium bowl. Gradually add the warm milk, butter and lightly beaten eggs into the flour mixture; knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise until it is doubled in size, about 2 hours. Deflate the dough by placing your fingers under it, lifting a section of the dough, and then letting it fall back into the bowl. Work your way around the circumference of the dough, lifting and releasing. Cover the bowl tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, during which time the dough may continue to rise and may double in size again.<br> Turn out the dough onto a floured surface. The dough must be cool to the touch, so only take out the dough immediately before you get started. Flatten the dough slightly, and then add 1 1/2 handfuls of the pralines in the center. Fold and shape the dough around the pralines so they are completely surrounded by the dough and both sides are closed. Flip the dough over so the new \seam\ side is down and roll gently with both hands to shape and smooth out the dough.<br> Place the dough on a greased baking pan and let sit at room temperature until it doubles in size, about 2 hours.<br> Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.<br> Whisk together the remaining egg and sugar to make an egg wash. Cover the dough with the egg wash using a pastry brush and sprinkle with the rock sugar.<br> Bake for 25 minutes with the oven door closed, then for another 15 minutes with the door open. This will ensure the brioche is baked evenly and does not brown too much on the outside.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29780,&quot;Sheik Babani 2 medium eggplants Vegetable oil, for frying 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef 1/4 cup olive oil 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1/2 tablespoon freshly ground pepper 1/2 tablespoon salt Parsley, for garnish 2 eggplant cores 1/2 green pepper, chopped 1 jalapeno pepper, chopped 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon black pepper 1/4 cup olive oil 1/2 cup water 1 tablespoon beef base 4 cups crushed tomatoes Instructions: Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise and widthwise and \stripe\ the skin with a peeler.

Being careful not to overcook, grill the zucchini until soft but not mushy by moving it to the cool side of the grill. Remove from the grill and let cool. Carefully scoop out the insides and put it on a cutting board, leaving the skin and a sturdy rim all the way around. Chop and reserve zucchini flesh.<br> Rice: Saute the onion in 1 tablespoon of oil, in a saucepan, over medium-high heat until it starts to brown.

Slowly stir in the cream then get whisking. As I said, I use my freestanding mixer to this, but if you haven&#39;t got one, don&#39;t worry - but I would then advise a handheld electric mixer. This takes ages to thicken and doing it by hand will drive you demented with tedium and impatience. Or it would me. When the cream&#39;s fairly thick, but still not thick enough to hold its shape, dribble with the flower waters and then keep whisking until you have a cream mixture that&#39;s light and airy but able to form soft peaks. I always think of syllabub as occupying some notional territory between solid and liquid; you&#39;re aiming, as you whisk, for what Jane Grigson called \bulky whiteness.\ Whatever: better slightly too runny than slightly too thick, so proceed carefully, but don&#39;t get anxious about it. Spoon the syllabub in airy dollops into small glasses, letting the mixture billow up above the rim of the glass, and scatter finely chopped pistachios on top. In my How to Eat cookbook, there&#39;s a recipe for pistachio crescents that would be fabulous dunked into and eaten with this. But only if you feel like it: the cool, fool-like smoothness of this is perfect as it is. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 29789,&quot;Roasted Grape Tomatoes with Tangled Noodles 3 tablespoons garlic-infused virgin olive oil 4 cups sweet grape tomatoes Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3 cups low-sodium chicken stock 1 pound angel hair pasta or extra-thin egg noodles 4 ounces smoked mozzarella, roughly chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drizzle the olive oil over the grape tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Place the tomatoes on the baking sheet and cook until skins turn a rich golden brown, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the chicken stock over low heat. Add the noodles to a large skillet over medium heat, and pour in 1 ladleful of hot stock. Stir to prevent the noodles from sticking together as the stock cooks off. Once the noodles have absorbed all of the stock, add another 1 cup stock. Continue to stir and add the remaining stock 1 cup at a time, waiting until each addition is absorbed before adding more. Once all the stock has been absorbed, stir in the cheese and toss with the roasted tomatoes and their pan drippings.

Prepare the Roasted Potatoes with Wild Ramps. Reserve. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large cast iron pan, over medium-high heat. Season the meat all over with salt and pepper. Brown the veal on all sides, about 20 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 130 degrees F(the loin will be pink at the center), about 20 minutes. Allow the meat to rest in a warm place for 10 to 15 minutes. While the veal is roasting, blanch the asparagus in boiling salted water. Refresh it in ice water, then drain and set aside. Just before serving, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the asparagus, season with salt and pepper and cook just until heated through and tender, about 5 minutes. To serve, thinly slice the veal. Place a spoonful of Roasted Potatoes with Wild Ramps in the center of each plate. Arrange 2 or 3 slices of veal over the potatoes. Place asparagus around the potatoes, spoon sauce over the meat and serve. If using fresh mushrooms clean them by rubbing them with a damp cloth, or briefly submerging them in water, then drain and blot dry. If using dried mushrooms, place them in a medium bowl and cover with boiling water. Set the mushrooms aside until soft, then drain. Chop the fresh or re-hydrated dry mushrooms. Heat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and chopped mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are almost tender, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes more. Add the wine, bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until the mushrooms are fully soft, about 5 minutes more. Remove the lid and add the chicken stock. Increase the heat if necessary and simmer, uncovered, until the flavors are blended, 20 minutes or so. Strain the sauce, reserving the mushrooms. Return the sauce to the pot and simmer until it has reduced by 90 percent and has become very concentrated, about 15 minutes. Add the heavy cream and simmer until the sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon. Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm over a very low heat. Just before serving, add the reserved mushrooms and fresh herbs. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the ramps in an oven-proof medium skillet. Add the stick of butter, the honey, and enough water to cover the mushrooms. Simmer over medium heat until the water evaporates, about 10 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the ramps begin to brown. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the ramps are tender, about 5 minutes more. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large oven-proof skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until the fat renders and the bacon begins to crisp, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels. Add the potatoes to the hot bacon fat. Increase the heat to medium-high then season with salt and pepper. Cook, turning the potatoes in the hot fat until they begin to brown, about 7 minutes. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter to the potatoes. Transfer the potatoes to the oven and continue cooking until the potatoes are tender, about 7 minutes more. Set the potatoes aside. Immediately before serving, warm the potatoes over medium-high heat.

If the asparagus are thick, peel them halfway up the stalks. Cut off and discard the bottom third of the asparagus. Place the asparagus in a single layer on a sheet pan, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Roast for 10 minutes, until the stalks are just tender. Meanwhile, place the prosciutto in a single layer on another sheet pan and roast in the same oven for 5 minutes. Melt the butter in a medium (10-inch) saute pan over medium heat and wait until the bubbles almost subside. Crack the eggs into the skillet, keeping them separate, if possible. Sprinkle the eggs generously with salt and pepper and cook over medium heat until the whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny. Don&#39;t turn them over! Arrange the asparagus on 3 plates. Place 2 slices of prosciutto on top of each pile, drizzle with hollandaise, and place a fried egg on top of the prosciutto. Serve hot. Place the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in the jar of a blender and process on low for 15 seconds. Melt the butter in a small saucepan until it is sizzling hot.

Bake until the potatoes offer no resistance when pierced with a paring knife, about 1 hour. Let cool completely (leave the oven on). Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out the insides, being careful not to break the skins (it&#39;s better to leave a little flesh in the skin than to risk breaking it). Rice the potato flesh into a large bowl and set aside. Stir the milk into the potato flesh along with 2 cups of the Cheddar, and the sour cream, scallions, 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper to taste. Place the potato skins on a baking sheet and divide the potato mixture evenly among them. Top the potatoes with the chopped bacon and the remaining 1 cup Cheddar.

Cut in 3 ounces of butter with a sharp knife, a pastry blender, or by hand until the mixture resembles crumbs. Mix in enough water to make a non-sticky dough. Knead gently, cover and leave for 20 minutes. Roll out the pastry on a floured board to about 1/4-inch thickness. Dot it with one-third of the remaining 4 ounces butter cut into dice. Fold the pastry into three, like a letter, then again into three in the opposite direction. Cover in a cloth and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Repeat this process twice more and leave for another 20 minutes chilling before using. If you can&#39;t face all that fun, buy 1 pound of puff pastry instead. Divide the pastry in half. Roll each half into a round of about 9-inches in diameter and let rest while you make the filling. Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Whisk in 2 of the yolks, the almond essence, kirsch and the ground almonds. Work together until you have a smooth paste. Rinse a sheet pan under cold water. Place one of the pastry rounds on the tray and spoon the paste onto it, leaving a 2-inch margin all around. Hide the bean or the other objects in the paste.

Bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and let simmer for 10 minutes. If foam forms on the surface, use a large wide spoon to spoon it off and discard. Carefully transfer the pieces with a slotted spoon or tongs to a colander and rinse under cold water. Place colander over a large bowl and set aside. Discard the water. In a medium bowl, whisk the oyster sauce, soy sauce and sugar together until combined. Set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large wide nonstick skillet or Dutch oven over high heat. Once shimmering, add the remaining ginger coins, the carrots and onions. Toss until the vegetables are well coated in the oil and slightly golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. This will prevent the carrots from breaking apart during braising. Transfer the vegetables to a 6-quart Instant Pot?. Return the skillet to high heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of canola oil and heat until shimmering. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ketchup and bring to a full boil, about 30 seconds. Add the blanched oxtail pieces. Toss until the oxtail is fully coated. Add the oyster sauce mixture to the skillet and toss until everything is coated and the sauce is syrupy. Let simmer until the sauce has slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Taste the sauce and season with more soy sauce if needed. Transfer to the pot with the carrots. Add 4 cups of water. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 1 hour 30 minutes (see Cook\u2019s Note). After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer\u2019s guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete (this should take about 2 minutes). Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid. Skim up to 1/2 cup of fat from the top of the stew. Set to high sear/saut and add the tomatoes.

Bring the pot to a medium high heat. While doing this be careful not to swish the pan around because it could cause the sugar to recrystallize. As the sugar/water mixture boils the water will eventually evaporate and the sugar will begin to turn brown or to \caramelize. Pay close attention! Things can take a terrible turn for the worse here and there will be no recovery. As the sugar begins to turn a shade of golden, then light brown and then a slight shade of darker brown, remove it from the heat and add the heavy cream. As you do this, it will bubble up like crazy. Be sure to have a pot large enough to accommodate the bubbling up. Getting this on you could cause a very severe burn. Whisk the sugar/cream mixture until things settle down and add the butter 2 pats at a time, be sure the pats have completely incorporated before adding more butter. Let cool and put into jars.

(NOTE: Males are usually larger.) A bushel is enough for 2 to 3 pots of crabs, depending on their size. 2 (12-ounce) cans beer 4 cups water<br> 1 (8-ounce) packet crab boil seasoning, usually available where crabs are purchased<br> 2 sticks butter, melted (optional) Instructions: Eating guidelines: It is easier to learn how to eat crabs from an expert, but if none is available, here are step-by-step instructions. First, pull off claws and legs. Break legs and check for meat. Sucking is okay. Some like to save the claws for last because they are rather dessert-like, although the \lump\ meat from the body is prized most. Next, turn the crab on its back. You will see an elongated part of the shell that looks like a \T.\ Some call it the key, even though it doesn&#39;t look very much like one. The female key is plumper; the male&#39;s is more elongated. Pull the key back, breaking it off, which makes the rest of the shell easy to remove. Now the body of the crab is shell-less. You will now see the long rib-like strips on either side of the cavity. These are the crab&#39;s gills. Edible, but not very good. Pull them off, and you will more easily be able to break the crab in half. When you do this, you will most likely now see a good amount of white, fleshy \lump\ crab meat. Continue opening the small sections to expose more meat. You will not need mallets or hammers for this. When you are ready for the claws, break them in half at the joint. Take a wooden mallet and whack the large half hard. Don&#39;t be shy. Other helpful hints: Don&#39;t wear your Sunday best. If it tastes good, you can eat it. Plates and cutlery are unnecessary; the brown paper is a communal plate. Bibs are for babies. When finished, steamed hand towels are very welcome. The easiest way to dispose of the mess is to roll up the brown paper with all the shells, etc. on it -- taking care to \rescue\ knives, bowls, etc. first -- and discard in outdoor trash can. The garbage may attract animals, so be sure to keep the lid on tight. Note: Leftover crabs are excellent cold, served with a mayonnaise based dipping sauce. Cooked crabs will keep in refrigerator for a few days. Cover tables, preferably outdoors, with brown packaging paper and tape. For each pot of crabs, add water, beer, and approximately 1/4 packet of crab boil seasoning to pot. Bring to boil. With gloves on, remove crabs from bushel, you may have to pull them apart (carefully!) and put/shake a few at a time into pot. It is best to grab them from behind to avoid the claws, as their legs only move forward. Add enough crabs to fill bottom of pot. Sprinkle more crab boil seasoning over first layer of crabs. Continue, alternating crabs and seasoning until pot is nearly full, leaving about an inch at the top. Cover tightly. Steam over high heat for 14 to 16 minutes, or until shells are bright orange. Halfway through cooking time, shake pot to redistribute seasoning. When done, remove pot from heat. Drain over sink the accumulated liquid from pot. Spread crabs onto large tray; place in center of table where guests help themselves. Serve with small dishes of melted butter and, for those who like added seasoning, place small bowls of extra crab boil seasoning on table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29855,&quot;Hot Chocolate Brownies Cooking spray 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled 1 cup sugar 3 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup hot chocolate or cocoa mix 1 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips 72 mini marshmallows Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Do not thaw before using.) 3 tablespoons butter, margarine or olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, minced 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 green or red sweet bell pepper, seeded and minced (or use a combination of both peppers) 2 cups long grain white rice (preferably Basmati or Texmati rice) 4 cups rich well seasoned Chicken Stock or \doctored\ *canned broth Freshly ground black pepper Salt to taste Optional: 1 tablespoon additional butter or margarine Instructions: If using fresh corn: After removing the husks and silk, cut the kernels from the cobs using a sharp knife (being careful not to cut into the cob itself). Place the kernels into a bowl and using the knife, scrape up and down the shaft of the cob (over the bowl of corn) extracting the natural \corn cream. If using canned or frozen corn, simply begin with step #2. To saute the vegetables: Melt the butter (or heat the oil) in a 2 1/2 quart heavy bottomed sauce pot (one that comes with a tight fitting lid). When hot, add the onions and garlic and saute for 3 minutes. Add the green pepper and saute until all the vegetables are softened and very fragrant, about 5 minutes over meduimlow heat. To toast the rice: If using an \aromatic\ rice, rinse it through a sieve (medium mesh) and drain well (see note). Add the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring to coat the rice with the butter and vegetables. Cook for about 3 minutes or until the rice is dry and beginning to turn golden. To simmer (see note): Add the hot broth and return to a boil. Stir in the corn (whether fresh, drained canned or frozen), and bring back to a boil. Cover the pot and turn the heat to low. Simmer over a low flame for exactly 17 minutes without lifting the lid. To \settle\ and serve: Uncover and add a good amount of fresh pepper and some salt to taste. If desired, stir in 1 tablespoon of additional butter or margarine. Fluff with a fork, and cover the pot. Allow the rice to settle for 3 to 5 minutes to absorb any excess moisture. Serve hot. Time Management Tips:</p><ol><li>For extra ease of preparation when assembling, all listed fresh vegetables can be chopped as much as one day ahead and kept refrigerated in separate (well covered) bowls.</li><li>The stock can be made months ahead and kept frozen in securely covered, heavy freezer containers. \Variation\ Tips:</li><li>Changing the type of stock can give your rice dish a totally different taste and (at times) color. Choose your stock according to your menu and don&#39;t be afraid to mix different types of stock,vegetables (and herbs) to create an even more complex flavor. Also, always thaw more stock than you&#39;ll need so you can boil it down until the volume is reduced (which will concentrate the flavor). Some winning combinations of stock: Beef and chicken, chicken and shrimp, veal and beef, veal and chicken or chicken and fish. Tips From a Teacher: The most renown type of aromatic rice is Basmati rice which (once grown only in Pakistan and India), is now also grown here in the United States. This type of rice is special (although pricey) not only for it&#39;s nutty, butterlike and seductive flavor, but during cooking, the grains swell much more in length than in width, making the feel of the cooked rice more distinctive in the mouth. Basmati rice is also lower in starch which encourages the grains to remain separate. Jasmine rice, another long grain white rice once grown exclusively in Thailand, is now also grown here and the flavor is similar to Basmati although the texture is somewhat softer when cooked. The other readilyavailable types of aromatic rice are grown here and come in both white, tan and brown varieties. All of the new domestic breeds of rice are an attempt to duplicate the flavor and aroma of Basmati, at a more affordable price. They can be identified as Texmati, Wehani and Popcorn rice (also called Wild Pecan rice). These are all delicious and lend their own unique characteristics to the finished dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 29870,&quot;Mile-High Pecan Pie 2 tablespoons cornstarch 3 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks 3/4 cup dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 stick plus 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/3 cup plus 1/4 cup maple syrup 1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt 1 cup heavy cream 4 cups pecans 1 frozen unbaked 10-inch deep-dish pie shell<br> Instructions: Place a sheet pan in the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.

Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, the flour, 1 1/2 tablespoons rosemary, the fine salt and 3/4 cup warm water; stir with a wooden spoon (or with the dough hook if using a mixer) until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, dusting lightly with flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. (Or knead with the dough hook on medium-high speed, adding a little flour if the dough sticks to the bowl, about 8 minutes.) Brush a large bowl with olive oil. Add the dough, cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until more than doubled, about 2 hours. Brush 2 baking sheets with olive oil. Generously flour a work surface; turn the dough out onto the flour and divide into 4 pieces. Working with one piece at a time, sprinkle some flour on the dough, then fold the top and bottom portions into the middle. Fold in the sides to make a free-form square. Use a spatula to turn the dough over, then tuck the corners under to form a ball. Place seam-side down on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough, putting 2 balls on each baking sheet. Let stand, uncovered, until more than doubled, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

In a medium saucepan cook the cream with the vanilla bean and salt over moderate heat until the surface begins to shimmer. In a large heatproof bowl, blend the egg yolks and granulated sugar with a wooden spoon. Slowly add the hot cream mixture, stirring gently. Strain the custard into a large measuring cup; skim off any bubbles. Arrange 8 shallow 4 1/2-inch wide ramekins in a roasting pan (see note). Slowly pour the custard into the ramekins, filling them almost to the top. Set the roasting pan in the center of the oven and carefully pour in enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the pan loosely with foil and bake for about 1 hour, or until the custards are firm at the edges, but still a bit wobbly in the center. Transfer the ramekins to a wire rack to cool completely. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. Preheat the broiler. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet and blot the surfaces of the custards to remove any condensation. Using a small sieve, sift 2 teaspoons of the turbinado sugar over each custard in a thin, even layer. Broil the custards as close to the heat as possible until the sugar is evenly caramelized, 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29879,&quot;Nutella and Banana Sandwiches 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 8 (1/2-inch thick) slices Pullman bread or pain de mie 1/4 cup sugar mixed together with 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1 jar chocolate hazelnut spread (recommended: Nutella) 2 ripe bananas, sliced 1/4-inch thick 1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts, toasted Whole strawberries, for serving Instructions: Heat a griddle or large nonstick saute pan over medium heat.

Place in a large bowl and wash under cold, running water until water runs clear, about 10 minutes. Drain in a colander. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan. Saute onions with salt and pepper until golden brown. Add garlic and ginger, and cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add dal and chicken stock or water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, covered, 20 minutes. Just before dal is ready, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a small skillet. Add the neem leaves and black mustard seeds and fry until leaves are crisp and seeds are popping, about 1 minute. Stir fried leaves and seeds into dal and serve immediately. Dal keeps well for 2 to 3 days. Reheat before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner, Riesling]&quot; 29881,&quot;Dill Pickles 5 1/2 ounces pickling salt, approximately 1/2 cup 1 gallon filtered water 3 pounds pickling cucumbers, 4 to 6-inches long 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 teaspoon dill seed 1 large bunch dill Instructions: Combine the salt and water in a pitcher and stir until the salt has dissolved. Rinse the cucumbers thoroughly and snip off the blossom end stem. Set aside. Place the peppercorns, pepper flakes, garlic, dill seed and fresh dill into a 1-gallon crock. Add the cucumbers to the crock on top of the aromatics. Pour the brine mixture over the cucumbers in order to completely cover. Pour the remaining water into a 1-gallon ziptop plastic bag and seal. Place the bag on top of the pickles making sure that all of them are completely submerged in the brine. Set in a cool, dry place. Check the crock after 3 days. Fermentation has begun if you see bubbles rising to the top of the crock. After this, check the crock daily and skim off any scum that forms. If scum forms on the plastic bag, rinse it off and return to the top of the crock. The fermentation is complete when the pickles taste sour and the bubbles have stopped rising; this should take approximately 6 to 7 days. Once this happens, cover the crock loosely and place in the refrigerator for 3 days, skimming daily or as needed. Store for up to 2 months in the refrigerator, skimming as needed. If the pickles should become soft or begin to take on an off odor, this is a sign of spoilage and they should be discarded. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]</p><p>&quot; 29882,&quot;Prosciutto And Mozzarella Panini 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 2 teaspoons minced fresh oregano, or 1 teaspoon dried 1 teaspoon minced garlic Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 8 1/2-inch-thick slices ciabatta or other rustic Italian white bread 4 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella cheese 4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto 6 ounces jarred roasted red peppers,drained and torn into 1-inch-wide pieces Instructions: Whisk the olive oil, vinegar, oregano, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl to blend.

Add the water and mix using a rubber spatula until the dough comes together. The dough should be a little sticky, but soft and able to hold its shape. Add up to 1/2 cup more flour, if needed. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead until it\u2019s soft, smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Alternatively, you can use a stand mixer and knead until the dough becomes soft and elastic, about 5 minutes. The dough might be just a little sticky and that\u2019s okay. Place the dough in a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Place in a draft-free area, such as a turned-off oven, until doubled in size, about 90 minutes.<br> Gently deflate the dough by pressing it down with your hands. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and divide into 8 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball and gently flatten. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 20 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, place a cast-iron griddle on an outdoor grill and heat it to medium high (450 degrees F) with the lid closed. Alternatively, you can use a large cast-iron skillet.<br> Use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll out 1 piece of dough into a round about 1/4-inch thick, flipping the dough a few times to prevent it from sticking. Meanwhile, keep the remaining pieces of dough covered with a kitchen towel. Transfer the rolled-out pitas to a baking sheet and cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining dough, stacking the rounds with a flour-dusted piece of parchment or wax paper between each round to prevent them from sticking.<br> Brush the griddle lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle a little water on a rolled-out pita and place it on the griddle. You can cook 2 pitas at a time on a grill pan and 1 pita at a time on a cast-iron skillet. Close the grill and cook until there are small light brown spots on the pita, about 2 1/2 minutes on each side. Some of the pitas will puff up as they cook. Transfer to a platter and cover with a clean towel to prevent them from drying out. Repeat with the remaining rolled-out pitas. (It shouldn\u2019t be necessary to re-oil the griddle if it is well-seasoned.)

Place a heavy cast-iron skillet (preferably 12 inch) into the oven to preheat. Chill a large mixing bowl, pastry cutter, the flour and 1 stick of the butter in the freezer 15 minutes before assembling the biscuits. Add the flour to the chilled mixing bowl. Working quickly, cut 1 stick of the butter into the flour using the chilled pastry cutter (or your fingers); the goal here is pea-size balls of butter. In batches, add in the buttermilk until the dough is cohesive yet still moist. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly press into a 1-inch-thick round. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter or the business end of a dry measuring cup, cut out 10 biscuits. (Use the extra dough to cook up a big piece of shortcake for dessert....strawberry shortcake!) Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and add the oil. Place the dough rounds into the hot skillet, right up against each other, and brush with the melted butter. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29891,&quot;Dried Cherry Rice Pudding 3 cups whole milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 cup uncooked white rice 1/2 cup dried cherries that have been rehydrated in 1/4 cup warm brandy 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 cup heavy cream Instructions: Combine the milk, vanilla, and cinnamon in a heavy pot.

Transfer the mixture to a storage container and refrigerate for 2 hours. In a large heavy-bottomed sauce pan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a 1/3 of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 360 degrees F. (If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) Remove the croquette mixture from refrigerator and shape into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch thick patties and coat with white cracker crumbs. Use an ice cream scoop to keep portion sizes the same. Fry the croquettes until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels and season with salt. Serve with Garlic Aioli. Combine all ingredients thoroughly.

Season fish inside and out with salt and pepper. Pour about 1 tablespoon of oil into a large roasting pan, reserving the rest of the oil. Lay the fish in the pan and holding the sliced side of the lemon half against your palm, squeeze the juice into the inside cavity of the fish. Stuff the inside cavity with shallots, cilantro, and the thyme. Slice the rest of the lemon and lay the slices on the top (outside surface) of the fish and drizzle the rest of the oil on the outside of the fish. Roast until internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F, about 20 minutes. (There will be some carryover cooking even after you remove fish from oven.) Let rest and transfer to a platter.

Spread the Brussels sprouts out on a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with the oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Bake, stirring the sprouts once halfway through cooking, until golden brown and tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack and let cool completely. Leave the oven on. Sprinkle the Parmesan evenly on a work surface and lay the pastry sheet over it. Roll the dough into a 12-inch square, sweeping up any loose cheese onto the dough and pressing it in place. Use an offset spatula or table knife to spread the butter over the pastry so it covers it from edge to edge in a thin, even coating. Lay the prosciutto over the butter so it covers the pastry completely. Cut the pastry square in half to make two 12-by-6-inch rectangles. Cut each rectangle crosswise into eight 1 1/2-inch-wide, 6-inch-long strips. Then cut each strip diagonally lengthwise so you have 32 long, narrow triangles. Place a Brussels sprout at the wide end of each triangle, then roll it up in each strip toward the tip (it will look like a crescent roll with the Brussels sprout peeking out on each end).<br> Transfer each bundle to a parchment-lined baking sheet and space 1 inch apart. Rake up all the excess Parmesan on the work surface and sprinkle it on top of the rolls. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the Brussels sprouts are warmed through, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 29934,&quot;Jerky Tomato Sauce 3 to 4 ounces beef jerky 1 cup boiling water 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/2 cup chopped onion 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper Pinch kosher salt 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 (14.5-ounce) can chopped tomatoes 1 teaspoon dried parsley 1/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: Using kitchen shears, cut the jerky into small bite-size pieces.

Place the beets on a large piece of aluminum foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Place the orange peels among the beets. Fold the aluminum foil up and around the beets to create a closed packet. Place the packet on a baking sheet and roast until the beets are tender and the edges of the orange peels begin to caramelize, 45 to 50 minutes. Open the packet carefully and discard the orange peels. Allow the beets to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the components of the salad: Slice the peeled oranges into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Use a horizontal peeler to make long, thin strips of the cucumber from end to end. Make the dressing by whisking the Greek yogurt with the mint and lemon zest and juice in a small bowl. Season the dressing with salt and pepper. Set aside. Once the beets have cooled slightly, use the edge of a paring knife to peel off the skins. Slice the beets into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. To assemble the salad, arranges the sliced beets in a shingled pattern on a serving platter. In between every 2 to 3 slices of beets, slip a round of orange into the mix. Using a small spoon, dollop the yogurt dressing onto the salad. Curl the cucumber ribbons over the surface of the salad. Drizzle the platter with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with the pistachios and pomegranate seeds. Serve chilled or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 29936,&quot;Italian Greens and Herb Salad 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons grated lemon peel 1 teaspoon honey 1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning 1/2 cup olive oil 1 head romaine lettuce, coarsely chopped 4 Belgian endives, thinly sliced crosswise 1 cup pitted kalamata olives, halved 1 cup (lightly packed) fresh Italian parsley leaves, coarsely chopped 3/4 cup (lightly packed) fresh basil leaves, torn into bite-size pieces Instructions: Blend the lemon juice, lemon peel, honey, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper in a blender.

Add the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the milk and 2 tablespoons sugar. Add with the remaining milk to the flour. (If using dry yeast, mix the yeast with 2 tablespoons of the milk and 2 tablespoons sugar and let sit until foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes and add to the flour.) Add the eggs and butter to the flour mixture. Begin to mix the ingredients into a soft, but not sticky, dough. Add a little extra milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. Work in extra flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. (You can do this in a mixer fitted with a dough hook.) Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Punch down the risen dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a few seconds. With a lightly floured rolling pin, gradually roll out the dough to about 1/2-inch thick. When rolling dough, let it rest periodically to relax. Cut out into 3 to 4-inch rounds with a lightly floured biscuit cutter. Re-roll the scraps to make more rounds. Place the doughnuts on lightly floured baking sheets, spacing them apart, and cover lightly with a dry towel. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 20 minutes. Transfer the risen doughnuts to a heavy pot filled 3-inches high with vegetable oil at 350 degrees F. Fry the doughnuts, a few at a time, until golden and puffed, turning frequently, 5 to 7 minutes. Lift the doughnuts from the oil using a slotted spoon and roll on a plate lined with granulated sugar and cinnamon mixed together. Let cool slightly and fill a pastry bag, fitted with a 1/2-inch round tip with jelly preserves. Insert the tip into the end of each doughnut and pipe approximately 1 to 2 teaspoons preserves into them and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 29959,&quot;Ranch Risotto 4 slices good quality bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces 1/2 yellow onion, diced small 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 cups Arborio rice 3/4 cup dry white wine 4 cups chicken stock, heated 1/2 cup ranch dressing 4 tablespoons heavy cream 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage 6-ounces Maytag blue cheese (about 1 1/2 cups) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 2 tablespoons chopped tomato, for garnish Instructions: In a large, wide-mouthed pot over medium heat, add the bacon right away and cook evenly, stirring often, until it just begins to crisp. Add the onions and the garlic. Cook this until it becomes aromatic and softens up a bit. Add the rice and stir to coat the rice in rendered bacon fat and cook for about 1 minute, continually stirring. Pour in the wine and stir until its absorbed by the rice. Using a large ladle, add the hot stock in a ladleful at a time, just covering the rice and stirring until the stock gets absorbed by the rice. When rice absorbs the stock, add another ladleful. Continue until the rice starts to look creamy as the liquid is reducing down, about 18 to 20 minutes total. Taste the rice. The grains should be cooked through with some bite left. Add in the ranch dressing, cream, herbs, and blue cheese. Stirring a lot over medium heat, allow all the ingredients to meld together and then pull into a thicker texture. The more you stir the better the results. After the rice becomes a creamy mixture, taste, and season with salt, and pepper, if needed. Transfer the risotto to a large shallow bowl, top with a sprinkling of chopped tomato, and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 29960,&quot;George&#39;s Bank Halibut with Savoy Cabbage, Garlic Confit andFingerling Potatoes in Lobster Cream 4 fingerling or new potatoes, unpeeled 1 small carrot, cut into 1/4-inch dice 1 small (about 1-pound) head Savoy cabbage, outer leaves discarded, cut into 1/2-inch wide shreds 1/4 cup chicken stock 1 cup Lobster Cream, recipe follows Garlic Confit, recipe follows 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Coarse salt and freshly ground white pepper<br> Coarse salt and freshly ground white pepper 4 halibut fillets, about 7-ounces each 3 tablespoons canola oil 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives, for garnish 1 (1-pound) lobster body (no meat) 1 small carrot, diced 1 small white onion, diced 2 sprigs fresh thyme 2 teaspoons canola oil 1/4 cup dry sherry 1 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon tomato paste Salt and white pepper 20 large garlic cloves, unpeeled 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon water Coarse salt and freshly ground white pepper Instructions: In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the potatoes until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, shred the chicken and set aside. Reserve 3 1/3 cups of the broth (1 cup is for the chicken gravy, supplement with boxed stock if you don&#39;t have enough.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 13- by 9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. In a large saucepan, combine 2 1/3 cups of the reserved broth, the Chicken Gravy, green chiles, onions, garlic, sour cream, cumin, salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat. Spread 1 cup of the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Arrange a layer of 6 tortillas over the mixture, and then top with 1 cup shredded chicken and 1/2 cup of the Cheddar.

Remove 1/2 cup and pulse in a spice grinder or mini food processor, leaving it quite coarse. Reserve remaining seed mixture for the bagel topping. For the dough: Combine the water, honey, yeast, salt and 1 tablespoon of the barley malt in a spouted measuring cup. Combine both flours in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the yeast mixture and beat on low speed with the dough hook just to combine. Knead until almost smooth and slightly sticky but forms a loose ball, about 5 minutes. (Add a little more water if the dough is too crumbly or a little more flour if it is too loose to form a ball. The dough should form a loose, slightly sticky ball that is almost but not completely smooth.) Add the coarsely ground seed mixture and continue to knead until well distributed, 1 to 2 minutes more. The dough should be smooth and springy. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature 1 hour before ready to use. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface. Divide it into 12 equal parts, roll and work each into smooth balls, making sure to seal any dough seams well. Shape the bagels by sticking your thumb through the center of each ball and using your fingers to gently stretch a 2-inch-wide hole in the center. Cover the bagels with a towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F with racks in the top and lower thirds. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the baking soda and remaining tablespoon of barley malt. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and grease them well. Also lay out a clean kitchen towel near your pot of boiling water. Spread the remaining seed mixture in a shallow bowl. Working with 3 bagels at a time, boil them for 1 minute on each side (use a timer for this). Use a slotted spoon or spatula to transfer them briefly to the kitchen towel to catch any excess moisture. Dip the bottoms in the seed mixture and then transfer them to the baking sheets. Brush the bagels with the egg white and sprinkle the tops with more seed mixture and a little flaky salt. Bake the bagels for 8 minutes, switching the pans on the racks and rotating the pans 180 degrees, and then continue to bake until golden brown, begin checking at 8 minutes. Let cool slightly. Split a bagel and to one half add a schmear of cream cheese, slices of blueberry lox, tomato, cucumber, red onions, capers, dill and a squeeze of lemon for the bagel sandwich of your dreams. Frozen bagels will keep for up to a month; reheat in the toaster. In a large mixing bowl, combine the blueberries, salt, sugar, liquid smoke, cilantro, lemon zest and a bunch of turns of black pepper. Lay a large piece of plastic wrap down on a work surface and place a small handful of the blueberry mixture in the middle. (I recommend wearing gloves for this.) Place half of the filet skin-side down over the mixture, top it with most of the remaining blueberry mixture, and then top that with the other half of the filet, flesh-side down. Cover the top and sides with the remaining blueberry mixture, making sure that all parts of the fish are covered. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, place on a rimmed baking sheet, cover it with a cutting board and weigh it down with something heavy (such as: a few bricks, some cans or a cast iron pot). Refrigerate for 2 to 4 days (depending on how cured you like your lox; 4 days will make a firmer and saltier lox) flipping every 12 hours and pouring out any juices as they accumulate in the pan. It\u2019s ready when the fish is firm to the touch. Rinse off the curing mixture, pat it dry, and slice it as thinly as possible. Enjoy!

Start on a slow speed until blended, then turn it up to the highest speed until it is light and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla to the mixture and mix on medium speed until the eggs are fully broken up and combined. Do not over mix this part. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together, add to the mixture and mix until combined. Add the sour cream and buttermilk and mix until combined. Add the espresso, and mix until it is combined. If you are using hot espresso shots, then pour them slowly into the mixture so that it does not begin to cook the eggs. Add the chocolate chips and mix them until combined. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Grease and flour a bundt cake pan. Scoop the cake mixture into the prepared pan. Place the cake on a cookie sheet and bake for 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours, or until an inserted knife comes clean from the cake. Placing the cake on a cookie sheet is just a suggestion to keep your oven clean, in case the cake mixture spills over the sides of the pan. Let the cake cool, then remove it from the pan upside down. Garnish it with powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 29970,&quot;Big Dog Sandwich One 6-inch hoagie roll 7 ounces chopped Brisket, recipe follows 7 ounces Pulled Pork, recipe follows<br> 1/2 link All Beef Hot Links, recipe follows 1 tablespoon BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 1 tablespoons Mustard BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 2 ounces Feta Slaw, recipe follows One 12-pound brisket or 1 whole bone-in pork butt (Boston butt ) 4 ounces ground pepper<br> 4 ounces salt<br> 4 ounces brown sugar<br> 3 ounces paprika 2 ounces chili powder<br> 2 ounces garlic powder<br> 2 ounces onion powder<br> 1400 grams beef (not a fatty cut) 450 grams beef fat<br> 40 grams minced garlic<br> 34 grams sea salt<br> 11 grams cl flakes<br> 7.5 grams black peppercorns<br> 6 grams pink curing salt<br> 5 grams cayenne pepper<br> 4.5 grams coriander seeds<br> 2.5 gallons ketchup 6 cups apple cider vinegar<br> 4 cups molasses<br> 3 cups steak sauce, such as A-1 2 cups mustard 1 cup Worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup BBQ rub<br> 1/2 cup garlic pepper<br> 1/2 cup ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 2 gallons Creole mustard, such as Zatarain&#39;s 12 cups honey<br> 12 cups apple cider vinegar<br> 5 cups raspberry jelly<br> 4 cups ketchup 2 cups BBQ rub<br> 1 cup Worcestershire sauce 4 pounds shredded green cabbage 2 cups shredded red cabbage 2 cups julienne carrots (cut into thin matchsticks) 2 cups crumbled feta 2 cups diced green onion 1 cup red wine vinegar 1 cup white wine vinegar 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon salt Instructions: Open the hoagie roll.

Chop the thyme and rosemary leaves, orange zest and garlic together finely. Put into a bowl with the ground spices, then add the rest of the marinade ingredients and mix together.<br> Rub your chosen meat all over with the marinade, really getting it into all the nooks and crannies and, in case of the lamb, the slashes. Place the meat in a snug-fitting roasting pan, top with any leftover marinade and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Bake the meat in the preheated oven until sweet and tender. This will take 1 1/2 hours for the pork ribs and the lamb (but if you like your lamb pink, it will only need 1 hour), and 1 hour and 20 minutes for the chicken.<br> Now you&#39;re going to finish your meat on a medium hot barbecue. Place it carefully on the bars of the barbecue and sear it well on 1 side, then turn it over. While it&#39;s cooking, use your reserved rosemary sprigs to baste the meat with the sticky juices from the bottom of the roasting pan. Keep turning and brushing the meat until you&#39;ve built up a lovely sticky, charred crust, then take it off the barbie and rest it on a serving dish for a few minutes. Meanwhile, pop your roasting pan on the barbie or over a gas burner and let the juices reduce a bit.<br> Cut the pork into individual ribs, carve the leg of lamb into slices or tear the chicken into pieces, and serve with a bowl of the lovely marinade juices from the roasting pan.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 29973,&quot;S&#39;Mauros 1 cup hot fudge (from one 11.75-ounce jar) 2 cups coarsely crushed graham crackers (from about 10 sheets), plus more for topping 1 cup marshmallow creme Instructions: Heat the hot fudge according to the package instructions.

Dissolve the yeast in the water. With the mixer running at low speed, add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Add the eggs and mix well. Add the butter and mix at medium speed until smooth, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. The next day, turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Roll dough into a 9 by 13-inch rectangle, about 1/2-inch thick. Place on a sheet pan. Loosely drape plastic wrap over the dough and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the plastic wrap from the brioche dough and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. After 10 minutes, rotate the pan to ensure even cooking. When baked, immediately remove to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature. Vanilla Custard: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Let cool slightly. Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. (The custard can be made up to 48 hours in advance.) With a serrated knife, slice the sheet of brioche in half lengthwise. Spread the bottom and top generously with custard. Place washed and dried rose petals over the custard, covering the surface entirely. Place the top brioche on and press lightly.

Grease 2 (2 1/2-inch) wide-mouth canning jars with a paper towel dipped in shortening. Sift flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and baking soda into a large bowl. Using the electric mixer and a medium mixing bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar on low speed, then increase to medium mixing speed to mix well. While the mixer is running, add the eggs, one at a time. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides. Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the applesauce. With a large spoon, stir in the sifted flour mixture and the walnuts. Pour the batter into a measuring cup with a spout; pour the batter neatly into greased jars. Fill the jars halfway full. Place the filled jars on the sheet tray and bake on the center rack of the oven for 45 minutes. When done, the top of the cake will spring back when pressed with a finger, and the sides will have come away from the jar. Remove from oven and let cool 10 to 15 minutes. Cake will still be warm, but not hot. Place a circle of waxed paper on top of the jar and seal with the jar lid.

Add the juice from half of the orange and half of the lemon. Taste to see if it has a fresh taste from the citrus. If not, add the juice from the remaining fruit halves. Whisk to blend and set aside. With a small paring knife, cut around the center of each peach to halve it and remove the pit. Place the peach halves on a flat surface and cut them into 1/2-inch thick slices. Heat a small saute pan and add the honey. It should start to foam and bubble. Keep the heat low and allow the honey to simmer gently. Note: the honey becomes extremely hot - be careful to keep the heat low. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. When it begins to froth and turn light brown on the edges, add the peach slices and stir to coat with the butter. Cook, stirring from time to time, until the peaches become tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the lime zest and juice. Stir to blend. Meanwhile, check the honey. It should be a golden brown. If the foam prevents you from seeing the color, remove the pot from the heat and blow on the center of the foam to see the color beneath. Pour the honey over the peaches and stir to blend. Remove the skillet from the heat and spoon the peaches into individual serving plates or a platter. Top with the Streusel Topping and a dollop of the sour cream. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix together until incorporated and in clumps. Place onto a baking sheet and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown.

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours. Prepare a campfire or charcoal grill for cooking at medium-high heat (you&#39;ll know it&#39;s ready when you can hold your hand about 2 inches above the fire or grates for only 2 to 3 seconds).<br> Put the cauliflower on a clean work surface, stem-side down, and rub the salt paste all over the florets until they are completely covered. Flip the cauliflower in your hands (you may want to flour your hands if the cauliflower is a little sticky); holding it by the exposed stem, gently nestle it into the coals. Cook, rotating occasionally by grasping the stem with grilling tongs, until the stem is tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife and the crust is blackened all over, 35 to 40 minutes. Try not to crack the crust so that it stays sealed and the cauliflower can steam while it roasts. Transfer to a baking sheet and let cool for 5 minutes, then use tongs to crack the crust from the cauliflower and discard it.<br> While the cauliflower is cooking, put the bell peppers in the coals and cook, turning frequently with the tongs, until blackened. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and cover with a plate to steam and soften, about 10 minutes. When cool enough to handle, peel the skin from the peppers, remove all the seeds and discard skin and seeds. Set peppers aside.<br> Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the garlic along with the bread pieces.

Add the water, sesame oil and 2 tablespoons of the neutral oil. Mix on low speed until a shaggy dough comes together, scraping down the sides as necessary. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until the dough is soft and smooth and it pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove the dough from the bowl, divide in half and transfer each portion of dough to an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic or a clean towel and allow to double in size, about 1 hour. Turn out the doughs, one at a time, onto a lightly floured surface. Roll each into a 14-inch circle that is about 1/4 inch thick. Brush the surface of each with a thin layer of sesame oil and then scatter the scallions equally over each. Roll each into a tight jelly roll. Gently stretch each log and then coil into a spiral snail shape. Press to flatten slightly and set on a dusted baking sheet. Cover with plastic or a clean towel and allow to proof for 20 to 30 minutes or until puffy. Arrange an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat an ovensafe, 8-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of neutral oil, swirl it around and heat until shimmery. Take one of the pancakes and flatten with your hands to the size of the pan. Brush the top with water and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of the sesame seeds. Place the pancake in the oil, sesame-side facing up, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes (you can swirl it around but try not to disturb it too much), until the underside is deep golden. Flip with a spatula, transfer to the oven and bake for 10 minutes or until both sides are deep golden and it sounds hollow when you tap on it. Invert onto a rack and cool for a few minutes. Slice and sprinkle with flaky salt to serve. Repeat with the remaining dough, neutral oil and sesame seeds.
