few \pulses\ until it is lightly powdered. Combine with the granulated sugar, salt, onion powder, granulated garlic, cayenne, black pepper, mustard, chili powder, cumin and paprika in a bowl and hand stir until well incorporated. Store in an airtight container. For the BBQ mother sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat to low if the onion is cooking too fast--you don&#39;t want it caramelized or browned. As the onion is getting close, add the garlic and cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes longer. Add the ketchup, honey, tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire, dry mustard, cayenne and black pepper and stir well. Slowly add up to 1/2 cup water until the sauce reaches the consistency you like. A slightly thick consistency is best. Add about 3 tablespoons of the basic BBQ rub, stir well and taste. The sauce should have a good, well-rounded flavor. Add more of the basic BBQ rub in 1-tablespoon increments until your desired flavor is achieved, up to about 1/2 cup total. Cool and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. For the ribs: Rinse the ribs and remove the membrane from the back. Trim any excess fat from the tops of the slabs. Trim 1 bone from the large end of the ribs and 2 bones from the small end. This will give you a much more consistent slab for cooking. Starting on the backs, sprinkle the slabs of ribs with approximately 1/2 tablespoon of the basic BBQ rub each, then add 1/2 tablespoon yellow mustard each and massage into the meat. Flip the ribs over and repeat. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. For a contest, I marinate ribs like this for 12 to 16 hours. Prepare a smoker to run at 225 degrees F with around 4 chunks of apple wood and 4 chunks of cherry wood so that the wood will smolder throughout the cooking. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator, unwrap and repeat the basic BBQ rub and mustard procedure, massaging them in. Don&#39;t get it too thick or paste-like, as this will give you a dark appearance when cooked. Place the ribs in the smoker meat-side up and cook for 2 hours. Remove the ribs from the smoker and increase the temperature to 250 degrees F. Apply the basic BBQ rub and mustard to both sides of the ribs as before. On the top sides, slather approximately 1 tablespoon of honey over the surface of each slab, then sprinkle heavily with the turbinado sugar. Lay each slab of ribs meat-side up on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil and fold up the edges. Pour approximately 1 to 2 ounces of the grape juice into the bottom of each foil package, then finish wrapping the ribs but don&#39;t crimp the edges--you want steam to be able to escape. Return the ribs to the cooker for 2 hours, then test for tenderness. (I cook ribs in this stage until they look overdone and too tender. Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll tighten up. If they still have too much texture, leave them in for 20 to 30 more minutes.) Remove the ribs from the cooker, open the foil and drain off the liquid. Using the foil as a tool, \roll\ the ribs over so the bone side is up, glaze with the BBQ mother sauce, then roll them back over and glaze the tops. Using long tongs, carefully remove the ribs from the foil and place them back in the smoker for 15 minutes. This will let the glaze cook onto the ribs and let the ribs tighten back up. Remove from the cooker and allow to rest for 5 minutes, apply a very thin coat of sauce to \glisten\ the ribs, then lightly sprinkle with chipotle powder before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Merlot]&quot; 49973,&quot;Spinach Salad on Garlic Croutons 2 large eggs 12 slices crusty peasant bread 2 large cloves garlic, halved Extra-virgin olive oil, for liberal drizzling, plus 2 tablespoons 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano<br> 1.4 pound thick cut pancetta, diced 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, sliced 1/4-inch thick or quartered Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup Marsala or dry sherry 1/2 pound farm spinach - available bundled in produce department, washed, dried and chopped 1/2 small red onion, chopped 1 lemon Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the eggs in a pan, cover with water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cover the pan, turn off the heat and let stand 10 minutes. Run the eggs under cold water, crack and return to cold water for a few minutes to loosen shells. Chop the eggs and set aside. Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove baking sheet from the oven and rub with the garlic. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with the cheese, then return to the oven to melt the cheese, about 1 to 2 minutes. While bread toasts, heat a skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, a couple of turns of the pan. Add the pancetta and crisp for about 3 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and deglaze the pan with Marsala or dry sherry. While mushrooms cook, combine spinach with red onions and dress with juice of 1 lemon, a liberal drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and nutmeg. Arrange the toasts on a platter and top with the mushrooms and spinach. Garnish with chopped eggs and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 49974,&quot;Spaghetti with Garlic Mussels in Black Olive Sauce 1/2 cup white wine or chicken broth 1 small shallot, chopped 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives 1/2 cup pitted oil-cured olives 2 tablespoons capers 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 teaspoon anchovy paste 2 cloves garlic Salt 1 pound spaghetti 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 clove garlic, chopped Pinch smoked paprika Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 1 pound mussels, cleaned 1/2 cup white wine or chicken broth Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano Instructions: For the sauce: In a saucepan set over medium heat cook the wine and shallots until the liquid reduces by half. Add the cream and simmer until the sauce thickens. Remove from the heat. Place the kalamata olives, oil-cured olives, basil, lemon juice, olive oil, anchovy paste and garlic in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until just smooth, but still a little chunky. Combine the cream sauce and olive sauce. For the mussels: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, in a separate pot, cook the garlic in the olive oil until just brown. Add the paprika and pepper flakes. Add the mussels. Add the wine and cook to reduce by half. Add the lemon juice, then cover and cook until the mussels open. Throw away any mussels that don&#39;t open. Reserve the mussels and cooking liquid for later use. While the mussels cook, boil the pasta to al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Stir in the butter, parsley and oregano. Toss the spaghetti with the olive sauce, and then spoon some mussels on top with some of the cooking liquid and serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 49975,&quot;Spicy Cajun Chicken Pot Pie One 9-inch round refrigerated pie dough 1 1/2 cups whole milk, plus more, for brushing 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small green bell pepper, diced 1/2 medium onion, chopped 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 8 ounces small red potatoes, diced 3 cups coarsely shredded cooked chicken (from a rotisserie chicken) 1 tablespoon chopped pickled jalapenos Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pie dough on a baking sheet and brush with a little milk. Sprinkle with the thyme and 1/4 teaspoon of the Cajun seasoning. Bake until golden brown and crisp, 15 to 18 minutes. Break into quarters. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bell pepper, onion and remaining 3/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and cook, stirring, about 2 minutes. Gradually pour in the milk while stirring to avoid lumps. Add the potatoes and 2 cups water. Bring to boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are cooked and the liquid is thickened, about 15 minutes.

Mix well to coat. Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat; add 2 tablespoons of canola oil. Pan fry chicken until cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Take half of the chips and divide them between four oven-safe plates, placing the chips in a single layer. Sprinkle 1/2 cup Mexican pinto beans over the chips on each plate. Using half of the shredded Mexican blend cheese, distribute cheese evenly over the chips, making sure each chip has some cheese (no naked chips here). Divide the remaining chips among the plates, placing the second layer in a pile in the center on top of each plate to build a small mountain. Sprinkle the remaining beans and cheese evenly over the chips (remember, no naked chips!). Bake until cheese in the center of the first layer is fully melted, about 15 minutes. While cheese is melting, in a small bowl, mix sweet onion, green onion, cilantro, and lime juice; set aside. Use an oven mitt to remove nachos from oven, and place plates on a heat-safe surface. Sprinkle the onion mixture, cooked Korean chicken, and tomatoes evenly on top of nachos. In a medium bowl, whisk together rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, chili-garlic paste, and 1/3 cup canola oil. Add green and red cabbage, and toss until well coated. When you remove cabbage from the bowl, shake excess marinade off and place a handful of cabbage in the center of each plate of nachos, letting it cascade down over the chips. Top your nacho mountains with a dollop each of sour cream and guacamole. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with your favorite salsa if using. Remember to have plenty of napkins\u2013you&#39;ll need &#39;em! Place soy sauce, gochujang, garlic, ginger, onion, pear, green onion, sesame oil, brown sugar, and sesame seeds in a blender and blend until smooth. Chill until ready to use. Place pinto beans, cumin, garlic powder, white onion and salt into a large pot. Add water to pot until all ingredients are completely immersed. Cover pot with lid, bring water to a boil, then remove the lid and reduce heat to medium. Stir frequently. If the water level drops below the top of the beans, add more water to cover beans. Cook for about 1 hour or until beans are soft. Cool any beans you\u2019re not using immediately before refrigerating them in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 49977,&quot;Honey-Ginger Lemonade 1 cup honey 1/3 cup sliced ginger 1 1/2 cups fresh-squeezed lemon juice<br> Ice cubes, for serving Instructions: Bring 2 cups water, the honey and ginger to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.

Roast them for 50 minutes to 1 hour, depending on their size, until a small sharp knife inserted in the middle indicates that they are tender. Unwrap each beet and set aside for 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle. Peel the beets with a small, sharp knife over a piece of parchment paper to prevent staining your cutting board.<br> Meanwhile, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, mustard, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and set aside. While the beets are still warm, cut each one in half and then each half into 4 to 6 wedges and place them in a large mixing bowl. As you&#39;re cutting the beets, toss them with half of the vinaigrette (warm beets absorb more vinaigrette), 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Taste for seasonings.<br> Place the arugula in a separate bowl and toss it with enough vinaigrette to moisten. Put the arugula on a serving platter and then arrange the beets, almonds, and goat cheese on top.

Stir in the almonds and saute, tossing frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes, until the almonds are a golden brown. Sprinkle with the fleur de sel, add the maple syrup and keep warm. Meanwhile, combine the ricotta, honey and vanilla and divide it among breakfast plates. Surround the ricotta with the berries and spoon the almond and maple syrup mixture over the ricotta. Place a slice of toasted brioche on each plate and serve warm. Set a medium-meshed sieve over a deep bowl. Line the sieve with two double layers of cheesecloth and dampen the cheesecloth. Pour the milk and cream into a large stainless steel or enameled pot such as Le Creuset and stir in the salt. Bring to a full rolling boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally (a full rolling boil means that the bubbles have expanded in the pot). Turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar. Allow the mixture to stand for one minute until it curdles. Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined sieve and allow it to drain into the bowl, discarding the liquid as it collects in the bowl. Allow it to drain at room temperature for 20 to 25 minutes. The longer you let the mixture drain, the thicker it will be. Transfer the ricotta to another bowl, discarding the cheesecloth and any remaining liquid. Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

Season liberally with pepper and grey salt. Toss with fennel seed and smoked paprika. Sprinkle the masa harina or flour over the chicken and toss to coat. Heat a cast iron pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 1/4 cup olive oil, when it begins to smoke, add the chicken, leaving the excess flour or masa harina in the bowl. Spreading the chicken evenly so it covers the bottom of the pot in 1 layer. (You may have to cook the chicken in batches to do this, adding more olive oil as necessary.) Leave the chicken alone, without turning it, so the meat will brown and caramelize, about 5 minutes per side. The chicken has a lot of moisture in it, so a good amount of steam will come from the pan before it is caramelized. As it browns, turn each piece with tongs. Once all sides are caramelized, remove the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving juices in the pot. Over medium heat, add another 1/4 cup of olive oil to pan along with the onions and garlic, cook until onions soften and caramelize, about 5 minutes. Add the jalapenos, cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, chili powder and thyme, stir to combine. Add wine, bring to a simmer, then add the chicken stock, diced tomatoes and cooked chicken. Stir to incorporate everything, season with salt. Simmer until chicken is wonderfully tender, about 45 minutes. Add the white beans, zucchini, poblano, red pepper and scallions. Bring to a simmer and cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in basil. Serve immediately or cool and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

In a large pot, combine the brown sugar, salt and 64 ounces (2 quarts) water. Heat until the salt and sugar totally dissolve in the water. Remove from the heat, let cool at room temperature and place in the refrigerator to chill the brine. Place the chicken in the chilled brine for 2 to 3 hours. Set up a smoker or a gas grill on indirect heat at a pit temperature of 300 degrees F. Use hickory chips or chunks for the smoker. If using a gas grill, put the chips in a smoke box or foil pan under the grates on the burners. Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry. Coat the chicken with the canola oil, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the BBQ Chicken Rub on both sides. Place the chicken in a mesh grill basket or on a wire rack. Cook until the chicken reaches 185 degrees F, 35 to 45 minutes. It&#39;s technically done at 165 degrees F, but take it to a higher internal temperature to achieve a better mouth feel. Remove the chicken, coat with 1 cup of the BBQ Sauce and put back on the grill for a few minutes to set the sauce. Serve with the remaining sauce on the side. In a bowl, add the sugar, paprika, pink sea salt, celery salt, granulated onion, chili powder, mustard and cayenne and whisk until combined. Mix the ketchup, vinegar, sugar, Worcestershire, black pepper, mustard, liquid smoke, chili powder, white pepper, coriander, cayenne and 1/2 cup water in a saucepot. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring continuously. Turn off the heat, add the cognac and stir to combine. Set the sauce to the side for later use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 49998,&quot;Spicy Swiss Chard and Artichoke Dip 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the baking dish 6 cloves garlic, minced 4 slices thick-cut applewood-smoked bacon, diced 8 cups roughly chopped Swiss chard, stems removed 1 14-ounce can artichoke hearts, drained, rinsed and roughly chopped 1/4 cup sliced pickled jalape?os, drained and chopped 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, drained and finely chopped 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups whole milk 1/4 cup ricotta cheese 4 ounces cream cheese, softened 1 cup shredded sharp white cheddar cheese 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Pita chips or crackers, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.

All rights reserved &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 50013,&quot;Divinely Divinci 8 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered 3 pounds white chocolate, tempered Cocoa butter Powdered food coloring, as desired Luster dust Modeling chocolate Vegetable oil, for the gloss Instructions: This centerpiece is about inspiration and this recipe is about techniques you can use to make the molds and templates for the centerpiece that you design. This recipe will give approximate measures and ideas but this is not an exact recipe for the exact centerpiece I made. You can make molds or templates. If you make molds, use the Elastack material to create a mold for virtually any shape of an item made from virtually any relatively heat-proof material. For templates, draw the design onto poster board or foam board and use an X-acto knife to cut the design from the board. Make the molds: Place the Elastack molding material in a saucepan over medium heat until melted. Use metal rulers to outline the mold that you would like to make. For my centerpiece, I used some bicycle gears with sprockets I bought at a bicycle repair store. The pieces ranged in diameter from 2 to 17 inches and I chose them for their unique shapes. Place the rulers on a parchment paper lined sheet pan, and place the item(s) to be molded in the center of that space. Pour the melted Elastack over the item to be molded until it is completely covered. Let this set for about 30 minutes until the Elastack hardens. When set, remove the original piece. Now the mold is ready to use. I made templates for a 30-inch tall, gear inspired support piece, a 16-inch gear with sprocket, the flying machine wings, back reinforcement and spine, and other gears. If using templates, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of parchment paper. If the piece you will cut out is very tall, make a thicker layer so the chocolate will support the height. Remember, dark chocolate is stronger than white chocolate. It is also easier to work with a thicker layer if you use rulers to outline the overall perimeter of the space. Let the chocolate set slightly. Place the template on top of the chocolate and use a paring knife to trace around it. I used a pastry tip to cut half-circles from the edge of the chocolate support piece to make the sprockets (the notched part) of the gear. Use a larger round cutter on the larger gear piece to cut sprockets around the outside perimeter. Make these cuts before the chocolate sets. When the chocolate is set, peel off the parchment and save the excess chocolate for a future use. Use a paper cornet filled with white chocolate to fill the small gears in the Elastack mold. Use the same technique to fill the other gears using dark or white chocolate, as you are inspired. Unmold the gears when the chocolate has set. Make the rivet heads: Place tempered dark chocolate in a pastry bag and pipe chocolate into a flexible mini-dome mold pan. Fill the domes half full. When the chocolate sets, unmold. If you want to add the additional detail of the head of a screw, use the back of a hot knife to score the center of the dome. Make a base: Use flexible aluminum strips or very large cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 16 inches in diameter. Place it on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the ring to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper. I painted the gears with luster dust and cocoa butter. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate, as you are inspired. Remember, luster dust comes in a large array of colors and metals so have fun with this! Make a transfer sheet: If you would like to recreate a painting or image from a book, tape the original image to the work surface. Place a piece of acetate over the image. Mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color and trace the image with a paintbrush. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use an airbrush to \antique\ the painting. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and paint, as you are inspired. When the paint had dried, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over the acetate design. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to trim the outside edge of the painting. When the chocolate sets, peel away the acetate and the image will be on the chocolate. You can use this technique to recreate any image. The results will be as good as your painting skills! Modeling chocolate is a great medium to use to create any number of things. I used it to make the support of Leonardo&#39;s flying machine. I rolled a piece that was about 3/8-inch in diameter and about 3 inches long. Using tempered chocolate as glue, I positioned the wings on either side of the spine and glued them together. The reinforcement support was glued to 1 side. I inverted this whole piece and glued the modeling chocolate spine to the center. To make white chocolate decorations: Fill a paper cornet with tempered white chocolate. Use a scissor to trim the tip to a fine point. Use the chocolate to draw any design on the wings of the flying machine. Assemble: Use a sharp knife to scar the base of the chocolate where the support will be attached. Using tempered dark chocolate as glue, attach the center support. Glue the gears onto the tall support as you are inspired to do so. Continue with the rivets and more gears. Position the paintings and attach, if necessary. Add the flying machine. Use a pastry brush to gloss with vegetable oil, if desired. Place the Chocolate Gear Tarts around the base of the centerpiece. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranio, Garnacha]&quot; 50014,&quot;Grilled Pizza with Ricotta and Pesto 2 ounces pizza dough Flour, for rolling surface Extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup basil pesto<br> 2 cups ricotta cheese, preferably whole milk 4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Prepare a medium-hot fire in your grill, or heat a cast-iron grill pan over medium heat. Roll the pizza dough into 8 small pizzas, each about 1/8-inch thick and 3 inches round.<br> Lightly brush both sides of the pizzas with oil. Grill the pizzas over medium heat until the first side is nicely browned and firm to the touch, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the pizzas over on the grill. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of pesto on each pizza, spreading it to the edges. On top of each pizza, spoon 4 teaspoons of ricotta cheese, in little balls. Cook the pizzas until the ricotta just begins to melt, 3 to 5 minutes from the moment you turned the pizzas. Sprinkle Parmesan over the top of each pizza. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper.

Place the flour in a medium mixing bowl and, with a slotted spoon, add the Bread and Butter Pickles to the flour. Coat the pickles with the flour, making sure they are individually coated, as the pickles tend to stick together. This is easy to achieve if done in 2 or 3 small batches. Add the pickles to the hot oil and fry, turning once, until golden brown and crispy on both sides. Drain into a paper-towel-lined mixing bowl to absorb any excess grease. Season with kosher salt. Serve on a small plate with a ramekin of Buttermilk Chive Dressing. Slice the cucumbers 1/4-inch thick by hand or on a mandoline into large mixing bowl. Toss the cucumbers with the pickling salt and cover with a thin layer of ice. Set aside for 4 hours. Drain, rinse and drain the cucumbers again. Toss the drained cucumbers with the mustard seed and crushed red pepper. Transfer to a storage container, leaving enough room for the brine. Make the brine by combining the vinegar, 4 cups water, the sugar and turmeric in a nonreactive saucepot. Brine to a boil and pour over the cucumbers. Let cool to room temperature before storing in a refrigerator for 3 weeks before using. In a small mixing bowl, add the sour cream, buttermilk and apple cider vinegar and whisk until the ingredients are incorporated. Add the chives, dill, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste and stir once more. Cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to use.

Spray a 12-cup muffin pan generously with the baking spray. For the popovers: Whisk the milk, flour, eggs, vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until combined. Drizzle in the melted butter while whisking until combined; let the batter stand for 5 minutes. Add the baking powder; whisk the batter to combine and divide it evenly among the muffin cups (a scant 1/4 cup batter per muffin cup). Bake the popovers until puffed and browned around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the pan about halfway through. For the filling: While the popovers are baking, combine the broth and flour in a medium saucepan and whisk until the flour is dissolved. Place the saucepan over medium heat and whisk continuously until the mixture comes to a boil; continue to whisk until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the peas and carrots, then the chicken; cover to keep warm. To assemble: When the popovers are done, turn them out of the pan, using a small spatula if necessary. Arrange 2 popovers on each of six plates or bowls and top with the chicken filling, dividing evenly among the popovers. Garnish with chopped parsley and sprinkle on the remaining 2 tablespoons of grated Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 50038,&quot;Homemade Beef Jerky 5 pounds very lean beef or venison, trimmed of all fat 3 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons ground black pepper 2 tablepoons Emeril&#39;s Original Essence, recipe follows 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika Instructions: Cut the meat into strips 1-inch wide and 1/2-inch thick, and spread on baking sheets.

Butter the sides and bottoms of two 8-inch round cake pans. Line the bottoms and sides with parchment if desired (for easy removal). Add the flour, baking powder, granulated sugar and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and combine well. In a separate bowl, combine the milk, egg whites, vegetable oil and vanilla bean paste and whisk to combine. Set aside. Turn the mixer to low and add the chunks of butter slowly to the dry mix. Continue to beat on low until there are no chunks of butter remaining and the mixture becomes crumbly. Add a third of the wet ingredients to the bowl and then turn the speed to medium. Mix until a light paste forms, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Add half of the remaining wet ingredients and beat on medium-high speed for 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the remaining wet ingredients and beat on medium speed for 5 minutes. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans and bake until a skewer comes out clean and the sides have begun to pull away from the sides of the pans, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans on a rack, 10 minutes, then invert onto the rack to remove the pans and parchment and cool completely. For the filling: Roast the pecans in the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the condensed milk and stir constantly until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract and salt. Cool completely before using. For the buttercream: Beat the butter with a hand mixer, the paddle attachment of a stand mixer or a wooden spoon until smooth and fluffy. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until fluffy. Beat in the vanilla bean paste. Pour in the milk and beat for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. To assemble: With a long serrated knife, split each cake layer horizontally into 2 layers. Place 1 layer on a cake plate and top generously with filling. Place another layer on top; top with more filling. Continue in this manner until you place the final layer of cake. Frost the cake all over with the buttercream. Serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 50047,&quot;Cast Iron Skillet Potato Cake 1 to 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter 6 large Idaho baker potatoes, washed and peeled Kosher salt 2 teaspoons dried thyme Instructions: The thing about trying to cook meals on a budget, they often end up making me feel like I didn&#39;t make anything special. Then, I put a call in to my inner chef and realized that with a few ingredients and a little elbow grease, I can make something that feels fancy and exciting without breaking the bank. In a small saucepan, melt the butter and bring it to a gentle simmer. Shut off the heat and allow it to sit a minute on the stove. The milk solids should start to sink to the bottom. Slowly pour the butter into a bowl, keeping as much of the white milky liquid as possible in the saucepan. Discard the milk solids; these are prone to burning and by clarifying the butter, the potato cake will be less likely to overbrown. Keep the butter warm on the stove. Using a mandolin slicer or a sharp knife, cut all of the potatoes into thin (1/8-inch thick) slices. Transfer them to a bowl and cover them with 3/4 of the melted butter. Season with a little salt and the dried thyme and toss to coat the potatoes with the butter. Pour the remaining butter in the bottom of the cast iron skillet and swirl it around to coat the bottom and sides. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remember that the bottom layer with be the top when you unmold this cake so it should be done with extra care. Layer the potatoes, following the edge of the skillet, so they overlap. Start the second circle, closer to the center, of overlapping potato rounds. Continue to make circles with the potatoes until the entire bottom of the skillet is filled with potato rounds in smaller and smaller circles. Fill the skillet with another level layer of potatoes. Sprinkle a touch of salt and make 3 more layers. Press down gently on the potatoes to make sure they are starting to stick together and form a cake. Place the skillet on high heat and cook until the water starts to emerge from the potatoes and you can see the edges browning, 5 to 8 minutes. Place the skillet in the oven and cook, undisturbed, until the potatoes feel tender in the center when pierced with the tip of a knife, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the skillet and carefully pour off any excess butter or liquid into a bowl. Place the skillet on a flat surface and cover it with a platter larger than the skillet. Carefully turn the platter over in one deft motion. Lift off the skillet and use a large metal spatula to place it back in the skillet so it can brown on the second side. Pour the butter back in and cook in the oven for an additional 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven. Pour off any liquid. Season with salt. Cut into wedges like a pie. Serve immediately in the skillet. Alternatively, lift it out of the skillet and serve on a platter or in slices on individual plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 50048,&quot;Watercress and Potato Soup 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup chopped shallot 1 cup chopped peeled potato 1 medium clove garlic, minced 1 sprig fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 1/2 cups chicken broth 1 cup firmly packed chopped watercress 1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream, as desired Sliced toasted almonds and chopped chives, for serving Instructions: Heat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the potato, garlic, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, stirring, until the potatoes are well coated, 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour in the broth and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a simmer. Stir in the watercress and cook 5 minutes more. Remove from the heat, discard the thyme and let cool at least 5 minutes. Carefully puree until smooth with a handheld immersion blender or in 2 to 3 batches in a blender (do not fill the blender more than halfway full per batch). Stir in the cream and reheat the soup if necessary, adjusting the consistency and seasoning with additional water, salt and pepper.

Add the flour and cook until smooth and bubbly, about 3 minutes. Add the milk slowly while whisking constantly. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, paying special attention to the corners of the saucepan. Add the paprika and salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the corn and parsley, return to a simmer. Scrape the filling into a bowl and cool completely before filling wrappers. To Form: Moisten the edges of 1 of the empanada wrappers with a fingertip dipped in warm water. Center a generous 1/3-cup of the filling on the wrapper. Bring the sides of the wrapper together to meet over the filling and pinch the sides together to seal and form a half-moon shape. Lay the half-moon flat on the work surface. Work you way around the edges, bringing about 1/2-inch of the bottom layer of dough up and over the top layer, to make a mini-pleat. Press as you go to seal the pleats. If you don&#39;t want to mess with crimping, just seal the edges all the way around with the tips of the tines of a fork. Fry the Empanadas: (empanadas may also be baked; see Note below): Pour enough vegetable or canola oil into a large heavy skillet to fill about 3/4-inch up the sides. Heat over medium heat until the tip of the handle of a wooden spoon immersed in the oil gives off a lively sizzle, about 375 degrees F. Carefully slip as many of the empanadas into the oil as will fit without crowding. Cook until the dough is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip and repeat. Drain briefly on paper towels before serving. Repeat with remaining empanadas. Note: To bake empanadas, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or use a nonstick baking sheet. Bake until the empanadas are light golden brown, about 25 minutes.

Heat your flour tortilla in a frying pan or the microwave for just a few seconds. Fill your burrito with your scramble, beans, rice and any other toppings you like. My favorites are listed above. The possibilities to vary your burrito fillings are endless. This is a great way to get a complete, healthy and balanced meal quickly, all wrapped up in a tortilla and ready to go. It will provide great fuel for your day. I recommend quick-soaking beans rather than cold soaking overnight, as quick-soaking makes some of the starches more digestible. To quick soak, rinse the beans and place in a large pot. Cover with cold water to about 3 inches above the top of the beans. Bring the pot to a boil, cover and immediately remove from the heat. Let sit for 1 hour, drain, rinse and return the beans to the pot.<br> Cover the beans with fresh cold water to 3 to 4 inches above the level of the beans (this will require more water than the previous time, as the beans will have expanded during the quick soak). Add to the pot the carrot, celery, onion, garlic, thyme, parsley, bay leaf and salt. All the vegetables can and should be left whole, as they will be easier to remove later. (I add the salt at the beginning of cooking, as I find it adds better flavor to the beans. Many people believe that adding salt too early will make the beans tough, but I have never found this to be the case.) Bring the liquid to a boil, and immediately reduce to the barest simmer, just barely bubbling very gently. Cook, uncovered, until the beans are done, roughly 1 to 2 hours. The timing will vary greatly with the size and variety of beans, the size of your pot, your elevation, the weather, etc. Just taste-test along the way until they are fully cooked through but not mushy. Once done, remove the pot from the heat. I generally remove all the aromatics and then store the beans in their own cooking liquid in the fridge in a sealed container. They will last 1 to 2 weeks that way. The liquid is delicious. Yield: makes enough for 6 to 10 burritos, depending on appetite. In a medium saucepan heat the oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions, and saute until soft and translucent. Add the chili powder, salt and white pepper, and saute a minute longer. Add the rice, and saute for 3 to 4 minutes to toast the rice just slightly. Add the diced tomatoes, and stir the entire mixture for 3 to 4 minutes longer. Add the stock, turn up the heat and bring the liquid quickly to a boil. As soon as it boils, cover the pot and reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting; let steam for about 30 minutes. Check the rice for doneness, adding a bit more liquid if necessary, re-cover and keep steaming until done. Uncover, and fluff the rice.

Trim the green leaves from the base of each head of cauliflower. Then trim a sliver off of each base to level it. Make 2 equal slices vertically from the top to the base of each head of cauliflower, creating 4 steaks in total. In a large baking dish, add the beer, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, red cl flakes, garlic, a nice pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Whisk until the sugar and salt dissolve, then place the steaks in 1 layer in the dish. Bake the steaks, flipping them once, until tender but still firm enough to hold their shape, about 20 minutes. Use your judgment when you flip them to determine if they need to cook the full 20 minutes. Transfer the cauliflower steaks to a paper towel-lined baking sheet; reserve the baking liquid for the next step. Pat the top of each steak dry as well. For the glaze: In a medium bowl, add the jam, jerk seasoning, lime juice and 1/4 cup of the cauliflower baking liquid. Stir to loosen and combine. Heat a cast-iron griddle to medium-high heat (cast iron is preferred, but you can use a large pan and do this in batches, or use a nonstick griddle, but cast iron--ooooh--cast iron!!!). Drizzle each cauliflower steak with olive oil on both sides followed by a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Place the steaks on the griddle and cook until lightly golden brown when you take a peek beneath, 4 to 6 minutes; gently flip the steaks, then allow them to become golden brown again on the other side. Brush the tops and sides of each liberally with the glaze. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, then remove to a platter and sprinkle with the mint and cilantro. Serve warm. Chop the chilled leftovers for a quick salad. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 50057,&quot;Bulgar Salad with Grapes 1 cup bulgur Kosher salt 1 cup pecan halves, toasted and roughly chopped 2 cups halved green and red seedless California grapes<br> 2 cups packed finely slivered kale or Swiss chard leaves 1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions 1/4 cup lemon juice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest Pinch cayenne Black pepper Instructions: Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan.

Rinse the quinoa a few times in a fine mesh strainer. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the quinoa and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the quinoa and rinse under cold water, then set aside to drain and dry out. Meanwhile, combine the spinach, cilantro and garlic in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer one-third of the mixture to a medium bowl along with the ground beef and turkey, milk, breadcrumbs, 2 teaspoons of the Worcestershire, the cl powder, egg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some black pepper. Combine the mixture well with your hands. Whisk together the remaining 2 teaspoons Worcestershire with 2 teaspoons of the vinegar. Divide and pat the meat mixture into four even 1-inch-thick football shapes. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Top each with 3 slices of tomato and drizzle with some of the Worcestershire-vinegar sauce. Bake until the meatloaf reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, 18 to 20 minutes. Drizzle with more Worcestershire-vinegar sauce and top each with cheese and continue to bake until melted, about 2 minutes more. Blot the bottom of each meatloaf on a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Meanwhile, combine the quinoa, the remaining spinach mixture, the remaining 2 teaspoons vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium pot and stir, over medium-low heat, until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Divide the meatloaves, quinoa and watermelon slices among four dinner plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 50060,&quot;Pumpkin Cupcakes Nonstick cooking spray All-purpose flour 1 (18 1/4-ounce) box yellow cake mix 3/4 cup pumpkin puree, plus more if needed 1/3 cup vegetable oil 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup pumpkin puree 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice Red and yellow food coloring, if desired Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the cake pan with nonstick cooking spray, coat with flour, and knock out the excess. Combine the cake mix with the pumpkin puree and oil. Beat with a hand mixer on medium until well incorporated, about 2 minutes. Some pumpkin purees have more moisture than others, if the cake batter seems dry then add more pumpkin puree, 1/4 cup at a time. Using an ice cream scoop, fill the molds 2/3 of the way to the top with batter. Bake until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 12 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes and remove to a wire rack to cool completely. In a large bowl, combine the icing ingredients and mix together until well blended; the icing should be thick but have a pourable consistency. If it&#39;s too thick add a little water to thin. If you want the color to be more orange add a few drops of red and yellow food coloring. Dip the top 1/2 of each cupcake into the icing and place onto a sheet pan fitted with a wire rack allowing the icing to drip down the sides.

Remove from heat and let cool to 180 degrees F. Add mozzarella curd to a large bowl and bring to room temperature. When the water has cooled to 180 degrees F, ladle it onto the curd. The curd will begin to look like shaggy mozzarella. Using a wooden spoon, stir and stretch the cheese until it forms a cohesive ball and takes on a \plastic\ texture. Shaping mozzarella: Place half of the whey water (the salted water that turned the cheese curd into mozzarella) in another large bowl and chill to 80 degrees F. Meanwhile, work the mozzarella that&#39;s in the remaining warm whey water into 1 large ball. Knead and stretch the ball of cheese until there are no more lumps. Once the cheese is smooth, pull off a 4-inch section and put it into the second bowl containing the cooled whey water. Repeat this process with the remaining cheese. Making stracciatella: Take each of the sections of the mozzarella out of the cooled water and pull apart the strands (like string cheese). Put all of the pulled strands of cheese into a mixing bowl and add the heavy cream. Gently stir to make stracciatella. Set aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place baguette slices on a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over the slices and place in the oven to toast, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and, while still warm, rub cut side of garlic over the toasted bread. Then rub the bread with the cut side of tomato while gently squeezing the tomato halves. Top slices with a generous spoonful of stracciatella followed by a drizzle of olive oil, flaky sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 50066,&quot;Black and Green Olive Tapenade 1 1/2 cups kalamata, pitted and chopped 1 1/2 cups picholines, pitted and chopped 4 filets anchovies, chopped 3 lemon juice and zest of 2 tablespoons fresh thyme, chopped 1 tablespoon fresh oregano, chopped 2 tablespoons garlic, chopped 1 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/2 cup capers, drained and rinsed Black pepper to taste Instructions: Put all ingredients in a bowl.

Heat two tablespoons of oil in large frying pan over moderately high heat. Brown chicken, turning pieces once, about 4 minutes per side. Add a few teaspoons of water to skillet. Repeat a few times and then add watered flour to make a gravy. As chicken browns, add onions, cover pan and simmer on low heat for 10 to 15 minutes so chicken will stew. (Typically back home in Belize onion was the only vegetable used with the chicken, however many Belizians that are now in the Unites States add bell pepper and tomatoes to this dish.) For the rice and beans: Clean beans and check for stones. Put beans in a stockpot with water to cover, thyme, onions, garlic and pepper. Do not add salt at this time because the beans will turn hard. Cover and cook over moderate heat for 1 hour, stirring every 10 minutes and adding a little water if necessary. Cook until beans have softened. Add salt, coconut milk and uncooked rice.

In an 8-inch nonstick skillet over low heat, combine the brown sugar, maple syrup, butter, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon and a pinch kosher salt. Melt together and whisk to combine. Turn the heat up to medium and bring the mixture to a boil. Allow to boil vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully add the apples and toss around until the apples are fully coated in the caramel. Reduce the heat to low and allow to bubble for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the apples begin to soften and appear translucent. Place the skillet onto a parchment-lined baking sheet (to catch any bubbled-over caramel) and bake for 5 minutes while you prepare the batter. In a large 8-cup liquid measure or large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and granulated sugar until frothy. Add the buttermilk, flour, vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and the nutmeg if using. Whisk to combine until no longer lumpy. Open the oven and carefully remove the pan. Pour the batter into the skillet over the apples, swirling around the perimeter and ending in the center. (Beginning on the sides and working inward gives the pancake better structure instead of just pouring all of the batter in the middle. This will also ensure that the pancake \u201csouffles\u201d evenly). Place back into the oven to bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the sides have risen and the edges are dark. Remove from the oven and allow to settle for a minute or two. Carefully invert on a plate. Sprinkle with flaky salt and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 50079,&quot;Turkey Hash 4 ounces olive oil 2 red onions, diced 1 red bell pepper, julienne 1 green bell pepper, julienne 2 jalapenos, diced, and seeded 2 pounds ground turkey breast 1 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds red potatoes, sliced thin 1/2 cup Roma tomatoes, diced 1/2 lime Instructions: In medium saute pan, add 2 ounces olive oil, onions, peppers and saute until translucent.

Then add the shrimp and clams and cook until the shrimp turn pink and begin to curl and the clams open fully, about 5 minutes. Cut the onions in half. Cut the artichokes in half and scoop out and discard the chokes. Serve the shrimp, potatoes, onions, and artichokes with shallow bowls of melted butter, sea salt and the Fennel Spice Rub for dipping, and with jars of hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 50102,&quot;Honeyed Yogurt Cheesecake Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the springform pan 4 large eggs, separated, at room temperature<br> 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt<br> 1/4 cup evaporated cane juice<br> 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour<br> 1 pound full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 1/3 cup honey<br> 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br> 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest<br> 1/2 cup 2 percent Greek yogurt, at room temperature<br> 2 tablespoons honey 2 teaspoons hot water<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 cups halved apricots<br> 1 cup blackberries<br> Instructions: For the cheesecake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 325 degrees F. Lightly spray an 8-inch springform pan with 3-inch-high sides with nonstick cooking spray. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, place the egg whites and salt. Beat on medium-high speed to soft peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly rain in the evaporated cane juice. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until the egg whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks, about 2 minutes. Sift the flour over the whipped whites and gently fold until smooth. Scrape the meringue into a clean bowl. (And hey, guess what? You just made a small batch of angel food cake batter!) Into the mixer bowl (no need to clean it), place the cream cheese. Place the bowl back on the mixer and fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until creamy. Add the honey and beat until smooth. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Add the lemon juice, vanilla extract and lemon zest and beat to blend well. Reduce the mixer speed to low and stir in the yogurt. Carefully fold about a third of the egg white mixture into the batter to lighten it. Gently fold in the remaining whites until the batter is smooth. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the cake is puffed, lightly golden and mostly set but with a slight wobble when the pan is jostled, 45 to 50 minutes (a toothpick won&#39;t tell you much about doneness; it&#39;s best just to rely on visuals here). Turn off the oven and let the cake continue to cook in the oven for 1 hour. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. When ready to serve, unmold the cheesecake and put onto a serving platter. For the topping: In a medium bowl, whisk together the honey, hot water and vanilla. Add the apricots and blackberries to the bowl and gently toss to coat. Top the cheesecake with the honey and fruit mixture, slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 50103,&quot;Peach Martini 2 ounces vanilla vodka 1-ounce peach schnapps 2 ounces peach nectar 1/2-ounce fresh lime juice Ice cubes Peach slice, for garnish Instructions: In a cocktail shaker mix all the ingredients along with the ice.

Finely chop the nuts in a food processor or coffee grinder. Transfer nuts to a bowl and mix in brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and cloves. Brush a 13 by 9-inch baking pan with melted butter and set aside. Cut a piece of cardboard into a 13 by 9-inch rectangle. Unroll the phyllo dough and lay the sheets flat on a work surface. Set the cardboard template on the stack of phyllo and trim the excess so they fit the pan. Keep the pastry covered with a damp, not wet, towel as you work to prevent drying out. To build the baklava, you will alternate 3 layers of dough with 2 layers of nuts. Start with a stable base of 8 sheets on the bottom, brushing each with melted butter. Spread 1/2 the nut mixture evenly over the stacked sheets. Cover with 4 sheets of phyllo, painting each with melted butter, then sprinkle again with remaining nut mixture. Top the last layer of nuts with 8 layers of phyllo as you did for the bottom. Drizzle any remaining butter over top. If you have time, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes so the butter will set and make the baklava easier to cut. Using a sharp knife, make 5 cuts across lengthwise, then cut diagonally to form diamonds. Baklava is more difficult to cut after it is cooked because the pastry becomes so flaky. Bake for about 40 minutes until golden and flaky. If the top browns too quickly during baking, tent with foil. To make the syrup: combine the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let simmer for 10 minutes until thickened. Remove the orange peel, cinnamon stick, and whole clove; set aside to cool. Remove an end piece of the baklava and tilt the pan to allow the butter to collect in the corner. Spoon out the excess and discard. With the pan flat, pour the syrup evenly over the hot baklava. Allow to stand for several hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 50135,&quot;Potato-Stuffed Flat Bread 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon yogurt 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup water Potato Filling, recipe follows 4 tablespoons softened butter 1 potato, baked, cooled, peeled and mashed 1/2 cup yogurt 1 small onion, minced 1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded, and minced 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon minced ginger 1 teaspoon cumin powder 2 tablespoons minced cilantro 2 teaspoons salt Instructions: Sift the flour with the salt, and knead into a soft dough by adding the yogurt, butter, and water.<br> Cover with a moist cloth and let rise for 1/2 an hour.<br> Meanwhile, combine ingredients for the potato filling in a bowl and refrigerate until needed.<br> Knead the dough again, and divide into 8 equal parts, rolling them into small balls.

Lower to a simmer and reduce until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover and let steep until needed. Set up steamer using a wok or large Dutch oven and a steamer rack or basket. Make sure an 8-inch round cake pan with a heatproof plate on top will fit into the covered steamer setup. Fill with water almost to but not touching the rack. Cover with the lid and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir the gypsum, granulated sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons of the soy milk in a small bowl until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Let sit to hydrate the gypsum until the mixture starts to bubble or foam, about 5 minutes. Pour the gypsum mixture into an 8-inch round metal cake pan (regular or nonstick). Pour the remaining soy milk into the cake pan and stir until the gypsum mixture is well combined with the milk. Cover with a heatproof plate, add to the steamer, cover with the lid and steam over medium heat until set but still jiggly, about 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the plate. Meanwhile, strain the ginger syrup into a small bowl and set aside. Check the tofu pudding by scooping out a shallow portion. If there&#39;s a yellowish, clear liquid underneath, it has set properly.

Immediately turn off the heat and set aside. In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring constantly, to caramelize the mixture. You&#39;ll smell a characteristic nutty-caramel odor when the butter browns, signaling that the mixture is ready. Whisking constantly, gradually add the butter/brown sugar mixture to the hot milk/cream mixture. If the mixture isn&#39;t smooth, blend for 20 seconds with a hand blender or pour through a fine sieve. Put the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture. Whisk in the cornstarch and salt until dissolved. Whisk the cornstarch mixture back into the hot milk mixture in the saucepan. Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Turn off the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour into 6 to 8 custard cups, ramekins, or mugs and chill, uncovered, at least 2 hours or overnight.

Add the eggs and yolks and mix on medium speed. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl, pushing the flour towards the center. Continue to mix on medium speed, repeating these steps until the dough comes together into a ball. If the dough sticks to the sides of the bowl, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a cohesive ball. Knead the dough on medium-high for 3 to 4 minutes. When the dough is smooth, bright yellow in color and bounces back when pressed, transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. Knead by hand a few more times and then form into a ball. The dough should feel moist but not sticky; knead in more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, as necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours but no more than 4 hours. Fit the stand mixer with the pasta roller attachment and set to the widest setting (No. 1). Position the stand mixer with 2 to 3 feet of counter space to the left. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide into three portions. Work with one piece of dough at time, keeping the rest under plastic wrap so it doesn&#39;t dry out. With your fingers, press a portion of the dough into a roughly 5-by-2 1/2-inch rectangle. Dust lightly with flour on both sides. Turn the mixer onto low speed and feed the dough through the roller with the 2 1/2-inch parallel to the roller. Next, fold the two ends of the dough into the center so they just meet and then fold one half over the other so the dough closes like a book; this is called laminating the dough. Use your fingers to seal the two edges together, then once again shape the dough into a 5-by-2 1/2-inch rectangle. Dust the dough with flour and feed it through the roller a second time. Repeat by laminating the dough one more time and feeding it through the roller. Dust with flour and feed through the roller three more times, dust with more flour as needed. Adjust the roller to setting No. 3 and feed the dough through the roller twice. Adjust to setting No. 5 and feed the dough through two more times. At this point the dough will be over a foot long. Use your right hand to feed the dough through the roller and your left hand to catch the dough. Always be very gentle with the dough to prevent tearing. Be sure to feed the dough through the machine so that it does not fold onto itself. You can make small adjustments to how the dough is entering the roller by gently guiding it to the left or right. If the dough is too long to handle, simply cut it in half and work with a smaller portion. Finally, adjust the roller to setting No. 7 and feed the dough through another two times. After the dough has gone through the roller for the last time, dust it all over with flour and then fold it over itself and hold under a piece of plastic wrap. Repeat these steps with the remaining two pieces of dough. Replace the roller attachment with the fettucine cutter attachment. Dust a baking sheet with flour. Cut the rolled dough into 12-inch pieces and feed through the fettucine cutter on low speed. Twist the fettucine into a nest and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap while you cut the remaining dough. Lightly dust the tops of the fettucine nests with flour, cover with slightly dampened paper towel and then with plastic wrap. Hold at room temperature for no more than an hour or the pasta will dry out. (Makes 1 pound pasta dough.) For the chicken and broccoli alfredo: Place a baking sheet in the oven and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Mix the broccoli florets with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the broccoli to the preheated baking sheet and roast until the lightly charred and tender, 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt so that the water tastes like the ocean. Heat a 12-inch, high-sided pan over medium heat. Add the butter and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. When the butter is melted, add the chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. If the chicken has browned on both sides but isn&#39;t cooked through yet, remove to a baking sheet and finish in the oven. Let cool and then cut into 1/2-inch pieces. To the same pan, add the minced garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the flour and stir to combine, scraping up the dark bits from the bottom of the pan. Whisk in 1 cup of the half-and-half, making sure the flour is completely combined, without any lumps. Whisk in the remaining 3 cups half-and-half, bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. When the mixture has thickened around the edges, but before your whisk leaves a trail behind it, add the remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest and the Asiago and Parmesan, and whisk to combine. Turn the heat to low and season with salt and pepper. The sauce should have the consistency of a thick soup. If the sauce thickens too much, add a little of the pasta water to thin it out. Add the chicken and broccoli to the cheese sauce and hold over low heat. Meanwhile, cook to the pasta: Separate the strands of pasta on the baking sheet and add them to the boiling water. Cook for 30 seconds, or until the pasta floats to the top. Drain and add to the cheese sauce. Add the lemon juice and toss to combine. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 50176,&quot;Salad with Warm Goat Cheese 1 (11-ounce) log plain or herbed Montrachet 2 extra-large egg whites, beaten with 1 tablespoon water Fresh white bread crumbs 2 tablespoons good cider vinegar 2 tablespoons good Champagne vinegar Pinch sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 extra-large egg yolk 1 cup good olive oil Enough mixed salad greens for 6 servings Olive oil and unsalted butter, for frying Instructions: Slice the Montrachet into 12 (1/2-inch-thick) slices. (The easiest way to slice goat cheese is to use a length of dental floss.) Dip each slice into the beaten egg whites, then the bread crumbs, being sure the cheese is thoroughly coated. Place the slices on a rack and chill them for at least 15 minutes. For the dressing, place the vinegars, sugar, salt, pepper, and egg yolk in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and blend for 1 minute. With the motor running, slowly pour the olive oil through the feed tube until the vinaigrette is thickened. Season, to taste. Toss the salad greens with enough dressing to moisten, then divide them among 6 plates. Melt 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat until just under smoking.

Pat the skin dry with a paper towel and season the fish on both sides with salt. Heat a large saute pan coated generously with extra virgin olive oil over high heat. Coat the bottom of another slightly smaller saute pan with olive oil. Gently place the fish fillets skin side down in the saute pan and place the other saute pan directly on top of the fish. The purpose of this is to gently press the skin of the bass onto the bottom of the saute pan to create a lovely crispy fish skin. Be sure to oil the bottom of the top saute pan or the fish will stick to it. After a couple of minutes remove the top saute pan from the fish, this will allow the steam to escape and the skin to become very crispy. As fish cooks it turns from translucent to opaque. The idea is to cook the fish 2/3&#39;s of the way on the skin side and flip it over for the last 1/3 of the cooking time. The rule for fish is about 7 to 8 minutes per inch of thickness, a little less if you like your fish more on the rare side. Serve the fish over the sauteed spring veggies and call your self a superstar! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 50188,&quot;Cranberry Custard Pie 1 1/2 cups self-rising flour, plus more for the dough 2 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> Pinch of kosher salt or sea salt<br> 8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, diced<br> About 1/4 cup cold water<br> 2 cups granulated sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 4 large eggs<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Zest of 1 orange<br> 4 cups cranberries, thawed if frozen (from a 12-ounce frozen bag)<br> Orange slices, for topping 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> Instructions: For the crust: Add the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor.

If it takes too long it will turn mushy. Cut the watermelon in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 1-inch-thick half-moon slices. Grill the watermelon slices, working in batches if using a grill pan, until just marked, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a colander placed over a large bowl to cool and collect the juices. Once cool enough to handle and you have about 1 tablespoon watermelon juice, slice the rind off the watermelon and cut the flesh into 1-inch cubes. Set aside.<br> Meanwhile, toss the beans with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and place onto the center of a large piece of foil so that most of the beans are flat but some are still overlapping. Roll up all 4 sides of the foil to create a tray, leaving the top open so you can still see the beans. Transfer the foil to the grill and cook, covered, until the beans are softened and charred, 7 to 8 minutes.<br> Whisk the vinegar, Dijon, shallot, reserved 1 tablespoon watermelon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil until emulsified.<br> Add the spinach, chives, tarragon, nutritional yeast and fennel with fronds to a large bowl.

Add the pork butt and let marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Cut the stems off the taro leaves and soak the leaves in a large bowl or salad spinner filled with water for 20 minutes. Rinse the leaves, then repeat soaking for 20 minutes and rinse again. Place a 14-inch square of foil on a work surface and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place 1 taro leaf on the foil, then center about 12 ounces of the pork butt and 2 ounces of the butterfish on top (overlap several taro leaves if necessary to fit). Wrap the taro leaf over the filling, folding in from the sides first so that it completely covers the filling, then roll shut like a burrito, using additional taro leaves to wrap over any tears. Wrap in another 1 to 2 layers of leaf (you will need 6 to 8 ounces of leaves, total, for each packet). Tightly fold the foil over the packet to completely cover the taro leaves. Repeat with the remaining leaves, pork butt and butterfish. Reserve remaining pork butt for another use. Place the Lau Lau packets in a large steamer pot, cover and cook for 6 hours. Add water to the steamer as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Tempranillo]&quot; 50251,&quot;Chicken Sauce Piquante 1/4 cup olive oil 1 (3 pound) fryer chicken, cut into 8 pieces 1 teaspoon salt, plus 1/2 teaspoon 1 1/2 teaspoons Essence, recipe follows 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons bleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onions 3/4 cup chopped green bell peppers 3/4 cup chopped celery 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 4 bay leaves 4 cups seeded and chopped plum tomatoes 3 cups chicken stock or low-sodium canned chicken broth 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon Emeril&#39;s Red Pepper Sauce or other hot pepper sauce Hot white rice, for serving 1/2 cup chopped green onions (green and white parts) 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in large heavy nonstick pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with 1 teaspoon of the salt. In a bowl combine the Essence with 1/2 cup of the flour and stir to combine. Dredge the chicken pieces in the seasoned flour mixture and shake to remove any excess flour. Brown the pieces, in batches if necessary, until golden on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Stir in the onions, bell peppers, celery, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne, and bay leaves. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft and lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of the flour and cook, stirring, to cook the flour without browning, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, chicken stock, Worcestershire, and pepper sauce. Return the chicken to the pot, increase the heat under the sauce to medium-high and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is fall-from the bone tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove and discard the bay leaves. To serve, spoon the rice onto plates, top with the chicken and sauce, and garnish with the green onions and parsley. Combine all ingredients thoroughly.

Line one baking sheet with paper towels; line a second baking sheet with parchment; and set a rack over a third baking sheet. Cut the ends off the onions and peel the skin. Slice the onions crosswise into three rounds, then separate into rings. Place the dill pickle chips on the paper-towel-lined baking sheet, cover with more paper towels and dry well. Whisk the eggs in a medium bowl. Add the buttermilk and whisk to combine. In another medium bowl, whisk together the flour, 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Place the breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Toss the onions rings in the seasoned flour; coat well. Then dip the onion rings in the buttermilk mixture. Dredge the onion rings a second time in the flour and again in the buttermilk (for a double dredge). Toss the onion rings in the breadcrumbs and place on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Use the same double-dredge process--flour, buttermilk, flour, buttermilk, panko--for the pickle chips. In batches, fry the onion rings until golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Remove to the rack to rest. Sprinkle immediately with salt. Fry the pickle chips until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove to the rack and sprinkle with salt. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 50253,&quot;Huevos Rancheros with Bacon Tortillas 5 vine-ripened tomatoes (about 2 pounds) 2 to 3 serrano cl peppers 1/2 white onion, chopped 1 clove garlic, chopped Kosher salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 6 slices bacon 1 cup masa harina (instant corn flour) Kosher salt 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 large eggs Kosher salt 1/4 cup crumbled Cotija cheese or queso fresco 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Make the salsa: Preheat the broiler. Spread the tomatoes and serrano peppers on a foil-lined baking sheet and broil, turning occasionally, until charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Wrap in the foil and set aside, about 10 minutes. Rub off the charred skins; remove the pepper stems. Pulse the tomatoes, peppers, onion, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor until chunky. Heat the vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully add the tomato mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cilantro and season with salt. Transfer the salsa to a bowl and cover to keep warm; wipe out the skillet. Prepare the tortillas: Cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 9 to 11 minutes; drain on paper towels, reserving the drippings in the skillet. Finely chop the bacon. Combine all but about 1 tablespoon bacon, the masa harina and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Stir in 3/4 cup warm water and knead in the bowl until the dough is soft and pliable, about 2 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 pieces; roll each into a ball, then flatten into 4-inch disks. Cook the tortillas: Heat the vegetable oil in the cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tortillas and cook until golden brown on the bottoms, 3 to 4 minutes; flip and cook until golden on the other side, 3 more minutes. Flip again and cook until the tortillas are browned and cooked through, about 1 more minute. Wrap in foil to keep warm. Make the eggs: Add the vegetable oil to the bacon drippings in the nonstick skillet and set over medium-high heat. Add the eggs, season with salt and fry until the whites are set, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon some of the prepared salsa onto 4 plates. Place a tortilla on each plate and top with a fried egg. Top with a little more salsa, then sprinkle with the cheese, cilantro and the reserved bacon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 50254,&quot;Sephardic Chicken Soup with Sofrito and Herbed Matzo Balls 8 large eggs 2 teaspoons canola oil 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup chicken fat, melted (schmaltz), plus 2 tablespoons, for optional garnish 1/4 cup water 1/3 cup freshly chopped parsley leaves 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 cups matzo meal 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder Soup: 1 (3 1/2 to 4-pound) chicken 4 quarts chicken stock 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 small yellow onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice 1/2 cup quartered cherry or grape tomatoes 1/2 cup diced (1/4-inch) red bell pepper 1/2 cup diced (1/4-inch) green bell pepper 2 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves 4 garlic cloves, minced Small pinch saffron 1 teaspoon hot red pepper sauce, optional Instructions: To make the matzo balls, bring a large pot of salted water or chicken broth to a boil over high heat. Whisk the eggs, oils, chicken fat, water, parsley, salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, add the matzo meal and sift in the baking powder. Mix together, then fold into the eggs. Cover with plastic wrap, pressed tightly against the batter and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight. Moisten your hands lightly with water and form the matzo mixture into 24 walnut-sized balls. Carefully drop the matzo balls into the water or broth. Reduce the heat to medium and partially cover. Simmer gently until the matzo balls are cooked through, about 40 minutes. Using a skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer the matzo balls to a large bowl of cold water. Meanwhile, make the soup. Bring the chicken pieces and stock to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat, skimming off the foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer, partially covered, until the chicken is tender, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the chicken from the soup. Remove and discard the skin, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces, and reserve the meat until service. Return the remaining bones back to the broth and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes more to further develop the soup&#39;s flavor. While the soup is simmering, heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, tomatoes, red and green peppers, cilantro, garlic and saffron. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables in the sofrito are tender, but not browned, about 8 minutes. Add the hot sauce, if using. Set the sofrito aside. When ready to serve, strain the soup and discard the bones. Return the soup to the pot and stir in the sofrito and chicken pieces. Add the matzo balls and simmer until the matzo balls are heated through, about 5 minutes. (The soup and matzo balls can be prepared up to 2 days ahead, cooled, covered, and refrigerated. Reheat before serving.) Ladle the soup, along with sofrito, chicken and matzo balls into bowls and serve hot, with an optional drizzle of the additional melted chicken fat (schmaltz). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 50255,&quot;Grilled Cauliflower with Cilantro Pesto 1 large head cauliflower, cut into 1- to 2-inch florets (about 6 cups) 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Cilantro Pesto, recipe follows Cotija cheese and cilantro leaves, for serving 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon lime zest and 3 tablespoons lime juice, from 1 to 2 limes 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 clove garlic, smashed and peeled 2 cups packed cilantro leaves 1 cup roasted and unsalted cashews 1/2 cup crumbled Cotija cheese Instructions: Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high.

Melt the butter over medium heat in a saucepan, add the shallot saute and saute until translucent. Whisk in the flour to make a roux. Add the brandy and gradually whisk in the stock. Let reduce by half. Whisk in heavy cream and remove from heat. While the lobster bisque sauce is reducing, make the vol-au-vent. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out puff pastry dough, and using a 4-inch circle or biscuit cutter, cut out 8 dough rounds. Place 4 of the dough rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet. Using a 3 inch circle or biscuit cutter, cut a concentric circle in the middle of the remaining 4 inch dough rounds to create a half-inch wide circle of dough. These half-inch wide circles of dough are to be used without the 3- inch pieces from the center. Place 1 of these half-inch wide circles of dough on top of each of the rounds already on the baking sheet, matching up the edges. Brush egg wash over the surface of each of the paired dough circles and rounds. Then use a fork to prick through the dough around the perimeter (that is, through each dough circle and into the accompanying round beneath it). Place in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. The center of each will rise. Remove pastry shells from oven and allow to cool slightly. Flake the now cooled salmon into chunks and fold sauce into the salmon. (Do not feel compelled to use all of the sauce. The filling should not be too liquid.)

Generously cover the ribs with the cure. Place the ribs, uncovered, on a rack set in a baking pan or a tray. Marinate for 24 hours in the refrigerator. Rinse the ribs well under cold water, and pat dry thoroughly. For the dry rub: Toast the peppercorns and fennel seeds in a dry saute pan until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind the toasted spices. Combine the ground peppercorns and fennel seeds with the paprika, dried sage, dried thyme, granulated garlic, onion powder, sugar and bay leaf powder in a bowl, stirring to combine thoroughly. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and scatter the onions on the foil. Sprinkle the dry rub liberally over both sides of the ribs and place them, bone-side down, on top of the onions to prevent sticking. Add the vinegar to the pan and sprinkle the fresh thyme leaves over the ribs. Top with another piece of foil and crimp the edges together with the bottom piece of foil to create a large foil pouch. Roast until the ribs are tender and the meat has shrunk back from the bone, approximately 1 1/2 hours. Pour the pan juices through a strainer to remove the onions. Skim the fat and simmer the juices with the chicken stock in a saucepan over high heat until reduced by half. Cut the lamb racks into double rib portions, drizzle lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with a little salt. Crisp the exterior of the ribs on a hot grill or under a broiler for 5 minutes (meat-side only), basting occasionally with the reduced pan juices. Serve drizzled with the apricot mint chimichurri. Place the apricots and 1 teaspoon honey in a heat-proof bowl and cover with boiling water. Soak the apricots for 10 minutes to plump. Remove the apricots from the hot water and roughly chop.

Spoon the cheese mixture into the lined pan, then fold the ends of the cheesecloth neatly over the top. Place a saucer on the cheesecloth, then a 2-pound weight, such as a can, on the saucer. Put the flower pot in a bowl large enough for the liquid to drain into. Refrigerate for at least 12 hours. Empty the bowl. Unmold the pashka onto a serving plate and carefully remove the cheesecloth. Decorate with candied fruit, pressing some of the fruit into the pashka to form the letters XP, which stands for Khristos voskres (\Christ has risen). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 50267,&quot;Classic Chicago Chicken Vesuvio 1 (4 pound) skin-on, bone-in chicken pieces, patted dry (2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 drums, 2 wings) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing<br> 1 pound medium russet potatoes, unpeeled, cut into wedges about 1/8th of each potato<br> 6 garlic cloves, smashed<br> 2 fresh thyme sprigs<br> 2 fresh oregano sprigs<br> 1 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio<br> 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning<br> 1 cup frozen peas, thawed<br> Zest and juice of 1 lemon<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season chicken liberally with salt and pepper. In a large cast-iron skillet, add 1 tablespoon oil and heat over medium heat. Working in batches, sear the chicken pieces, flipping only once, until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove the seared chicken to a plate or sheet pan and set aside. Add 3 tablespoons oil to the skillet and place the potato wedges cut side down in the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Sear until lightly golden, about 6 minutes, then flip and sear the other cut side for 6 minutes. Remove the potatoes to a plate or sheet pan and set aside. Add 1 tablespoon oil and the garlic to the skillet and let the garlic flavor infuse into the oil without the garlic coloring, 30 seconds. Add the thyme, oregano, and wine and bring to a simmer. Return the potatoes to the skillet in a single layer and top with the chicken, skin side up. Brush the chicken with a little more oil and season with salt. Sprinkle a generous amount of the Italian seasoning all over the tops of the chicken. Roast the chicken and potatoes in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Remove skillet from the oven, add the peas and let them heat through. Let the chicken cool for 10 minutes. Pour the lemon juice over the top and top with the zest and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 50268,&quot;Marshmallow Dreidels 6 thin pretzel sticks, halved 12 marshmallows 1 cup white candy melts 12 chocolate kiss candies Blue candy melts, melted, for decorating Instructions: Push the pretzel sticks into the tops of the marshmallows.

Microwave until the water is hot and the chestnuts have softened, about 3 minutes. Drain the chestnuts (reserving the liquid) and place in the bowl of a food processor. Blend with 1 tablespoon of the reserved liquid until finely ground. Add the 1 1/2 cups of the Parmesan, the ricotta and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Blend until completely smooth. Taste for seasoning and adjust with additional salt and pepper if needed. Add 1 egg and blend until well combined. Transfer to a mixing bowl and reserve. Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil (it should taste like sea water). While the water is coming to a boil, form the raviolis. Whisk the remaining egg in a small bowl with 1/2 teaspoon water. Place 5 wonton skins on a lightly floured work surface. Brush the wonton skins with the egg wash. Place a leveled tablespoon of the chestnut filling in the center of each wonton skin. Place 5 more wonton skins directly on top. Use your fingers to gently press the skins together. Use a 2 1/2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter lightly dipped in flour to cut around the filling. Transfer the filled raviolis to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and cover with a slightly damp paper towel. Make 15 additional raviolis with the remaining wonton skins and filling. Once all of the raviolis are made, make the brown butter sauce. Place the butter, garlic and thyme in a large, straight-sided saute pan. Heat over medium heat until the butter starts to bubble and foam, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Continue cooking until the foam subsides and brown specks start to appear, 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Turn off the heat and cover with a lid to keep warm while you cook the raviolis. In batches, add the raviolis one at a time to the boiling water, stirring after every addition. Cook until the raviolis float to the top, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove from the water and add to the browned butter; it is okay if some pasta water gets in the sauce. Toss the raviolis in the sauce. Continue with the remaining raviolis. To serve, remove the thyme sprigs and garlic from the sauce, reserving the thyme. Divide the raviolis and sauce among 4 plates. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and crispy thyme leaves. If desired, lightly drizzle with balsamic vinegar. Use a peeler to thinly shave whole chestnuts over the entire dish. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 50270,&quot;Parmesan-Crusted Chicken with Grilled Baby Artichokes 1 clove garlic, minced 2 lemons, cut in half<br> 1/2 cup olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 baby artichokes, trimmed and cut in half<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 large eggs, beaten<br> 1 cup breadcrumbs<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1 1/2 pounds chicken breast, thinly sliced<br> 3/4 cup canola or vegetable oil<br> 2 cups watercress<br> Instructions: Whisk together the garlic and juice of 1 1/2 of the lemons in a small bowl.

When sausage starts releasing juices, add onions and jalapeno. Stir-fry until sausage is thoroughly browned, and onions begin to caramelize. Season with salt and black pepper, to taste. Drain excess juice, transfer sausage filling to a bowl, and pat dry with paper towels. If filling is too wet, it will damage pastry dough. Add cream cheese to the filling and incorporate it with hands. Cut puff pastry squares diagonally, to form two equal size triangles. Before filling each one, moisten edges with a brush and water. Place about 2 tablespoons filling in the center of the dough, forming a triangle within the triangle of pastry dough. Bring the two points of the base of the pastry dough triangle to meet the third point, and firmly squeeze ALL edges together. Make sure the filling is completely enveloped by dough. Press the tines of a fork into each seam; the indentations will allow dough to expand when baked. Bake at 400 degrees until dough puffs and browns (20-25 minutes).

Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, rinse the octopus. Remove the head just above the eyes and then make a cut just below the eyes to remove them completely. Dip the ends of the octopus tentacles in the simmering wine mixture for a few seconds. Remove and then dip them again. Repeat once more for a total of 3 times; this will curl the tips for a very pretty result. Submerge the octopus tentacles and the head in the wine mixture, adding more water if needed to cover the octopus. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently, covered, until the tip of a paring knife goes into the thickest part without much resistance, about 1 hour 45 minutes. Allow the octopus to cool for 30 minutes in the liquid before transferring to a plate to cool completely. When cool enough to handle, use a piece of paper towel to wipe the skin away. Cut the base into individual legs. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle the octopus legs and head with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Place on the hot grill and cook until charred in a few spots, about 4 minutes per side. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Cut off the top 1/4 of the lemons and shave a small slice off the bottom so it stands easily. Using a grapefruit knife, cut out the flesh of the lemon and place in a strainer set over a bowl. Be careful not to cut through the bottom. Stand the lemons on a cookie sheet and place in the freezer and freeze until solid. Press the flesh of the lemons through the strainer to extract all of the juice. You should end up with about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice. Add the water to the lemon juice. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, until the mixture is of desired sweetness. Add the thyme and limoncello and let sit for 15 minutes. Strain the mixture into a roasting pan or baking dish. The dish should be large enough so the liquid is not more than 1-inch deep. Freeze the mixture for 1 hour. Remove from the freezer and scrape with 2 forks to break up ice. Return to the freezer and freeze until solid, about 2 to 3 hours, scraping with forks every hour or so.

Pulse for a few seconds and then pour into a large mixing bowl. Add the shortening and knead it into the flour with your hands until it is crumbly. Add the milk all at once and mix in with a spatula until it begins to come together. Lightly flour your hands and the countertop and turn the dough out onto the countertop. Knead the dough ball, folding over 10 to 20 times. Using a rolling pin roll the dough to 1/3 to 1/2-inch thickness, then cut into rounds using a 2 1/4-inch ring. Roll each round as thinly as possible or to 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling onto the dough, brush the edges of half of the dough lightly with the egg wash, fold over and seal the edges together with the tines of a fork, dipping it into flour as needed. Gently press down to flatten and evenly distribute the filling and snip or cut 3 slits in the top of the pie. Dock pies that are going to be deep-fried, instead of snipping or cutting slits. To pan-fry pies, place a medium saute pan over medium low heat along with 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable, canola oil or butter. Once heated, place 2 to 3 pies at a time into pan and saute until golden on both sides, approximately 3 to 4 minutes per side. Allow to cool 4 to 5 minutes before serving. To deep-fry pies, heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or a large heavy pot to 375 degrees F. Once hot, add 1 to 2 pies at a time and fry until golden brown, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. To bake pies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place finished pies onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. To make toaster pastries: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Divide dough in half and roll out to less than 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 4 inch by 5 inch rectangles. Place 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling onto center of one piece of dough. Brush the edges with egg wash and top with second piece of dough. Seal edges by pressing together with tine of fork. Gently press down to flatten and evenly distribute the filling and dock the top of the pie. Repeat with second half of dough. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, allow to cool completely and place into zip-top bags until ready to toast. The pies will not be brown until toasted. Place all of the ingredients into a small saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a bowl and place in refrigerator to cool completely before using as filling. For each pie place 1 to 2 tablespoons onto the center of the dough. Follow directions above. Yield: enough for 10 to 15 pies Place the sugar, cocoa powder, salt, and butter into a large zip-top bag and squish to combine. Cut a whole in 1 corner of the bag. For each pie, pipe 1 to 2 tablespoons of mixture onto the center of the dough. Follow directions above.

Season the meat with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the meat into 6 portions (about 4 ounces each). Using your hands, form each portion into a ball shape by gently tossing it from one hand to the other. Form each portion into a thin patty. Each patty should be somewhat larger than a slice of the rye bread since it will shrink when cooked. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-heat. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 7 minutes. Transfer the onion to a bowl. Wipe out the skillet; return to the heat, and heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add 2 patties and saute, turning once, until well browned and cooked to medium, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining oil and patties. Arrange 1/6 of the onion over one bread slice. Place 1 cheese slice over the onion and top with a patty. Top the patty with a slice of cheese and cover with a bread slice. Spread about 2 teaspoons of butter over the outside of each slice. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 6 sandwiches. Heat the cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 2 sandwiches and cook, turning once, until lightly browned and the cheese has melted, about 5 minutes per side.

The water will turn milky white. Drain the dal and repeat 3 times, or until the water is clear. Add 6 cups of cold water to the bowl, add the dal and set aside to soak for 6 hours.\u202f Reserve 1 cup of the soaking water, then strain the soaked dal. Transfer the dal to a blender and add 1/4 cup of the soaking water. Blend until completely smooth. Add a little more water if the mixture is still chunky. The batter should have a thick consistency like a dense pancake batter. Leave the batter covered at room temperature for at least 2 hours or refrigerate overnight and bring to room temperature before using. Make the raita: Stir the yogurt, milk, sugar, mint, black pepper, and ginger together in a bowl. Stir in the cumin and rock salt if using. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Make the dahi bhalla: When ready to fry, add oil to a depth of 5 to 6 inches to a deep pot. Place over medium-high heat until the oil registers 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Stir about 1 1/2 teaspoons salt into the batter. Fill a medium bowl with water. Wet your hands in the water, then gently roll about 1/4 cup batter into a ball. Hold the ball in the center of your palm and make a hole in the center with a finger.\u202f\u202f(If you are unable to make a clean hole in the dough, just make smaller discs of about 2 tablespoons and no thicker than 1/2 inch.) Working in batches, carefully place the formed dumplings into the hot oil; the dough will sink and immediately bounce back to the surface. Fry the dumplings until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and drain on a wire rack or paper towels. (We love eating dahi bhalla freshly made, but they can be finished later by cooling them completely, then freezing them in airtight containers.) Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil in a saucepan. Add a generous pinch of salt and switch off the flame. After 5 minutes, place all of the fried dumplings in the water, cover and let sit 5 minutes. Remove the cover; the dumplings should be swollen. Take the dumplings out one at a time and use your hands to gently squeeze the water out of them. To serve, pour a third of the prepared raita over one large serving platter or individual serving dishes (shallow dishes are preferable as you want the dumplings in a single layer). Place the dumplings on top and then cover the dumpling with the remaining raita. Drizzle with tamarind chutney and cilantro chutney. Sprinkle with chaat masala and cumin powder, and garnish with aloo bhujia or sev and cilantro. If you prefer the dish to be spicier, add fresh green cl to taste. Serve immediately. Place the tamarind, sugar, ginger, cl powder, black pepper and rock salt in a saucepan and add 4 cups water. Bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours over medium heat until the tamarind is dark in color and the mixture has thickened. The chutney should be thick but pourable; add more water if necessary. Carefully transfer the mixture to a blender and puree. Taste and add kosher salt to taste, and more sugar if the sauce tastes very sour. Return the mixture to the pot and simmer for another 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely. Keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 months. Blend the cilantro, chiles, ginger, lemon juice, chaat masala, ice cubes and salt together in a blender until smooth. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 50297,&quot;Grilled Smashed Potatoes with Toasted Cumin Vinaigrette 2 tablespoons ground cumin 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 16 small new potatoes<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons canola oil 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Put the cumin in a small skillet over low heat and toast, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not dark, 2 minutes.

Put the potatoes in a pot, cover with cold water, add 1 tablespoon of salt, bring to a boil and cook until a paring knife inserted meets with some resistance, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Heat a charcoal or gas grill to high. Using a potato masher, smash the potatoes, leaving them very chunky, and toss with the canola oil and some salt and pepper. Put the potatoes in a grill basket and grill, covered, tossing occasionally, until slightly charred and crisp in spots, about 6 minutes. Remove to a bowl and toss with the vinaigrette.

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan heat the milk, the vanilla pod over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Do not boil. For the caramel: Mix together 1 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Heat until the sugar dissolves and continue cooking until the sugar turns golden brown. Do not stir. Remove from heat and add 2 tablespoons of orange juice. (Be very careful when you add this because the hot sugar will fly everywhere.) Shake the pan to incorporate the orange juice and sugar. Spray 8 (4 to 5-ounce) ramekin dishes or 1 large flan mold, with cooking spray. Pour the caramel into the dishes, to completely cover the bottom. In a large bowl mix together the remaining 2/3 cup sugar, the eggs, and a pinch of salt and whisk well. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk and gradually blend the milk into egg and sugar mixture while stirring or whisking constantly. Stir in the heavy cream, then strain the egg mixture through a sieve. At this point, add the vanilla bean seeds and pour the mixture into the ramekin dishes over the caramel. Fill a deep casserole dish with water and arrange ramekins in the casserole dish. The water should reach halfway up the dishes. Bake in the preheated 200 degrees F oven until the custard sets, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the ramekins from the oven and cool. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before serving. To serve: Mix together fresh berries and raspberry sauce in a small bowl. Remove the ramekins from the refrigerator and loosen the edges with a small knife. Put a dessert plate on top of the ramekin dish, and turn upside down, so that the caramel sits on top. Remove ramekin dish.

Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolk and ice water and work that in with your hands. (Or do the whole thing in a food processor, pulsing a couple of times to combine the dry ingredients, then pulsing in the butter, and then the egg.) Check the consistency of the dough by squeezing a small amount together between thumb and forefingers: You want there to be just enough moisture to bind the dough so that it holds together without being too wet or sticky. If it&#39;s still crumbly, add a little more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time. When you get it to the right consistency, shape the dough into a disk and wrap it in plastic.

Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Return the pasta to the pot. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and season with salt, and pepper. Add the yellow squash and saute until almost tender. Add the lemon zest and continue cooking for 1 more minute. Add the white wine, and scrape up the pan releasing any dry bits on the bottom. Add the chicken stock, heavy cream, lemon juice, and reserved cooking liquid. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until the sauce is creamy and coats the back of a spoon. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese. Season the sauce with salt, and pepper, to taste. Toss the pasta with the sauce and serve. Garnish with additional Parmesan cheese. To make fresh pasta dough: Mound the flour on a clean work surface. Hollow out the center making a well in the middle of the flour with steep sides. Break the eggs into the well. Add the salt, and olive oil to the hollow center and gently mix together with a fork. Gradually start incorporating the flour by pulling in the flour from the sides of the well. As you incorporate more of the flour, the dough will start to take shape. With your hands or a bench scraper continue working the dough until it comes together. If the dough is too dry, add a little water; if too wet or sticky, add a little flour. Begin kneading the dough and keep kneading until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. At this point, set the dough aside, cover it with plastic, and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes. You can store the dough in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours, but allow it to return to room temperature before rolling it out. Divide the pasta dough into 4 even sections. Keep each section covered with plastic wrap or a clean towel while you work with each one. Flour the dough, the rollers of a pasta roller (or your rolling pin), your hands, and the work surface. If using a pasta machine: Flatten 1 of the of the dough pieces between your hands or with a floured rolling pin until it forms a thick oval disk. Dust the disk, the roller, and your hands with additional flour. Flour a baking sheet to hold the rolled out finished pasta. With the roller on the widest setting, pass the pasta through the machine&#39;s rollers a few times until it is smooth. Fold the dough over into 1/3, and continue to pass through a few more times until the pasta is smooth again. Begin adjusting the pasta machine settings to become thinner, passing the dough through a few times at each setting. If rolling the pasta by hand: Flatten a dough piece into a thick oval disk with your hands. Flour a baking sheet for the rolled out finished pasta. Place the oval dough disk on a floured work surface, and sprinkle with additional flour. Begin rolling out the dough with a floured rolling pin working from the center of the dough outwards, constantly moving the dough and lifting it to make sure it&#39;s not sticking. Flavor and color variations: Cook&#39;s Note: All color additions should be added to eggs before incorporating into the flour. Keep in mind that you will need to add a little bit of flour to your basic pasta recipe to compensate for the additional liquid added Spinach Pasta Dough (green hue): Blanch 8 ounces (about 3 cups) spinach leaves. Puree in a food processor or blender until smooth. Press the spinach puree through a small strainer or chinois, removing the liquid before mixing with the eggs. Add 3 tablespoons spinach puree to the eggs before mixing. If the dough feels too sticky, add additional flour until a soft, silky dough is achieved. Tomato Pasta Dough (orange hue): Add 2 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste to the eggs before incorporating into the flour. Beet Pasta Dough (pinkish-red hue): Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roast 1 large beet in aluminum foil about 45 minutes, or until tender. Peel the beet and puree in a food processor. Add the beet puree (about 4 tablespoons) to eggs before incorporating into the flour. Herb Pasta Dough (speckled): Mince 1/2 cup fresh herbs and add to eggs before incorporating into the flour. Squid Ink Pasta Dough (black hue): Add 1 tablespoon squid ink to the eggs before incorporating into the flour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner, Riesling]&quot; 50311,&quot;Healthy Chicken-and-Cheese-Stuffed Sweet Potatoes 1 medium sweet potato, pierced all over with a fork 1/4 cup shredded skinless cooked chicken breast (rotisserie or leftover) 3 tablespoons shredded mild Cheddar Kosher salt<br> 1/2 small avocado 1 tablespoon salsa verde 1 scallion, sliced Instructions: Microwave the sweet potato on high until tender (when you squeeze it with a clean dish towel, it should feel really soft), about 5 minutes.

Line a 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick spray. Mix together the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the mixture into the prepared pan and pat lightly to pack it slightly. Bake until light golden brown on top and done in the middle, watching to make sure it doesn&#39;t burn, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Spoon the dulce de leche into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave to just slightly soften it, about 45 seconds. Scoop it on top of the oatmeal base and use an offset spatula to spread it out to the edges and into an even layer. Sprinkle on a layer of peanuts so that they completely cover the caramel and use your hands to gently press them into the caramel. Sprinkle on the butterscotch chips and mini chocolate chips in generous layers. Note: The warmth of the cookie base and caramel should slightly soften the butterscotch and chocolate chips. When that happens, use your hands to very gently press the chips just enough to anchor them together (but not enough to misshape them). If the pan isn&#39;t warm enough, pop it into the oven for 30 seconds or so and gently press the chips to anchor them together. Chill the bars for 2 to 3 hours to make them easy to slice. Remove them from the pan, place on a cutting board and use a long serrated knife to cut into small squares (they&#39;re rich!).

When they are cool enough to handle, core the tomatoes and peel off the skin. Using clean hands, squish the tomatoes, pushing the pulp through the sieve into the bowl underneath. At first you will have a watery liquid. Add the tomato liquid to the eggplant and then continue to push the tomato pulp through the sieve, until you have only seeds and hard pulp pieces left. Finally, add the rest of the pulpy liquid to the eggplants and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the sugar and continue to cook for 10 more minutes, until thickened. In the meantime, bring the reserved cooking liquid back to a boil, add additional salt, and cook the fettuccine according to directions on the package. Drain well. To serve, spoon a third of the eggplant into a bowl and set aside. Toss the pasta in the saute pan with the remaining eggplant and add the packaged mozzarella. Place the mixture in a large serving bowl and top with the reserved eggplant, the fresh mozzarella and the Parmesan. Garnish with the remaining basil leaves and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]</p><p>&quot; 50350,&quot;Cheese Pastry 3 ounces cream cheese, room temperature 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour Instructions: Combine the cream cheese, butter and salt in a large bowl or in a food processor fitted with the metal blade.

Allow to come up to room temperature, about 2 hours. Preheat a grill for two-zone cooking with high heat on one side and no heat on the other side. (The overall grill temperature should be 325 degrees F on the grill grates.) Using a paper towel, wipe off any excess moisture and salt from the steaks. Start the steaks on the indirect heat side of the grill. (The target grill temperature should be around 250 degrees F.) Cover and grill the steaks, flipping once, until the internal temperature reads 125 degrees F (10 degrees away from finished target temp), about 45 minutes to an hour. Meanwhile, combine the butter, thyme, Worcestershire, a pinch of salt and some pepper in a small bowl. Spread one spoonful of the butter directly on your serving board underneath where each steak will be placed. Do this before you get your steaks on the grill so that when they come off, you can set each steak on a spoonful of the butter. Set aside the remaining butter for the top of the grilled steaks. Move the steaks to the direct-heat side of the grill and sear until the internal temperature reads 135 degrees F, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place the steaks on the resting butter and use a fork to spread the remaining butter over the steaks. Let the steaks rest for 10 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 50356,&quot;Strawberry and Almond Cream Parfait 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 4 egg yolks 1 1/4 cups whole milk 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 3 ounces marzipan 1/3 cup granulated sugar Nonstick spray 1 3/4 cups slivered almonds, lightly toasted Kosher salt 12 ounces fresh strawberries, hulled washed and quartered 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream, lightly whipped Instructions: In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar, flour and egg yolks until thick and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. In a medium pot, bring the milk and vanilla bean to a gentle boil. Pour about half of the milk mixture over the eggs whisking constantly. Pour the whole mix back into the pot and place the pot back over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Note: you must stir this mixture constantly, scraping the bottom as you stir, so the flour doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom and burn. Remove the pot from the stove and whisk in the marzipan. Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap and cover it with a coating of plastic wrap. Place the tray in the refrigerator to cool. In a medium skillet over low heat, melt the granulated sugar. Spray a tray with a light coating of nonstick spray. Spray the end of a wooden spoon as well. When the sugar turns light brown, add the almonds and stir to coat them with the sugar. Spoon the almonds on to the baking sheet and sprinkle lightly with salt. When the almond cream has cooled, remove and discard the vanilla bean and place the pastry cream in a medium bowl. Whisk until it is smooth. In another medium bowl, toss the strawberries and brown sugar together. Place 4 to 6 glasses on a flat surface. Begin by spooning a thin layer of almond cream in the bottom of each. Sprinkle with a few almonds. Add a layer of the whipped cream. Top with a layer of strawberries. Repeat the layers until the glasses are full. Refrigerate for a while before serving or enjoy immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 50357,&quot;Hazelnut Crunch Cake with Mascarpone and Chocolate 1 box chocolate cake mix 1 cup (about 4 1/2-ounces) hazelnuts, toasted and skinned 2/3 cup sugar 1/3 cup water Two 8-ounce containers mascarpone cheese, room temperature 1 cup cream 3/4 cup powdered sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup bittersweet chocolate chips 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon orange zest Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cut off most of the green part of the leek, wash well, and chop into coarse pieces. Add the leek, the garlic and the red pepper to the olive oil. Stir. Cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have begun to soften. Add the basil, saffron, orange peel, and fennel seeds. Mix well with the leeks. Then add the fish pieces, saute for 2 minutes over high heat and boil for 1 minute. Add the wine and water, stir well, and simmer for 1 hour. Stir occasionally, skimming foam off the top of the pot. When done, select a clean pot that is large and wide. Strain the broth into the pot through a sieve, pressing on the solids in the sieve. Add salt and pepper to taste. For the toasts: Heat an oven to 250 degrees. Place the bread slices on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes, turning occasionally. When done, rub each slice with the cut side of the garlic clove and rub with torn basil leaves. Work carefully since the toasts are brittle. The toasts will pick up a rich green color. Reserve. For the first course: Bring the bouillabaisse broth in the large, wide pot to a simmer. Cut the potatoes in half and add to the broth. Simmer for 10 minutes. Then add the fish, adding the thickest and firmest ones first. you must use your judgement here; the fish should be firm, just-cooked. Most fish will not take longer than 5-7 minutes in the simmering broth. When the fish are done, remove them to a platter. Working quickly on a slotted board, fillet the whole fish (a very large spoon works nicely) and divide the fillets evenly among the 6 dinner plates. Reserve the fish bones and heads. Cut up the chunks of fish (monkfish, haddock, etc.) and divide among the plates. Return all juices from the slotted board to the bouillabaisse pot. Place a cooked potato half in the center of each plate, and ladle a few tablespoons of broth around the fish on each plate. Drizzle a teaspoon of extra-virgin olive oil over the fish on each plate and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Strew the chopped parsley over the fish and serve immediately. For the second course: While your guests are eating the first course, bring the pot of broth to a boil. Plunge the lobsters into the broth, cover, and cook for 12 minutes. Remove lobsters from broth when done and working over a slotted board, cut into 6 half-tail portions, 6 claws, and 6 first joints (the part that connects the claw to the body). While working, slip the shelled shrimp and the scallops into the simmering broth for about 1 minute or until just cooked. Now divide the lobster pieces, the cooked shrimp and the cooked scallops among 6 plates. Place a dollop of aioli on the side of the plate. Serve immediately, but don&#39;t forget to put the remaining pieces of lobster (like the chest and legs), juices from the slotted board, the shrimp shells, and the reserved fish heads and bones from the first course into the bouillabaisse pot. Cover the pot and turn the heat to medium-high. For the third course: Cook the broth with the shellfish shells and saffron in it over medium-high heat for at least 20 minutes; after 30-40 minutes, it will pick up even more flavor, but it may be difficult to wait that long. When ready to serve, select 6 wide, shallow soup bowls and place two toasts in the center of each. Ladle the bouillabaisse broth around the toasts and top the toasts with a dollop of aioli. Place a small basil leaf on the aioli and scatter the shredded basil over the soup. Serve immediately with additional aioli on the side. ; Combine all of the above ingredients except the olive oil and process for 30 seconds. With the motor running slowly add the olive oil drop by drop in the beginning, and then pour the remaining oil in a slow steady stream. The mixture will be thick, but not stiff.

In large mixer bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy with a heavy duty mixer. Add the melted chocolate and mix well. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix thoroughly after each addition. Add the vanilla and mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Add half of the flour to the mixer bowl along with 1/2 cup of the half-and-half. Mix until the flour is mixed in, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the rest of flour mixture and the other 1/2 cup half-and-half. Mix until the batter is smooth and all of the flour lumps are gone. Fill 24 cupcake liners half full and bake for 20 minutes in the convection oven or 28 minutes in the standard oven. The tops of the cupcakes should be lightly browned. Check the cupcakes to make sure no batter sticks to a wooden toothpick when inserted into the cupcake. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the ganache: Put the chocolate chips, heavy cream and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each time, until the chocolate chips are melted and the ganache has the consistency of hot fudge. It will look like a mess at first but as you continue to stir it will start to form a thicker mixture. If the ganache becomes too thick to dip, put it back in the microwave for about 15 seconds and stir again. For the chocolate whipped mousse filling and topping: In large mixer bowl, beat the heavy cream, half-and-half and pudding mix until light and fluffy using heavy duty mixer. It should have the consistency of whipped cream. Put the filling in a pastry bag or zipper bag with a corner cut off. To assemble: Make a hole in the middle of each cupcake using a sharp knife. Be sure and leave a small amount of cake in the bottom of the hole. Fill the cupcakes using the filling in the bag. Using the same bag, frost the tops of the cupcakes with the filling. Put in the freezer until the topping mixture is cold and somewhat stiff, about 20 minutes. Dip each cupcake in ganache and immediately sprinkle with mini chocolate chips and garnish with a piece of chocolate bar. Let the cupcakes sit until the ganache is set. Then serve, or refrigerate until time to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 50367,&quot;Garlic-Infused Oil and Dipping Sauce 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced Balsamic vinegar Pinch red pepper flakes Pinch salt Freshly ground black pepper Finely grated Parmesan or Romano cheese Hot crusty loaf Italian or French bread, sliced Instructions: To make the garlic oil, in a small saucepan, gently heat the oil over medium heat.

Stir until the sugar and salt have completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the ice cubes to cool.<br> Place the pork loin in large freezer bag (or large plastic container with a lid). Pour the brine into the freezer bag, submerging the roast completely, seal, and set aside for 2 hours.<br> Preheat the grill and set up two zones-one hot for searing and another medium for cooking through.<br> Using the tip of a paring knife, pierce the casing of the sausage all over (this will ensure the flavor of the sausage goes into the pork as it cooks). Remove the pork from the brine and pat it dry with paper towels. Using a clean honing steel, poke a hole into the center of the loin lengthwise and work it all the way through so it creates a cavity. Insert the sausage into the cavity so that it sits neatly within the roast. Season the roast with salt, pepper, granulated garlic, paprika, and cumin.<br> Wipe down the grates of the grill with oil-blotted towels. Place the roast on the hot part of the grill and sear fat side down, 3 to 4 minutes, and then on each of the three other sides. Transfer the roast to the cooler part of the grill (indirect heat) and cook until the internal temperature hits 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 55 minutes. Set the roast on a platter and tent with foil. Allow it to rest for 15 minutes before carving into thick slices. Served drizzled with juices from the platter and the Creole mustard.<br> Traditional Oven Cooking Method:<br> Pan-roast the pork by searing the roast on all four sides in a hot cast-iron pan over high heat, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer the pan to a preheated 350 degrees F oven and roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until cooked through to a temperature of 165 degrees F in the center. Rest the roast in the pan, then slice and serve with the pan juices and mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM (Grenache, Syrah, Mourvdre)]&quot; 50369,&quot;Pasta Al Forno: Oven Baked Pasta 1 pound/450 g rigatoni pasta 4 tablespoons/60 ml extra-virgin olive oil 1 large eggplant, cubed 10 large sun-dried tomatoes, chopped 15 infornate olives, pitted and chopped 2 dried cl peppers, crushed, optional 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 (25-ounce/750 ml) jar tomato puree Salt 12 ounces/400 g freshly grated mozzarella Smoked scamorza cheese, as much as desired, roughly chopped Freshly grated Parmigiano cheese, for sprinkling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Preheat a 14-inch skillet or medium roasting pan over medium heat on your largest burner. Mix grill seasoning, cumin, paprika and coriander together. Place the thyme, cilantro or basil, parsley and pistachios in the food processor and process into a paste. Remove bowl from processor and remove blade from bowl. Have a rubber spatula on hand. Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil generously over the breasts to coat the skin. Loosen skin of the breasts with a small sharp knife. Divide the herb and nut paste between the flesh and skin on each breast. Use your hands to move the paste around under the skin to evenly distribute the mixture. Coat the extra-virgin olive oil coated skin with the spice mixture. Set the coated breasts into the large skillet or roasting pan. Wash hands. Set a second slightly smaller skillet or pan on top of the breasts and weight down with a couple of bricks covered in foil. Crisp the skin 8 to 10 minutes then transfer meat to oven and roast 35 to 40 minutes, until an instant-read meat thermometer registers 165 to 170 degrees F. While turkey roasts, heat a second large, deep skillet over medium to medium-high heat with 5 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces. To melted butter, add bay, celery, apple, 1/2 of the onion and zucchini. Season the vegetables liberally with salt and pepper. Cook 10 minutes or until softened. Add crumbled muffins and sunflower seeds to the pan and combine with the vegetables. Season the stuffing with poultry seasoning then adjust salt and pepper. Dampen the stuffing with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of stock. Pile the stuffing into a serving dish. Place in oven to just crisp up the top along with turkey or, if the pan does not fit, when the turkey comes out, switch on the broiler and crisp the top of stuffing - it should only take a couple of minutes, tops. In a sauce pot, melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat and add the finely chopped remaining 1/2 of the onion. Sweat the onion out 5 to 6 minutes to make it nice and sweet. Add the flour to the skillet and whisk 1 minute. Add in the chipotles and their sauce then whisk in 4 to 4 1/2 cups chicken stock. Thicken the gravy 2 to 3 minutes then season with salt, to taste. Let turkey rest to distribute juices then thinly slice and serve with mounds of stuffing and gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 50373,&quot;Chocolate Coconut Almond Layer Cake 2 (8-inch) round store/bakery bought chocolate cake layers 2 (16-ounce) cans chocolate frosting 1 teaspoon almond extract 1 cup flake coconut 1/4 cup toasted and chopped peanuts Instructions: Cut each cake layer in half horizontally to make a total of 4 layers.

In a large bowl, break up the mozzarella curd into small pieces. Coat the curd with 2 tablespoons of salt, and set aside. In another large bowl, salt the second gallon of water with the remaining salt and add as much ice as it can hold. This is where it gets a little tricky. Carefully pour the boiling water over the salted curd. As the curds begin to melt, carefully stir with a wooden spoon for 1 minute. Submerge both of your hands in the ice water for as long as you can stand it, because you&#39;re about to stretch the mozzarella in boiling hot water. The curd will have settled into the bottom of the bowl, and at this point you have to work quickly or risk over-cooking the curd. Dip your hands into the hot water and begin stretching the mozzarella. By stretching the cheese you insure that all the curds have completely melted. The curds will become incredibly soft and have buttery shine, and also, it smells wonderful. Form the mozzarella into tomato size balls, and then drop the mozzarella into the ice water to stop the cooking process. Work quickly, as the mozzarella will start to become rubbery the longer it sits in the hot water. Wrap each mozzarella ball tightly in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to a week. Serve the cheese with the best tomatoes you can find, really fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil, salt and fresh cracked pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 50376,&quot;Thai Quinoa Bowls with Pork 1 pork tenderloin (about 1 1/4 pounds) 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons chili-garlic sauce, plus more for serving 3/4 cup quinoa Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/3 cup crunchy peanut butter 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 1 teaspoon grated lime zest, plus 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 cup frozen shelled edamame, thawed 1 large carrot, shaved into ribbons with a vegetable peeler 2 cups bean sprouts 1 cup fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Bruise the tops with something heavy, like a meat mallet, and reserve for the broth. Peel off 2 or 3 of the woody outer layers from the base stalks until you reach the smoother, more tender core. Roughly chop the stalks and put in a food processor along with the garlic and shallots. Pulse about 20 times until everything is finely chopped, but not a paste. Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add the chopped lemongrass mixture and cook until soft and starting to brown, about 6 minutes. Add the crushed red pepper and stir for 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons fish sauce, 4 teaspoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has thickened slightly, a spoon dragged across the pan leaves a trail and the oil is starting to separate from the solids. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the lemongrass mixture from the pan and reserve. Add the beef broth, 4 cups of water, and the bruised lemongrass tops to the saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook until it tastes like lemongrass, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the vermicelli noodles. Cook, stirring periodically, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain very well and divide among 4 large soup bowls.

You will need a slotted spoon to drop the tomatoes into the hot oil. De-core and cut the ends off green tomatoes. Cut tomatoes 1/2-inch thick and set aside in medium bowl. In small bowl, set aside 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour. In medium bowl, mix milk and eggs to create an egg wash. In large bowl, combine remaining flour, cornmeal and salt. Add celery salt, cayenne, pepper, onion powder, and paprika. This is the cornmeal breading mixture for the tomatoes. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper to place the breaded tomatoes on after final dredging. Begin the dipping process by dredging the tomatoes in the all-purpose flour, then the egg wash, and finally through the cornmeal breading mixture. Repeat this process until all the tomatoes are breaded. Once the oil has reached 350 degrees F, begin frying until golden brown. Tomatoes will float to the top when finished cooking. Drain on paper towels. Garnish with cashew relish and finish with a dollop of goat cheese. Clean and pick cilantro leaves off stems. Cut stems off jalapenos and roughly chop. Combine cashews, chopped jalapenos and cilantro in food processor and pulse until combined. Do not puree, it should be a rustic mix.

Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bring a pot of water to a boil and salt generously; prepare an ice water bath. Blanch the broccoli in the boiling water for 1 minute, then remove it to the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking and set the color. Remove it from the water to drain. Roll out the pie crust on a floured surface and press into a deep fluted tart pan with a removable bottom (or a deep-dish pie pan). Lay the onions over the base of the crust, then lay the brocolli pieces on top of the onions. Chop the Brie and lay that in the crust too. Whip the half-and-half, eggs and some salt and pepper in a large bowl, then pour it into the crust. Sprinkle the chives on top. Place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet, cover lightly with aluminum foil and bake for 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the quiche is set and the crust is golden brown, another 10 to 15 minutes. (The quiche will still seem slightly loose, but will continue to set once removed from the oven.) Let the quiche sit for 10 to 15 minutes, then, if using a tart pan, remove the quiche from the pan. Cut into slices with a sharp serrated knife and serve. Put the flour in a large bowl. With a pastry cutter, gradually work the shortening and butter into the flour until it resembles coarse meal, 3 to 4 minutes. In a small bowl, beat the egg with a fork and pour it into the flour mixture. Add the cold water, white vinegar and salt. Stir gently to combine. Form the dough into 2 evenly sized balls and place each ball into a gallon food storage bag. Using a rolling pin, slightly flatten each ball of dough (to about 1/2 inch thick) to make rolling easier later. Seal the bags and place them in the freezer until you need them. (If you will be using them immediately, it&#39;s still a good idea to put them in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to chill.) When you are ready to use the dough to make a crust, remove from the freezer and allow to thaw for 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 50429,&quot;Easy Chocolate Tart One 14-ounce package chocolate sandwich cookies, such as Oreos 1 stick (8 tablespoons) salted butter, melted<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 3 tablespoons salted butter<br> 12 ounces dark chocolate, chopped<br> 12 ounces milk chocolate, chopped<br> 4 ounces white chocolate 2 teaspoons coconut oil<br> Instructions: For the crust: Add the cookies to a food processor and pulse to fine crumbs. Pour in the melted butter and pulse together. Tip into an 11-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom and press the mixture in with a 1/4-cup measure to form an even crust on the bottom and sides. Put it in the freezer for 15 minutes to set. For the ganache: Put the cream and butter in a pan and heat until the mixture starts to bubble. Put the dark and milk chocolate in a bowl and pour the warmed cream and butter over it. Mix everything together until melted and fully combined, then pour it into the chilled tart base. Refrigerate the tart overnight until set. For the chocolate curl garnish: Put the white chocolate and coconut oil in a bowl and set over a pan of simmering water until the chocolate is melted; mix together. Pour the melted mixture onto the underside of a clean baking sheet and spread it in a very thin layer with an offset spatula or knife. Put it in the freezer until set, about 2 minutes. (To check if it is set, press it with your fingertip; it should leave the slightest mark but not a depression.) Using a sharp-edged spatula, scrape the chocolate from the bottom of the baking sheet into curls. Remove the tart from the pan and decorate with the curls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 50430,&quot;Double Smoky Ribs with Bacon-Bourbon BBQ Sauce 3 pounds boneless country-style pork ribs (8 ribs) 2 tablespoons smoked paprika 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon garlic powder 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 large handfuls apple or hickory wood chips, soaked in water for at least 30 minutes 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 bacon slices, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 medium yellow onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 12-ounce bottle ketchup-style chili sauce (1 cup) 1/2 cup peach preserves 1/3 cup bourbon* (You may substitute orange juice) 1/3 cup cider vinegar 2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons molasses (not blackstrap) 1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper sauce Instructions: To make BBQ Sauce: Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp and browned, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels, leaving fat in saucepan. Let bacon cool. Add onion to saucepan and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chili sauce, peach preserves, bourbon, vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and molasses. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring often, until reduced by about one quarter, 20 to 25 minutes. Finely chop cooled bacon and stir into sauce; add hot pepper sauce. Let cool. Makes about 2 1/2 cups sauce. Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. To make ribs: Mix paprika, sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper together in small bowl. Season ribs with paprika mixture. Let ribs stand at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes. Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect cooking with medium heat, about 350 degrees F. For a gas grill: Use a smoker box or create one using small, shallow aluminum foil pan. Remove cooking grates. Preheat grill on high. Turn one burner off. Place disposable aluminum foil pan over a burner, adding 1 handful of drained chips. Replace grates. For a charcoal grill: Place large disposable aluminum foil pan on one side of charcoal grate and fill with 1 quart water. Build fire on opposite side, and let burn until coals are coated with white ash. Spread coals in grill opposite pan and let burn 15-20 minutes (you should be able to hold your hand about 1 inch above the grate for about 3 seconds). Add 1 handful of drained chips to coals. Position cooking grate in grill. Lightly oil grill grate. Grill ribs with indirect heat, with the lid closed, for 30 minutes. Add remaining drained chips to box or coals. Grill, with lid closed, turning occasionally, until tender, about 1 hour more. (On a charcoal grill, add more charcoal as needed to maintain temperature, leaving grill lid open for a few minutes to help charcoal ignite.) During the last 15 minutes, brush ribs with some of the sauce, turning every few minutes to glaze. Transfer to platter, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve hot with remaining sauce, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo]&quot; 50431,&quot;Calamares a La Romana Fried Squid with Aioli 4 cups soy oil 12 ounces squid bodies, cut into rings Flour Mix, recipe follows Salt 4 ounces Aioli, recipe follows 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves 1 tablespoon sweet paprika 1 cup olive oil 1 whole egg 2 tablespoons water, or more as needed 4 to 5 drops lemon juice 2 to 3 garlic cloves Salt Instructions: Fill a deep pot halfway with the oil and heat to 350 degrees F.

Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl to make the marinade. Pour the marinade over the ribs and push the sauce into the cuts so it gets all the way down to the bone. Turn the ribs over face down in the marinade and cover for a minimum of 2 hours or refrigerate overnight for a stronger flavor. Remove ribs from the marinade and barbecue over a charcoal grill. Serve ribs with Cucumber Kimchi, steamed rice, and green Korean peppers. Enjoy! Make 3 deep slashes of equal size along the length of the cucumbers. Make sure not to cut all the way to the end of the cucumber to keep the cucumbers whole. Dissolve the 2 tablespoons of salt in the water. Soak the cucumbers for 2 hours to soften so they won&#39;t crack when they get stuffed. For the stuffing, combine the remaining ingredients except for the chicken stock and mix well.

The stuffing must taste delicious by itself. This stuffing should be made at time of final preparation or the bread stuffing will have a heavier consistency than desired. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Keep fumet hot in a pot on the stove. Check the entire fish for scales or bones. This is done by running your fingers over all surfaces of the fish. Remove any bones with a pair of needle-nosed pliers. Place fish on a lightly oiled sheet of aluminum foil in large pan. Salt with kosher salt inside and out. Since there are crevices within the fish, use your hands to place the salt throughout. Pepper the inside and outside of the fish. Lightly place a coat of olive oil on outside of fish. Stuff fish with bread mixture. If the mixture does not adequately remain in the fish cavity, gently tie the fish around with butchers twine every few inches. Place fish in oven and pour 3 cups of the hot fumet over fish. Cover and cook for about 80 to 90 minutes, basting with hot fumet every 15 minutes. To check for doneness use a fork in the thickest part of the flesh and determine that the meat is opaque, signifying doneness. The fish will have an internal temperature of 130 degrees when it is done. Remove fish from the pan with foil. Gently peel back foil and place fish on a platter. Slice and serve. Simmer first 9 ingredients for 25 to 30 minutes. Add fish parts. Simmer for 1 hour, covered. Salt and pepper, to taste. Strain through chinois. Strain again, using cheesecloth.

Examine steaks for pin bones by rubbing fingers over surface of meat. If found, remove with bone tweezers or pliers reserved for culinary uses. Using a sharp paring or boning knife, trim bones from the cavity side of the steak. Trim the stomach flaps so that 1 side is missing about 2 inches of skin and the other, 1 inch of meat. Roll the skinless section up into the hollow of the cavity, then wrap the other around the outside to form a round resembling a filet mignon. Tie in place with 2 passes of butcher&#39;s twine. (Do not tie it too tight or fish will pop out during cooking.) Combine cumin, coriander, fennel and peppercorns on a double thick piece of aluminum foil and toast over grill, shaking gently until seeds become fragrant. Crush seeds in mortar and pestle or pour into spare pepper grinder. Coat steaks lightly with oil, season with salt, then liberally grind toasted seeds on both sides of steaks.

Add the broccoli and saute until tender. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat and add the garlic, onion, and bay leaf. In another small saucepot, heat the milk. Saute the onion until it becomes translucent, then deglaze pan with the white wine, and cook for a few minutes to let most of the wine evaporate, then turn the heat to medium-low. Whisk the Parmesan into the hot milk, then gradually whisk into the onion mixture. In a small bowl, create a slurry by whisking a small amount of water into the cornstarch. Add this to the sauce to thicken it. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove saucepan from heat, season sauce, to taste, with white pepper, and salt if needed. Remove and discard bay leaf. Immediately put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming, and keep in a warm place. Season the salmon with salt and pepper and slice lengthwise into 3/4-inch wide strips. Roll the strips into a spiral, secure with a skewer, and place on a baking sheet. Set aside briefly. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a food processor blend shrimp, egg whites, salt and pepper to a paste. Spread some of this mixture evenly onto each of the salmon spirals, then spray with spray butter. Place in the oven, and bake until the fish flakes and the shrimp crusts a golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest. While the salmon/shrimp spirals are in the oven, prepare the plates. Toss the onion, broccoli mixture with enough of the sauce to coat. Spoon some of this mixture into the center of each serving plate. Top with a salmon/shrimp spiral, then drizzle with sauce and garnish with dill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</li></ol><p>&quot; 50448,&quot;Kofta Kebabs with Tzatziki 4 cloves garlic 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus a pinch 1 pound ground beef chuck or lamb 3 tablespoons grated onion 3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger Freshly ground black pepper Olive oil, for brushing the grill Tzatziki, recipe follows Grilled flat bread 2 cups plain whole milk yogurt or 1 cup Middle Eastern-style plain yogurt 1 medium cucumber, peeled, halved, and seeded 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus a pinch 1/2 clove garlic 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon dried mint, crumbled Instructions: Smash the garlic cloves, sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt, and, with the flat side of a large knife, mash and smear mixture to a coarse paste.

Pour the olive oil onto the flat top. Add the pork belly and sizzle on each side until the edges are crisp and golden but the middle is still soft, about 2 minutes. (You can prepare the pork belly while the sandwich is melting on the flattop.) For the islander grilled cheese: Place 2 ounces of Cheddar on each slice of bread, add the basil and close the sandwich. Ladle some clarified butter on the flattop and add the sandwich. Grill the sandwich until the bread is crisp and golden and the cheese is melted. Transfer the sandwich to a cutting board. Use a spatula to open the sandwich and add the pork belly. Add the Pineapple Sriracha Jam, then add the cucumber sticks. Close the sandwich and cut. Voila! Add the olive oil to a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden. Add the ginger, sriracha, pineapples and lemongrass. Cook until the pineapple begins to break down and soften slightly, about 20 minutes. Remove the lemongrass. Use a stick blender to puree the mixture or puree the mixture in a blender in batches. Mix the sugar and gelatin in a bowl, then add it slowly to the sauce. Bring to a hard boil and boil, skimming the foam off the top, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce. Let cool, then stir in the cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 50452,&quot;Easy Peasy Ginger Beer 5 ounces (140 grams) fresh ginger 4 tablespoons muscovado sugar 2 to 3 lemons 1 3/4 pints (1 liter) soda water or sparkling mineral water Sprigs of fresh mint Instructions: Grate the ginger on a coarse grater; you can leave the skin on if you like. Put the ginger with its pulpy juice in to a bowl and sprinkle in your muscovado sugar. Remove the rind from 2 of your lemons with a vegetable peeler, add to the bowl, and slightly bash and squash with something heavy like a rolling pin or a pestle. Just do this for 10 seconds, to mix up the flavours. Squeeze the juice from all 3 lemons and add most of it to the bowl. Pour in the fizzy water. Allow to sit for 10 minutes and then taste. You may feel that the lemons are slightly too sour, therefore add a little more sugar; if it&#39;s slightly too sweet, add a little more lemon juice. Pass the ginger beer through a coarse sieve in to a large jug and add lots of ice and some sprigs of mint. &quot;,&quot;[Gamay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 50453,&quot;Fish Bowl Ice 3 ounces coconut rum 3 ounces blue curacao 3 ounces vodka Big splash pineapple juice 1/2 cup sweet and sour mix Big splash lemon-lime soda Lemon and lime slices, for garnish Instructions: Add all ingredients in a large bowl or pitcher.

Brush the tomato halves with grapeseed oil and place on the grill. Grill for just 1 minute to get a char and soften the tomatoes. Chop the tomatoes and add to a bowl. Stir in the shallot, thyme, parsley, and garlic. Drizzle in just enough olive oil to moisten the mixture. Season with salt. For the burger: In a bowl, blend the onions and beef and season with salt. Do not over-mix, this will cause the burgers to be too tightly bound. Next, portion into 2 balls, create a pocket in the center of each ball, and fill each ball with half the cheese. Season the outside of the balls and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. For the vegetables: In a bowl, mix the oil, vinegar, herbs, and garlic and add the vegetables. Allow the vegetables to marinate for 10 minutes. Grill over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes each side. Increase the heat to medium-high. After resting the burgers, pat each burger flat into a 1 by 6-inch patty. Grill over medium-high heat about 6 minutes on each side. The cheese should be still intact but not beginning to leak out. Grill the brioche buns for just 1 minute. Stir the lemon juice into the mayonnaise. Spread the lemon mayo on the bottom half of the buns, top with the burgers, some chutney, shredded romaine, and then the top of the buns. (Spoon the chutney onto the burger, leaving the liquid in the bowl.)

Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Wrap the outside of the pan with a double thickness of foil. Put a kettle of water on to boil for the water bath. To make crust: Pulse vanilla wafers in a food processor into fine crumbs. Add oil and pulse to blend. Press crumb mixture evenly into bottom of prepared pan. (Rinse and dry the workbowl.) To make filling: Process cottage cheese in food processor until very smooth and silky, stopping to scrape down the sides once or twice. Add cream cheese and process until smooth. Add 1 cup sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, vanilla and salt; process until well blended. Add eggs and pulse several times just until mixed in. Sprinkle in lemon verbena (or lemon balm); mix with a rubber spatula. (Do not process.) Scrape the filling into the crust-lined pan. Place the cheesecake in a shallow roasting pan and pour in enough boiling water to come 1 inch up the outside of the springform pan. Bake until the edges are set but the center quivers slightly, 50 to 55 minutes. Turn off the oven. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven, with the door ajar, for 1 hour. Remove foil from pan. Cover cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours. To make topping: About 1/2 hour before serving, rinse strawberries. Set aside 3 whole berries for garnish; hull remaining berries and slice into a bowl. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sugar and toss to coat. Let stand until strawberries are juicy, 20 to 30 minutes. To serve, place cheesecake on a serving platter and run a knife around the inside edge of the pan; remove pan rim. Make 3 lengthwise cuts in each whole berry; press lightly and arrange fanned berries in the center of the cheesecake. Garnish with a sprig of lemon verbena (or lemon balm). Cut cheesecake into slices and place on dessert plates. Top each serving with strawberries and juice and garnish with another lemon verbena (or lemon balm) sprig. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 50476,&quot;Banana Mango Smoothies 1 cup Farmer&#39;s Pick Mango 100% Juice ? ripe mango ? ripe banana 1 cup fat free plain yogurt 1 cup ice cubes Instructions: In a blender, combine all the ingredients and puree until smooth.

Set aside. Trim all the hard fat from the brisket. Trim all the soft fat to 1/4 inch. Prepare a smoker or a grill, following the manufacturer&#39;s directions. Stabilize the temperature at 220 degrees F. Use a mild wood such as hickory or cherry for the smoke flavor. Generously cover all sides of the brisket with the rub and gently massage it in. Reserve the leftover rub. Smoke the meat until an instant-read thermometer registers 170 to 185 degrees F when inserted into the flat part of the brisket, about 1 hour per pound. For example, a 10-pound brisket may need to smoke for about 10 or more hours. Monitor the internal temperature. Separate the point of the meat from the flat. At this time you can slice the flat part off the brisket and eat. Trim the visible fat from the brisket point and coat it with the reserved rub. Return the meat to the smoker and continue cooking until the internal temperature of the brisket point reaches 200 degrees F.

Remove from the heat and set aside. Serve warm or at room temperature. For the pie filling: In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the potato, onion, pepper, celery, and garlic and cook until softened, about 6 minutes. Add the cumin, salt, and pepper. Mix well to ensure that all the vegetables are seasoned. Once the potatoes start to brown, add the vegetable broth, bring to a boil then reduce heat to simmer. Once the liquid begins to reduce add the shrimp and cover skillet. Remove the cover once all the liquid has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature.<br> For the dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, curry powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Slowly add the water until the dough is well formed and soft but not sticky (you may not use all the water). Knead for 2 minutes on a lightly floured surface and then place in a large bowl to rest for at least 15 minutes. Cover the bowl with a moist cloth or flip the bowl over on a clean prep surface and let sit until ready to use.<br> Heat the oil in a pot to 360 degrees F. Divide the dough into 8 balls. Flatten into 4-inch circles and place a heaping spoonful of mixture in the center, taking care not to overfill. Wet one edge with water, fold over and seal by pinching the edges with fingers or floured fork. Gently add each pie into the hot oil and fry on both sides until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on brown paper or paper towels.<br> Serve the pies with the apple-mango chutney. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 50519,&quot;Lobster Pot Pie 2 pounds lobster tail meat 1 large Spanish onion, diced 2 carrots, sliced into thin coins 2 teaspoons fresh tarragon 1 cup frozen peas 4 red potatoes, diced 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups milk 2 bay leaves 1 teaspoon white pepper 1 tablespoon lobster base 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 16 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into bits 6 tablespoons ice water 1 egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fill a large saucepan with lightly salted water and bring it to a boil. Add the lobster meat, reduce the heat to low, and cook 10 minutes until the meat is opaque. Drain and set aside to cool. Place 4 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan and place it over medium heat. Allow the butter to melt and add the onion, carrots, and tarragon. Stir to coat, lower the heat, and let cook for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the peas in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Meanwhile, place the diced potatoes in a small saucepan and cover with water. Add a little salt and place over high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and let simmer until the potatoes are fork tender (about 15 minutes). Drain the potatoes and add them to the vegetable mix. Chop the lobster meat and add to the veggie mix as well. Set aside. For the bechamel: Place the milk in a medium saucepan along with the bay leaves and white pepper and scald (which means heat it but don&#39;t let it boil!) Add the lobster base and whisk to incorporate. Melt the butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan. Whisk the flour in and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and whisk until the mixture thickens. Slowly add the milk, whisking constantly, until the bechamel is thick and creamy. Remove bay leaves. Add the bechamel to the lobster mixture and stir well. For the crust: Place the flour in the bowl of a food processor along with the salt. Add the butter bits and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour into a bowl and add the ice water a little at a time, stirring well with a fork. Transfer the dough to a well floured surface and knead just until it all comes together (don&#39;t work the dough too much or it&#39;ll get tough). Divide the dough in half and flatten each ball into a disk. Wrap each disk in film and refrigerate for 1/2 hour. Remove from the refrigerator and roll each disk out on a lightly floured surface until it is about 12 inches in diameter. Line a 9-inch pie plate with the first disk, ladle the lobster mix into the crust and brush the edges of the dough with the egg wash. Top with the second disk. Trim the excess dough and crimp decoratively. Cut vent holes in the dough and brush the top with the egg wash. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes until the crust is a golden brown. Remove from heat and let cool for 20 minutes before cutting and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 50520,&quot;King Ranch Chicken 2 tablespoon butter 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 1/4 teaspoon ground hot red pepper 1/8 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoons flour 3/4 cup chicken broth 1/2 cup milk 2 tablespoons sour cream 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1 tablespoon butter 1 small yellow onion, peeled and chopped 1/2 medium green bell peeper, cored, seeded, and chopped 1/4 cup chopped roasted green chilies 6 ounces mushrooms, wiped clean and finely chopped 1/2 cup canned crushed tomatoes 2 tablespoons minced pimiento Vegetable oil for frying 8 corn tortillas 3 cups diced cooked chicken 11/2 cups coarsely shredded mild cheddar cheese 1/4 cup sliced pimiento-stuffed olives 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Prepare a grill for indirect cooking for the salmon and direct cooking for the tomatoes. Preheat a grill basket. Sprinkle both sides of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper, then place them on the soaked planks skin-side down. Sprinkle the top of each with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Grill the salmon on the planks over indirect heat until just cooked through and the internal temperature registers 135 degrees F with an instant-read thermometer, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the cherry tomatoes with the olive oil and some salt. When the salmon fillets are ready, leave them on the planks and transfer the whole thing to a serving platter; loosely tent with foil. Add the cherry tomatoes to the grill basket and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are just blistered and some are starting to burst, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully remove the tomatoes to a mixing bowl and toss with the parsley, lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Spoon the tomato mixture over the salmon and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 50522,&quot;Margherita Pizza with a Fried Egg 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (one 1/4-ounce envelope) 2 cups warm water (105 to 115 degrees F)<br> 5 to 5 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 2 teaspoons fine sea salt<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for the bowl<br> 2 tablespoons canola-olive oil blend 1 large Spanish onion, finely chopped<br> 4 cloves garlic, chopped to a paste<br> Pinch Calabrian cl flakes<br> Two 28-ounce cans plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Cornmeal, for the peel Extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced and torn into pieces<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 4 to 6 large eggs<br> 1 bunch fresh basil<br> Instructions: For the dough: Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl; let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cups of the flour and the salt until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups flour; continue adding flour (up to 1/2 cup), 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until the dough comes away from bowl but is still sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead it with lightly floured hands: Start by slapping the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away with the other. Fold the dough back over itself (use a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape dough from work surface). Repeat until the dough is easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish by kneading normally until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with plastic and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, 3 hours. Press the dough with a finger to see if it&#39;s done; an indent should remain. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 4 to 6 balls. Place the balls on a lightly oiled baking sheet, cover gently with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature until puffed and relaxed, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the onions; cook until very soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cl flakes; cook 1 minute longer. Add the tomatoes and their juices, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a strong simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften and the mixture thickens, about 30 minutes. Mash the tomatoes with a potato masher and continue cooking until thickened, about 15 minutes longer. Stir in the oregano and season with salt and pepper. Cool before using on the pizza. (Makes 1 quart; freeze leftover sauce in a container with a tight-fitting lid for up to 1 month.) For the pizza: Preheat a pizza oven to 625 degrees F, or a conventional oven as hot as it will go with a baking stone on or near the bottom of the oven. Sprinkle a pizza peel with some cornmeal. Roll and stretch one of the dough balls into a thin oblong on a lightly floured surface and lay it on the peel. Spread the dough with about 1/2 cup tomato sauce, leaving a 1-inch border. Sprinkle the border with olive oil and season the whole pie with salt and pepper. Scatter 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan over the pizza and top with a few pieces of mozzarella -- it shouldn&#39;t cover the top. Slide the pizza into the pizza oven (or onto the baking stone) and cook until the crust is golden on the edges, blistered and crisp on the bottom, and the cheese is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes, depending on oven temperature. When the pizza still has a few minutes to go, heat some olive oil in a small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Slip in an egg and cook until about three-quarters done -- the white should be set enough to remove the egg from the pan but not completely firm. Season with salt and pepper. Use the peel to remove the pizza from the oven; slide the egg into the center of the pizza. Return the pizza to the oven and cook until the white is set and the yolk is still runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board, top with torn basil, slice and serve. Repeat for the remaining pizzas. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 50523,&quot;Stir-Fry in a Bun 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon minced ginger 1 pound top sirloin, slightly frozen, then cut into 1/4-inch slices, cut against the grain 2 carrots, peeled and cut on the bias into 1/4-inch pieces, approximately 1 cup 3 celery stalks, cut on the bias into 1/4-inch pieces, approximately 1 cup 1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch strips, approximately 1 cup 1 red onion, cut into 1/4-inch pieces, approximately 1 cup 1/4 cup sake 3 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce Cornstarch slurry (mix 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch with 1/2 teaspoon water) 1 cup bean sprouts 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil 1 package Hawaiian sweet dinner rolls (12 to 16 rolls) 1/2 bunch green onions, julienned for garnish Instructions: In a large saute pan, or wok, add oil over high heat.

Beat the butter and granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to medium high, add the vanilla and egg and beat until incorporated. Reduce the speed to low, add the flour mixture in 2 batches and beat until just combined. Shape the dough into a disk. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Generously dust a work surface with confectioners&#39; sugar. Roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/2 inch, dusting with more confectioners&#39; sugar as needed. (Return the dough to the refrigerator if it gets too soft.) Cut out shapes with a 2-inch round cookie cutter and arrange 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Reroll the scraps and cut out more cookies. Refrigerate the cookies until firm, about 1 hour. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the cookies, rotating the pans halfway through, until lightly browned around the edges, 9 to 11 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets. For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 7 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft glossy peaks form, adding up to 8 tablespoons water if necessary to make a smooth icing that thickly coats the back of a spoon.

Stir and serve! &quot;,&quot;[Rum, Ginger Ale]&quot; 50565,&quot;Red Wine Beef Stew with Potatoes and Green Beans 2 pounds beef chuck for stew, cut into 1-inch cubes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons butter 4 medium carrots, peeled, halved and cut into 1-inch chunks 3 small onions, diced 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans reduced-sodium beef or chicken broth 2 cups dry red wine 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes 3 sprigs fresh rosemary 2 medium russet or Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks 2 handfuls green beans, ends trimmed Instructions: Season the beef cubes lightly with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy 6-quart pot over medium heat. As soon as the butter starts to turn brown, add half the beef and raise the heat to high. At first, the beef will give off some liquid, but once that evaporates, the beef will start to brown. Cook, turning the beef cubes on all sides until the pieces are as evenly browned as possible, about 5 or 6 minutes after the water has boiled off. If the pan starts to get too brown at any point, just turn down the heat a little. Scoop the beef into a bowl and brown the rest of the beef the same way using the remaining butter. Scoop out the second batch of beef, then add the carrots and onions and raise the heat to medium-high. Cook until the onion starts to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour until it has been worked into the veggies and you can\u2019t see it any more. Pour in the chicken broth, wine, and crushed tomatoes, and toss in the rosemary. Slide the beef back into the pot and bring the liquid to a boil. Turn down the heat so the liquid is just breaking a gentle simmer. Partially cover the pot and cook 50 minutes. Stir the stew several times while simmering so it cooks evenly and nothing sticks to the bottom. Stir the potatoes into the stew, cover the pot completely, and cook until the potatoes and beef are tender, stirring occasionally, about another 45 minutes. Add the beans and cook for another 5 minutes until the green beans turn bright green and are cooked through but still have a nice snap to them. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 50566,&quot;Proscuitto and Ricotta Calzone 1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 2/3 cup warm tap water (110 degrees) 2 1/2 teaspoons (1 envelope) active dry yeast 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup whole milk or part-skim ricotta Freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or basil 1 tablespoon finely grated Parmesan 3/4 cup coarsely grated mozzarella 2 ounces thinly sliced and shredded prosciutto, or skinned and diced dried sausage, or a combination 1 (12-inch) round pizza pan, cookie sheet, or jelly-roll pan, oiled Instructions: For dough: Stir together flour and salt in 2 quart mixing bowl. Make a well in center. In separate bowl, whisk together water and yeast, then 1 tablespoon of the oil. Stir the liquid mixture into the well in the flour and stir with a rubber spatula to form a soft, sticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead gently. If it is very sticky, scrape it off the surface with a spatula or plastic scraper. Do not add more flour or it will produce a tough dough. Knead for about 5 minutes, until dough is smooth and only slightly sticky. Rinse and dry the mixing bowl and spread remaining tablespoon of oil all around the inside. Form dough into a ball and place back in greased bowl, turning so that the top surface of the dough gets oiled. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. For filling: Place ricotta in mixing bowl and stir in other ingredients, in the order listed. Taste mixture, and if it seems excessively bland, stir in a few pinches of salt, but not too much. Remember, the sausage or prosciutto is salty. Set a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. To shape calzone, generously flour work surface and scrape the risen dough from the bowl, in one piece, onto the work surface. Fold dough over on itself from the outside edge in, all around, shaping it into an even ball. Cover dough with a towel and let rest on work surface for 5 minutes. Flour dough and press it with the palms of your hands to form an even disk. With a rolling pin, roll out dough until it is about 12 inches in diameter and about 1/8-inch thick. Add pinches of flour to the work surface and to the dough as necessary to keep it from sticking to the surface or to the rolling pin. If the dough resists being rolled, cover it with a piece of plastic wrap and allow it to rest for 5 minutes before continuing. Fold the disk loosely in half and transfer it to the pan. Unfold dough and spread the filling over half of it, leaving about 1-inch of uncovered dough around the edges. Brush dough border with water, fold the unfilled dough back over filling, and crimp edges together in overlapping folds to seal. Slash top of the calzone in several places to allow steam to escape during baking. Bake for about 30 minutes, until the dough is baked through and has turned a deep golden color. Serve hot from oven or at room temperature. Wrap any leftover calzone in plastic or foil and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature or rewarm in a 375 degree F. oven for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 50567,&quot;Pork Chops with Apples and Onions 4 bone-in pork loin chops, 1- inch thick Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 2 onions, thinly sliced 1 pinch crushed red pepper 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and sliced Pinch cinnamon 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves finely chopped 2 cups apple cider Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Season the pork chops generously with salt. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring it to a high heat. Sear the pork on both sides and on the fat edge, working in batches if the chops don&#39;t all fit in the pan at the same time. Be sure not to crowd the pan. Remove the pork from the pan and place on a cookie sheet. Finish the pork in the oven for about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving. Ditch the excess fat from the saute pan. Give a drizzle of fresh olive oil and add the onions and crushed red pepper and season with salt. Cook until the onions become soft and aromatic. Add the apples, cinnamon and rosemary and toss to coat with the oil. Add the cider and cook until the cider has reduced by two-thirds and the onion-apple mixture is very soft and saucy.

Heat the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl in the microwave at 75 percent power until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir the chocolate and microwave again until melted, up to 2 minutes more. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water, and stir occasionally until melted and smooth.) Position the oven rack 3 inches below the heating element of the broiler and preheat the oven to broil. Place the marshmallows on a rimmed baking sheet so they are not overlapping, and broil until the tops just begin to toast, about 10 seconds, turning the pan for even browning. (Alternatively, you can use a kitchen torch to char the marshmallows.) Allow to cool at room temperature for 10 minutes. Fold half the marshmallows and graham crackers into the chocolate, and stir to coat. (Some of the marshmallows may melt, but that&#39;s OK.) Pour the chocolate onto the prepared baking sheet, and spread evenly with an offset spatula into an 8 1/2-by-11 inch rectangle. Poke the rest of the marshmallows and the graham cracker pieces into the chocolate in a random yet attractive pattern. (This part may be messy, but stretching the marshmallows into the bark will look cool.) Lightly press down the toppings. Allow the bark to set in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Let the pasta stand about 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 50588,&quot;Spinach Artichoke Baked Brie One 10-ounce box frozen leaf spinach, thawed, drained 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons sour cream 1 small clove garlic, grated 1/4 cup canned artichoke hearts (about 2), drained well and coarsely chopped 1/4 cup shredded whole-milk mozzarella 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg, lightly beaten One sheet frozen puff pastry (from a 17.3-ounce box), thawed One 16-ounce wheel of brie Crackers and crostini, for serving Instructions: Put the spinach in a clean kitchen towel over a bowl or the sink and twist to squeeze out all the moisture.\u202fCoarsely chop. Put the cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream and garlic in a large bowl; mix vigorously until combined and smooth. (If you prefer, you can use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.) Add the spinach to the cream cheese mixture, breaking it up as you add it. Add the artichokes, mozzarella and Parmesan, mixing to combine. Season with salt and pepper, then refrigerate until ready to use.<br> Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk the egg with a splash of water in a small bowl. Roll out the puff pastry to a 13-by-12-inch wide rectangle. Cut a 1-inch wide strip of dough off the shorter end to create a 12-by-12-inch square, reserving the strip for decorating. Transfer the square to the prepared baking sheet. Place the wheel of brie in the center of the dough. Top with the chilled spinach-artichoke mixture. Fold the puff pastry up and over the brie, brushing the edges with a little egg wash and pinching to seal. Form the reserved strip of dough into a bow. Brush a little egg wash on the center of the pastry and gently press the bow on top to secure. Brush the bow and the entire exterior of the pastry with the egg wash, then return it to the refrigerator to chill, about 30 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Bake until the pastry is golden brown and cooked through, about 40 minutes. Let sit for 15 minutes, then serve warm with crackers and/or crostini. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 50589,&quot;Chocolate Cheesecake Cupcakes with Ganache Frosting 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/teaspoon dry chipotle powder.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/teaspoon%20chopped%20rosemary.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>teaspoon chopped rosemary</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/teaspoon%20freshly%20ground%20black%20pepper.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
