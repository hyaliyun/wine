2/3 cups salted peanuts, coarsely chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 by 13 by 2-inch cake pan. Line it with parchment paper, then grease and flour the pan. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until light yellow, about 2 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the vanilla, eggs, and peanut butter and mix until all ingredients are combined. In a small bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the flour mixture to the peanut butter mixture. Mix just until combined. Spread 2/3 of the dough into the prepared cake pan and spread over the bottom with a knife or offset spatula. Spread the jam evenly over the dough. Drop small globs of the remaining dough evenly over the jam. Don&#39;t worry if all the jam isn&#39;t covered; it will spread in the oven. Sprinkle with chopped peanuts and bake for 45 minutes, until golden brown. Cool and cut into squares. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9312,&quot;Shrimp Scampi Zoodles 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 cup dry white wine Finely grated zest of 1 lemon 1 1/2 pounds medium peeled and deveined shrimp, tails removed Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 6 cups zucchini noodles, from 2 medium zucchinis (about 1 pound)<br> 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> Instructions: Heat the butter and 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter melts, add the garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook, stirring, until fragrant and the garlic is just golden, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and lemon zest and cook, reducing the sauce until the alcohol smell is gone and the sauce is a nice golden color, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the shrimp, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the shrimp start to turn pink on the outside but are still translucent inside, about 3 minutes. Add the zucchini noodles and toss with tongs until they are well coated with the sauce and have wilted slightly, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br> Transfer to a serving bowl, drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, sprinkle with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 9313,&quot;Best Snickerdoodles 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons cream of tartar<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened<br> 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar 2 large eggs<br> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line several baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and 1 1/2 cups of the sugar together until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Then beat in the eggs and scrape the bowl. Turn the mixer to low and slowly add the flour mixture until well combined. Mix the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Use a 1 1/2-tablespoon cookie scoop to measure out the dough balls. Roll each ball in your hands to even out, then roll in the cinnamon sugar to thoroughly coat. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheets, 2 1/2 inches apart. Bake until just golden around the edges, 8 to 9 minutes. Cool for several minutes on the baking sheets before moving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9314,&quot;Green Cauldron Broccoli Soup Olive oil, for pan 1 medium onion, chopped<br> 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> Salt and pepper Salt and pepper<br> 2 cups chicken stock<br> 1 cup half-and-half<br> 4 small heads broccoli, chopped<br> 1 package soft herbed cheese, such as Boursin 1 cup grated Monterey Jack Instructions: Drizzle some olive oil into a heavy-bottomed pot set over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and some salt and pepper and cook until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock and half-and-half and bring to a simmer. Add the broccoli and cook until tender. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth. Stir in the herbed cheese and the Monterey Jack and let melt. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9315,&quot;Biscuits and Gravy 12 ounces hot bulk sausage 12 ounces mild bulk sausage 4 tablespoons flour 1/2 gallon milk Salt Pepper Biscuits, store bought or homemade Instructions: In a large pot, add sausage and cook until browned and cooked through. Drain grease and add flour to sausage. Cook over medium-high heat until the sausage is well-coated with the flour. Add milk and stir until desired thickness and add salt and pepper, to taste. Serve with biscuits. This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant.

Line a standard muffin pan with 12 cupcake liners.<br> In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and granulated sugar. Cream on high speed until the butter is light and fluffy, about 6 minutes. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.<br> Combine the coconut milk, whole eggs, egg whites and vanilla extract. Alternately add the flour mixture and the coconut milk mixture to the creamed butter in three stages, allowing the batter to mix for 30 seconds after adding the dry or wet ingredients. Fold in the desiccated coconut. Fill the cupcake liners three-quarters full with batter and bake until golden brown and baked through, about 25 minutes.<br> For the dark rum syrup: Bring the granulated sugar and 1 ounce water to a gentle simmer. Remove from the heat and stir in the dark rum. Liberally douse the baked cupcakes with syrup immediately upon removing the cupcakes from the oven. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the pineapple filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the brown sugar into the bottom of an 8-inch square baking dish. Drizzle the honey and sprinkle the cinnamon on top of the brown sugar. Peel, core and small dice the pineapple. Evenly distribute the pineapple over the brown sugar. Wrap the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, remove the foil and stir the pineapple and liquefied sugar. Replace the foil and bake the pineapple for another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, remove the foil and stir the pineapple and liquefied sugar. Bake the pineapple, uncovered, for another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. For the tangelo cream cheese icing: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the butter until light and fluffy on medium-high speed. Add the cream cheese and mix on medium-high speed until well combined and lump free. Scrape down the sides of the mixer bowl and add the powdered sugar. Stir on low speed until well combined. Add the vanilla extract and tangelo paste and beat on medium-high speed for 2 minutes. Place in a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. To assemble: Using an apple corer, remove the center core of the baked cupcakes and fill with oven roasted pineapple. Pipe tangelo cream cheese icing generously on top of the cupcakes. Roll the cupcake icing in toasted desiccated coconut, and garnish with a mandarin orange segment and rolled fondant street sign.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 9317,&quot;Combat Steak 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 bone-in rib steaks, about 10 ounces each, 1-inch thick 3 large portobello mushrooms, about 4 ounces each, or 1 pound button mushrooms 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, divided 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup red wine 1/2 cup crumbled blue or feta cheese, optional Instructions: In a small bowl mix the rub ingredients together. Massage the rub into both sides of each steak. Let the steaks stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling. Meanwhile, prepare the mushrooms. Remove the mushroom stems and discard. Wipe the mushroom caps with a damp paper towel. If using portobello mushrooms, use a teaspoon to scrape out the dark gills. Cut each mushroom in half, and then cut each half crosswise into 1/2-inch slices. In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, melt 1/4 cup of the butter. Add the mushrooms and garlic, spreading the mushrooms in a single layer. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until the mushrooms are barely tender, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring 2 or 3 times with a spoon. Add the wine and cook until nearly all the wine has evaporated, about 3 minutes, stirring once. Set aside. With the lid closed, grill the steaks over direct medium-high heat, 450 to 500 degrees F until cooked to desired doneness, 8 to 10 minutes for medium-rare, turning once with tongs or spatula. If flare-up flames occur, move the steaks temporarily over to indirect medium-high heat. Remove steaks from the grill and let rest for 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, reheat the mushrooms over medium heat, adding in the remaining 1/4 cup of butter and heating until the butter has melted. Serve the steaks warm with the mushroom and butter mixture spooned over the top. Add crumbled cheese, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 9318,&quot;Ellen&#39;s Chocolate Biscotti 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 2/3 cup alkalized cocoa powder 2 teaspoons baking powder Pinch of salt 1 1/4 cup sugar 1 1/3 cups chopped, skinned hazelnut or walnuts 4 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees and set rack in the middle level of the oven. Cover 2 large cookie sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment or foil. Mix the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt and sift into a mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar and nuts. Whisk the eggs and vanilla and stir into the flour mixture to form a dough. On a lightly floured surface, press dough together. Divide dough in half and roll into a log the length of the pan (14 to 18 inches) Place each log on the pan and flatten slightly. Bake for about 30 minutes, until well risen and firm. Cool the logs on the pans. After the logs have cooled, detach from paper and slice them about 1/2-inch thick with a sharp serrated knife. Place back on paper lined pans, cut side down, and bake again for about 20 minutes, or until dry and crisp. Cool on pans and store in a tin or plastic container with a tight fitting lid. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 9319,&quot;Apple Pie Cupcakes Apple Filling: 3 medium apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices 1/4 cup granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Large pinch apple pie spice Pinch fine salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus melted butter, for brushing 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour Cupcakes: Cooking spray 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/4 teaspoons apple pie spice 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk Whipped Topping: 3/4 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon sour cream Apple pie spice, for sprinkling Instructions: For the apple filling: Toss together the apples, granulated sugar, lemon juice, apple pie spice and salt in a medium bowl. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring frequently, until the apples are tender but still pliable and the liquid is simmering, about 6 minutes. Add the flour and stir until it dissolves and the liquid thickens. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the filling cool completely. Divide the filling evenly into 12 little packed mounds within the skillet; set aside. For the cupcakes: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners and coat the liners and the top of the tin with cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, apple pie spice and salt in a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, beat the sugar and eggs with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. While continuing to beat, gradually pour in the butter, then add the vanilla. Adjust the mixer to medium-low and add half the flour mixture. Add the milk, then the remaining flour mixture, taking care not to overmix the batter. It will be thin, like pancake batter; transfer it to a liquid measuring cup to make filling the lined muffin cups easier. Divide the batter evenly among the cups of the prepared muffin tin. Top each with a mound of apple filling. Bake for 15 minutes (the cupcakes will spread quite a bit). Remove the tin from the oven, gently brush the tops of the cupcakes with melted butter and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Continue to bake until the tops of the cupcakes, which will bake and puff around the apple filling, spring back when pressed, 6 to 8 minutes more. Let the cupcakes cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. For the whipped topping: Beat the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and sour cream in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture forms soft peaks. Transfer it to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with one corner snipped off. Pipe a dollop of whipped topping onto each cupcake (don&#39;t completely cover the cupcake) and sprinkle with apple pie spice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 9320,&quot;Soft-Shell Crabs with Grenobois 1 lemon 8 live soft-shell crabs Flour, for dredging 6 tablespoons unsalted butter Salt and pepper 4 tablespoons finely chopped tomato confit 1 tablespoon chopped shallots 1 tablespoon capers 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley 1 tablespoon pitted finely chopped black olives Instructions: With a knife, cut away the skin of the lemon, removing every trace of pith and exposing the fruit. Cut between the membranes, releasing the lemon segments. Cut the segments into small dice. You will need 1 tablespoon. To clean the soft-shell crabs, cut off the gills (a cotton-like membrane under each side of the head) by lifting the sides of the upper shell and snipping with scissors. Cut off the turned under tail as well as the head directly behind the eyes. Scrape out the inside through the opening at the head with a knife, and rinse the opening under cold water. Dry the crabs with a paper towels and refrigerate until needed. Dredge each crab in flour, shaking off any excess. In a large pan over medium heat, warm 3 tablespoons of butter. Add the crabs bottom side up and cook for 3 minutes on each side. Season with salt and pepper. Remove, keep warm, and set aside. Add the remaining butter to same pan, and heat until golden brown. Add the tomato confit, capers, lemon, parsley, shallots, and olives and cook until mixture is warmed through. To serve: Place two crabs on center of plate. Add the vegetables on top of crabs and around the plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 9321,&quot;Cheddar Baked Eggs 6 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup flour 1 1/2 cups milk, scalded 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 1 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese 1/2 cup thinly sliced green onion 12 eggs Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large saute pan over low heat, melt butter. Add flour and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, taking care not to brown the flour. Slowly add hot milk, using a wire whisk to stir.

Transfer to a bowl and toss with the granulated sugar and lemon juice. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the flour, cinnamon and salt and stir until the juices thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. (The filling can be made up to 2 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Add the cooled filling and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round. Lay the dough over the filling and press the two crusts together around the edges. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers. Brush the top crust with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Cut a few slits in the top crust to let steam escape. Chill 1 hour. Put a baking sheet on the bottom oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for at least 30 minutes. Put the pie directly on the hot baking sheet and reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F; bake until the pie is golden and the filling is bubbly, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes, rotating the pie as needed. (Cover the edges with foil if they are browning too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and let cool until the filling is set, about 3 hours. Pulse the flour, shortening, sugar, vinegar and salt in a food processor until it looks like fine meal. Add the butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Sprinkle in 1/4 cup ice water and pulse until the dough begins to come together. Pinch the dough with your fingers; if it doesn&#39;t hold together, add up to 4 more tablespoons ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse again. Divide the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pat each into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or preferably overnight, or freeze up to 2 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9323,&quot;Coquito (Coconut Rum Eggnog) 6 eggs 3/4 (750 ml) bottle white rum 2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk 2 (14 ounce) cans evaporated milk 2 (10 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk 2 tablespoons vanilla 1 cup brandy Instructions: In a blender, beat the eggs and the rum at high speed.

Add 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water (about 100 degrees F) and mix with your hands or a spoon until the dough comes together (it will be wet and sticky). Cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap. If you have extra time, refrigerate 12 to 24 hours; this is not necessary but will improve the flavor of the bread. Let the dough rise, covered, at room temperature for about 18 hours; this rise is necessary whether you refrigerate the dough first or not. The surface will be bubbly after rising. Generously dust a work surface with all-purpose flour. Turn the dough out onto the flour, then sprinkle flour on top. Fold the top and bottom of the dough into the center, then fold in the sides to make a free-form square. Use a dough scraper or a spatula to turn the dough over, then tuck the corners under to form a ball. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and generously dust with flour. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet, seam-side down, and sprinkle with more flour. Cover with a cotton kitchen towel (do not use terry cloth) and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. Position a rack in the bottom of the oven and place a 2- or 4-quart cast-iron or enameled Dutch oven (without the lid) on the rack. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F for at least 30 minutes. When the dough has doubled, carefully transfer the hot pot to a heatproof surface. Uncover the dough, lift up the parchment and quickly invert the dough into the pot (shake the pot to center the dough, if necessary). Cover with the lid and bake 30 minutes, then uncover and bake until brown and crusty, 15 to 30 more minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9332,&quot;Baby Back Ribs in the Oven | Baked Baby Back Ribs 2 slabs baby back ribs, about 1 pound each (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 cup light brown sugar 1 tablespoon chipotle cl powder 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup apple cider 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 2 cloves garlic, minced Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, chipotle cl powder, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, seafood seasoning and black pepper. Place each slab of ribs on a piece of aluminum foil large enough to fold over and seal, then place on a baking sheet. Do not seal the ribs in the foil yet (see Cook&#39;s Note). Generously sprinkle the dry rub on both sides of the ribs. Place in the refrigerator, meat-side down and uncovered, for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the apple cider, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, Worcestershire and minced garlic. Pour half the liquid over each slab and tightly seal each in the aluminum foil, crimping the edges to make a packet. Transfer the foil packets and baking sheet to the oven and bake until the meat is tender and starts to pull away from the bones, about 2 hours. Remove the sheet pan from the oven. Carefully open the aluminum packets and pour the braising liquid into a small saucepan. Bring the liquid to a simmer over medium heat until it becomes a thick and syrupy glaze, about 4 minutes. While the braising liquid reduces, line a baking sheet with foil and gently transfer the ribs to it. Position a rack on the top level of the oven and preheat the broiler. Using a pastry brush, generously brush the ribs with about half the glaze. Place the ribs under the broiler for about 1 minute. Brush with the remaining glaze and return to the broiled until charred in spots, about 1 minute more.

Place shallots, garlic and thyme sprigs in a small ovenproof baking dish and drizzle with olive oil. Cover dish with foil and bake until shallots are very tender but not brown, about one hour. Uncover and cool 30 minutes. Place garlic, half of shallots and oil in work bowl of a food processor. Add chopped thyme, mustard, salt and pepper. Process until almost smooth. Transfer paste to a small bowl. Shallot paste can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to four days. Rinse turkey inside and out with cold running water and pat dry. Starting at the neck end, carefully slide your hand between the turkey&#39;s skin and breast to loosen skin. Spread a half cup of shallot paste under skin and over breast meat. Tuck wings underneath the body of the turkey and tie legs together loosely with kitchen twine or dental floss so the turkey will hold its shape. Place turkey on a small wire rack set inside a large roasting pan. Spread a half cup of shallot paste all over the outside of the turkey neck, gizzard and heart and place onion, celery and thyme sprigs in the pan around turkey. Bring a cup of the wine and two cups of the broth to a boil in a medium saucepan. Pour boiling liquid into bottom of roasting pan. Cover breast loosely with foil and place turkey in oven. Roast for one and a half hours. Add a cup of the broth and a cup of wine to the pan and roast turkey another 30 minutes. Remove foil and add a cup broth to pan. Continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh registers 175 degrees F, another one to one and a half hours. During roasting, cover exposed parts of turkey with foil as needed to prevent over-browning and add more broth if pan juices evaporate. Remove turkey from oven and transfer to a platter. Tent turkey loosely with foil and let rest 30 minutes - its internal temperature will rise another 5-10 degrees. Reserving drippings and discard neck, gizzard and heart.

In a bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard, white wine, garlic, salt, black pepper, and thyme leaves. Stir to blend and rub all over the lamb. Cover and place it in the refrigerator to marinate for a few hours or overnight, turning the lamb over from time to time and recoating it with the marinade. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the lamb from the marinade and season on all sides with salt, pepper and olive oil. Reserve the leftover marinade for later use. In a roasting pan fitted with a roasting rack place the lamb, fatty side up, on the rack and place it in the center of the oven. . Having the leg elevated off the bottom of the pan will allow for more even roasting. At 425 degrees F, the roast should start to brown fairly quickly. After 25 to 30 minutes, lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. I usually count between 12 to 14 minutes per pound of meat (including the weight of the bone) for a roast. When the oven heat is lowered, count about 30 to 40 minutes and then check the inner temperature of the thickest part of the roast with an instant-read thermometer. Cook it to about 130 degrees F. The meat, once it \rests\ will be a nice medium rare. Remove the roast and turn it fat side down onto a flat surface to rest. Resting the lamb on the opposite side will help to redistribute the juices. Note: Save the pan drippings. Place the roasting pan on the stove over medium low heat. Add the reserved marinade, dry sherry and 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard. Whisk together and simmer until thick. Transfer the sauce to a gravy boat and serve with lamb. Slice the lamb (against the grain) and serve family style. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 9336,&quot;Six-Foot Nachos Two 14.5-ounce cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained 2 large tomatoes, finely chopped A few dashes of hot sauce Kosher salt 2 Fresno chiles, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 3/4 pound fresh chorizo, casings removed 3 medium orange bell peppers, cut into a 1/4-inch dice Kosher salt 1 pound frozen corn, thawed 1/2 cup crumbled cojita cheese or grated Parmesan 1/4 cup sliced pickled pepperoncini 1/4 cup sliced pickled pepperoncini or banana peppers 1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced 1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped 2 firm-ripe avocados, diced 1/4 head red cabbage, thinly sliced Kosher salt 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced One 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained Two 3.8-ounce cans sliced black olives, drained 8 cups whole milk One 8-ounce package cream cheese 2 pounds shredded Monterey Jack 1 pound white American cheese, cut into small pieces 3 cloves garlic, finely grated 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar Kosher salt Five 13-ounce bags tortillas chips Sour cream and your favorite salsas and hot sauces, for serving Instructions: For the red block: Toss together the kidney beans, tomatoes, hot sauce and a large pinch of salt in a medium bowl or container with a lid and refrigerate.

For the black block: Toss together the beans and olives in a medium or container with a lid and refrigerate. This can be done up to 1 day ahead. For the cheese sauce: Working in batches, put the milk and cream cheese in a blender and puree. Pour into a very large pot and heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture begins to bubble. Add handfuls of both the Monterey Jack and American cheese at a time, stirring well after each addition, until melted and smooth. Once all of the cheese has been added, simmer for a few minutes, then stir in the garlic, vinegar and 1 tablespoon salt. Let the cheese sauce cool and thicken. Keep warm. (The cheese sauce can be made, cooled and refrigerated up to 1 day ahead and then reheated). Makes about 12 cups. Assemble the nachos: If making ahead and refrigerating the prepared ingredients in advance, let each bowl of ingredients sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour or microwave to just take the chill off. The green layer of scallions and cilantro is the exception: Keep refrigerated until using. Tape together two 7-foot lengths of parchment or wax paper to make one double-wide 7-foot sheet. Lay it, tape-side down, down the middle of a long table or countertop. Spread the chips out into a 1-foot-wide and 6-foot-long rectangle. Ladle about 3/4 of the cheese sauce (about 8 cups) all over the chips; reserve the remaining sauce to serve on the side. Starting at the left end of the rectangle, sprinkle the red block ingredients to cover a 12-inch square and top with the sliced Fresno chiles. Next to the red block, sprinkle the orange ingredients to cover another 12 inches. Next to the orange block, follow up with the yellow ingredients and top with the sliced pepperoncini.

Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, coriander, caraway, cumin, cayenne, and salt. Continue to cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat. In a food processor, add the lentils and onion mixture and puree until smooth. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve at once. May be covered and chilled and served cold. Serve with pita toasts or crudite. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 9355,&quot;Vietnamese \Pho\ Rice Noodle Soup with Beef 5 pounds beef marrow or knuckle bones 2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2 pieces 1 (3-inch) piece ginger, cut in half lengthwise and lightly bruised with the flat side of a knife, lightly charred 2 yellow onions, peeled and charred 1/4-cup fish sauce 3 ounces rock sugar, or 3 tablespoons sugar 10 whole star anise, lightly toasted in a dry pan 1 tablespoon sea salt 1 pound dried 1/16 inch wide rice sticks, soaked, cooked and drained 1/3 pound beef sirloin, slightly frozen, then sliced paper-thin across the grain Instructions: In a large stockpot, bring 6 quarts water to a boil. Place the bones and beef chuck in a second pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil and boil vigorously for 5 minutes. Using tongs, carefully transfer the bones and beef to the first pot of boiling water. Discard the water in which the meat cooked (this cleans the bones and meat and reduces the impurities that can cloud the broth). When the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer. Skim the surface often to remove any foam and fat. Add the charred ginger and onions, fish sauce and sugar. Simmer until the beef chuck is tender, about 40 minutes. Remove 1 piece and submerge in cool water for 10 minutes to prevent the meat from darkening and drying out. Drain, then cut into thin slices, and set aside. Let the other piece of beef chuck continue to cook in the simmering broth. When the broth has been simmering for about 1 1/2 hours total, wrap the star anise and cloves in a spice bag or piece of cheesecloth and add to the broth. Let infuse until the broth is fragrant about 30 minutes. Remove and discard both the spice bag and onions. Add the salt and continue to simmer, skimming as necessary, until ready to assemble the dish. The broth needs to cook for at least 2 hours. (The broth will taste salty but will be balanced once the noodles and accompaniments are added.) Leave the remaining chuck and bones to simmer in the pot while you assemble the bowls. To serve, place the cooked noodles in preheated bowls. (If the noodles are not hot, reheat them in a microwave or dip them briefly in boiling water to prevent them cooling down the soup.) Place a few slices of the beef chuck and the raw sirloin on the noodles. Bring the broth to a rolling boil; ladle about 2 to 3 cups into each bowl. The broth will cook the raw beef instantly. Garnish with yellow onions, scallions, and cilantro. Serve immediately, inviting guests to garnish the bowls with bean sprouts, herbs, chiles, lime juice, and black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 9356,&quot;Pineapple Upside Down Cake 1/2 cup dried cherries 1 cup apple juice, boiling 1 pineapple, skinned and core removed 2 cups cake flour 1 tablespoon baking powder Pinch salt 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature 1 cup dark brown sugar, firmly packed 2 vanilla beans, scraped 4 large eggs 3/4 cup whole milk 2 cups heavy cream Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Remove the parchment and weights and continue baking until the crust is light brown all over, 10 to 15 more minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: Break the cinnamon sticks in half and put in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Toast, stirring, about 5 minutes. Add the evaporated milk, ginger, nutmeg and cloves and cook, whisking, until the milk comes to a simmer, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let steep, 15 minutes. Discard the cinnamon sticks and add the pumpkin, sugar and salt; whisk until smooth. Whisk in the eggs until just combined. Pour the filling into the cooled pie crust and bake until set and no longer wet and jiggly in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. (If the crust is getting too dark, cover loosely with foil.) Transfer the pie to a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9374,&quot;Creamy Fish Enchiladas 2 pounds halibut or other firm, sustainable white fish Olive oil cooking spray<br> Seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay, for sprinkling<br> 1 lime One 8-ounce brick cream cheese or Neufchatel, softened<br> 1 cup sour cream<br> 1 teaspoon ground coriander, 1/3 palmful<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/3 palmful<br> 2 small cans diced green chiles, drained<br> 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro or parsley<br> 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill, or 1 teaspoon dried dill<br> Kosher salt and ground black pepper<br> Eight 8-inch flour tortillas, warmed or lightly charred over a flame on the stovetop<br> 1 to 1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br> 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Garnishes: thinly sliced avocado dressed with lime, thinly sliced rings of red onion, chopped fresh parsley or cilantro<br> Instructions: Preheat a broiler.

Proper feel-good food, it&#39;s gorgeous served on its own or with whatever fruit you&#39;ve got knocking around. For me, though, the best way of eating it, especially in the summer, is really cold with hot strawberry jam. As an alternative, you can broil or roast peaches and plums to serve with it. Beautiful! I used to make jam with my mum when I was a kid. For a lovely fresh strawberry taste, I now use less sugar and I don&#39;t cook it for quite as long as my mum used to. Any leftover jam will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks if you store it in a jar rinsed with boiling water, but you&#39;ll probably find it gets eaten way before that! It&#39;s great served as a sauce alongside a tart, drizzled over ice cream or simply spread on a piece of toast or fresh bread. Place the strawberries in a wide, stainless steel pan and sprinkle the sugar over the top. Scrunch the strawberries up with your hands, really pushing them between your fingers to pulp them up - the mixture will start to look like jam at this point. You want all the sugar to dissolve in the strawberry juice before you put the pan on the heat and bring it to the boil. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes on a medium heat, and every 5 minutes or so come back to your jam to skim off the foam. Don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s still a bit liquid - it needs to be so you can swirl it into your rice pudding. Remove the pan from the heat and put aside. There you have it - beautiful, quintessential strawberry jam! Meanwhile, place the milk, rice and vanilla sugar in a deep saucepan. Bring to a medium simmer and put on the lid. Cook for half an hour, stirring occasionally, until the rice pudding is thick, creamy, oozy and moist. If it ends up being a bit too thick, you can thin it down by adding a little more milk. To serve, divide the rice pudding between your bowls. Spoon over a big dollop of your beautiful strawberry jam, then slowly swirl it in so it marbles and ripples through the rice pudding. Sprinkle over the meringue pieces and scatter with a few wild strawberries, if you like. \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Line two 12-cup muffin pans with cupcake liners and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until light in color and fluffy. Add the sugar and continue beating until uniformly incorporated into the butter; stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Restart the mixer on low speed and add the eggs one at a time, waiting until each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Once all the eggs have been added, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl to insure that all the ingredients are incorporated. Add the vanilla bean paste and orange zest and blend uniformly. Add the gluten-free baking mix in three additions, alternating with the milk in two additions, fully incorporating each addition before moving to the next. If needed, stop the mixer after each addition, scrape down the sides of the bowl and resume mixing on low. Fill the cupcake liners two-thirds full with the batter and bake until the top of each cupcake is slightly springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 14 to 16 minutes. Immediately turn the cupcakes out of the pans onto a cooling rack and let cool completely. For the orange mousse filling: In a saucepot, gently heat 1/2 cup of the orange juice concentrate and the sugar, stirring just until the sugar is dissolved. Refrigerate until chilled.<br> In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons water with the remaining 1 tablespoon orange juice concentrate; sprinkle the gelatin over the liquid and let the gelatin bloom and hydrate.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer, whip the cream on high speed to medium-firm peaks. Melt the bloomed gelatin in the microwave just until melted and clear, 15 to 20 seconds; do not overheat as this will kill the gelatin! Stir the gelatin into the chilled orange juice mixture until combined, and then pour the orange juice mixture into the whipped cream. Mix completely and refrigerate until ready to use. For the strawberry passion fruit Italian meringue buttercream: Put the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a heavy saucepan and heat over high heat until the sugar mixture registers 250 degrees F on a candy thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes. While the sugar is cooking, whip the egg whites on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer to the soft-peak stage (the whites will look foamy and white), being careful not to over-whip. (If the whites start to look clumpy, they&#39;ve been over-whipped. If this happens, toss them out and start again. If the whites are beating faster than the sugar is cooking, turn down the mixer speed. You can always turn up the speed if you need to.) Add the cream of tartar and continue whipping. While the egg whites are whipping on medium speed, gently pour the sugar syrup down the side of the mixing bowl. Turn the speed up to high and whip until the mixing bowl no longer feels warm to the touch, about 7 minutes. Turn the mixer speed back to medium, add the butter in small chunks and mix until completely incorporated. Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the strawberry and passion fruit purees. Turn the mixer back to medium-low speed and mix until the purees have been incorporated.<br> Fit an 18-inch piping bag with a round tip and twist and hold the bag right by the tip to prevent the buttercream from leaking out. Fold the top of the piping bag over your hand and spoon the buttercream into the bag. To assemble: Use an apple corer or knife to core out the center of each cupcake. Fill each cupcake with some of the orange mousse filling, and frost the top of each with some of the strawberry passion fruit Italian meringue buttercream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 9405,&quot;Bleu Cheese Crostini With Sancerre Syrup And Peppery Lettuce 1 1/2 cups dry white wine, such as Sancerre or Sauvignon Blanc 1/4 cup orange blossom honey 1/2 lemon, juiced 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 baguette, cut into 1-inch slices 8 ounces bleu cheese 1 bunch peppery lettuce, such as arugula or watercress 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup toasted chopped walnuts Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Put a sheet pan or pizza stone in the oven to get it heated up too. Combine the Sancerre, honey, and lemon juice in a saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Simmer gently, swirling the pot around, until the wine is syrupy and coats the back of a spoon, about 15 to 20 minutes. Butter both sides of each slice of bread. Put a nice hunk of bleu cheese on top of the baguette slices and arrange them on the hot sheet pan or stone. Bake for 5 minutes until the cheese melts and the bread toasted. Put the lettuce in a mixing bowl and toss with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Pile the greens on a serving platter with the bleu cheese crostini around it.

Whisk all until the yolks are thick and pale yellow. While still on the stove, place the Camembert into the yolk mixture and stir until it is melted. Place the yolk mixture into a blender or food processor and blend until mixture is smooth. In a separate bowl whip the heavy cream until it reaches soft peaks. Place the yolk mixture into a bowl and gently fold in the whipped heavy cream. To prepare the figs, place all of the spices into a spice bag or cheesecloth tied with twine. Place the spice bag in a saucepot. Quarter the figs and place them into the pot with the port, honey, and orange juice. Slowly bring the figs to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes until the figs are cooked but still have some shape. Strain the figs and place the liquid back into the pot and reduce it by half. Once reduced, pour the liquid over the figs and let cool. To assemble the trifle, place a small amount of fig jam in the bottom of a martini glass and then a small amount of the Camembert cream. Add a layer of cake, fig jam, and then cream. Continue until you finish with the cream on the top of the glass.

Add the sage leaves and fry for around 30 seconds or until dark green and crisp. Quickly remove them with a slotted spoon to a bowl lined with paper towels - you&#39;ll use these for sprinkling over at the end. In the pan you&#39;ll be left with a beautifully flavored oil, so put it back on the heat and throw in your onion, celery, carrot, garlic, rosemary leaves, cl and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Cook gently for about 10 minutes until the vegetables are sweet and soft. Add the squash and the stock to the pan, bring to the boil and simmer for around 30 minutes. While the soup is cooking, make your croutons. Drizzle a little olive oil over the ciabatta slices, and press some grated Parmesan onto each side. Place in a non-stick pan without any oil and fry until golden on both sides. When the squash is soft and cooked through, whiz the soup with an immersion blender or pour it into a standard blender and pulse until you have a smooth puree* (but you can leave it slightly chunky if you like).

Fill a very large bowl halfway full with ice water. Quarter the Napa cabbage lengthwise and remove the core. Thinly slice the cabbage widthwise and place in the ice water. Repeat this same process for the radicchio. Halve the romaine lettuce lengthwise and then thinly slice. Add to the water. Mix all of the greens well in the ice water and let sit for about 5 minutes. Drain. Place in a clean kitchen towel and dry well. Be careful not to bruise the greens. Refrigerate. Remove the chicken from the oven and cool enough to handle. Remove the skin and slice the chicken. Discard the skin and bones. Roughly chop the sliced chicken and place in a large bowl. The chicken should still be warm. Add some of the vinaigrette and toss well. Add the greens and a little more vinaigrette and toss until everything is well coated. Place a small mound of greens on 4 plates. Top each mound with a spring roll basket and lightly press to stabilize. Fill the baskets with more of the salad. Top with some of the fried springroll strips, a sprig of cilantro, peanuts, and a lime wedge. Place all of the vinaigrette ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Correct the seasonings. Refrigerate until ready to use. Heat a deep fryer to 375 degrees F. Or fill a deep pot halfway full with oil and heat to 375 degrees F. Roll up 2 of the egg roll wrappers and julienne. Set aside. Place 1 of the remaining wrappers in the hot oil for 5 seconds to soften. Then, carefully push the center of the wrapper down with a ladle. Fry just until the oil stops sizzling, about 15 to 30 seconds. The basket should be golden brown. Remove with tongs to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Repeat with the remaining 3 wrappers. Once all of the baskets are made, add the julienne strips and fry just until the oil stops sizzling and the strips are golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 9416,&quot;Red Chard and Rice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 to 4 slices bacon, or 1 (1/8-inch thick) slice of speck, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, grated 1 small bunch red chard, stemmed and chopped Freshly grated nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika or sweet paprika 1 cup white rice 1 3/4 cups chicken stock or water Instructions: Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a saucepot over medium heat. Add the bacon, cook 2 minutes, then add the garlic and stir 1 minute. Add the chard and season with a little nutmeg, salt, pepper, and paprika. When the chard is wilted add the rice and stir 1 minute more. Add the stock or water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pot. Cook 15 to18 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Fluff with a fork and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 9417,&quot;Lebanese Lentils, Rice and Caramelized Onions (Mujadara) 1 cup brown or green lentils (not lentils du Puy), sorted for debris and rinsed 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon cracked black peppercorns 3 medium red onions, thinly sliced Kosher salt 3/4 cup basmati rice 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 (1-inch) cinnamon stick 2 tablespoons pine nuts, optional Squeeze of fresh lemon juice Greek yogurt, for serving, optional Instructions: Throw the lentils into a medium saucepan. Fill with enough cold water to cover the lentils by about an inch. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, then turn down to a simmer and cook until the lentils are tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, as the lentils cook, grab a large skillet. Pop it over medium-high heat and add the oil. Allow the oil to warm for a minute, then drop in the cumin seeds and cracked peppercorns and cook, shaking the pan once in a while until the cumin seeds darken a touch, about 1 minute. Add the onions, sprinkle with a dash of salt and cook until they turn dark caramel brown, stirring often. This will take about 15 minutes. Splash the onions with a little water if they stick to the bottom of the pan. You&#39;ll know they&#39;re done both by their deep chestnut color and by the slight crispiness developing on some of the onions. Using a slotted spoon or spatula, remove about half of the onions to a paper towel-lined plate; these are for garnish later. Sprinkle in the ground cumin, cayenne and then add the cinnamon stick; saute about 1 minute. Add the rice and cook, stirring often (but gently so you don&#39;t break the rice!) until some rice grains start to brown. Quickly, add the cooked lentils, 3 cups of water and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt; bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to low so that the pan is at a simmer, cover and cook 30 minutes. The water should be completely evaporated and rice should be tender. (If there&#39;s still too much water in the bottom, put the lid back on and cook for another 5 minutes.) Turn off the heat, keep the lid on, and allow the rice to steam undisturbed for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, toast the pine nuts, if using, in a small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking often, about 5 minutes. Taste the rice for seasoning. Serve with the reserved caramelized onions, toasted pine nuts, if using, and a little squeeze of lemon juice. I also like to serve this with some dollops of Greek yogurt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 9418,&quot;Greek Yogurt Pancakes 6-ounce can unsweetened pineapple juice 1 cup frozen wild blueberries 1 large peach, pitted, peeled and diced, or 1 cup frozen peach slices, thawed and diced 2 cups 2-percent Greek yogurt 4 large eggs 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda Kosher salt Cooking spray Instructions: Bring the pineapple juice and blueberries to a boil in a small saucepan. Cook until the blueberries soften and pop and the juice is thickened and syrupy, about 15 minutes. Stir in the peaches and cook for 5 more minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Meanwhile, whisk the yogurt, eggs, sugar and zest in a large bowl until combined. Mix together the flour, baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl and fold into the yogurt mixture until combined. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Working in batches, pour the batter about 1/4 cup at a time, evenly spacing the pancakes, onto the skillet or griddle. Cook until the tops are bubbly and look slightly dry, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip carefully and cook until golden and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with more cooking spray and the remaining batter. Serve the pancakes hot with the blueberry-peach sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9419,&quot;Chicken Fried Steak 1 to 2 pound round steak, tenderized Pinch tenderizer Pinch garlic salt Pinch black pepper Baking soda 1 egg 1/2 cup milk 1 cup all-purpose flour Lard, for frying Instructions: Cut steak into serving size pieces.

Roll in flour again and fry in hot lard until golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec]&quot; 9420,&quot;Instant Pot Split Pea Soup 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 5 sprigs thyme 4 ounces ham, diced (about 1/3 cup) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 stalks celery 2 carrots 1 large leek 3 cloves garlic 1 1/2 cups dried green split peas (about 12 ounces) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup pita chips or bagel chips, broken into pieces Instructions: Pour the chicken broth into an Instant Pot or other multi-cooker and set to saut. Add the thyme, ham and butter. While the broth heats, chop the celery, cut the carrots into 1/2-inch-thick rounds, halve the leek lengthwise and thinly slice and chop the garlic; add the vegetables to the pot as you cut them. Rinse the split peas in a colander, discarding any small stones, then add to the pot. Secure the lid, making sure the steam valve is in the sealing position, and set the cooker to high pressure for 15 minutes. When the time is up, carefully turn the steam valve to the venting position to release the pressure. Turn off the cooker. Remove the lid and stir the soup; discard the thyme sprigs. Thin the soup with up to 1 cup water if needed (the soup will continue to thicken as it cools). Season with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and top with the pita chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9421,&quot;Salisbury Steak with Mushroom Sauce 4 boneless steaks (about 4 ounces each) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Flour, for dredging 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 cups beef stock 8 ounces white button mushrooms, quartered 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, caps quartered 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 onion, minced 1 carrot, diced 4 sprigs fresh thyme 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup balsamic vinegar Pea whipped potatoes, recipe follows 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks 1 1/2 pounds English peas, or 2 pounds frozen peas 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 tablespoon minced garlic (about 3 to 4 cloves) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Grated Parmesan, optional Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Use a jaccard steak tenderizing tool, or tenderize the steak yourself with a fork. Lay the meat out in front of you, pushing it flat with your hands or a meat mallet, and pull it gently apart with tines of the fork until the meat is slightly pulled apart and tender. Season with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. In a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, add olive oil and brown steaks, in batches if necessary, on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Set aside, keep warm. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, reduce stock by half. Season mushrooms with salt and pepper, to taste. Saute quartered mushrooms in the same pan as the meat, in the leftover olive oil, until very brown, about 5 minutes. Add butter, minced onion, carrot, thyme, and garlic. Cook until vegetables are caramelized, about 5 minutes, add balsamic vinegar and reduce for 1 to 2 minutes. Add broth, slide meat back into sauce, cover and bake until tender, about 1 hour. Stack steaks with pea whipped potatoes and drizzle with balsamic/mushroom sauce. Put the potatoes in a large saucepan with cold water to cover by 3 inches. Salt the water, cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. While the potatoes are cooking, cook the peas in a separate saucepan of salted water. Simmer until just tender, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a sieve and cool on a baking sheet. When the potatoes are done, drain well, scatter on a baking sheet, and let cool for several minutes. In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the cream until it reaches a boil then simmer for a few minutes. Add the cream to a blender with the cooked peas and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until the butter stops foaming and turns a light brown. Add the garlic and cook quickly until pale gold. Add remaining cream, season, to taste, with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Press the cooled potatoes through a ricer or food mill into the butter and garlic mixture, tossing to coat. Reduce the heat to low. Add the remaining butter by tablespoonfuls, stirring vigorously after each addition. In this way, the butter does not melt into a golden puddle. Instead, it forms an emulsion with the potatoes, creating a very smooth puree. Fold the pea puree into the mashed potatoes and adjust seasoning, as necessary. Instead of salt, the puree can be seasoned with a little grated Parmesan, if desired. Serve hot.

Place over high heat (use 2 burners if necessary) and deglaze pan with wine and broth, scraping any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula. Once these solids are dissolved, pour liquid into a saucepan and add the bay leaf and peppercorns. Reduce for 5 minutes over high heat or until reduced by 1/3. At this point you basically have a jus which could be used to sauce your roast. To create a gravy, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in 2 tablespoons of white roux. Return to a simmer, whisking constantly. Continuing to cook once a simmer has been reached will result in a smoother sauce, but not a thicker one. Since all starch thickened sauces thicken as they cool, it&#39;s a good idea to make your gravy a little on the loose side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]&quot; 9423,&quot;Sauteed Red Snapper with Basil Oil and Sun-Dried Tomatoes 4 five-ounce pieces of red snapper fillet, skin on, but with all pin bones removed 2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 clove garlic, finely-minced 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, soaked in hot water, drained, and julienne 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves 3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 4 teaspoons basil-flavored olive oil Instructions: Season the snapper fillets with salt and pepper. Preheat a saute pan with the olive oil until the oil is hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the snapper to the hot pan, flesh side down, and cook over medium heat 4 to 5 minutes. Turn to cook the skin side an additional 3 to 4 minutes. The fillets will curl inwards briefly, but once they have cooked for a minute, they will begin to relax and lay flat again, allowing you to cook the skin side to a crispy texture. Lift out the snapper with a slotted spatula, leaving the juices and oil in the pan. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and shallots, and saute together for 2 minutes. Add the fresh herbs to the pan. Stir quickly, just to heat the herbs enough to release their aromas. Pour the sun-dried tomato and herb mixture over the snapper. Then drizzle a teaspoon of basil oil over each fillet and around the dish.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 9424,&quot;Honey Horseradish Wings with Dijon Ranch 4 pounds wings, separated into wingettes and drumettes, tips discarded 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons aluminum-free baking powder 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup sour cream, Greek yogurt or more mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 3 tablespoons buttermilk or non-dairy milk substitute<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried dill<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon fresh parsley leaves or diced green onion, for garnish, optional 1/2 cup unsalted butter or vegan butter substitute, to keep things kosher 1/4 cup honey<br> 1/4 cup cream-style horseradish sauce, such as Inglehoffer<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste<br> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste<br> Apple slices, for serving, optional Instructions: For the wing prep: The day before you are going to make the wings, prep them. Dry the wings very well and place in a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine the salt and baking powder. Sprinkle over the wings and toss evenly. Line two baking sheets with aluminum foil and top with racks. Place the wings over the racks, making sure they do not touch. Refrigerate for 12 hours or overnight.<br> For the Dijon ranch: Whisk the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, Dijon mustard and buttermilk together in a medium bowl. Then add the dried dill, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, salt and pepper and whisk again. Cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to use. You can make the Dijon ranch up to 5 days ahead of time. Garnish with the parsley or green onions before serving, if desired.<br> When ready to make the wings, position oven racks in the center and top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.<br> Bring the wings to room temperature. Dry them off again to remove any moisture. This yields the crunchiest wings.<br> Roast the wings on the rack-lined baking sheets, flipping them halfway through and switching the pan rack positions for even roasting, for 1 hour.<br> After an hour, increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F and roast, flipping the wings halfway through and switching the pan rack positions, until golden brown and crispy, 45 to 50 more minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them rest a few minutes to crisp up more.<br> For the wing sauce: When the wings are nearly ready, melt the butter and honey in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and simmer until a thick honey consistency, about 10 minutes. If it gets too thick, you can add a little water. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Add the horseradish, salt and pepper and mix to combine.<br> Toss the wings in the sauce and serve immediately with the Dijon ranch and apple slices, if desired.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9425,&quot;Spiced Blackberry, Quince and Apple Pavlova 1 cup/8 1/4oz/230g superfine sugar Squeeze of lemon juice 4 egg whites, at room temperature 3 quince or 4 pears, peeled, cored, and sliced 2 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced 2 star anise 1 cinnamon stick, snapped in half Couple of twists of black pepper 1/2 bottle of Marsala or good red wine Finely grated zest and juice of 1 orange 4 tbsp soft light brown sugar seeds of 1 vanilla bean, (save a third of the seeds for the cream filling), or 4 drops of vanilla extract 2 large handfuls of blackberries 1 1/5 cup/11fl oz/300ml whipping or heavy cream 1/8 cup/ 3/4 oz/20g confectioners&#39; sugar a few seeds from vanilla bean (saved from above) or 1 drop vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (140 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Put the sugar and lemon juice in a large bowl. Add one egg white and whisk for a minute - the mixture will look hard, but don&#39;t worry. Add another egg white and whisk for a few minutes before adding the remaining whites. Then whisk for 4 to 5 minutes until the meringue is stiff and shiny.<br> Dollop the mixture in a circle on the parchment paper about 8in (20cm) round, making the sides slightly higher than the center. Bake in the bottom of the oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the meringue is firm and crisp on the outside but still soft and \pillowy\ inside. If you can, wedge the oven door open a tiny bit with a damp tea towel; this allows the moisture to escape and dries out your meringue more quickly. You don&#39;t want too much color - it may begin to turn a very, very pale beige, but that is it. Once cooked, turn off the oven and leave the meringue inside until completely cool.<br> Meanwhile, put all the fruit filling ingredients except the blackberries in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. You can throw the vanilla seeds and the bean into the mix. Bring the liquid to just boiling point, then turn down to a poach. (A poach is when there is only one or two bubbles breaking the surface of the liquid.) Cook for about 15 minutes, until the fruit is soft but still has a bit of bite. Add the blackberries and remove the pan from the heat, then let the fruit cool in the liquid.<br> To make the cream filling, put the cream, sugar, and vanilla into a large bowl and whip. The cream is whipped enough when it just starts to hold its shape in the bowl and does not run when the bowl is tipped. It is best to very slightly underwhip, as the cream will thicken when left to stand. Drain the fruit through a sifter or colander, reserving the liquid if you want, to have as a hot toddy.<br> To assemble the pavlova, place the meringue on a serving plate. Dollop the cream mixture all over it, leaving a 1 1/2 (4cm) border all the way around. Pile the drained fruit all over the cream and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 9426,&quot;Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup butter, softened 1/2 cup chocolate hazelnut spread (recommended: Nutella) 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup chopped toasted hazelnuts Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In another medium bowl combine the butter, chocolate hazelnut spread, sugar, and brown sugar. Using an electric mixer, cream the ingredients together, about 4 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Add the hazelnuts and stir until just combined. Using a tablespoon measure, spoon out the cookie dough onto a cookie sheet, spacing the mounds about 4 inches apart. Use the tines of a fork to flatten the cookie dough.

Trim off any skin, leaving an even layer of fat (about 1/2 inch thick). Use a sharp paring knife to score through the fat in a diagonal crosshatch pattern without cutting through to the meat. Place the ham, flat-side down, on a roasting rack set in a large roasting pan. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Combine the orange juice, 1 cup chicken broth and the melted butter in a measuring cup. Pour over the ham and tent with foil. Bake, basting with the pan juices every 30 minutes, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the ham registers 130 degrees F, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Make the glaze: Remove the ham from the oven, spoon out about 1/4 cup of the pan juices and transfer to a medium bowl. Whisk the pepper jelly, mustard, brown sugar, marmalade, vinegar, thyme, cl powder, coriander, cayenne and orange zest into the bowl. Brush the ham with about one-quarter of the glaze. Add the remaining 1 cup broth to the pan. Return to the oven and bake, brushing the ham with more glaze twice (reserve some for finishing), until the surface is caramelized and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 140 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 more hours. Transfer the ham to a cutting board. Brush with the reserved glaze; let rest 15 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9428,&quot;Spinach-Bacon Salad with Chicken 4 slices bacon 2 shallots, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 avocado 1 cup buttermilk 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon Kosher salt 2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 10 ounces each) Freshly ground pepper 10 ounces baby spinach (about 7 cups) 1 1/2 cups seedless red grapes, halved 1/4 cup salted roasted pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds) Instructions: Position a rack in the upper third of the oven; preheat to 425 degrees F. Cook the bacon in a medium ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, turning, until crisp, 8 minutes. Remove to a paper towel lined-plate with a slotted spoon, reserving 1 tablespoon drippings in the skillet. Let cool slightly, then chop. Meanwhile, soak the shallots in the vinegar in a small bowl. Puree the avocado, buttermilk, tarragon and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender; set aside. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat the reserved bacon drippings in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.

Season the lamb on all sides with salt and pepper, to taste. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet with a heatproof handle over medium-high heat. Put the rack into the pan, fat side down, and sear it until it is browned, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the rack over and sear the other side for 2 minutes. Put the pan into the oven, and roast the lamb until it is medium-rare, or until the internal temperature reaches 125 to 130 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the lamb from the oven, cover it with foil, and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing into chops. Serve with the Mint Pesto. Combine all of the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor. Process until the mixture is almost smooth. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper, to taste.

Bravissimo! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9459,&quot;Flaky Birthday Berry Pie with Celebratory Jaconde One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 4 cups heavy whipping cream 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup cornstarch Pinch fine sea salt 1/2 cup water Zest and juice of 1 lemon 2 cups blueberries 2 cups raspberries 2 cups hulled and quartered small strawberries 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 2 tablespoons, melted and cooled 1/2 cup egg whites, at room temperature 1 cup cake flour Gel food coloring of your choice 1 1/4 cups almond flour 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 3 large eggs, at room temperature, plus 2 eggs, separated Pinch fine sea salt 1/2 cup granulated sugar Four 10-inch Flaky Pastry Layer rounds, recipe follows 1 pound all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 2-tablespoon pieces, at slightly cooler than room temperature 6 ounces ice-cold water 1 teaspoon lemon juice Instructions: For the sweetened whipped cream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the cream cheese and mix until smooth; transfer to a bowl. In the same mixer bowl, combine the heavy whipping cream and sugar. Switch to the whisk attachment and whip on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the cream cheese back to the bowl and continue whisking on high until the cream forms stiff peaks. For the berry filling: Combine the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a large saucepan and stir to combine. Add the water, lemon juice and lemon zest; stir to combine. Turn the heat to medium-low and add the blueberries and raspberries. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to bubble and thicken, about 5 minutes. Cook an additional minute, then add the strawberries, butter and vanilla. Gently stir until the butter has melted, then transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 2 hours. For the jaconde: Line two half-sheet pans with silicone baking mats. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 1 cup of the confectioners&#39; sugar and the 8 tablespoons butter and mix until smooth. Gradually add the 1/2 cup egg whites and mix to combine. Gradually add the cake flour and mix until a paste is formed. Divide the paste between bowls based on how many colors are desired. Add a drop or two of food coloring to each of the bowls and stir to achieve the desired colors. Transfer the paste to a pastry bag fitted with a small open tip and pipe your chosen pattern on the baking mats. Freeze the patterns until frozen solid. Once frozen solid, leave the decor in the freezer and make the cake batter. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the almond flour and all-purpose flour. Set aside. Place a stand-mixer bowl over a pot of simmering water to build a double boiler. Add the 3 whole eggs and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar and whisk vigorously until the sugar has dissolved. Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer and beat on high speed with the whisk attachment until the bowl is cool to the touch and the mixture ribbons. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and set aside. Wash and dry the bowl and whisk very well. (Note: A bowl or whisk with any reside will not beat egg whites properly.) In the clean mixer bowl, combine the 2 egg whites and salt. Beat with the clean whisk attachment on high speed until frothy. Slowly add the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Continue whisking until the egg whites hold soft peaks; set aside. Sift the almond flour mixture over the whole egg mixture; using a silicone spatula, gently fold to incorporate. Fold in the egg whites, followed by the melted butter. Remove the prepared pans with the frozen decor from the freezer. Immediately divide the cake batter between the two pans and gently spread into an even layer. Bake until the edges are barely brown and the cake is springy, about 5 minutes. Allow to cool, then run a small knife along the edges of the pans to release the cakes. Sift the remaining 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar over the cakes. Place a piece of parchment over each cake, followed by an inverted baking sheet. Flip over so the cakes land decorated-side up on the baking sheets. Gently release the baking sheets and carefully peel away the baking mats from the cakes. If needed, use a paring knife to help with this process. Place one Flaky Pastry Layer on a cardboard cake round. Fill a pastry bag with half the whipped cream; place the rest back in the refrigerator. Cut the tip of the bag to create a 1/2-inch opening. Pipe a band of whipped cream along the perimeter of the pastry disk and spread one-third of the berry filling inside. Place a second pastry layer on top, pipe the whipped cream along the perimeter again, and add another third of the berry filling. Top with a third pastry layer and repeat with the whipped cream and the remaining berry filling. Top with the final pastry layer, then wrap the cake gently in plastic, and freeze for 30 minutes or until the whipped cream feels set. Refrigerate the remaining whipped cream in the piping bag. Remove the layered cake from the freezer and pipe whipped cream to coat the sides with a crumb coat. Refrigerate for 20 minutes to set. Measure the height and circumference of the layered cakes and trim the jaconde to fit around the sides and top. (Note: You will likely need to cover the entire cake in multiple strips.) Gently press the jaconde to the sides and top of the cake. Place the remaining half of the whipped cream in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and pipe rosettes on top of the cake. Add the flour and salt to a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the butter and toss to combine. With your fingers, begin to \smush\ the butter into flat pieces. Continue smushing until all the butter is flattened but none of the pieces are larger than a quarter. The flour will look like coarse cornmeal. Add the water, quickly folding it in with a wooden spoon to distribute the moisture. (Do not stir vigorously--the dough should appear shaggy.) Use your hands to break up any large clumps of moisture. Then use your knuckles or a palm to smear the dough up the sides of the bowl (a technique known as fraisage). This distributes the butter over a larger surface to achieve larger flakes and compact the dough. Once you&#39;ve gone around the bowl one time, fold the dough over itself a few times to pick up any dry bits from the bottom. Gently press the dough into a disk. (Note: The dough should remain very cool to the touch throughout the process. If it approaches room temperature, refrigerate it for 5 to 10 minutes to chill.) Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll out to a 10-by-12-inch rectangle. Perform a letter fold by folding one of the short ends towards the middle and the other short end over the first, like folding a business letter. Turn the dough 90 degrees, so the long side faces you, and perform a second letter fold. Turn the dough 90 degrees again; perform a third letter fold. If the dough still feels cool, it can be used immediately. Otherwise, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper. Divide the dough into four even pieces. Roll each piece into a rough 10-inch round. Place the rounds onto the prepared sheet pan, placing a piece of parchment in between each round to separate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Trim each round to a perfect 10-inch circle; dock each one. Bake the rounds on individual sheet pans, placing a piece of parchment over the rounds and then placing a second sheet pan on the parchment to \tame\ the puff. (Note: Don&#39;t press the pan; just let it rest.) Bake for 15 minutes with the second sheet pan on top. Remove the second sheet pan and the top piece of parchment and bake until uniformly golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. If you are baking in batches, refrigerate the unbaked rounds. Allow the baked rounds to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9460,&quot;Veracruz Red Snapper: Huachinango a la Veracruzana One 3.3-pound/1 1/2-kilogram whole red snapper, cleaned and scaled 3 cloves garlic, chopped 2 limes, juiced 2 tablespoons water Pinch clove Pinch pepper Vegetable oil, for sauteing 1/2 cup chicken stock 1 onion, sliced 2 bay leaves 2 pinches dried oregano 1/2 cup freshly made tomato puree (water, tomatoes, and a dash of olive oil) 4 plum tomatoes 6 pickled chiles 8 green olives pitted and crushed, plus 12 green olives, whole 1 tablespoon capers Salt 3 tablespoons chopped parsley Instructions: Clean the fish without cutting off either the head or the tail. With a sharp knife, score the fleshy part of the snapper. In a bowl, combine the garlic, lime juice, water, clove, and pepper to make the marinade. Pour the marinade over the fish and allow the marinade to penetrate the snapper for 30 minutes. Pour a tablespoon of oil into a hot pan and sear the fish for a few minutes on each side. Add the chicken broth and begin to add the remaining ingredients. First, add the sliced onion, bay leaves, and oregano. Next, pour in the fresh tomato puree, followed by the whole plum tomatoes. Add the pickled chiles, crushed olives, and capers. Season with salt and continue simmering for 15 minutes. Before serving, sprinkle the whole olives and chopped parsley over the snapper and serve on a large dish. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 9461,&quot;Spring Chicken Salad 1/2 pound small red-skinned potatoes, halved Kosher salt 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1/4 cup low-fat plain Greek yogurt Freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 romaine hearts, torn 1 rotisserie chicken, skin removed and meat shredded (about 2 cups) 1 Kirby cucumber, peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded and sliced 4 radishes, cut into wedges 1 yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced Instructions: Place the potatoes in a small pot and cover with water.

Add the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pulse just to combine. Add the butter and pulse until all of the butter is incorporated into the flour and the mixture is sandy. Add the egg and vanilla and pulse until the mixture comes together in big clumps. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead a few times to form a ball. Divide the dough in half, pat into 2 discs about 1/4-inch thick, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Let the dough sit at room temperature for a few minutes to make rolling easier. Put 1 disc of dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper and roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thick. Cut out with desired cookie cutters and arrange on one of the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Bake until the bottom of the cookies are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. Gently gather any scraps into a ball and press into another disc. Chill the disc until firm enough to roll and cut out as many cookies as possible. For the icing: Sift the meringue powder and confectioners&#39; sugar together in a large bowl and add 6 tablespoons water. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-high until the mixture is glossy and soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Add food coloring if using or divide into several batches and color with different shades of food coloring. Decorate cookies as desired. The cookies can be store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 9464,&quot;Goat Cheese Mashed Potatoes with Beef Coffee Gravy 2 pounds white russet potatoes, peeled and quartered 4 ounces goat cheese 4 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup evaporated milk, plus more as needed Salt and white pepper, to taste 1 (15-ounce) can beef broth 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon instant coffee 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 cup water 3 tablespoons butter, cut into large chunks Salt and pepper Instructions: For Potatoes: Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water.

Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the egg and almond extract until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Turn out the dough onto a large sheet of plastic wrap; shape into a disk. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out the dough until 1/4 inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut out cookies with a 1 1/2- to 2-inch fluted round cookie cutter or biscuit cutter. Reroll the scraps once and cut out more cookies. Arrange about 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle generously with coarse sugar. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are firm but not browned, 17 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 9481,&quot;Mesa Fresca 2 ounces tequila (recommended: El Tesoro) 2 ounces freshly squeezed grapefruit juice 1/2-ounce freshly squeezed lime juice Pinch salt Splash lemon-lime soda (recommended: Sprite or 7-Up) Instructions: Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake well. Serve over the rocks in a Collins glass. &quot;,&quot;[Tequila, Grapefruit Juice, Lime Juice]&quot; 9482,&quot;Hibiscus Granita 3 cups hibiscus ice tea Instructions: Pour the iced tea into ice cube trays and freeze overnight.

Pulse the machine until the granita has the texture of crushed ice. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 9483,&quot;Easy Shrimp Potstickers 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 3 scallions, chopped 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 egg 40 round wonton or gyoza wrappers 3 tablespoons peanut oil 1/3 cup ponzu 1 scallion, minced 1 teaspoon chili sauce (recommended: Sriracha) 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger 1/2 teaspoon sugar Instructions: Potstickers: In a food processor, add the shrimp, garlic, scallions, soy sauce and egg. Pulse until combined but still chunky. Remove the mixture to a bowl. To assemble the potstickers, put about 1 teaspoon of filling into the center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten the rim of the wrapper with water. Fold the dough until the ends meet and press the air out of the center towards the edges. Seal by pressing firmly. This is the simplest way. To make the classic pleated look: using your thumb and index finger, pinch the corner of the unsealed wonton closed. Using your other hand pull a bit of the unsealed wonton edge toward the pinched corner and pinch to make a slight pleat in the wrapper, continue to pull the loose wrapper in and pleating until you run out of space, then push the air out through the final opening and pinch together. Repeat for the rest of the wontons. You can freeze them at this point on a baking sheet first, and then transfer to a freezer bag. Dipping sauce: Stir all the ingredients together in a small serving bowl. When ready to cook the potstickers, add oil to a large saute pan. When oil begins to swirl, add potstickers to the pan and cook until golden brown on 1 side. Flip and add 3 ice cubes. Immediately cover the pan to let the potstickers steam and cook through, about 3 minutes. Remove to a large platter and serve with dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9484,&quot;Tuscan Beans With Tuna 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 16 fresh sage leaves (8 chopped, 8 whole) 2 15-ounce cans cannellini beans 3/4 pound kale, stems and ribs discarded, large leaves torn in half Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup grape tomatoes, thinly sliced 3 inner stalks celery, thinly sliced (with some leaves) 1/2 cup chopped pitted kalamata olives 1/3 cup chopped roasted red peppers 1 12-ounce can solid white albacore tuna in water, drained Instructions: Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat.

Meanwhile, toss the tomatoes, celery, olives and roasted peppers in a medium bowl. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat, then fry the sage leaves until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes; drain on paper towels. Reserve the oil. Break the tuna into large chunks and divide among shallow bowls. Spoon the bean mixture around the tuna and top with the olive salad and fried sage.

Slice off a thin piece off the bologna lengthwise so it has a flat bottom and won&#39;t roll around. Score the top in a series of thin slashes in a diamond pattern. Season the bologna liberally with the barbecue rub. Put the bologna in the cooker and cook for at least 3 hours but up to 5 hours. It&#39;s already fully cooked, so the recipe is very flexible, but as it cooks longer it will get smokier and develop a better outside crust. Transfer the bologna to a cutting board. Tent loosely with foil and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice to serve. This rub is a little more complex than Barbecue Rub #67 and has great color as it cooks on the food. I like to put this one in the food processor until it&#39;s finely ground. It makes for a smooth texture but also takes care of breaking up the lumps in the dried brown sugar. You may want to dry the sugar the day before. This preparation is a little more complicated, but don&#39;t be afraid to use on whatever you&#39;re cooking. Combine all the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Process for 15 seconds.

Line bottom of jelly-roll pan with parchment paper. Combine clarified butter and vanilla in small bowl. Keep hot until needed or reheat for a few seconds just before using--this is important! Combine flour with 3 tablespoons of the sugar. Sift together twice; return to sifter and set aside. In a large heatproof mixing bowl, use a whisk to combine eggs and sugar. Place bowl in or over a saucepan containing 1 to 2 inches of barely simmering water. Heat eggs to lukewarm, (check by touching), whisking occasionally. Remove bowl from heat. Beat egg mixture at high speed with an electric mixer until it has cooled, tripled in bulk, and resembles softly whipped cream. Sift about 1/3 of the flour mixture over the whipped eggs. Use your largest rubber spatula to fold the mixture, by hand, quickly but gently until combined. Sift and fold in half the remaining flour mixture; sift and fold in the rest. Scoop about 1 cup of the batter into another bowl and fold it together with the hot clarified butter and vanilla. When completely combined, fold the butter mixture back into the remaining batter. Turn batter into prepared pan, and spread evenly over pan. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until cake shrinks slightly from the edges of the pan and top springs back when pressed with fingers. Run a small knife around the edges of the cake to release it from pan. Invert pan onto a sheet of foil and remove pan. Cool cake without removing parchment pan liner (cake will steam slightly between the parchment and the foil, making it flexible enough to roll without cracking later). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 9508,&quot;Instant Pot Chicken Posole 4 dried guajillo cl peppers, stemmed and seeded 2 dried ancho cl peppers, stemmed and seeded 2 dried cascabel cl peppers, stemmed and seeded 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 small white onion, diced 8 cloves garlic, roughly chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 8 ounces dried white hominy, picked over and rinsed 1 cup fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems), plus more for topping 2 teaspoons dried oregano, plus more for topping 1 bay leaf 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 8) Sliced radishes, crumbled queso fresco, sour cream and/or shredded cabbage, for topping<br> Lime wedges, for serving Instructions: Set an Instant Pot to saute on high. When the pot registers hot, add the dried chiles and cook until just beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add 1 cup water. Turn off the pot and put on the lid.

Makes 2 3/4 tablespoons (see Cook\u2019s Note). For the beef: Fill a large saute pan with 1 inch of water and add a large, five-finger pinch of salt. Add the ground beef and cook over high heat, stirring every 2 minutes, until the liquid released by the ground beef has almost disappeared and you can only see fat, about 15 minutes. Let the beef fry in the fat for about 1 minute, then remove the beef to a large bowl, leaving the fat in the saucepan.<br> Add the onion to the saute pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the 2 tablespoons of Abuela Chabe\u2019s Seasoning and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the cooked beef and season with salt. Stir in the tomato sauce and Worcestershire sauce and cook until the mixture has reduced slightly, about 3 minutes. Taste and season again if necessary. Set aside.<br> For the bechamel: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and whisk until combined. Continue to whisk until the mixture turns the same yellow color as Dijon mustard and starts to smell slightly nutty, about 6 minutes. Whisk in the nutmeg and cook for 1 minute. Gradually add the milk in five additions while whisking constantly, making sure to fully incorporate between each addition; this will ensure a smooth texture. Season with salt and cook until the bechamel coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 8 minutes. (If the sauce seems too thin, remember that it will continue to thicken as it sits.)<br> For the assembly: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook the noodles, stirring occasionally and separating them to prevent sticking, until softened and bendable but still tough in the center, about 5 minutes. Transfer the noodles to a large bowl of cold water and set aside until ready to assemble.<br> Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.<br> Spread 3 tablespoons of the meat sauce and 3 tablespoons of the bechamel on the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.<br> Lay a single layer of noodles over the meat sauce and bechamel (if you&#39;re using long noodles, you will need to cut some noodles to fill the gaps). Spread half of the meat sauce (about 1 1/2 cups) over the noodles. Add another single layer of noodles. Spread 1/2 cup of the bechamel over the noodles. Top with 5 ounces of the ham and 6 ounces of the Gruyere.<br> Repeat by adding another single layer of noodles, the remaining half of the meat sauce, another single layer of noodles, 1/2 cup of the bechamel, the remaining 5 ounces of the ham, 6 ounces of the Gruyere and a final single layer of pasta.<br> Combine the remaining bechamel and the remaining 4 ounces of Gruyere (if using sliced cheese, crumble it up) and spread on top of the pasticho.<br> Cook until bubbling gently around the edges, about 45 minutes. If the top has not browned, broil on high until a couple of brown spots appear, 1 to 2 minutes.

To make the topping, measure the flour, polenta, sugar, salt, baking powder, and anise seeds into a food processor or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Pulse for a few seconds to combine. Add the butter and pulse or mix on medium-low speed until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and make a well in the center. Pour the egg into the well and toss the egg and flour together lightly and thoroughly with your fingers until evenly mixed. The mixture will not adhere in the manner of a dough but will clump together if pressed in your palm. Set aside until needed. To make the filling, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and toss until well mixed. Turn mixture into a 2 quart shallow baking dish. Sprinkle the topping over the filling in an even layer. Do not press down. Place the dish on a baking sheet to catch the drips and place in the oven. Bake until the juices are bubbling up around the topping and the top is crisp and golden brown, about 1 hour.

Place on a cookie sheet and bake for 20 minutes, until well browned. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9525,&quot;Pan Fried Fish 1 large or two small skin-on fish fillets, about 8 ounces (rainbow trout, small salmon, brown trout) Kosher salt Ground black pepper Flour for dredging 2 tablespoon Canola oil 3 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoons capers, drained 1 lemon, juiced Instructions: Heat a heavy pan over medium high heat. Season fish on meat side with salt and pepper. Lightly dredge fish in flour and shake off excess. When pan is good and hot, add Canola oil followed immediately by 1 tablespoon butter. As soon as foaming subsides, place fish in pan with the skin side down. Jiggle pan for the first 10 seconds to keep the fish from sticking. Cook until golden crust forms on meat. Carefully turn fish away from you and again jiggle pan for the first few seconds. Cook until skin turns golden brown. Remove to a warm plate. Pour out the cooking fat, add remaining butter and quickly fry the capers. Remove pan from the heat, add lemon juice to pan and swirl. Pour sauce over the fish and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 9526,&quot;Short Rib Ragu and Polenta 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons olive oil 3/4 cup finely diced carrots<br> 3/4 cup finely diced celery 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 large yellow onion, finely diced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 1/2 pounds bone-in short ribs 1/4 cup pancetta or bacon, diced (about 2 ounces) 1 cup dry white wine 1 1/2 cups whole milk One 28-ounce can diced tomatoes 2 cups whole milk 2 cups chicken broth 1 cup coarse-ground polenta 1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano, plus more for garnish 4 tablespoons unsalted butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil, for garnish Instructions: For the short rib ragu: Place a large saucepan over medium heat and melt the butter in the oil. Add the carrot, celery, garlic and onion with a good pinch of salt and saute for 5 minutes, stirring often. Increase the heat to high, push the vegetables to the outer edges of the pan and add the short ribs and pancetta. Brown the short ribs on one side, about 4 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium and turn them a quarter turn. Continue to cook, turning them as they brown, until thoroughly brown on all sides but not burnt (don&#39;t worry about crispy bits in the pan), about 15 minutes. Pour the white wine into the saucepan. With a wooden spoon, scrape up all the brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Push the meat all around to make sure you scrape it all off. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to let some of the alcohol cook off. Add the milk, diced tomatoes (with liquid), 1 teaspoon salt and a good grinding of pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower to the lowest heat and let simmer very slowly, half-covered and stirring from time to time, until the meat is very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours; the sauce should be more oil- than water-based and thick like oatmeal. Transfer the short ribs to a plate to cool. When cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and shred; discard any excess fat and cartilage. Return the meat to the pan. Season to taste and set aside. For the polenta: Combine the milk, chicken broth and 1 cup water in a pot. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Add the polenta gradually, whisking constantly. When the mixture starts to boil rapidly, reduce the heat to medium low, at a steady but not too vigorous bubble, and switch to a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring often, until thick, about 15 minutes. Stir in the Pecorino Romano and butter. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and plenty of freshly ground pepper. To serve, put the polenta and ragu in two separate presentation-ready pots. At the table, pour the hot polenta onto a large serving platter or board. Next, pour the hot ragu over the center of the polenta. Finish with a dramatic drizzle of olive oil and a cloud of grated pecorino. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 9527,&quot;Fig-Stuffed Cookies: Cuccidati Italian 8 ounces dried figs, chopped 6 tablespoons brandy 1 (8-ounce) jar honey 2 ounces raisins 2 ounces dates 2 ounces dried cherries 2 ounces citron or candied pineapple 1 cup walnut pieces, toasted 1 cup whole, blanched almonds, toasted 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 pinches ground clove Rind of 1 lemon (remove any white pith) Rind of 1 orange (remove any white pith) 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup sugar 3/4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 tablespoons butter, chilled and cut into small pieces 3 eggs (1 whisked with 1 teaspoon water, to make an egg wash) 1/4 cup milk 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 to 2 tablespoons milk Colored sprinkles, or small dots Instructions: Make the Filling: In a bowl, combine the figs with 4 tablespoons of brandy and let soak overnight or up to 4 weeks. In a food processor, combine the soaked figs, the remaining 2 tablespoons brandy, and all the remaining filling ingredients. Process until chopped and well combined. (Alternatively, run all the ingredients through a meat grinder. Some Italian women bring their filling ingredients to the butcher and have him grind it for them.) Keep chilled until ready to use. Make the Pastry: In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt and pulse to mix. Add the butter and pulse until it looks like fine crumbs. In a small bowl, whisk together the 2 eggs and milk. While the motor in running, pour the liquid through the feed tube until just combined and a dough is formed. Form the dough into a disk and chill 30 minutes. On a floured work surface, roll out the dough 1/8-inch thick. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut out large (3-inch long) almond shaped pieces from the dough. Transfer the pieces to a sheet pan; then chill. To form the cookies, have ready the filling, the chilled dough pieces, the egg wash with a pastry brush, and a sharp knife. Paint the edges of the dough pieces with egg wash and place 1 teaspoon of filling shaped into an oval in the center of half the pieces. Top each with a second piece of dough and carefully pinch the edges together to seal. Trim the excess dough from around the edges. Make each dough package look like a bird or fish, by shaping and cutting decorative lines. You can split 1 end to look like a tail, carve rows of lines to look like feathers or fins, cut a curved line for the gills or beak opening, and a hole for the eye. (There are many different shapes they&#39;re made into, such as wreaths, slippers, and crescents.) Re-chill the cookies Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the cookies with the egg wash. Bake the cookies until lightly golden brown, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile make the Icing: In a bowl, whisk together all the ingredients. Toss the cookies with the icing while they&#39;re still hot and sprinkle with the colored sprinkles, or leave them plain. The icing makes the cookies look like porcelain when they&#39;re done. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 9528,&quot;Spicy Juicy Lucy Sliders 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, thinly sliced (about 3 cups) 2 chipotle peppers in adobo, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds ground beef 4 ounces pepper jack cheese, cut into 12 equal pieces 1/4 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 12 slider-size potato buns, split and toasted Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add the onions, spreading them into an even layer. Cook, without stirring, until the edges of the onions are beginning to brown, 5 minutes. Stir the onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and caramelized, another 20 minutes. Add the chipotles, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook until fragrant and well combined, 1 to 2 minutes, and remove from the heat. Preheat the oven broiler. Divide the meat into 12 portions, about 2 ounces each. Form a patty around each piece of cheese and flatten to 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter. Put the wrapped patties on a foil-lined baking sheet and sprinkle all the patties with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Broil until the cheese is melted and the burgers are still a bit pink inside, about 6 minutes. The burgers will be cooked to at least medium in order to melt the cheese but still stay juicy. Mix the ketchup, balsamic and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Brush the burgers with some of the ketchup sauce and divide the rest among the bottom halves of the buns. Place a burger on each bottom bun, top with some of the spicy onions and finish with a top bun. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 9529,&quot;Shrimp and Barley Risotto 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small bulb fennel, chopped, plus 1/4 cup fronds 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 cups quick-cooking pearl barley (about 8 ounces) 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 1/4 pounds peeled and deveined medium shrimp 3/4 cup frozen peas 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese Instructions: Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Cut the sweet potatoes and then the parsnips into paper-thin slices using a food processor fitted with the thinnest vegetable-slicing blade. If necessary, cut the potatoes in half or quarters lengthwise so they fit into the feeder tube. Use 1 tablespoon of the butter to coat the inside of a 2-quart oven-proof casserole (a 6 by 10-inch Pyrex pan works well). Combine the cream, stock, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Place 1/3 of the sweet potatoes in a thin layer across the bottom of the casserole. Layer half the parsnips on top of the sweet potatoes. Repeat this sequence until all of the sweet potatoes and parsnips have been used. Pour the cream mixture over the top. It should reach about 3/4 of the way up the vegetables. Butter a piece of aluminum foil with the remaining butter and wrap the foil tightly over the casserole. Put in the oven and turn tempertature down to 325 degrees. Bake the casserole 1 hour.

Cook until the oil begins to bubble, then reduce the heat to low. Cook for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the shallots and garlic are lightly toasted. In a heatproof jar, combine the red cl pepper and salt. While the oil mixture is still hot, pour it into the jar and allow it to sit and steep for a few minutes. Add the sesame oil. You can make this ahead of time and keep it in the refrigerator for a few months. To make the noodles: Dissolve the baking soda and 1 teaspoon kosher salt in the warm water, then combine with the flour in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix until a shaggy dough forms, then knead by hand or on medium speed in the stand mixer with the dough hook until the dough is smooth and slightly elastic but still stiff, 8 to 10 minutes. Alternatively, you can combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl until you have a shaggy dough, then turn out onto a work surface and knead by hand. Lightly wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest for at least 30 minutes or longer. When the dough has rested, divide it into 3 equal parts. Use a rolling pin to roll them out into long skinny ovals, about 12 inches long by 3 inches wide. Brush the ovals on both sides with a thin even layer of neutral oil and then set them on a baking sheet, cover completely with plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour. To shape the noodles, work with one oval at a time and keep the others covered. Cut each oval the short way into seven 2-inch-wide strips and then gently pull the ends of each strip to create one long noodle. You can slap it on the counter a couple of times as you pull to help it stretch and if it gives you resistance, just let it rest a little longer. Pull each noodle to 30 to 32 inches long and place them on a baking sheet or on the countertop, keeping them separated. Repeat with the remaining dough to form the rest of the noodles. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil the noodles in 2 or 3 batches for about 2 minutes each; they are done when they are opaque and bouncy. Bring the water back up to a full boil after dropping each batch of noodles. Stir the chili oil. Drain the noodles and transfer directly to a serving bowl. Add to the noodles: a few splashes of rice vinegar, half of the chili oil, a sprinkle of flaky salt and scallions. Toss to coat. Do a taste test. Add more chili oil, rice vinegar and flaky salt, if needed. Toss to combine. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and serve immediately. Drizzle additional chili oil on top or on the side, as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 9541,&quot;Chocolate Cambridge Cream 3 vanilla pods 7 fluid ounces (200 milliliters) milk 13 fluid ounces (375 milliliters) double cream 8 large egg yolks, preferably organic 2 1/2 ounces (70 grams) caster sugar 1 heaped teaspoon cocoa powder 3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) good-quality chocolate, bashed up finely Extra sugar, for caramelizing Instructions: Run a knife along the length of the vanilla pods, scraping out the seeds, and then chop up the pods. Put the seeds and pods in to a thick-bottomed pan with the milk and cream. Simmer slowly for 5 minutes for the flavor to infuse. In a bowl that will fit into the top of the pan, but not fall into the pan, whisk the egg yolks, sugar, and cocoa powder for a minute. Still slowly whisking, add the vanilla-flavored milk and cream and keep whisking until well mixed. Add 1-inch (2.5 centimeters) of hot water to the dirty pan bring to a simmer and put the bowl on top of the pan. Cook the custard slowly over the simmering water for 5 minutes, stirring often until it coats the back of the spoon. Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a clean container. Discard the vanilla pods. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Put 4 ovenproof serving dishes in a high-sided roasting tray. Divide the chocolate between them and shake flat. Carefully divide the custard mix between the dishes; making sure the chocolate isn&#39;t disturbed. Fill the tray with water until it is halfway up the sides of the dishes. Cook in the preheated oven for around 30 to 45 minutes until slightly wobbly in the middle. Allow to cool, then sprinkle with some sugar, and caramelize with a blowtorch. Propane Gas Torch Warning: Propane gas torches are highly flammable and should be kept away from heat or flame, and should not be exposed to prolonged sunlight. Propane gas torches should only be used in well-ventilated areas. When lighting a propane gas torch, place the torch on a flat, steady surface, facing away from you. Light the match or lighter and then open the gas valve. Light the gas jet, and blow out the match. Always turn off the burner valve to \finger tight\ when finished using the torch.

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Add peanut oil to a large wide skillet until it is at least a 1/2-inch deep. Heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Dredge each sandwich in flour and shake off the excess. Dip each sandwich generously in the egg/and cheese mixture. Work in batches, do this process to each sandwich just before frying, it&#39;s not a good idea to flour and dip ahead of time. Secure each sandwich with toothpicks. Put the first sandwich in the hot oil. Remove the toothpicks to turn and insert the toothpicks in the second side. When each sandwich is nice and brown on both sides, remove it from the oil and blot it on paper towels. Put it on a sheet tray with a rack and keep warm in the preheated oven. Repeat this process with each of the sandwiches. Cut the sandwiches diagonally into quarters, arrange on a serving platter and serve with the sauce. In a small saute pan combine the olive oil, garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook over medium heat until the garlic is golden brown and very aromatic.

Stir with a wooden spoon until the onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add enough stock to just cover the vegetables, about 1 quart, and stir to combine. The roux may separate. Add the tomatoes with their juices, andouille and smoked sausages, cayenne, bay leaves, 1 1/2 tablespoons salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper and the remaining stock, about 1 more quart. Partially cover and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over high heat. Add the okra and cook, stirring, until the gel dries out slightly, about 3 minutes. Add to the Dutch oven. Taste the gumbo for seasoning and adjust as desired. Add the chicken, cook until warmed through and serve, or simmer up to 2 hours more to concentrate the flavors, adding the chicken 20 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with the reserved sliced scallions and serve over rice. Serve with hot sauce and file powder if using. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 9546,&quot;Almost-Famous Chocolate Mousse Cake 1 18.25-ounce box devil&#39;s food cake mix (plus required ingredients) 14 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced (1 1/2 sticks) 1/4 cup strong coffee 10 large eggs, separated 1 1/2 cups plus 6 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 cups cold heavy cream 12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 3/4 cup heavy cream 5 tablespoons light corn syrup 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream 1 tablespoon sugar 1 pint vanilla ice cream Instructions: Make the cake: Prepare the cake mix as the label directs for a 9-by-13-inch cake. Bake; cool slightly in the pan, then invert onto a rack to cool completely. Clean out the cake pan and line it with plastic wrap. Cut the cake in half lengthwise, then in thirds crosswise to make 6 rectangles. Using a serrated knife, slice each rectangle in half to make two layers. Arrange half of the pieces snugly in the cake pan. Crumble the remaining pieces and press tightly into 6 small balls; arrange 1 cake ball in the center of each cake rectangle in the pan. Make the mousse: Heat the chocolate, butter, coffee and 1/4 cup water in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water), stirring, until melted. Remove the bowl from the pan; stir until cool. Reserve the simmering water. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Whisk the egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a separate large heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over the saucepan of simmering water and whisk until pale yellow, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the chocolate-coffee mixture and the vanilla and whisk until combined, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan and set in the bowl of ice water; whisk until slightly cool but not thick, about 4 minutes. Beat the egg whites and salt in a bowl with a mixer until foamy. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until almost stiff; gently fold into the chocolate-yolk mixture to make a dark chocolate mousse. Spread 5 cups over the cake and cake balls. Freeze until firm on top, about 30 minutes. Beat the heavy cream and the remaining 4 tablespoons sugar until soft peaks form; fold into the remaining mousse. Remove the cake from the freezer; spread with the light chocolate mousse, cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight. Make the chocolate shell: Stir the chocolate, heavy cream and 4 tablespoons corn syrup in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) until melted. A spoonful at a time, spread half of the shell mixture over the frozen mousse. Return to the freezer. Make the chocolate sauce: Add the remaining 1 tablespoon corn syrup and the butter to the remaining chocolate shell mixture. Microwave 30 seconds, then stir until glossy. To serve the cake, beat the heavy cream with a mixer until foamy. Add the sugar and beat until soft peaks form. Remove the cake from the freezer; invert onto a baking sheet and unmold, then invert again onto a platter, chocolate shell-side up. Cut the cake in half lengthwise using a warm knife, then cut into thirds crosswise to make 6 rectangles; cut each rectangle in half diagonally to make 2 triangles. Top each triangle with whipped cream, ice cream and the prepared chocolate sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 9547,&quot;Vegan Spicy Herb Chickpea Havarti 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for the pan 1 cup unsweetened almond milk<br> 1/2 cup chickpea flour<br> 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast<br> 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> Instructions: Lightly grease a mini loaf pan (5 3/4 by 3 1/4 by 2 inches) with oil; set aside. Add the oil, almond milk, chickpea flour, vinegar, nutritional yeast, Italian seasoning, salt and red pepper flakes to a small saucepan and whisk to combine. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is very thick and pulls away from the bottom of the saucepan, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top to flatten it (work quickly because the mixture will firm up and become difficult to spread as soon as it starts to cool). Let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes, then cover and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.

Place the bread on a baking sheet. Bake until totally dry, about 30 minutes. Break the bread into chunks. Pulse in a food processor until the bread turns into crumbs. Throw in the meat into a large mixing bowl. Add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, milk, parsley, garlic, eggs, salt and some pepper. Use clean hands to mix together until well combined. Use a scoop to retrieve a small amount of the meat mixture, and roll it in your hands to make meatballs (about 25). Place on a pan and put the pan in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes, just to firm them up. Heat the olive oil in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. Working with 8 to 10 meatballs at a time, cook them until brown but not cooked all the way through, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Remove from the pot to a plate while you make the sauce. For the sauce: Add the garlic and onions to the meatball pot. Stir and cook until the onion begins to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook for another minute. (Just omit this step if you&#39;re not using wine.) Add the crushed tomatoes, whole tomatoes, sugar, salt and pepper to taste. Stir the sauce to combine all the ingredients. Cover and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. If sauce needs more liquid, just add in a little water. Then throw in the parsley, basil and the meat-a-balls! Stir gently, then cover and cook for 20 more minutes, stirring once or twice until the meatballs are cooked through. Heap the rigatoni on a large platter and pile the meatballs and sauce on the top. Sprinkle on some extra minced parsley and serve with extra grated Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 9552,&quot;Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge Sundae 2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk 2/3 cup semi sweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter (recommended: Skippy) 4 scoops toffee or caramel ice cream 4 scoops chocolate ice cream 4 scoops vanilla ice cream 4 tablespoons or 1/4 cup salted peanuts, roughly chopped or left whole to taste 4 chocolate cigar cookies Instructions: Put all the sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, and peanut butter into a saucepan and put it on the heat to melt, stirring occasionally.

Place tomatoes cut-side down on a baking sheet lined with foil for easy cleanup and brush skin with 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil, reserving the rest of the oil. Roast tomatoes until charred, about 15 minutes, remove from oven and place in plastic bags to sweat. This will help make it easier to remove the skin. Heat chicken stock in a medium saucepot over medium heat. Peel shrimp and add shells to the pot, reserving the shrimp. Bring the pot of stock and shells to a boil, skimming any impurities which rise to the surface. In a large stockpot, heat the remaining grapeseed oil over medium heat and melt the butter in it, and saute onions and garlic until onions turn translucent. Add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to soften and give up their juices. Strain the chicken stock into the stockpot with the onions and mushrooms and discard the shrimp shells. Remove skin from the roasted tomatoes and add them to the pot. Add the white rice and all-purpose seasoning, bring to a gentle boil, reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer 20 minutes. Chop most of the shrimp, small dice, reserving about 8 whole shrimp. Stir chopped shrimp into pot and add whole shrimp last, without stirring in the whole shrimp.

Put the chicken breasts in a medium saucepan, add the broth (it should just cover the chicken), and bring to a boil. Cover, turn the heat very low, and cook the chicken very gently until just firm to the touch, about 15 minutes. Remove chicken from the broth reserving the broth. When the cool enough to handle, shred or dice the chicken into large bite-size pieces, discarding the bones. (If some of the pieces are still a bit pink, don&#39;t fret, it finishes cooking in the pie.) Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the oil in a heavy non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, mushrooms, celery, turnips, season with salt, to taste, and cook until the vegetables are light brown, about 8 minutes. Add the onions and cook about 1 minute more. Stir the flour into the vegetables and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the reserved chicken broth and whisk until it comes to a boil. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer, uncovered, until thick, about 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the chicken parsley, dill, lemon zest, and pepper and remove from the heat. Layer 3 sheets of phyllo dough on the workspace, spraying with olive oil spray in between each layer. On the last layer, sprinkle with more salt and pepper, and the paprika. Cut sheets in half, crosswise, and stack to make 6 layers. Cut 4 rounds out of the phyllo with scissors or a paring knife that fit snugly into the opening of each ramekin. Divide chicken filling evenly among the ramekins and place the phyllo rounds on top. Bake until bubbly, chicken is cooked through and crust is crispy and golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9574,&quot;English and Italian Finger Sandwiches 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> One 14- to 16-ounce loaf Italian bread (from a bakery), sliced into 24 thin slices<br> 1/3 cup roasted red peppers<br> 1/3 pound thinly sliced salami<br> 1/3 pound thinly sliced prosciutto di Parma<br> 1/3 pound thinly sliced mortadella<br> 1/2 cucumber, peeled if waxy, thinly sliced<br> Fresh basil leaves, as needed 4 to 5 pickled pepperoncini, sliced<br> Instructions: Stir together the oil, vinegar, oregano, salt and some pepper in a small bowl.

Add the spinach and cook, stirring, just until the liquid is released. Add the cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and cook until the cream is reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9577,&quot;Pignolatta 3 1/2 cups sifted flour, plus more possibly 6 eggs 1 teaspoon salt Canola oil, for frying 2 cups honey 6 tablespoons sugar 1 (3-ounce) jar confetti sprinkles or lightly toasted pine nuts Instructions: In a large ceramic bowl with a wooden spoon or in a mixer with a dough hook mix together the flour, eggs and salt to make a stiff dough that pulls away from the walls of the bowl. You may end up using your hands to finish the job if mixing with a wooden spoon. If the dough is still sticky to the touch add more flour. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and doesn&#39;t stick to your fingers. . Quarter the dough and roll the segments into ropes the thickness of 1/2-inch. Cut off knobs of dough 1/2-inch long (some people roll these into balls but I don&#39;t). In a 3 quart saucepan heat oil for deep-frying to 365 degrees F. Fry the dough pieces until golden brown in batches, a handful at a time and drain on a paper towel. The dough will sink in the oil then come floating to the top. They do expand in the oil so leave them some room. Allow them to cool while you make the caramel. In a large saucepan combine the honey and sugar and bring to a boil. Working quickly with a wooden spoon stir in the fried dough pieces to coat them with the honey caramel. Quickly spoon the sticky dough balls onto 2 plates and form into a tall mound resembling a pine cone, then quickly sprinkle pine nuts or confetti sprinkles over the surface so they stick to the honey caramel before it cools and is no longer sticky. If there&#39;s a second person around to help with this, get them. It&#39;s a bit of a group or family project. You can also place smaller amounts into foil cup cake cups for individual servings. Let cool and serve. Keeps up to 1 week. To eat just pick off dough pieces and enjoy. Notes about the recipe: Some spell it Pinolata with one T. It sometimes has pine nuts or \pignolla\ stirred into the caramel or is formed into the shape like a pine cone so the name may have come from that. In Sicily they&#39;re called Pignolata, in Naples (Italy, not Florida) the same thing is called Struffoli. I first had this at the holidays at an Italian friends house and they make them every year. But because they&#39;re fried they fit for Hanukah too. They&#39;re something you serve after a meal and really need coffee to wash them down. It&#39;s a very tactile dessert that you pick apart tiny caramelized nugget by tiny caramelized nugget. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 9578,&quot;Poached Shrimp Po&#39; Boys 1 pound Market Pantry?

Heat the oil over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 375 degrees F. Set up brown paper bags or several layered paper towels nearby for draining the chicken.<br> Starting with the dark meat, one piece at a time, add the chicken to the seasoned flour and turn to coat. Shake to remove excess flour. One piece at a time, add the chicken to the hot oil. The oil should not quite cover the chicken. (Do not overcrowd the pan; this can be dangerous and result in soggy chicken, too.)<br> Fry the pieces, turning them once or twice, until the coating is rich golden brown on all sides, 10 to 14 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cover the skillet. Continue cooking until the chicken is cooked all the way through and the juices run clear when pricked with a knife, another 10 to 15 minutes. (An instant-read thermometer inserted into a thigh should register 170 degrees F.) Remove and drain the chicken on the brown paper bags or paper towels.<br> Remove the skillet from the heat. Carefully pour off most of the grease into a metal bowl or can, leaving 2 to 3 tablespoons in the pan with the browned crumbs. Reduce the heat to very low. Add 4 tablespoons of the remaining flour used to coat the chicken. Stir together with a wooden spoon and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add the milk and stock or water. Cook, stirring often, until the gravy is smooth and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add a heaping pinch of black pepper. Taste and adjust for seasoning with salt.<br> Serve the gravy with the rice and chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 9593,&quot;Dirty P&#39;s Garlic-Ginger Chicken Thighs 2 pounds skin-on, boneless chicken thighs 1 cup thinly sliced red onion 2 tablespoons minced garlic 2 tablespoons minced peeled ginger 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup fresh tangerine or orange juice Freshly ground pepper Vegetable oil, for the grill Instructions: Combine the chicken, onion, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, juice and 1 teaspoon pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to coat the chicken with the marinade. Refrigerate 1 hour or overnight.<br> Preheat a grill to medium high and oil the grate. Grill the chicken skin-side down until marked, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip and continue to grill until cooked through, about 5 more minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9594,&quot;BBQ Cheese Straws 1 1/2 cups coarsely grated extra-sharp Cheddar 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 stick cold unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon BBQ seasoning mix 2 tablespoons heavy cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F with the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper and set aside. Add the cheese, flour, butter, salt and BBQ mix to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the cream and pulse until a ball forms. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 to 1/8-inch thick. Cut the dough with a sharp knife into 1/4-inch wide strips. Transfer to the prepared sheet pans, leaving space between them, and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Flip the pans once halfway through the cooking time. Cool completely on the sheet pans. BYOC: If your friends are the spicy type, try adding a pinch or 2 of cayenne. If you want to get the kids involved, omit the BBQ spice, have them paint the straws with egg wash before you bake them and add some sesame seeds or poppy seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Zinfandel]&quot; 9595,&quot;Tortilla Soup 2 ears fresh corn, husks removed 4 or 5 large garlic cloves, peeled 1 small onion (about 3 ounces), peeled, trimmed and quartered 1 small jalapeno pepper, trimmed and seeded 2 tablespoons corn oil 1 large boneless skinless chicken breast 2 corn tortillas, cut into 1-inch squares 1 pasilla cl pepper, soaked in water 2 large ripe tomatoes (1 pound), peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons tomato paste 2 to 3 teaspoons ground cumin 2 quarts chicken stock Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 corn tortillas, cut into strips and baked to crispness 1 ripe avocado, diced 1/2 cup grated Cheddar 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Using a large knife, carefully scrape the kernels off the corn cobs and set aside, reserving the cobs. Using a food processor fitted with the steel blade, or a large knife, coarsely chop the garlic, onion, jalapeno pepper and corn kernels. Reserve. In a large soup pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat and sear the chicken until just browned on both sides. Add the tortilla squares, and cook over low heat until they are slightly crisp. Stir in the chopped vegetable mixture and pasilla pepper and simmer just until the vegetables are coated with the oil. Do not brown. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and 2 teaspoons of the cumin and continue to simmer for about 10 minutes to maximize the flavor. Slowly pour in the stock and cook over low heat until the soup is reduced by 1/3 and the chicken breast is cooked through. Remove the chicken breast and set aside. When cool enough to handle, slice chicken into very thin strips. Meanwhile, puree the soup, in batches, in a blender* or food processor until smooth. At this point, the soup can be passed through the fine strainer if desired. Ladle the soup into soup bowls and garnish with tortillas, avocados, chicken, cheese, and cilantro. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 9596,&quot;Buffalo Chicken Pasta Salad Kosher salt 1 pound rigatoni noodles<br> 1 pound cooked chicken, diced (I love using leftover wing meat) 4 stalks celery, cut into small dice (about 2 cups), plus chopped leaves, for garnish 1/2 bunch green onions, green parts only, sliced (about 1/2 cup)<br> 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise<br> 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese<br> 5 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br> 2 to 4 tablespoons hot sauce<br> 2 tablespoons dark, dark, DARK beer<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne (or togarashi if you have it!)<br> Instructions: In a large pot of heavily salted boiling water, cook the rigatoni according to the package directions for al dente.

When the ice cream has softened, beat it in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or by hand in a bowl with a wooden spoon) until soft and creamy but not melted. Break the cheesecake into pieces and beat or fold into the ice cream. Scrape the ice cream mixture into the prepared springform pan and smooth the top. Freeze until set, at least 4 hours or overnight. Combine the strawberries, the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and the lemon juice in a nonreactive saucepan and warm over medium heat just until the strawberries begin to break down and give off their juices, 3 to 5 minutes. Stick the strawberry mixture in the refrigerator to chill. When ready to serve, remove the sides of the springform pan and place the frozen cheesecake on a cake plate. Spoon the strawberries over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</li></ul><p>&quot; 9613,&quot;\Serious\ Vanilla Ice Cream 2 cups half-and-half 1 cup whipping cream 1 cup minus 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons peach preserves (not jelly) 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped Instructions: Combine all ingredients (including the bean and its pulp) in a large saucepan and place over medium heat.

Place a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Lay the bread slices on the rack; set aside to air-dry. Whisk the cream, eggs, Parmesan, nutmeg and some salt and pepper in a large casserole dish until smooth; set aside. For the Florentine sauce: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour until the mixture is smooth and lump-free. Cook, whisking constantly, until light brown, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the milk and 1/4 cup of the heavy cream. Continue to cook, whisking, until the mixture has thickened, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low, stir in the spinach, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, 1/4 teaspoon salt, a few grinds of pepper and the nutmeg. Turn off the heat, and cover to keep warm. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Transfer the bread slices to a plate. Transfer the baking sheet with the wire rack to the oven. Place 2 bread slices in the egg mixture, and let them completely soak on both sides, about 30 seconds to 1 minute per side, checking after 30 seconds. (The bread should feel heavy and soaked through but hold its shape without breaking apart.) Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in the skillet. Add the 2 soaked slices, and cook until the outside is golden brown and crisp and the inside is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. You will need to watch and adjust the heat between medium and medium-low if the bread is browning too quickly or not browning quickly enough. Keep the finished French toast slices warm on the rack in the baking sheet in the oven. Repeat with the remaining slices. Toss the remaining 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan with the parsley in a small bowl; set aside. Place the Florentine sauce back over medium-low heat, whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons cream and the lemon juice and heat through, about 1 minute.

Add the chiles and soaking liquid. Blend until smooth. The salsa may be made a day or 2 ahead and then refrigerated. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the vegetable oil into a large skillet and heat over medium heat. One at a time, dip the tortillas in the cl salsa and shake off any excess. Transfer the tortillas, one at a time, to the hot pan and saute 10 seconds on each side. Drain on a rack. Lay all of the tortillas out on a counter. Reserve 1/4 cup of the grated cheese. Divide the remaining cheese into 12 portions and spoon onto the lower half of each tortilla. Divide the remaining diced onion evenly and sprinkle over the cheese. Roll up each tortilla to form a tube. Arrange the enchiladas on a baking tray, seam side down, and bake 3 to 5 minutes or until heated through. With a spatula, transfer the warm enchiladas to a serving platter. Place about a spoonful of Ancho cl salsa over each enchilada. Sprinkle with the reserved cheese and serve, passing the extra salsa at the table. In large bowl combine all ingredients and stir until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small piece of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoons at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Divide the dough into 24 golf ball size pieces for tacos and 12 large balls for quesadillas.

Refrigerate the crab mixture for 30 minutes to firm up; this allows the panko to absorb some of the liquid, helping the crab cakes bind together. For the remoulade: Meanwhile, combine the mayonnaise, parsley, Dijon, capers, hot sauce, Worcestershire, paprika, cayenne, garlic, lemon juice and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl and mix until combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. For the crab cakes: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with butter. Scoop 1/3-cup mounds of the crab mixture, pat into 1-inch-thick patties and place on the prepared baking sheet. You should have 9 patties. Bake until golden around the edges and heated through, about 205 minutes. For the fried green tomatoes: Meanwhile, heat 1/2 inch of oil in a large Dutch oven or skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F.

Peel and slice peaches into wedges. Remove boiling wine syrup from heat then add peach slices. Cover and allow to sit for 10 minutes. Remove peaches and reserve syrup in refrigerator for future use. Will hold about 1 week. In a small pot reduce the balsamic to 1/3. Remove from heat. For this dish you will need a non-stick pan. Take the foie gras out of the refrigerator. One thing I want to point out really quickly is you will need a warm knife. When you use the knife simply have a container of lukewarm water and place the knife in it and slice a 2-inch thick piece of foie gras, slice it and season with salt and white pepper. Take the non-stick pan, place it on a gas stove, on high. Take a knife and score the foie gras left to right and this will allow the fat to be released a little bit quicker and prevent it both from sticking and burning in the pan. Once the pan is lightly smoking, remove from heat for 1/2 a minute. Add dash of grapeseed oil. Place the foie gras in the pan score side down and place back over the heat. Continue to sear the foie gras for approximately 1 to 1 1/2 minutes making sure that the Foie Gras does not burn; turn over and cook the foie gras for a further 1 to 1 1/ 2 minutes on the other side. Remove from the heat and let rest for approximately 1 1/2 minutes. Stir in butter and lemon juice. Spoon peaches and syrup onto 4 plates, place foie gras on top of peaches and drizzle plate with reduction.

Everyone smothers it with heavy sauces or encrusts it with this and that...which is fine. But why not enjoy the fish for what it is from time to time? So, simply season the salmon fillet with a nice sprinkle of salt and coarse ground pepper, both sides. Rub the fillet with a small amount of olive oil. Grill or pan sear the salmon until just medium rare or medium, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. (The saying is, you don&#39;t cook salmon, you should merely threaten it!) In a skillet over high heat, heat the butter until nearly smoking. Add the shiitakes and leeks and cook on high heat until the edges just begin to brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.

For the dressing: Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it starts to bubble and smoke. Add the onions and celery to the pan and sweat until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the thyme, bread cubes and poultry seasoning to the pan, folding and stirring to toast the bread and bloom the seasoning, 3 to 4 minutes. The bread should start to brown and smell amazing. Turn off the heat, drizzle in about half of the stock and fold to combine. Drizzle in more stock as needed to moisten the dressing but not make it soggy. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Once you&#39;re happy with the flavors, dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Cover the pan with the lid and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes. Uncover, then cook for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. For the stuffed turkey breast: Butterfly the turkey breast into a 1-inch-thick sheet, opening it up like a tri-fold book. Place the butterflied turkey breast skin-side down on your work surface, drizzle with olive oil and heavily sprinkle with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning. Spoon about half of the dressing in an even 1/2-inch layer over the breast, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Roll the turkey into a long tight cylinder, making sure to end up with the skin on the outside. Tie the roll with butcher twine 2 inches between each knot and trim any excess twine. Sprinkle well with salt and pepper. Heat a cast-iron pan large enough to fit the roll over high heat. Add the oil to the pan. Brown the roll well on all sides. Before placing the pan in the oven, insert a very large metal skewer, like the kind used at a churrasco, through the length of the turkey roll. This will help conduct the heat and cook the turkey evenly on the inside. Place in the oven to roast until it reaches an internal temperature of 155 degrees F, 30 to 40 minutes. Cook the extra stuffing in a buttered baking dish and bake along with the turkey. Allow the turkey to rest for 10 minutes before removing the strings. Slice into 1/2-inch-thick slices. For the gravy: Carefully put the hot turkey pan back over medium-high heat with a dry towel or oven mitt. Toss in the butter and shallots and cook until light brown and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss in the flour as you scrape the pan bits. Work the flour into the pan for about another minute to make a rough roux. Pour in the cold chicken broth and demi while stirring rapidly to work the roux and stock together. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Season with the soy sauce, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust if necessary. Finish by stirring in the heavy cream. Shingle the turkey slices on a platter and top with the gravy. Garnish with the chopped parsley. Serve the extra stuffing alongside if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9638,&quot;S&#39;mores Milkshake 2 cups large marshmallows 2 cups chocolate chip ice cream 2 cups milk 1 cup marshmallow creme, such as Marshmallow Fluff 1 cup crumbled graham crackers 1/2 cup chocolate shavings Instructions: Place four 12-ounce glasses in the freezer.

In a large bowl, toss chicken with all of the seasonings. Cover with plastic wrap, and allow chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat a grill or a large grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill chicken on each side for 1 to 2 minutes per side. If your pan is not oven-safe, then transfer chicken to a baking dish and let finish cooking in the oven for 7 to 9 minutes, or until fully cooked through. Let the chicken cool, slice it into julienne strips, and reserve. Heat a pan of canola oil until the temperature of the oil reaches 375 degrees F. Fry the tortilla strips until crisp, about 2 minutes. With a spider or slotted spoon, remove the strips from the pan and let drain on a paper towel. In a large mixing bowl, toss the lettuce, onions, and tomatoes with 1 cup of the Tomatillo Vinaigrette. Toss until all ingredients are well mixed. Divide the lettuce mixture evenly among 4 dinner plates or individual salad bowls. Arrange 4 tomato quarters around the edge of each salad. In a circular pattern, arrange the chicken atop each salad, alternated with the avocado and poblano slices in between. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup cheese over each salad. Drizzle the remaining vinaigrette over the chicken and vegetables. Garnish with the tortilla strips and cilantro. Add the tomatillos to a pot of simmering water, and blanch for 5 minutes. Drain the tomatillos into a colander, and allow them to cool slightly. In blender, combine all of the ingredients except the oil. Puree the mixture for 15 seconds, and then continue blending for 30 seconds, slowly drizzling in the olive oil through the top until the dressing emulsifies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 9640,&quot;Turkey and Artichoke Stuffed Shells with Arrabbiata Sauce One 12-ounce box jumbo pasta shells (recommended: Barilla) 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 large yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup) 3 cloves garlic, chopped 1 pound ground turkey 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus 1/2 teaspoon 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus 1/4 teaspoon One 8- to 10-ounce package frozen artichokes, thawed and coarsely chopped One 15-ounce container ricotta cheese 3/4 cup grated Parmesan 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 5 cups Arrabbiata Sauce, recipe follows; 1 1/2 cups grated mozzarella (about 5 ounces) Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and partially cook until tender but still very firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain pasta. Meanwhile, in a large heavy skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and the garlic and cook until the onions are soft and starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Add the ground turkey, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is slightly golden and cooked through. Add the artichoke hearts and stir to combine. Remove from heat and let cool. In a large bowl combine the cooled turkey mixture with the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, basil, parsley, and the remaining salt and pepper. Stir to combine. To stuff the shells, cover the bottom of a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish with 1 cup of Arrabbiata sauce. Take a shell in the palm of your hand and stuff it with a large spoonful of turkey mixture, about 2 tablespoons. Place the stuffed shell in the baking dish. Continue filling the shells until the baking dish is full, about 24 shells. Drizzle the remaining Arrabbiata Sauce over the shells, top with the grated mozzarella. If freezing, cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 1 day and up to 1 month. To bake, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

In a bowl, combine the milk, honey, molasses, vanilla and eggs. In a separate bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, wheat flour, rye flour, 1 1/3 cup of sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry and mix until completely incorporated. Work until a dough forms and it comes together in a ball. Do not overwork. Freeze any extra dough for future use. Combine the remaining sugar and cinnamon for the topping. Roll out the dough to a thickness of approximately 1/8-inch. Dock dough and cut with a rippled edge pasta cutter to make 20 graham crackers. Place the crackers on parchment paper, dust with the cinnamon sugar and bake until the edges are golden brown, about 8 minutes. To assemble: Layer 1 graham cracker, 1 piece of chocolate, 1 marshmallow and top with another graham cracker and enjoy. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with powdered sugar. Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup and 1/2 cup cold water together in a heavy-bottomed pot with a candy thermometer. Bring to a boil and cook to a temperature of 235 degrees F, (soft ball stage of caramel). While the sugar is cooking, add the egg whites to the mixer. Dissolve the gelatin in 1/4 cup cold water and reserve. Once the sugar reaches 235 degrees F, immediately remove from the heat and stir in the gelatin. Turn on the mixer to high speed while the gelatin is dissolving. With the mixer running on high, whip the egg whites to soft peaks and then stream the hot sugar into the egg, building an emulsion as you combine the two. If the stream is too fast, the egg will break. Once all the sugar has been incorporated into the egg, a meringue is formed. Add the orange zest and whip the meringue until it is just below body temperature. Once the meringue has reached the correct temperature, stop the mixer and place the meringue into a pastry bag and pipe onto prepared baking sheet. Coat the tops of the marshmallows with another thin dusting of powdered sugar after piping. Let the marshmallow air dry for 2 hours. Store all unused marshmallows in an airtight zip lock bag with a liberal amount of powdered sugar. The sugar is to keep the marshmallows from sticking together. Melt the chocolate in a bowl over hot water. Pour the melted chocolate on a parchment lined baking sheet or counter top into one large sheet about 1/8 inch thick. Cool to room temperature and break into large pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9646,&quot;Slow-Cooker Moroccan Turkey Stew 1 teaspoon ground allspice Kosher salt 4 skinless, bone-in turkey thighs (about 4 pounds) 1/2 medium butternut squash, cut into 2-inch chunks 2 15 .5-ounce cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed 1 28 -ounce can whole peeled tomatoes with juices, broken up 1 cup dried apricots 1/2 cup golden raisins 8 medium carrots, cut into 11/2-inch pieces 3 medium red onions, halved and cut into wedges 2 whole dried red chiles 1/2 lemon 2 cups fresh cilantro, including leaves and some stems 1 cup fresh parsley 1 clove garlic, smashed 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Combine the allspice and 3 teaspoons salt in a small bowl.

Put the lettuce in a bowl. Pour the dressing over and toss well. Divide the dough into 4 equal balls. On a floured board, stretch and roll the dough into thin discs with a rolling pin. The dough may also be stretched by hand, but rolling will give you a thinner crust. Coat the rolled out dough with olive oil and place, oiled side down, on a very hot grill. This can be done indoors on a cast-iron stovetop grill pan that has been preheated over medium-medium high. When you start to see bubbles on the surface of the dough, turn it over. It should be slightly browned on the bottom. Brush each round with a generous tablespoon of the garlic paste and sprinkle with the thyme. Remove from the grill with tongs and top with the Caesar salad. Grate parmesan cheese on top, fold in half, and eat. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Peel the outermost layers of skin off the heads of garlic. Cut off the top 1/3 of the heads to open the cloves. Save the small pieces of garlic for another use (see Chef&#39;s Note). Put the heads, cut sides up, in a small baking dish and pour the olive oil over them. Season with salt and pepper. Cover tightly, place in the oven, and roast until about 3/4 cooked, about 45 minutes. Uncover and return to the oven until the cloves begin to pop out of their skins and brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool. When cool enough to handle easily, squeeze the roasted garlic into a small bowl. Press against the skins very well to get out all the sweet roasted garlic you can. Add the oil from the baking dish and mix well until a paste forms. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator, for up to 1 week. Chef&#39;s Note: It is hard to have too much roasted garlic around. You can roast the little bits from the tips of the garlic heads. Put them in a separate small baking container, such as an individual custard cup. Season with salt and pepper, douse with olive oil, cover, and place in the oven to bake along with the whole garlic heads. Depending on their size, they will be soft and browned in about 1/2 the time needed for the whole heads. The little pieces make a good \cook&#39;s snack\ while preparing dinner, or can be squeezed into tomato sauce or onto pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 9659,&quot;Online Round 2 Recipe - Eggplant Rollatini 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 medium onion, chopped 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1 (15-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves Reserved ricotta filling from Veggie Lasagna recipe 1/2 cup grated mozzarella, divided Reserved grilled eggplant from Veggie Lasagna recipe Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Sprinkle bits of the butter over the dough and, using a pastry blender or your fingertips, work it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal, with the biggest pieces of butter the size of tiny peas. In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt or sour cream, lemon juice and about 1/4 cup water and add this to the butter-flour mixture. With your fingertips or a wooden spoon, mix in the liquid until large lumps form. Pat the lumps into a ball. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour, or up to 2 days. For the filling: Get down the saute pan with the lid. If you don&#39;t have one, any large lid will do. Add the olive oil, tomatoes, salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes (if that&#39;s your thing) to your saute pan, then cover and heat over high heat. Roll the tomatoes around from time to time so that they&#39;ll cook evenly. In a few minutes, you&#39;ll hear some putts and pops as the tomatoes burst a little. When most have, remove the lid, turn the heat down to medium and add the zucchini chunks. Saute until they soften, about 2 minutes. Add the corn and cook 1 minute. Add the scallions, just stirring them in, then turn off the heat. Adjust the seasonings if needed. Transfer the mixture to a large plate and spread it out so that it will cool faster. (You want it cooled to at least lukewarm before assembling the galette.) Assemble the galette: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a floured counter, roll the dough out into a 12-inch round (it really doesn&#39;t need to be perfectly shaped). Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet; I like to fold my dough gently, without creasing, in quarters, then unfold it onto the baking sheet. Sprinkle the tomato-zucchini-corn mixture with half of the Parmesan and spoon the mixture into the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border. If any liquid has puddled in the plate, try to leave it there as you spoon. Sprinkle with almost all of the remaining Parmesan, leaving a pinch or two behind for the crust. Fold the border over the filling, pleating the edge to make it fit. The center will be open. Brush the crust with the egg yolk glaze. Sprinkle the glaze with the last pinches of Parmesan. Bake until puffed and golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes, then slide the galette onto a serving plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 9668,&quot;Lemon Buttermilk Poundcake 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 cups sugar 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 4 large eggs 3 egg yolks 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 1 tablespoon strained lemon juice 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup lemon juice 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions: Set a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees.

Line a large plate or baking sheet with paper towels. In a large bowl, sift together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the buttermilk, vegetable oil, honey and egg and stir to combine. The batter should be a little thicker than pancake batter; it should fall off a spoon but not run off of it. If necessary, add more buttermilk 1 tablespoon at a time. Dry the hot dogs thoroughly with a kitchen towel. Insert a skewer into the cut end of each hot dog, pushing it almost all the way through to the tip. Sprinkle the cornstarch onto a small plate and roll the hot dogs on the plate to lightly dust them with cornstarch. Gently tap the hot dogs to remove extra cornstarch. Pour the batter into a tall drinking glass. Holding a skewered hot dog at the bottom of the skewer, dunk the hot dog straight down into the glass of batter so that it is fully immersed in the batter. Slowly pull the hot dog back out, ensuring that it is fully coated on all sides and allowing some of the excess batter to drip back into the glass. Immediately place the battered hot dog carefully into the hot oil while still holding the stick (with tongs). Cook until deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, turning the stick as necessary to ensure even browning. Place the cooked corn dog on the plate of paper towels to drain.

Add the apples and vanilla bean and saute for about 2 minutes. Add the sugar, cinnamon and salt to the pan and cook until the apples start to turn a light caramel-golden brown but aren&#39;t falling apart, 6 to 8 minutes. The apples should still have some tooth to them. Add the flour and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, to remove the raw taste from the flour. Fold in the lemon juice. Spread the filling out in an even layer on a baking sheet and refrigerate until cold. For the egg rolls: Arrange an egg roll wrapper in a diamond shape on a board in front of you. Brush the borders with beaten egg. Spoon 2 to 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling into the center of the wrapper. Take care to leave about 1 inch between the filling and the edges of the wrapper. Fold the end of the wrapper nearest you over the filling, then fold the sides over. Finally, roll the wrapper into a tight cylinder, tucking and tightening as you go. Repeat with the remaining wrappers until all the filling is used. As you go, remember to keep the unused wrappers, as well as the finished egg rolls, covered with a towel to prevent them from drying out. Add 4 to 5 inches of oil to a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven and heat to 350 degrees F. Fry the egg rolls in batches of 4 until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself. Start with 2 pieces of colored sugar. I used red and green. Pull them into a rectangular shape that is about 1 1/2-inches wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick. Place the pieces side-to-side and let them stick together on the long side. Place a piece of white sugar that is about 1/2-inch wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick in the middle. Close the red and green around it. Roll it and twist it while pulling it. When it gets to the desired thickness, use a scissor to cut the length and shape into a cane. Allow to cool completely. The white is inside and will become apparent when eaten. Jacques? tips: Vinegar keeps the sugar from crystallizing. You will not taste the flavor. It serves as an acid in this recipe. Sometimes candy cane recipes contain corn syrup, which makes the sugar very dry and very hot. Adding corn syrup makes it more difficult to work with the sugar at home. Remember, the sugar is at 320 degrees F, and that will burn you. The ideal work surface is a silpat placed over cool marble or granite. If you do not have marble or stone, use wood. It is a good idea to use gloves to help protect your hands from the heat and to prevent burning. I use a special sugar box that includes a special heat source, If you don?t have one, you can work in front of the oven. Set the oven to 300 degrees F. Open the oven door and place the silpat on the oven door. It provides a similar effect to the sugar box heater. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9696,&quot;Soppressata and Cheese in Puff Pastry 1 package (2 sheets) frozen puff pastry, such as Pepperidge Farm, defrosted 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 12 thin (not paper thin) slices soppressata salami (3 1/2 inches in diameter) 6 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place a piece of parchment paper on a sheet pan.<br> Lay one sheet of puff pastry on a floured board and lightly roll into a 10-inch square. Place it on the sheet pan and brush the pastry with all the mustard, leaving a 1-inch border. Arrange the soppressata in overlapping layers on the mustard and sprinkle the grated cheese evenly on the soppressata, also avoiding the border. Brush the border with the egg wash.<br> Lightly roll the second piece of puff pastry into a 10-inch square. Lay the pastry directly on top of the first square, lining up the edges. Brush the top with the egg wash, cut three large slits for steam to escape, and chill for 15 minutes.<br> When the pastry is cold, trim the edges with a very sharp knife to make a clean edge. Bake the pastry in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, turning once while baking, until puffed and brown.

Spray two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and dust with flour. Put the flour, baking powder and salt into the bowl of a food processor. Add the sugar and pulse a few times to combine evenly. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the dry ingredients. Pulse until the mixture looks like coarse sand, with some pea-size bits of butter, about 5 times. Whisk the milk, vanilla and eggs together in a liquid measuring cup. With the processor running, pour in the wet ingredients and process to make a smooth batter (this takes less than a minute). Divide the batter between the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick or small skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool the cakes on a rack for 15 minutes. Then run a knife around the edges of the pans and turn the cakes out onto a plate. Flip the cakes upright and cool completely on the rack, about 45 minutes.

Lift the dough occasionally by sliding a metal spatula or bench scraper underneath to make sure it isn&#39;t sticking to the parchment. Cut out 3 1/2-inch star cookies as close together as possible. Cut out the centers of the stars with a 1 1/2-inch cutter. If the dough becomes too soft to cut out, place it in the freezer for 5 minutes to firm back up. Transfer the large and small stars to separate prepared baking sheets, large on one and small on the other, leaving 1 inch between them all. Gather together the scraps and repeat with the remaining dough. When the remaining dough is too small for the large cutter, just cut out small stars. Sprinkle more confetti stars over the top of the cookies and gently press down so they stick. Freeze the cookies on the baking sheets while you repeat with the second dough piece. Freeze the cookies about 10 minutes before baking. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until the cookies are light golden brown around the edges and slightly firm when gently pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9700,&quot;Dream Bars Nonstick vegetable spray 1 1/2 cups flour 1 cup light brown sugar 1 cup coarsely chopped toasted pecans 6 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature 3 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut flakes 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk Instructions: Line a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with foil so that it covers the bottom and overhangs 2 sides by at least 1-inch.

Place the tomatoes, garlic, jalapeno and onions on a baking tray, then broil until everything is charred well, turning once, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a blender along with the chiles and their cooking liquid and pulse until smooth but still with a little texture. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Set aside until ready to serve. Break down the salt into finer pieces in a mortar and pestle (so it sticks to the chips better). Heat 5 to 6 inches oil to 350 degrees F in a heavy pot. Stack up the tortillas and cut into 6 even pieces. Working in batches, sprinkle into the hot oil and cook, stirring so they don&#39;t stick together, until puffed and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and place on a rack over a tray. Season with salt immediately.

Butter 2 (9 by 5 by 3-inch) loaf pans, using the heaping tablespoon of the butter. Cream the remaining butter and the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer on low speed until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. In a separate mixing bowl, beat together the egg yolks with the vanilla until light and frothy. With the electric mixer on medium-low, gradually add the egg yolk mixture to the butter and sugar mixture and mix for about 4 minutes. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. With the electric mixer on medium speed, alternately add the flour mixture, a third at a time, and the egg whites, a third at a time, to the butter and egg mixture, beating for 2 minutes between each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as you mix. Add the lemon zest during the last 2 minutes of mixing. Divide the batter equally between the pans. To 1 of the cakes, add the crumbled pralines and the rum to the batter and gently stir to mix evenly; leave the other plain. Bake the plain cake for about 1 hour, the praline cake for about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Both should be golden when done and firm to the touch. The cakes can be stored by wrapping them in waxed paper, then plastic wrap, then in foil. They do not need to be refrigerated. In a heavy saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, salt and condensed milk. With a wooden spoon, stir until the sugar dissolves.

Submerge in the water by weighting down with another bowl. Let stand until the husks soften, about 1 hour. Drain well and pat dry. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning once, until browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add the onion to the fat in the skillet and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the cilantro, chili powder, cumin, salt, and cayenne. Return the chicken to the skillet and add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover. Cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Cool until easy to handle. Discard the skin and bones and coarsely chop the meat. Transfer to a medium bowl. Meanwhile, let the cooking liquid stand off the heat for 5 minutes. Skim off and discard the fat on the surface. Return the skillet to the stove and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced to a thick glaze, about 20 minutes. Scrape the glaze onto the chicken, then add the cheese. To make the tamales, place a corn husk on the work surface. Spread about 3 tablespoons of the Classic Cornbread batter in a 2 to 3-inch square area in the center of the husk. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the chicken in the center of the batter and top with about 1 tablespoon of the batter. Fold the sides of the husk to enclose the batter (the tamale is now about 2 1/2 inches wide). Fold over the ends of the husk so the tamale is about 3 inches long. Place the tamale, smooth side up, on the work surface. Using kitchen twine, tie up the tamale with kitchen string, gift-box fashion. Repeat with the remaining husks, batter and chicken. (You may have some husks left over since you soaked more than you needed, in case some got torn.) Stand the tamales up, side by side, in a steamer inserted in a large pot. Add enough water to the pot to barely reach the bottom of the steamer. Cover tightly and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low. Steam the tamales until the batter is firm (open a tamale to check), about 1 hour. (The tamales can be made up to 8 hours ahead, cooled, and refrigerated. Steam over boiling water for 15 minutes to reheat.) Serve hot, with the Salsa Roja passed on the side. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over high heat. Add the tomatillos and cook just until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain. Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat until very hot. Cook the chiles, turning frequently, until they turn a darker shade, about 3 minutes. Do not burn them. Transfer to a plate and cool. Cut open and discard the seeds and stems. (Wear plastic gloves if your hands are sensitive, and do not touch your eyes or other delicate parts of your body until you wash your hands well.) Puree the tomatillos, chiles, tomato sauce, onion, and garlic in a blender or food processor. Season, to taste, with salt. Cool completely. (The salsa can be prepared up to 3 days ahead, covered, and refrigerated.) Whisk the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl to combine. Make a well in the center. Whisk the buttermilk, eggs, and oil in another bowl until the eggs are well combined.

Stir vigorously to add fresh oxygen to the mixture. This will form a stiff consistency more like a stiff dough than a batter. This firm texture is important for ripening levain, because a dense rather than loose levain creates delicious sour bread without an overpowering tangy bite. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly and let stand in a cool to moderate (about 70 degrees) draft-free place for 8 to 10 hours. The levain should have doubled in volume. The texture will be somewhat light, with many tiny bubbles throughout. Do not let the levain stand for longer than 10 hours, or the yeast will become exhausted and not raise the final dough. Learn more about the levain starter, including how to maintain and nourish the chef, in Dan Lieder&#39;s book \Bread Alone. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 9740,&quot;Crepes with Smoked Salmon and Lemon-Herb Sour Cream 1 cup quick mix flour (recommended: Wondra) 1 cup milk 1/3 cup cold water 3 eggs, beaten 4 tablespoons melted butter, plus more for pan Pinch kosher salt 1 cup sour cream or creme fraiche 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1/4 cup minced dill 2 tablespoons snipped chives 2 tablespoons chopped capers Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ounces smoked salmon Caper berries, for garnish, optional Instructions: In a medium bowl, add all of the crepe batter ingredients and whisk together until smooth. Expect the batter to be thinner than normal pancake batter. Refrigerate the batter for at least 30 minutes. When ready to make the crepes, lightly brush a 6 to 8-inch crepe pan or small nonstick skillet with melted butter and put over medium-high heat. Ladle a few tablespoons of batter into the center of the hot pan. Lift the pan, removing it from the heat, and swirl so the batter coats the bottom of the pan in an even layer that&#39;s as thin as possible. If you have a few holes in the crepe, you can add a bit more batter to those bald spots to cover them. If there is excess batter in the pan, simply pour it back into the batter bowl. Return the pan to the heat and cook until the edges crisp and the batter loses its shine, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Using a nonstick spatula, flip the crepe and continue cooking on the other side, another 30 to 45 seconds. If making crepes in advance, you can either slide the cooked crepes onto a cookie sheet and keep warm in a 200 degree F oven, or stack on a plate, putting waxed paper between each layer to prevent sticking while you continue with the remaining batter. When ready to serve, heat 1 crepe in a pan and add some of the filling, warming slightly. (If you imagine your crepe to be divided into quarters, you only want to add filling to the bottom corner in order to fold it properly. The crepe should be folded in half (like you would an omelet) and then again into a neat triangle (like a piece of pie). If you want more filling, crepes can be either rolled or folded in half.) Combine the sour cream or creme fraiche, lemon zest, lemon juice, dill, chives, and capers, in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper, to taste. To serve, put a piece of smoked salmon in the bottom corner of a warmed crepe, folding in half (like you would an omelet) and then again into a neat triangle (like a piece of pie).

Stir to dissolve the yeast and allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes. Using a sieve or strainer, \sift\ about half of the flour over the yeast mixture and blend until smooth with your hands. Add the salt, pepper and honey and mix to blend. Sift in the remaining flour and mix to blend. Lightly flour a cutting board or flat surface. Turn the pizza dough onto the floured area and knead for 3 to 5 minutes. The flour should feel smooth and the ingredients fully integrated. Add the dough to a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it \rest\ in a warm place until it has doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Press gently on the dough and turn it onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts, rolling each quarter into a loose ball. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow the dough to \rest\ for an additional 15 minutes. Flatten each ball, 1 at a time, and roll into a 6-inch round. Make the pesto: In a medium bowl, add the broccoli rabe, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and salt and the paprika to taste; stir to combine. Heat a large saute pan over high heat and add the broccoli. Keep the heat high, allowing it to brown and char on the edges. When the broccoli rabe is tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, remove from the heat and allow it to cool. Put the broccoli rabe on a cutting board and finely chop. Transfer to a bowl. Put the garlic through a garlic press and add to the bowl. Stir in the Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons of the olive oil and the basil leaves. Taste for seasoning. Cook the mushrooms: In another saute pan, over medium heat, add the mushrooms and a tablespoon of the olive oil. Season with salt and garlic powder, to taste. Cook until they release their water, 8 to 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a cast iron skillet, large enough to hold a pizza round, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, shut the heat off under the skillet and add 1 of the pizza rounds. Use a spatula to press gently on the top of the round to keep it relatively flat as it cooks. When you see it is slightly brown on the underside, season the top lightly with salt and pepper and flip the round to its second side. Season with salt and pepper. Repeat with remaining dough. Finish the pizzas: Arrange all of the browned rounds on baking sheets and layer with the mozzarella slices, broccoli rabe pesto and a sprinkling of mushrooms. Bake in the oven for a few minutes until the cheese melts. Season with salt and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 9749,&quot;Bean Cassoulet with Fennel Spiced Chicken and Roasted Vegetables 12 medium Brussels sprouts 2 medium red onions 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 medium parsnips 3 medium carrots 3 celery stalks, peeled Finely ground sea salt 1/4 cup Fennel Spice Rub, recipe follows 1 (4 pound) chicken plus 2 bone-in chicken breasts 2 to 3 garlic cloves, smashed 1/4 pound pancetta, cut into strips about 1/2-inch thick and 1-inch long, optional 1 pound giant white beans, such as Corona, precooked or canned with liquid 1 cup fennel seeds 3 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons white peppercorns 3 tablespoons grey salt Instructions: Trim the Brussel sprouts by removing the tough outer leaves and stems. Halve lengthwise. Cook the Brussel sprouts in a cast iron casserole or oven-proof skillet in boiling salted water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Peel the onion, cut through the stem into 6 equal wedges, and trim any ragged tops. Wipe dry the casserole dish and heat 1/4 cup oil in it. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the onions. While the onions are cooking, halve the parsnips lengthwise, then in bite-size wedges and add to the onions. While the parsnips and onions are cooking, cut the carrots and celery in the same manner as the parsnips and add to the vegetables already cooking in the casserole dish. Continue cooking the vegetables until lightly browned on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes, turning as needed. Add the cooked Brussels sprouts to the dish. Season with salt, to taste. Cook until all the vegetables are well browned, about 10 minutes, turning as needed. Remove the vegetables to a bowl and season with 2 tablespoons of Fennel Spice Rub to coat. Remove the vegetables from the casserole dish and set aside. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the chicken into bone-in serving pieces (2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, and 8 half pieces of breast). Heat the remaining 1/4 cup of oil in the casserole dish over high heat. Season the chicken pieces well on both sides with the remaining Fennel Spice Rub. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the chicken pieces skin side down, in batches if necessary. Cook until the chicken is dark brown on all sides, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the dish. Tilt the pan and pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat. Reduce the heat to medium, add the garlic and pancetta, and cook until golden, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the beans and their liquid into the casserole dish with the pancetta. Bring to a simmer. Add the reserved vegetables and the chicken, skin side up. Roast, uncovered, until the chicken is fully cooked and the surface is nicely browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let rest at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before serving warm. Put the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a heavy pan over medium heat. Watch carefully, tossing frequently so the seeds toast evenly. When light brown and fragrant, pour the seeds onto a plate to cool. They must be cool before grinding, or they will gum up the blades. Pour the seeds into a blender and add the salt. Blend to a fine powder, shaking the blender occasionally to redistribute the seeds. Store in a tightly sealed glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 9750,&quot;Shrimp Pad Thai 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided 1 tablespoon garlic, minced 1 tablespoon ginger, minced 16 large shrimp, peeled and deveined 1 egg, lightly beaten 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon fish sauce 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon red crushed pepper flakes 1 teaspoon brown sugar 7 ounces rice noodles, soaked in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes then drained 1/2 cup bean sprouts 3 scallions, sliced 1 cup freshly chopped cilantro leaves 1 lime, zested and juiced Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a wok or a large frying pan.

Put the bacon in a cold pan over medium-high heat, flipping three-quarters of the way through cooking, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and reserve the fat. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with some of the reserved fat and set aside. In a big bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and some salt. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, buttermilk and 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat to a uniform color. Chop 10 slices of the bacon coarsely into roughly 1/4-inch pieces. Finely chop the remaining 2 slices and set aside. Quickly but gently fold the liquid mixture into the dry mixture. (It should be a loose batter, not a dough. If not, add just a tad more buttermilk or even some cream.) Then, fold in the coarsely chopped bacon. Divide the batter among the muffin cups in the prepared tin and bake until the tops are golden and a toothpick comes out somewhat clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool for 7 minutes, then turn them out upside-down so they develop a nice thin crust on the baked edge. Cool to just warm or room temperature before frosting, another 7 to 10 minutes.

In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and butter. When the butter foams, add the onions and season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes, stirring only occasionally until they get golden. Let cool. Tear 2 pieces of aluminum foil that are large enough to wrap the fish in. Layer them, 1 sheet on top of the other. Fold up all sides of the foil so that it resembles a little aluminum boat. Into the boat pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and spread it around. Next, lay the potatoes in the boat in 1 layer, making sure they make contact with the oil. Season them with salt and pepper. With a sharp knife make slashes in the flesh of the fish about 1 1/2 inches apart, almost to the bone, and season with salt and pepper. Repeat on the other side of the fish. Lay it on top of the potatoes. Spoon the Mojo Verde on top of the fish. Lay the tomatoes on top of that, then spoon a little more Mojo Verde on the tomato slices. Next spoon on the caramelized onions. Pour the wine around the fish. Fold up the foil to seal, set it on a sheet pan, and roast for about 1 hour or until cooked through. Remember that cooking times can vary significantly, depending on the thickness and type of fish, but it can be kept warm and retain its moisture for up to 30 minutes if kept wrapped.

Mix the milk with the eggs in one; mix the flour with the seasoned salt, paprika, cayenne and 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper in another; and put the meat in a third. Then have 1 clean plate at the end to receive the breaded meat. Work with 1 piece of meat at a time. Sprinkle both sides with salt and black pepper, then place it in the flour mixture. Turn to coat. Place the meat into the milk/egg mixture, turning to coat. Finally, place it back in the flour mixture and turn to coat (dry mixture/wet mixture/dry mixture). Place the breaded meat on the clean plate, then repeat with the remaining meat. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. Drop in a few sprinkles of flour to make sure it&#39;s sufficiently hot. When the butter sizzles immediately, you know it&#39;s ready. (It should not brown right away; if it does, the fire is too hot.) Cook the meat 3 pieces at a time until the edges start to look golden brown, about 2 minutes each side. Remove the meat to a paper towel-lined plate and keep warm by covering lightly with another plate or a sheet of foil. Repeat until all the meat is cooked. For the gravy: Put the skillet with the grease back over the heat. When the grease is hot, sprinkle the flour evenly over the grease. Using a whisk, mix the flour with the grease, creating a golden-brown paste. Add more flour if it looks overly greasy; add a little more grease if it becomes too pasty/clumpy. Keep cooking until the roux reaches a golden brown color, about 5 minutes. Pour in 3 cups of the milk, whisking constantly. Add the seasoned salt and black pepper to taste and cook, whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Be prepared to add more of the remaining milk if it becomes overly thick. Be sure to taste to make sure the gravy is sufficiently seasoned. Serve the steaks with the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 9791,&quot;Pepper Crusted Tenderloin with Mushroom Cream and Roast Asparagus 3/4 pound asparagus, trimmed at stem (fat stems should be peeled down a bit as well) Extra-virgin olive oil, for liberal drizzling plus 2 tablespoons Salt 4 (1-inch thick, 3 to 4-inch round) beef tenderloin steaks, about 1 pound total 4 teaspoons coarse black pepper, a rounded palm full 2 tablespoons butter 6 white mushroom caps, very thinly sliced 1/4 cup cognac or brandy, eyeball it 3/4 cup cream, eyeball it Chopped parsley leaves or chives, for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Spread asparagus on small baking sheet and dress with a liberal drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt. Roast the spears in a hot oven until tender and ends are crisp and slightly brown at edges, about 10 to 12 minutes. Asparagus should remain bright green. Take the chill off the meat then pour the black pepper onto a small plate. Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high to high heat. When oil smokes, press each steak into pepper to coat then place peppered side down in the skillet. Sear and caramelize the meat 3 to 4 minutes, turn and cook 2 minutes more for rare, 3 minutes for pink. While the meat cooks, heat a small skillet over medium flame and melt then butter. Add mushrooms and lightly saute them for 4 to 5 minutes. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper and add cognac or brandy to the pan. Be careful of flare ups. You may want to add the liquor off the stove top then return the skillet to the heat. Reduce the liquid by half, cooking off the alcohol and concentrating the flavor, then stir in the cream and warm it through. Reduce heat a bit and let sauce thicken 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over meat and serve with asparagus alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 9792,&quot;Asian-Style 3 Bean Salad 1 pound string beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 (10-ounce) bag frozen shelled edamame (green soy beans) 3 tablespoons canola oil 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 1/4 cup 100 percent fruit apricot preserves 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed 2 scallions, sliced Salt Instructions: Put the string beans and frozen edamame into a steamer basket and steam them for 4 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Brush the parchment with 2 tablespoons of the melted butter. Using a 2-inch round cutter, make the center of each bagel half larger. Save the cutout pieces. Brush the cut side of the bagels and bagel cutouts with 2 tablespoons of the melted butter. Place the bagels cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Line up the cutout pieces down the center of the baking sheet cut-side down as well. Using the palm of your hand, press the bagels into the baking sheet. This will help make sure they are touching the baking sheet so the eggs won&#39;t seep out before they&#39;re cooked. Brush the tops of the bagels and cutouts with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Crack an egg into each bagel hole. Season the eggs with salt and pepper. Bake for 11 to 14 minutes, depending on how you like your eggs; 11 minutes will give you a runny yolk, while 14 minutes will give you a fully cooked yolk. For the hollandaise: In a small saucepan, melt the butter until sizzling. Put the egg yolks in a blender and turn on a low speed to allow them to combine. While the machine is running, slowly begin pouring the hot butter into the blender in a thin, steady stream. Once all the butter is in, immediately begin adding the lemon juice. Check the blender to make sure the sauce is still liquidy and moving easily through the blades. If not, add a little more juice and give it a stir and then blend again. Add the cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Transfer to a serving pitcher and cover with foil until serving. For the garnish: Transfer the bagels and cutouts to a serving platter. Arrange the salmon around the bagels and garnish with the red onions, chives and capers.

In a food processor, combine the chopped herbs with the garlic, crushed red pepper, a generous pinch of salt and enough olive oil to make a paste. Brush the paste on the outside of the pork rib roast. Toss the onions with olive oil, and salt, and place in the bottom of a roasting pan. Add the thyme, bay leaves and 2/3 of the cider. Place the pork on top of the onions and place in the preheated oven. Roast the pork at 425 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until the pork has developed a lovely brown crust. Check the pork, stir the onions and cider if they are starting to burn. Add more cider when the level starts to go down. Lower the oven to 375 degrees F and roast for another 30 to 35 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reads 150 degrees F. If the crust on the pork starts to get too dark, cover it with foil. Remove 1 1/2 cups of the cider from the bottom of the roasting pan and reserve for the applesauce. Let the pork rest for at least 15 minutes before carving. When ready to carve remove the pork from the bone and cut the loin into thin slices. Serve with the onions braised in cider and Chunky Applesauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan large enough to accommodate the apples. Add the apples and saute over medium-low heat until the apples start to soften. Add the reserved cider, apple cider and cinnamon and cook over low-medium heat until most of the cider has evaporated and the apples are cooked and very soft. Add the heavy cream and walnuts and cook until the cream has reduced by half. The end result should be a very chunky, sweet/savory applesauce. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</li></ol><p>&quot; 9797,&quot;Famous BBQ Sauced Pork Sandwich 1 tub of Curly&#39;s Famous Pulled Pork BBQ.(YUM!)

If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. For the court bouillon: Combine the garlic, dill, 4 cups of water and wine in a large stock pot. Squeeze the lemon juice into the pot, then add the lemon half. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a gentle boil over direct heat. For the artichokes: Cut off the top inch and most of the stem close to the base. Trim the tip of each outer leaf with kitchen shears. Trim the bottoms of the artichokes and prick with a fork or paring knife. Place over indirect heat to take on some smoke while the poaching liquid comes to a boil, about 5 minutes. Place the artichokes in the liquid, bottoms up. Cover and simmer until a knife inserted into the bottom of the artichoke gives no resistance, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette: Whisk all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Serve the artichokes with the vinaigrette on the side for dipping. (Alternatively, you can poach the artichokes over medium-high heat on a stovetop.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 9828,&quot;Cherry Pie with Ice Cream Sprinkle Balls 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces<br> 1/4 to 1/2 cup ice-cold water<br> 1 egg plus 2 tablespoons water, for egg wash<br> 2 pounds jarred sour cherries 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 3 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> Vanilla ice cream, for serving<br> Sprinkles, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the pie crust: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, salt, sugar and butter; pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse until the dough is crumbly yet holds together when squeezed. Divide into two disks, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. For the cherry filling: In a large bowl add the sour cherries, sugar, salt, cornstarch and lemon juice. Mix to combine. Set aside. On a floured surface, roll the chilled disks of pie dough into 14-inch rounds; wrap one around a rolling pin and gently place it (without stretching) in a 9-inch pie pan. Using kitchen shears, trim the edges to fit over the sides of the pie pan. Fill with the cherry pie filling. For the lattice crust, cut the remaining rolled pie crust into 1-inch strips?you should have enough for 10 strips. Lay 5 parallel strips on top of the pie filling, leaving 1/2 inch between each strip; fold back every other strip. Place one long strip perpendicular to the parallel strips. Unfold the folded strips over the perpendicular strip. Take the strips underneath the perpendicular strip and fold them back. Lay down a second perpendicular strip next to the first one and, again, unfold the folded parallel strips. Repeat with the remaining perpendicular strips. Crimp the strips of dough down and under to seal the crusts together. Brush the crust with egg wash. Place the pie in the oven and bake until the crust is golden, 1 hour. Remove to a wire rack and let cool for 1 hour before serving.

Add the vegetables to the pan and turn the heat to medium high. Toss the vegetables, by gently moving the pan back and forth over the flame. Cook the vegetables for 3 to 4 minutes, or until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a serving bowl and serve immediately. To blanch and refresh vegetables: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it generously. Fill a large bowl with ice water, and put a colander or strainer in it. Add the vegetable to the boiling water and cook, uncovered, until crisp tender, or the desired degree of doneness. Scoop the vegetable from the water and immediately put them in the ice water, to stop the cooking and set their color. Cool and drain, and use as desired. When blanching a mix of vegetables, don&#39;t cook them together since they may not all cook at the same time. Start with the lightest colored or mildest flavored vegetable, and blanch and refresh each vegetable, one after the other, until cooked as desired. Variations: Toss vegetables together in a medium bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 9833,&quot;Peanut Butter and Jelly Bars 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) salted butter, melted and slightly cooled, plus more for greasing 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 cup finely chopped salted peanuts 1 cup firmly-packed dark brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 cups crunchy peanut butter 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup grape jam or chunky preserves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut a piece of foil 9 by 20-inches. Butter the corners and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Line the pan with the foil so that the excess hangs over at each of the short sides of the pan. Whisk the flour in a medium bowl with the baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk in 1/2 cup peanuts. Put the melted butter in a large bowl and use a rubber spatula to stir in the sugars. Stir vigorously, mashing the brown sugar lumps with the spatula, so that the mixture is well combined and creamy. Using the rubber spatula, stir in the peanut butter, again making sure the mixture is well combined. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Fold in the flour mixture until just combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Press the back of a spoon or a curved rubber spatula into the batter to make little wells all over the batter, making sure not to push down to the bottom of the pan. Spoon the jam into the wells, making sure the jam is distributed evenly across the pan. Use a knife to pull the jam through the peanut butter mixture-it won&#39;t exactly ribbon, you will end up with some chunks of jam throughout. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup chopped peanuts over the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a non-jammy spot comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool completely on a rack, about 1 hour. When the bar has cooled completely, place a lightweight cutting board or a baking rack over the top of the pan. Flip and set on the counter. Gently pull the pan from the foil and the foil from the pan to remove. Gently peel the foil off the bar. Place another lightweight cutting board on top, and flip the bar right-side-up.

Immediately remove from the heat, add all the flour at once, and stir hard with a wooden spoon until all the flour is incorporated, about 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, to evaporate some of the moisture, about 2 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer or mix by hand), and mix at medium speed. With the mixer running, and adding 1 egg at a time, add 3 of the eggs, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add another egg and mix until completely incorporated. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Using a pastry bag fitted with a star tip (use a large size, like #12), pipe the dough onto the sheet pan in rows of 2 1/2-inch rings. Freeze them for 30 minutes to make them easier to pick up. Meanwhile, make the Glaze: Stir together the powdered sugar and milk in a small bowl. Pour the vegetable oil into a large pot to a depth of 2 inches and heat to 325 degrees F. Working in batches, lift the dough circles off the sheet pan and carefully slip them into the oil. Fry, turning once, until lightly browned. Drain the crullers on a brown paper bag; then dip them completely in the glaze. Let the crullers cool and set before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9854,&quot;Sauteed Broccoli Rabe Kosher salt 1 bunch broccoli rabe, tough, non-leafy stems removed Extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic, smashed Pinch crushed red pepper flakes Instructions: Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of well salted ice water. Drop the broccoli rabe into the boiling water and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the boiling water and plunge immediately into the ice water. Once cool remove from the ice water and let dry. It can be used right away or held for future use. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil. Add the smashed garlic and crushed red pepper and bring to medium heat. Once the garlic is brown and aromatic, remove it from the pan and discard. It has fulfilled its garlic destiny. Add the broccoli rabe and toss around in the oil to heat up and season. Remember the broccoli is already cooked. Add more oil, if needed and season with salt if needed (it probably will). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 9855,&quot;Smoked Salmon Spread 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish, drained 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 pound (4 ounces) smoked salmon, minced Instructions: Cream the cheese in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until just smooth. Add the sour cream, lemon juice, dill, horseradish, salt, and pepper, and mix. Add the smoked salmon and mix well. Chill and serve with crudites or crackers. If you can find it, I prefer Norwegian salmon; it&#39;s drier and less salty than other smoked salmon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9856,&quot;Skirt Steak with Bok Choy 1 pound piece skirt steak, cut into 3 equal pieces 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce<br> 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger<br> 2 teaspoon sesame oil<br> 1 teaspoon red chili flakes<br> 6 scallions, sliced, whites and greens kept separate<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 3 heads baby bok choy, halved and rinsed<br> 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced 1 cup mayonnaise<br> 2 tablespoons sriracha Instructions: Put the skirt steak into a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag.

Pour two-thirds of the marinade over the steak, reserving the remaining marinade. Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible. Set aside and let marinate for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the mayonnaise and sriracha in another small bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons each of olive oil and butter in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade and sear on each side until cooked to the desired temperature, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove the steak to a cutting board to rest while you cook the vegetables. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1/2 tablespoon butter to the skillet. Add the bok choy, cut side-down, and sprinkle the mushrooms around the skillet. Allow to brown and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the bok choy, whisk the reserved marinade to combine and pour into the skillet and let reduce slightly. Remove from the heat. Slice the steak against the grain. Transfer the bok choy to a platter with any sauce that is in the skillet, top with the shiitake mushrooms, arrange the sliced steak along the edges, and garnish with the reserved scallion greens.

(If you like a more country feel, you can wait and break them up in the pan later with a wooden spoon.) Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. When hot, add the onion and saute 5 to 6 minutes, or until soft. Add the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until you see the color start changing. If you&#39;d like to make the sauce spicy, add the red pepper flakes. Add the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer about 30 minutes. (If you did not puree the tomatoes, use a wooden spoon to break them into pieces while they cook.) Strive for balance in the consistency of the sauce: It has to be fluid, but it should not look overly wet. Add the basil and remove from the heat. Toss with just-cooked pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 9886,&quot;BBQ Chicken 3 pounds chicken leg quarters 2 1/2 cups barbecue sauce (recommended: Butch&#39;s Smack Your Lips Mild BBQ Sauce) 1/4 cup seasoning rub (recommended: Butch&#39;s Smack Your Lips Magic Dust) 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar Instructions: Put the chicken in a non-reactive bowl. Combine 2 cups barbecue sauce, the seasoning rub, and vinegar and pour it over the chicken. Cover and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Preheat the oven or smoker to 225 degrees F. Remove the chicken and shake off the excess marinade. If cooking in an oven, place on a rack over a pan to catch drippings. If cooking in a smoker, place directly on a rack. Use your favorite wood, I use New Jersey hickory. Cook until the internal temperature, using an instant-read thermometer, registers 165 degrees F, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove the chicken from the rack and place it in a foil pan. Brush with the reserved 1/2 cup barbecue sauce, cover with foil, and place back in the oven or smoker for 1/2 hour. Remove the chicken from the pan and finish off on a grill. Using medium to hot flame, grill until the outer skin is crisp and marked (a few minutes should do it). Serve immediately. You may also place chicken in a clean foil pan and cover with foil to keep warm until serving. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec]&quot; 9887,&quot;Double-Herb Roasted Chicken and Potatoes 1 (5 1/2-pound) roasting chicken 3 tablespoons chopped fresh or 1 tablespoon dried oregano, divided 2 garlic cloves, minced 8 fresh basil leaves Nonstick cooking spray 8 red potatoes, quartered lengthwise 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Remove and discard giblets and neck from chicken. Rinse chicken with cold water; pat dry. Trim excess fat. Starting at neck cavity, loosen skin from breast and drumsticks by inserting fingers, gently pushing between skin and meat. Combine 2 tablespoons chopped oregano and garlic cloves.

Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the scallion whites and all but about 1/4 cup of the scallion greens and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook, stirring, until tender and aromatic, about 1 minute. Add the broth, cashew milk, potatoes, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a generous amount of pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender and crumble when pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. The cashew milk will look curdled when it first comes to a boil and for a few minutes after it simmers, but it will smooth out when the soup is pureed. While the potatoes cook, dry the reserved potato peelings well. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potato peels flesh-side down in a single layer and fry, turning once or twice, until crispy and golden brown, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to paper towels using a slotted spoon, then immediately season with salt and a generous dusting of smoked paprika and transfer to a plate or rack\u2014the longer they stay on towels, the quicker they de-crisp. When the potatoes are done, turn off the heat and use a slotted spoon to scoop one-third to one-half of the chunks into a bowl. Puree the remaining mixture in the pot with an immersion blender until smooth. Alternatively, allow the mixture to cool slightly and then puree in batches in a regular blender. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Stir in the nutritional yeast and vegan sour cream until smooth. Return the potato chunks to the soup, crumbling them a bit as you drop them into the pot. Heat over low heat until hot; it doesn\u2019t have to come to a boil. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper as needed. Divide the soup among shallow bowls and top each with some vegan cheddar, a dollop of sour cream and some reserved scallion greens. Crumble the potato peels over the tops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 9889,&quot;Red Chicken Chilaquilles 6 cups chicken stock 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste 1/2 teaspoon pepper, plus more to taste 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 onion, peeled and diced 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 2 cups red salsa, recipe follows 2 handfuls corn chips 1 bunch cilantro leaves washed and diced 1/4 onion diced 1/4 cup grated Cotija cheese 1/4 cup Crema, recipe follows, or sour cream 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion, thinly sliced 4 cups diced canned Italian plum tomatoes 1 cup tomato juice 2 garlic cloves, peeled 1 large jalapeno cl, stemmed, seeded if desired 1 teaspoon salt 1 cups heavy cream 1/4 cup buttermilk Instructions: Bring the stock to a boil in a deep skillet.

Soak bread triangles 30 seconds per side, until well-coated. In a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat. When butter bubbles, carefully transfer brioche triangles to pan and cook 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Arrange triangles and ice cream decoratively on 4 dessert plates, standing toasts on their edges. In another skillet, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat. In a small bowl, toss banana slices with lemon juice and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar. When butter bubbles, add bananas and cook, turning them once, until each side is glazed light brown, about 3 minutes per side. In a small pan warm remaining 1/2 cup rum and pour over bananas. Heat one minute, then carefully light with a long match. Shake pan until flames subside and pour over toasts and ice cream. Sprinkle with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Cava]&quot; 9903,&quot;Smoked Pork Butt \Kyle Style<br> 2 cups cider vinegar 1 cup corn oil 1 can pineapple concentrate 1/4 cup salt (non-iodized) 1/8 cup paprika 1/8 cup Worcestershire sauce 1/8 cup white pepper 1 chicken bouillon cube (dissolved in 2 tablespoons water) 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup salt (non-iodized) 1/3 cup black pepper 1/4 cup paprika 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon chili powder 1 tablespoon celery salt 1 tablespoon hickory salt 1 tablespoon msg, optional 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground sage 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons yellow mustard 1 tablespoon honey 1 pork butt (approximately 5 pounds) Apple and hickory wood chips, soaked in water for at least 30 minutes, for smoking Charcoal, for smoker Instructions: Marinade: Place all ingredients in a non-reactive bowl and whisk together. Rub: Place all ingredients in a container with a lid and shake well. Glue: Whisk ingredients together and place in a squeeze bottle. Pork: Reserve 1 cup of marinade and set aside. (The reserved marinade will be used to base the pork during the cooking process.) Inject a little marinade into the pork butt in numerous places. Place pork in a resealable plastic bag and cover with remaining marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours. Remove the pork from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Cover pork with a light coat of the \glue\ mixture to help the rub stick. Sprinkle generously with rub, making sure to work it into the meat. Prepare a smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F and add the apple and hickory wood chips to the lit charcoal. Place pork on smoker. Be careful not to over-smoke. After 2 hours, baste pork with reserved marinade and return it to the smoker for 1 hour. Baste again and return to smoker for 1 more hour. Repeat 1 more time, with the basting and smoking for 1 more hour. Remove pork from smoker, wrap in aluminum foil and return to smoker until the pork has an internal temperature of 200 degrees F. (Alternatively, you can finish cooking the pork in a low oven preheated to 250 degrees F). When the pork has reached 200 degrees F, remove it from the heat and let stand for approximately 15 to 20 minutes before slicing or pulling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9904,&quot;Plum Cake 6 tablespoons butter, cubed, at cool room temperature, plus more for the pan 1 large egg 3/4 cup sifted self-rising cake flour 1/2 cup firmly-packed light brown sugar 12 ounces ripe Italian prune plums, pitted and quartered (about 12 plums) Whipped cream or ice cream, for serving, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter the bottom and sides of a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie pan. Use a fork to beat the egg with 1/4 cup water in a small bowl until combined. Put the flour and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the mixture is uniform. Drop in the butter cubes, toss with a fork to coat in the flour mixture and pulse until the mixture is crumbly and moist, about 8 long pulses. Add half of the egg mixture and process about 15 seconds. Add the remaining egg mixture and process an additional 15 seconds. The batter should be homogenous but not too thick. (Don&#39;t worry if it curdles a bit because of the brown sugar. It won&#39;t affect the batter.) Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Very lightly press the plums into the batter. Bake until the plums are tender and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly and serve with whipped cream or ice cream if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9905,&quot;Stick-to-the-Ribs Barley and Currant Cakes 6 tablespoons olive oil, divided 1 tablespoon garlic 2 shallots, minced 2 sprigs thyme 1 cup barley 1 quart chicken stock 1/2 cup currants 3 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves 4 tablespoons whole wheat flour 1 egg, beaten Instructions: In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add 3 tablespoons oil.

Place the rice in a large bowl and fill with fresh, room temperature water. Swirl your hand through the water and the rice; the water will go cloudy. That&#39;s all the starch that we&#39;re trying to remove in order to have individual grains of rice, not the sticky kind that&#39;s popular in Chinese and Japanese cuisine. (According to traditional Indian wisdom, this also makes the rice easier to digest because so much of the starch has been removed). Once you&#39;ve swirled your hand around for a minute or so, pour off the water, taking care not to lose any rice. Repeat this washing process until the water runs clear. Usually, this takes 3 or 4 changes of water. Fill up the bowl 1 more time and let the rice soak for 30 minutes. At the end of 30 minutes, drain the rice. Fill a medium saucepan with 1 3/4 cups water, add a pinch of salt, and bring to a boil. Add the rice, stir, and wait until the water comes back to a full boil. When it does, turn the heat down as low as it can go, and then cover. Cook for 15 minutes. At the end of 15 minutes, cut the heat. Let the rice sit for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork; you should see that every grain of rice has grown a little longer and is separate from its brothers and sisters. Well done! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 9914,&quot;Southern Greens 5 tablespoons margarine 1 turnip bulb, chopped 1 medium yellow onion, chopped 1 (8 to 12-ounce) ham hock, chopped Pinch salt 1 tablespoon sugar 2 pounds turnip greens, washed, stemmed and chopped 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes Pinch freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon horseradish Pinch wasabi powder 1 tablespoon ham base 2 cups water Instructions: In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, add the margarine, onion and ham hock. Saute until onions seem translucent, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients, except the turnip greens, and mix together. Add the turnip greens and cook on medium heat, partially covered until tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. When the greens and turnips are tender it&#39;s time to eat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 9915,&quot;Apple Clafouti 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch salt 3 eggs plus 1 egg yolk 1 cup whole milk 1/4 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Pinch salt 1 1/2 cups peeled and diced Granny Smith apple (about 1 large apple) 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon grappa, Calvados, or other fruit brandy Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting 1/3 cup creme fraiche Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Make the batter: Sift the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt into a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, egg yolk, and milk until well blended. Add about 1/3 of the egg mixture to the flour mixture and whisk until smooth, then gradually incorporate the remaining egg mixture. Whisk until well blended. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you prepare the apples. Cook the apples: With the tip of a knife, scrape the vanilla bean seeds from the pod into an ovenproof 10-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet. Add the pod and the butter and cook over moderately high heat until the butter turns nut brown. Add a pinch of salt. Add the apples and cook, stirring often, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean pod and discard. Sprinkle the apples with the sugar, reduce the heat to moderately low, and cook until the apples are almost cooked through and the sugar has melted and is coating the apples in a light syrup. Add the grappa or other brandy off the fire while pouring, place back on the fire, wait for flame to die down, the swirl the pan briefly. Spread the fruit evenly in the skillet. Working quickly, pour batter evenly over the fruit. Bake until the edges of the clafouti are puffed and browned and the center is set, about 15 minutes. Put some confectioners&#39; sugar in a sieve and generously dust the surface of the clafouti. Serve warm directly from the pan with a dollop of creme fraiche. Michael&#39;s Notes: If you plan to serve individual clafoutis from mini pans, heat the pans in the oven until quite hot, about 5 minutes, then divide the cooked fruit among the pans, top with the batter, and bake. Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the pans. To make a cherry clafouti, use 1 1/4 cups pitted cherries. Substitute 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest for the cinnamon and orange flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) for the grappa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>&quot; 9916,&quot;Roast Rib of Beef with Port and Stilton Gravy 8 pounds (3.8kg) beef fore rib (4 rib joint) (recommended: Scotch or Black Welsh) 2 onions, peeled, cut into 1/3-inch (1 cm) rounds 2 tablespoons garlic oil 1 1/2 teaspoons maldon salt or 3/4 teaspoon table salt 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper Port and Stilton gravy, recipe follows 2 tablespoons fatty juices, reserved from the roast beef tin 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1/2 cup (125ml) ruby port 1 tablespoon cooked onions from the roast beef tin, optional 2 cups (500ml) organic beef stock, \fresh\ from a shop-bough tub 4 1/2 ounces blue cheese (recommended: Stilton) 1 teaspoon red currant jelly Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Extra juices from the roast beef tin and carving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220c/ gas mark 7).<br> Take your beef out of the refrigerator to bring to room temperature, which could take 1 hour or possibly more.<br> Put the onion slices into a roasting tin and sit the beef on top of them. Use the onion slices as props to help the rib sit up on its bones in an \L\ shape. Smear the oil over the white fat of the rib, and sprinkle with the salt, thyme and cayenne pepper. Cook according to the beef&#39;s weight and your taste. I like my beef nice and underdone, so I give it 15 minutes per pound (33 minutes per kg) which means, for a joint this size, a cooking time of about 2 hours unless the beef is straight out of the refrigerator, in which case, add another 20 minutes or so. If you want medium beef, give the joint, from room temperature, 20 minutes per pound (44 minutes per kg), and if you like well-done meat, 30 minutes per pound (66 minutes per kg). As for feeding capacity, this size of joint will certainly look over a big tableful, from 8 with lots of leftovers to 14, without the definite promise of them.<br> When the beef comes out of the oven, remove to a carving board and allow it to rest in a warm part of the kitchen under a tent of foil for 30 minutes before carving; or just leave, tented in its tin, for the same time. Do not start clearing up the tin, even if you have taken the beef out, however, as you will need some of the pan juices and onions for the gravy. In a saucepan over low heat, add 2 tablespoons of the fatty juices from the beef tin. To make a roux, whisk in the flour, and then the port. Keep heating and whisking over a fairly gentle heat, until thick and bubbling. If you want to blend the onions into the stock, do so now. Be sure to avoid adding any blackened onions. Put the onions in a blender with the beef stock and mix together. Or leave the stock just as it is, straight out of the tub. Take the saucepan off the heat, and gradually whisk in the beef stock. Whisk in the blue cheese and red currant jelly. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Pour in any juices that remain in the tin or on the cutting board. Transfer to gravy boat and serve with the beef. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 9917,&quot;Chocolate-Dipped Clementines 7-8 medium clementines 4-ounce dark chocolate bar (60-70% cocoa), finely chopped Sea salt Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Cut a lengthwise slit in each plantain and set on a baking sheet. Bake until the flesh is thoroughly soft and oozing through the slit, 40-50 minutes. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, make the stuffing: Peel, core and finely chop 3 of the quinces. Peel and core the remaining 2 quinces and cut each into 8 wedges. Drop the wedges into a bowl of cold water to cover and squeeze in the lemon juice. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over moderate heat. Add the brown sugar and cook, stirring, until the sugar has melted. Add the finely chopped quinces, ginger, orange zest, cloves and cinnamon and stir to combine. Add 1 cup of water and continue cooking until most of the liquid is gone, about 15 minutes. Add the orange juice and rum and cook until almost all of the liquid is gone, about 5 minutes. Drain the quince wedges and add to the pan. Reduce the heat, cover and cook until the wedges are just soft, about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the walnuts and let cool. (The stuffing can be make a day in advance and refrigerated). Make the dough in a food processor with a paddle attachment: Peel, trim and discard any tough ends from the plantains. Combine the plantains and salt and pulse until a smooth puree is formed, or mix until just blended. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate about 2 hours. To assemble: Roll 2 tablespoons of the dough between your palms to form a ball. Line the bottom of a tortilla press with a small plastic bag and place the ball of dough in the center. Place another plastic bag over the dough and press to form a 3 1/2inch circle. Place a quince wedge on half of the dough circle and top it with a teaspoon of the sauce. Fold over to enclose the quince and press the edges to seal. Place the stuffed empanadas on a platter and chill at least 30 minutes. Heat the vegetable oil to 375 degrees F. Gently drop the empanadas into the hot oil and fry until golden, about 6 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 9919,&quot;Glazed Baked Ham with Vanilla Maple Sauce 1 ready-to-eat ham of your choice, whole or half, bone-in or boneless 1 cup Dijon mustard 1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Cut away any skin and trim the fat to a thickness of 1/4 to 1/2-inch. Place the ham, fat side up, in a shallow roasting pan lined with foil (since the sugar in the glaze can burn). As a rough guide, roast a fully cooked ham for about 10 minute per pound. A whole ham should cook in 2 1/2 to 3 hours, a half ham in 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Check the temperature after the minimum time with an instant-read meat thermometer. It should read 130 to 140 degrees. If not yet at the desired temperature, check it every 15 to 20 minutes. Serve the ham as is after a 20 to 30 minute rest or proceed to glaze it. To glaze: when the ham is warmed through, raise oven temperature to 425 degrees. Remove the ham from the oven and score the surface of the fat to make a crisscross grid. Spread glaze generously over the surface of the ham. Bake about 20 minutes, basting with pan juices a few times. Remove the ham from the oven, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes before carving Serve with Vanilla Maple Sauce &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 9920,&quot;Ponche Creme 4 large pasteurized eggs Finely grated zest of 1 lime 1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk 3/4 cup best-quality dark rum 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, plus more for topping 1 teaspoon Angostura bitters Instructions: Whisk the eggs and lime zest in a large bowl until well combined and smooth, about 30 seconds.

Put the tomatillos, onion and both chiles in a medium heavy saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil until the tomatillos turn an olive-green color, about 10 minutes. Drain and transfer the tomatillos, onions and chiles to a blender. Add the garlic and cilantro and blend until smooth. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix the Mexican crema and heavy cream together in a small bowl and season with salt. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the tortillas until golden but still pliable, about 10 seconds per side, using more oil if needed. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Place the tortillas on a work surface. Divide the shredded chicken evenly among the tortillas and roll up each like a cigar.

Heat the palm oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the vegetable puree. Cover, lower the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the herring, crayfish, bouillon and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; the stew should thicken a bit. Meanwhile, peel the yams and potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes. Place the cubes in a colander and rinse under cold running water. Stir the potatoes and yams into the stew and cook over medium heat, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Stir in the broth; the stew will be thin and soupy. Simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes and yam are fork-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash about 80 percent (not all) of the yam and potato into the broth so you have a thick porridge with some chunks.

Stir it around to combine and allow to warm. Next, add the vanilla extract and cinnamon sticks. Stir the mixture around and heat it up until it&#39;s hot but not boiling. Add the egg yolks to a medium bowl and whisk them vigorously until slightly lighter in color, about 2 minutes. Remove the cinnamon sticks from the half-and-half mixture and discard. Grab a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture and drizzle it very slowly into the yolks, whisking constantly. This will temper the egg yolks so that they don&#39;t scramble when they&#39;re added to the pan. Add another ladle of the hot liquid, and when it&#39;s mixed in, pour the egg mixture slowly into the pan with the half-and-half mixture, stirring with a spoon. Stir and cook it until the mixture is thick and coating the spoon, for 2 minutes or so. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a clean glass bowl and strain the custard. Don&#39;t worry if it looks a little lumpy. Add the heavy cream to the bowl and stir to combine. Finally, whisk in the ground cinnamon, and then cover the bowl and refrigerate until completely cool. Pour the cooled mixture into an ice cream maker and process according to your machine&#39;s instructions. When it&#39;s finished churning, it will still be in the soft-serve stage. Transfer the mixture to a freezer container and place in the freezer until it&#39;s frozen firm, for several hours. For the cinnamon crisps: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Place the tortillas on a baking sheet and brush both sides with the butter. Sprinkle both sides of the tortillas generously with the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Bake until golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes, and then allow them to cool to room temperature.
