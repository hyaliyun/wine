cups freshly grated Parmesan Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging 2 eggs, beaten 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: For the risotto: In a medium saucepan, heat the chicken broth to a simmer. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shallots to the butter, cooking until fragrant and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the Arborio rice and lightly toast, stirring to coat in the butter and shallots. Add the white wine, continuing to cook while stirring until the wine is absorbed. You should be able to run your spoon through the risotto and have the indentation stay. Using a ladle, add enough of the warm chicken broth to cover the rice, stirring constantly over medium heat until the broth is completely absorbed. Repeat the process 3 more times, adding the broth in stages while continuing to stir. Once all of the chicken broth has been added and the rice is tender, add the peas, lemon juice and lemon zest and stir to combine. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan, mozzarella and season with salt and pepper. Cool the risotto by spreading it evenly over a sheet tray. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. Once the risotto is cooled, form the mixture into burger-size patties, about 1-inch thick. Set up a dredging station with the flour in one dish, beaten eggs in another and panko breadcrumbs in another. Dip the rice patties into the flour, then into the eggs and finally coat them in the panko breadcrumbs. In a large skillet, heat 1/2-inch vegetable oil over medium heat until a pinch of panko sizzles when dropped in the oil. Working in batches of 2 to 3, fry the risotto cakes until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side (use a fish spatula under the cake and the back of a fork on top to help stabilize while flipping). Transfer to a wire rack, which will help them stay crispy. Season with salt and they are ready to serve. Cook&#39;s Note: This is a great way to use up leftover risotto. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 8684,&quot;Crpes with Flambed Peaches 4 store-bought crpes 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus melted butter for brushing<br> 2 peaches, pitted and sliced 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup dark rum Juice of 1/2 lime Instructions: Lightly brush a crpe with melted butter and warm in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, 15 to 30 seconds. Flip and fold over twice to form a triangle, then transfer to a serving platter. Repeat with the remaining crpes. Saut the peaches in the butter and sugar in the same skillet over medium-high heat until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.<br> Carefully add the rum to the skillet and use a long lighter to ignite. Cook until the alcohol burns off, then stir in the lime juice. Spoon the peaches over the crpes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 8685,&quot;Godiva Chocolate Pecan Caramel Cookies 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 ounces chopped dark chocolate (recommended: 2 (1.5 ounce) Godiva Dark Chocolate Bars) 1/2 cup chopped pecans 18 pieces chocolate or vanilla caramels (recommended: Godiva chocolate or vanilla caramels) Instructions: Special Equipment: 1 (2-ounce) ice cream scoop, 1 or 2 half-sheet pans, parchment paper Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, cream the sugars and butter together until fluffy, using either an electric mixer or by hand. When mixture is light and fluffy, add egg, and beat to incorporate. Add vanilla and beat to incorporate. In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add dry ingredients slowly to butter mixture and mix to thoroughly combine until a soft dough is formed. Stir in chopped chocolate and pecan pieces until blended. With a (2-ounce) ice cream scoop, scoop cookie dough and place 1 caramel into the bottom of each cookie, using extra dough to cover the caramel so that it is not visible. Lightly press each cookie onto the sheet pan or baking sheet, in rows of 3 by 4. Repeat until no dough remains. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cookies are golden on top. More baking time may be needed, depending on your oven. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 8686,&quot;Asian Mandarin Pork 1 package of Curly&#39;s Sauceless Pulled Pork 1 1/2 tablespoons peanut oil 1/4 cup chicken broth 1/4 cup water 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon sherry 2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion 1 clove garlic, minced 1 teaspoon white sugar 1 teaspoon ground ginger Salt and Pepper to taste 1 can of Mandarin oranges Instructions: Heat oil in a large skillet or wok. When hot, combine the chicken broth, water, soy sauce and sherry. Stir together and add the green onion, garlic, sugar, ginger, salt, pepper. Bring all to a boil. Add Curly&#39;s Sauceless Pulled Pork and lower heat, cover and let simmer until pork is warm. Check occasionally to make sure sauce is not thickening too much. If needed, add more water. Add mandarin oranges two minutes before ready to plate. Serve over steamed or fried rice.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8687,&quot;Coconut Chicken Lollipops with Tropical Ketchup and Anaheim cl Sauce 1/2 cup fresh tangelo juice (or orange juice) 1/3 cup olive oil 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 6 cloves garlic, crushed Salt and ground black pepper 1 dozen chicken drumettes, bones frenched 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cloves garlic, sliced thinly 1 white onion, sliced thinly Salt 2 cups ketchup 1 sweet ripe mango, peeled and chopped Juice of 1 orange Juice of 1/2 lemon Ground black pepper Splash rice vinegar 10 Anaheim chiles 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 white onions, chopped 2 habanero peppers, chopped 3 to 4 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 eggs, lightly beaten 1 1/2 cups thinly shaved dried, unsweetened coconut flakes Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: For the marinade: Combine the tangelo juice, olive oil, lime juice, oregano, cumin, garlic, and some salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken, toss to coat, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate the chicken in the fridge overnight. For the tropical ketchup: Heat a large skillet over medium heat and the olive oil. Add the garlic and onions and a good pinch of salt. Saute the onions until completely translucent, about 15 minutes. Add the ketchup, mango and citrus juices. Lower the flame and cook, stirring every once in a while, until reduced and thickened. Transfer the mixture to a blender and puree. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and vinegar (adding a little more lemon or orange juice if needed) and refrigerate until cold. For the cl sauce: Char the Anaheim peppers over an open flame or on the grill. Roughly chop the peppers and transfer to a blender. Heat a large skillet, add the olive oil and heat over medium heat. Add the garlic, onions and habanero peppers and saute, stirring, to caramelize the onions. Transfer the mixture to the blender with the charred Anaheim peppers. Puree everything until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Transfer the sauce to a bowl and stir in the mayo a little at a time until it tastes just right. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Remove the chicken from the marinade. Coat in the flour, then the beaten eggs, finishing in the coconut. Fill a deep skillet halfway with vegetable oil and heat over medium-high to 350 degrees F. Fry the chicken lollipops until golden on all sides and cooked through. Drain on paper towels and season with a little salt. Serve the chicken with the tropical ketchup and Anaheim cl sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 8688,&quot;Radicchio Salad with Black Olive Vinaigrette and Almond Crusted Goat Cheese 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon honey 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup chopped black olives 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper 1 teaspoon dried oregano 5 ounces plain goat cheese 1/2 cup finely chopped almonds 1/2 teaspoon paprika 3 small heads radicchio Instructions: Vinaigrette: In medium bowl, whisk vinegar, mustard, honey and oil. Add olives, salt, pepper and dried oregano. Combine thoroughly and refrigerate until chilled (about 1 hour). Goat cheese: Slice goat cheese and roll 1-inch balls. Combine almonds and paprika in a shallow bowl. Roll balls in paprika almond mix until completely covered on all sides. Salad: Rinse radicchio and cut into narrow slices. Put sliced radicchio into large bowl and slowly add vinaigrette dressing, coating the salad entirely. Top with goat cheese balls as you would with croutons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8689,&quot;Sweet Soul &#39;Taters 4 to 5 medium sweet potatoes, washed 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 cup milk<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 eggs<br> Butter, for greasing dish 1 cup packed brown sugar 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter<br> 1 cup chopped pecans<br> Instructions: For the sweet potatoes: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the sweet potatoes until fork-tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the potatoes and raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Slice the sweet potatoes in half and let them cool slightly. Scoop out the innards, place into a large bowl and give them a good mash, leaving some texture to the potatoes--no need to mash completely. Add the granulated sugar, milk, salt, vanilla extract and eggs. Stir and mash the mixture around--you don&#39;t want them to be perfectly smooth. Butter a 2-quart baking dish, pour in the potatoes and smooth out the top. For the topping: Combine the brown sugar and flour in a bowl. Throw in the butter and with a pastry cutter, cut together until thoroughly combined. Add the pecans and combine until the topping is nice and crumbly. Sprinkle the crumb mixture all over the top of the potatoes. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 8690,&quot;The Big Marc 1 cup warm water 1 1/2 ounces fresh yeast 1/2 cup sugar 4 ounces unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing 4 eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 4 to 5 cups all-purpose flour 8 ounces shredded Cheddar 1 ounce freshly cracked black pepper 1 head garlic Olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 1/2 cups ketchup 5 ounces vodka (about 2/3 cup) 2 1/2 pounds 80/20 ground beef, formed into six 6-ounce patties<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil 3 ounces melted unsalted butter 48 slices bread and butter pickles Instructions: For the buns: Stir the water, yeast and sugar together to activate the yeast. (You can tell when the yeast is activated-little bubbles will have formed, which will take a minute or two.) Add the melted butter and 3 of the eggs and mix until incorporated.<br> Add 4 cups flour and the salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Mix together on low speed, then stop and add the wet ingredients. Continue to mix until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. You may want to add a little bit more flour as you mix; the dough should be sticky but workable. Transfer the dough to a bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel, place in warm area and let rise until the dough has doubled in size, about 30 minutes.<br> After the dough has proofed (risen), turn it out onto a lightly-floured countertop and knead in the Cheddar and black pepper. Try not to overwork the dough; once the cheese is mixed in you can stop. Cut the dough into six equal portions and shape them into round balls. Place on a buttered baking sheet and flatten them with your hand.<br> Cover and let rise again in a warm area until they have doubled in size, about 30 minutes more. When they are almost doubled in size, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl and brush the tops of the rolls with the egg. Bake until golden brown, rotating halfway through, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. For the ketchup: Turn the oven down to 250 degrees F. Cut the garlic in half crosswise and sprinkle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Wrap in foil and roast until soft, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the garlic from the skins and mix into a paste. Reserve 1 tablespoon for the ketchup, and use remaining garlic for another use.<br> Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard and roasted garlic in a bowl. Add the ketchup and vodka and mix until incorporated. This will keep for up to 6 days in the refrigerator.<br> For cooking the burgers: Heat a skillet over high heat or heat an outdoor grill to high. Sprinkle the patties with salt and pepper. Coat with the oil and sear or grill until medium rare, 3 to 5 minutes per side.<br> Slice the buns in half horizontally and brush with the melted butter. Toast in the skillet or on the grill. Arrange 8 pickle slices on each bottom bun and place a hamburger on top. Slather 1 to 2 tablespoons of spiked ketchup over the burger and set the top bun in place. Serve immediately with the remaining spiked ketchup on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 8691,&quot;Cinnamon Swirl Sour Cream, Maple Cream Cheese, Strawberry and Bacon Breakfast Cupcake 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 8 ounces salted butter 1 cup sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups sour cream 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1/2 cup brown sugar, loosely packed Maple Cream Cheese Frosting, recipe follows Maple-Glazed Turkey Bacon, recipe follows 1 pound cream cheese 4 tablespoons maple butter or creamed honey 4-ounces strawberry jelly 1/4 cup fresh strawberries, hulled, and finely diced Maple-Glazed Turkey Bacon, recipe follows 1 (12-ounce) package turkey bacon 1/4 cup maple syrup 1 cup maple sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a mini cupcake or muffin pan with 24 mini cupcake liners or a regular-size cupcake or muffin pan with 9 cupcake liners. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a medium-size bowl. Set the bowl aside. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and then add the vanilla and one egg at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Turn the mixer to the lowest speed, and add the flour mixture and sour cream, alternating between the 2, beginning and ending with the flour. Mix the cinnamon and brown sugar together in a small bowl and fold by hand into the batter. Do not fully mix into the batter, it should be swirled in. Fill 24 mini cupcake liners 1/2-full with batter and bake for 30 minutes or fill 9 regular-size cupcakes 3/4-full with batter and bake for 32 minutes, or until golden and baked through. Cool the cupcakes completely. To assemble: Generously frost the top of each cupcake with the maple cream cheese mixture. Chop the maple-glazed turkey bacon into a fine dice and divide evenly among the cupcakes, sprinkle over the frosting. Sprinkle the maple sugar on top of the bacon to resemble \sand. Whip the cream cheese and maple butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until fully incorporated. Fold in, by hand, the jelly and fresh strawberries. Put the frosting into a pastry bag and cut 1/2-inch off the tip. Cook the bacon on the stove top in 2 nonstick skillets coated with olive oil spray, over medium heat, turning once, making sure the bacon is fully cooked. Turn the heat down and divide the maple syrup between the 2 skillets, drizzle the syrup over the bacon. Continue to cook, turning the bacon often, watching closely that the syrup does not burn. You want the bacon to be coated with the syrup and caramelized, but not soggy. Let cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8692,&quot;Rice and Black Bean Pilaf 1 cup brown rice, uncooked 2 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 small onion, diced (1 cup) 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons fresh chopped oregano or 1 teaspoon dried 1 stalk celery, finely diced 1 large carrot, finely diced 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon dried chili flakes 1 (15.5 ounce) can low-sodium black beans, drained and rinsed 2 teaspoons finely chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Place rice and chicken broth in a saucepot and bring to a boil.

When the yeast is dissolved, add 3 cups of the flour, then 2 teaspoons salt, and mix on medium-low speed. While mixing, add up to 1 more cup of flour, or just enough to make a soft dough. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth, sprinkling it with the flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to the bowl. When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured board and knead it by hand a dozen times. It should be smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl and turn it to cover it lightly with oil. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, make the garlic oil. Place 1/2 cup olive oil, the garlic, thyme, and red pepper flakes in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook for 10 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn&#39;t burn. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. (Be sure your oven is clean!)<br> Dump the dough onto a board and divide it into 6 equal pieces. Place them on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and cover them with a damp towel. Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes. Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Press and stretch each ball into an 8-inch circle and place 2 circles on each parchment-lined sheet pan. (If you&#39;ve chilled the dough, take it out of the refrigerator approximately 30 minutes ahead to let it come to room temperature.) Brush the pizzas with the garlic oil, and sprinkle each one liberally with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the pizzas evenly with Fontina, mozzarella, and goat cheese. Drizzle each pizza with 1 tablespoon more of the garlic oil and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the crusts are crisp and the cheeses begin to brown.<br> Meanwhile, for the vinaigrette, whisk together 1/2 cup of the olive oil, the lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. When the pizzas are done, place the arugula in a large bowl and toss with just enough lemon vinaigrette to moisten. Place a large bunch of arugula on each pizza and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 8696,&quot;Broccoli and Almond Salad 2 cups torn mixed salad greens 1/4 cup small broccoli florets 1/4 cup red pepper strips 1/4 cup cherry tomatoes 2 Tbsp. shredded carrots 1 Tbsp.

Mix on medium to low speed until thoroughly combined. Turn speed to low and slowly add the flour in 1-cup increments. Push down dough on sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Allow each cup to thoroughly mix in before adding the next cup. Add last cup slowly. Dough should begin to pull away cleanly from the sides and bottom of the bowl. If it doesn&#39;t, slowly add more flour until it does. If your dough is too dry, add a little water to moisten. Once dough pulls away cleanly from the sides and bottom of the bowl, allow the dough hook to knead the dough until lightly tacky and soft, about 4 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to overnight. For the duck confit: Mix salt, both sugars and sumac in a large mixing bowl by hand until thoroughly combined. Pat dry duck legs and rub with crushed juniper berries and crushed garlic. Set legs aside. Cover the bottom of a deep-walled baking dish large enough to hold the legs in a single layer with 1 quart of the salt-sugar mixture, ensuring that the bottom of the dish is covered (add more mixture if necessary). Put half of the fresh thyme sprigs down on top of the mixture. Snugly fit the rubbed duck legs in the mixture in a single layer. Cover with any remaining garlic or juniper berries that may have fallen off during placement. Cover the duck legs with the remaining fresh thyme. Pack with remaining salt-sugar mixture until meat of the dug legs is completely covered. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours. Remove duck legs from refrigerator and gently rinse each leg over a sink running cold water. Pat dry with paper towels and set aside. Place duck legs in a pot on stovetop and cover with schmaltz. Simmer on low heat until the meat pulls easily from the bone, about 2 hours. Pull duck legs from pot and allow to cool. Reserve oil. Pull the meat from the bone and rough chop the duck leg meat. Reserve the bones. For the duck stock: Place reserved bones in a 4- to 6-quart stockpot with the carrots, celery and onion. Add enough water to cover the bones and vegetables (about 4 quarts), then add the bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring just to boil and immediately adjust heat to low. Allow to simmer on low for 3 to 4 hours. Strain off bones and vegetables, reserving the dug leg stock. For the pierogies: Cover potatoes with 1 quart duck stock or enough stock to cover. Bring potatoes to a boil, then immediately lower heat to medium. Simmer the potatoes until they are fork tender, about 20 minutes. Strain and spread on a sheet tray. Sprinkle potatoes with 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt and allow to cool. Place potatoes and chopped duck leg meat in a mixing bowl. Add 1/4 cup reserved oil from the duck leg confit and fold in green onions. Taste filling and adjust seasoning if necessary. Remove dough from refrigerator and allow to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Unwrap and quarter the dough with a bench scraper. Cover the remaining 3 quarters of dough with a towel while you work on the first quarter. Roll the dough on a floured surface into an even sheet about 1/8-inch thick. Cut out dough discs using a 3- to 4-inch biscuit cutter. Combine cornstarch and 1 cup water in a bowl. Moisten each disc with a thin layer of the cornstarch slurry. Place a heaping tablespoon of filling into the center of each disc. Gently pick up each disc by the sides, then pinch the dough around the filling. Pinch dough closed, sealing the filling inside. Place filled pierogies on a generously-floured sheet tray. Bring large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches, gently place the pierogies in the boiling water. Return water to a boil and allow pierogies to boil until floating and warmed through, 10 to 15 minutes. Pull pierogies from the water and allow to dry slightly. (At this point you may refrigerate or freeze any pierogies you aren&#39;t planning on using.) Prepare a saute pan over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil from the duck leg confit. Carefully fry the pierogies until the sides are light brown and crusty. Serve with Pierogi Sauce. For the roast tomato ketchup: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toss tomatoes with oil, garlic, salt, basil, oregano and pepper and place on a sheet tray.

Let the yeast activate for 2 to 5 minutes. Add salt and 2 cups of flour and stir until blended. Add another 1 1/2 cups of flour and blend until too stiff to stir with a spoon. Cut dough in half to get 2 (18-ounce) (1 ounce per inch) pieces. If you like a thick crust, increase the amount of dough per inch or reduce the size of the pizza to a 14 or 16-inch pie. With the dough in both hands knead (turn it inside itself so knuckles touch) to get some air pockets out and to get a round shape. Knead about 7 times. (Don&#39;t knead too hard or the dough will rip at the top). At the bottom of the dough ball seal it by twisting the dough so that it is round on top and flat and sealed on the bottom. Place the dough in a clean bowl (if dry, sprinkle with a little water), and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough sit for between 30 to 60 minutes until it almost doubled in size. Put the dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour after it rises to gain elasticity. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Put the dough on a floured surface and push down on it with your fingertips to get rid of any bubbles. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough to the size you choose. Transfer the dough to an oiled pizza pan or baking sheet. Or if you have a baking stone, sprinkle wooden pizza peel with flour, place dough on top and transfer directly to the stone. Add sauce, cheese, and toppings as desired. Keep toppings an inch away from the edge of the pie. Cook pizza for approximately 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 8716,&quot;Grilled Rack of Pork With Cabbage 1 6-pound center-cut rack of pork (not frenched) Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups julienned carrots 1 1/2cups julienned peeled celery root 3/4 cup white wine vinegar 3 cloves garlic, smashed 1 jalapeno pepper, halved lengthwise 1 bay leaf 1 sprig fresh dill 1 tablespoon sugar 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 1 small head green cabbage (about 2 pounds), shredded 1 cup hard cider 1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard Instructions: Start a day ahead: Season the pork liberally with salt, cover and refrigerate overnight.

If not, slice the brisket into 2 pieces against the grain to allow it to fit. Put a cooling rack over a baking sheet. Put the brisket on the rack with the side lined with a thin layer of fat touching the rack. Sprinkle the salt and black pepper all over the brisket, making sure to season both sides. Let the brisket come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. (Tip: This step can be done up to 1 day in advance. Refrigerate the seasoned brisket, uncovered. By letting the brisket rest in the refrigerator, the sear will be more even and golden brown.) Put a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over high heat. Add the oil and heat until shiny, about 30 seconds. Add the brisket fat-side up and sear until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the brisket over and sear the other side for another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the brisket from the pot and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium high and add the onions. Cook until just translucent, about 3 minutes. Pour the cola into the pot and scrape up any brown bits. Place the brisket back in the pot fat-side up, along with any juices that have collected around it. Bury the brisket under the onions. Add the beef stock, star anise, rosemary sprigs and bay leaf; the stock should not submerge the brisket, but come up about two-thirds of the way. Bring to a simmer and reduce the heat to medium low. Cover the pot and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Remove the lid and flip the brisket over, making sure to nestle it back into the softened onions. Cover the pot and continue cooking until the beef is tender but not falling apart, an additional 1 1/2 hours. Remove the beef from the pot and set on a cutting board. Remove the rosemary stems, bay leaf and star anise and discard. Place the pot over high heat and cook the sauce until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.

Add the vinegar, red pepper flakes, salt and black pepper to taste. Pulse it a few times then continue pulsing while adding 3/4 cup of the olive oil. Keep pulsing until the mixture is pulverized, leaving just a little texture from the herbs. Transfer to a bowl, then cover and refrigerate until you need it (you can make it up to 1 day ahead, though it&#39;s best to make it the same day). Season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add the butter and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. When it&#39;s melted and starting to brown, add a steak. Fry until medium rare, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the steak and let it rest for 3 minutes. (If you&#39;re frying more steaks, just add a little more butter and oil to the pan as needed.) Slice the steak.

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 1 cup water, the butter and salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the water is boiling. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens up and begins to create a dough ball in the center of the pan and the dough is completely pulling away from the sides of the pan, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. On low speed, add the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl well after each addition and beating until the bowl feels cool (the mixture should be very smooth and silky). Transfer the dough to a re-sealable plastic bag and cut about 1/2-inch off one corner. Using this as a piping bag, pipe the mixture into the desired shapes on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and puffed, about 40 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: These pastries can be made a day or two ahead of time and kept in an airtight container at room temperature. If they feel soggy when you take them out, pop them into a 400 degree F oven for a couple of minutes until they crisp up again. Allow them to cool before filling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 8771,&quot;Chive-and-Garlic Knots 1 1/2 tablespoons butter or stick margarine 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1 (11-ounce) can refrigerated French bread dough 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives or green onions 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese Cooking spray Instructions: Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat.

Combine all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add shortening and butter. Using a pastry blender, cut in the shortening and butter until the mixture resembles course meal. Drop by drop, add the cold water. Mix in with the fingertips, not hands, as the palms will warm the dough. Continue mixing water in until the dough begins to hold together without being sticky but not crumbly. Divide dough into 2 pieces and place 1 piece of dough in plastic warp. Press down to form a disk. This will make rolling out easier after chilling. Lightly spray a deep 9-inch pie pan with cooking spray. Roll out second piece of dough and place in pie plate, allowing the excess pastry to hang over the edge. Lightly brush sides and bottom of crust with egg wash. Chill in refrigerator for 10 minutes before filling. Makes pastry for 9-inch double-crust pie. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Filling Preparation: Peel, quarter, and core apples; cut into 1/4-inch slices (should have 6 cups). Toss with the lemon juice in a bowl. In a separate bowl combine sugars, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, pour over the apples and toss to coat. Whisk together egg and bourbon. Fold into apple mixture. Spoon apple filling into the chilled pastry shell; cut butter into very small pieces and sprinkle over the apples. Roll out remaining pastry. Cut slits in pastry to allow steam to escape. Lightly brush egg wash around edge of pie. Cover pie and trim overhang. Turn edges under flush with the rim; crimp all around to make a stand-up edge. Bake pie at 425 degrees F for 40 minutes, or until top is golden brown and juices are bubbling up. Remove from oven and sprinkle with vanilla sugar, if desired.

Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium and add the potato slices a few at a time so they don&#39;t stick together. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender and the onions are golden but not brown, about 10 minutes. Place a strainer over a bowl in your sink and transfer the potatoes and onions to drain; reserve the oil. Whisk the eggs, milk, salt and pepper together in a large bowl. Drain excess oil off of the potato mixture. Add the potatoes and onions to the egg mixture and combine until they are completely mixed in. Set the bowl aside for about 15 minutes to let the potatoes release some of their starches into the eggs. Heat 3 tablespoons of the reserved olive oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high for 1 minute. Add the egg-potato mixture, rotating the skillet in a circular motion to distribute it evenly. Lower the heat to medium-low and shake the pan a few times to prevent sticking (by shaking the pan, you ensure that the eggs and potatoes release from the pan bottom). Cook the tortilla for about 5 minutes or until the potatoes on the bottom start to turn golden brown. Place the skillet in the oven and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until almost set. Remove from the oven and place a large flat plate on top of the skillet and invert the skillet. The tortilla should come right out. Add a tablespoon of the reserved olive oil to the skillet and slide the tortilla back in to cook the other side until it is golden-brown, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat off and set the skillet aside until the tortilla cools to room temperature. Transfer the tortilla to a plate sprinkle with parsley and serve at room temperature cut into triangles or squares. *Cook&#39;s Note: The Yukon potatoes should be sliced using a mandolin. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 8777,&quot;Linguine alle Vongole 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 6 ounces thinly sliced pancetta, cut into thin strips 1 garlic clove, thinly sliced 2 pounds cherrystone clams, scrubbed 1 cup chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned 1/3 cup dry white wine 4 small dried hot chiles (1-inch) or 1 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes 14 ounces dried thin linguine 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a deep 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then saute pancetta, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 6 minutes.

Add the vanilla, salt and egg and mix well. Add the flour a little at a time, mixing well and scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition. Mix until well combined. Let chill for 30 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.<br> Split the dough into 3 pieces. Into one, knead the ground cinnamon in with your hand until well incorporated. Into the next dough piece, knead in the nutmeg. And into the last, the cloves.<br> Pick teeny tiny portions of the cinnamon dough (about the size of a jelly bean), roll them between your fingers and place on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the nutmeg and clove dough (making sure to keep track of the separate flavors) until you have the desired amount of little cookies (20 to 30 of each). Bake until crisp, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Next, make the butterscotch cookie coating: In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the butterscotch morsels and 1 tablespoon heavy cream in 30-second increments, stirring every 30 seconds, until the butterscotch is melted. A touch more cream can be added if necessary. Add the corn syrup and very gently fold the mixture until it&#39;s a thin, liquid consistency, only heating the mixture for an additional period of 15 seconds or less.<br> Using a fork or slotted spoon (or, if you can use them, chopsticks work well), dip your cookies in the butterscotch mixture to lightly coat them (make sure you keep track of which flavor is which throughout--don&#39;t mix them up). The butterscotch creates delicious little pockets of butterscotch sauce while protecting the cookies from getting too soggy in the hot liquid panna cotta. Try to place them somewhere where the excess can drip off of the cookies a bit. Place the coated cookies in the freezer to harden, making sure not to mix up the different flavors!<br> Get out whichever 4 glasses you would like to present your dessert in (this recipe made enough for four 8-ounce stemmed sundae cups that we used). Wine glasses, martini glasses, tumblers, Irish coffee mugs--any of these work, but, depending on size, the layer size will vary! The Irish cream panna cotta will be the bottom layer, so the first to make. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the heavy cream and vanilla. Gently bring to just a boil, then immediately remove from the heat. Sprinkle the gelatin over the cream and whisk well until the gelatin is completely dissolved and no lumps remain, at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, then add the Irish cream liqueur and stir well.<br> Divide the liquid among your 4 glasses and carefully place them in the refrigerator for 5 to 6 minutes to slightly set up. Get your cookies out of the freezer. Take out your panna cotta and add 5 to 6 of the coated nutmeg spice cookies to the layer (up to you!) and then return the glasses to the refrigerator to set up completely (will take up to 45 minutes). The next layer will be the brown sugar maple panna cotta layer. In a small saucepan over medium heat, gently bring the heavy cream, brown sugar, maple extract and vanilla to just a boil. Immediately remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatin until completely dissolved and no lumps remain, at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Making sure that the Irish cream layer is set up, divide the brown sugar maple liquid among your 4 glasses. Return to the refrigerator for 5 minutes to set up, then add your coated cinnamon spice cookies. Chill for 45 minutes to set up completely. The final (top) layer will be the honey panna cotta. Heat the heavy cream and honey in a small saucepan over medium heat until it comes to just a boil. Remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatin until dissolved completely and no lumps remain, at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Whisk in the milk.<br> Making sure the other layers are completely set, divide the honey liquid among your 4 glasses. Let set up for 5 minutes, then add your coated clove spice cookies. Let the final layer set up for at least an hour.<br> We garnished each serving with a gingersnap cookie for a beautiful, rich holiday dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 8793,&quot;Berry Waffles 3 tablespoons unssalted butter 1 cup flour 1 teaspoon baking powder Pinch of baking soda Pinch cinnamon Pinch of salt 1/4 sugar 1/2 cup yogurt 1/2 cup milk 1 egg, lightly beaten 1 cup frozen blueberries not thawed Instructions: Preheat waffle iron and read manufacturer&#39;s instructions.

In a liquid measuring cup, add the water, yellow mustard and egg and whisk together. Add the wet ingredients and the coconut oil to the dry ingredients and stir to form a ball. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and knead for 7 to 10 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the hook once or twice. Form the dough into a ball and transfer to an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let sit on the counter until the dough has puffed up by about half, about 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a floured countertop and divide into 4 pieces (or 8, if using regular-sized hot dogs). For the flowers: Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. Flatten each piece of dough and roll it all the way around a hot dog. Cut each dough-wrapped hot dog crosswise into 6 pieces and arrange in a flower design on the baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow to proof in a warmish place for 30 minutes (they should be a little jiggly). Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl and brush each flower with the egg wash, then sprinkle with the mustard seeds. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes and eat warm with Chinese hot mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 8809,&quot;Sartu di Riso 1 pound Arborio rice (2 1/3 cups) 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br> 1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 dried bay leaf<br> 3 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano<br> 4 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 8 ounces sweet Italian sausage or sweet Italian turkey sausage<br> 1 clove garlic, chopped<br> 1 shallot, sliced<br> 2 sprigs basil<br> One 2-inch piece Parmigiano-Reggiano rind<br> One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> 3 tablespoons whole milk, at room temperature<br> 7 tablespoons fine breadcrumbs<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 8 ounces ground sirloin or ground dark turkey meat Olive oil, for frying<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup frozen peas, thawed<br> One 8-ounce ball fresh mozzarella, diced<br> Instructions: In a large saucepan combine the rice, chicken broth, 1 1/4 teaspoons of the salt and the bay leaf. Stir and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring once, until the rice is still slightly undercooked but the liquid is absorbed, 8 minutes. Pour the rice into a large bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Stir in 2 1/2 cups of the cheese and 3 of the eggs until well combined, and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a medium nonreactive saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove the sausage from the casing and break into small, bite-size pieces. Add the sausage to the hot oil and cook until browned, breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon as it cooks. Using a slotted spoon, remove the sausage to a medium bowl and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, shallots and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Cook, stirring constantly until fragrant and the shallots are soft, 1 minute. Add the basil, cheese rind and tomatoes, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the basil and cheese rind. Add 2 cups of the sauce to the reserved sausage and set aside. Meanwhile, in a separate medium bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs, the milk and the remaining egg with a fork and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes to thicken. Stir in the oregano, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Using your hands, mix in the beef, until just combined. Heat 1/2-inch of olive oil in a medium straight-sided pan. Scoop 1-tablespoon mounds of the mixture into damp hands and roll into uniform balls. When the oil is hot, fry the balls in 2 batches, turning them as needed with a slotted spoon to brown the balls evenly, about 4 minutes. When golden brown and crispy all around, remove the balls using a slotted spoon to the bowl with the sausage and sauce. Continue with the remaining balls, and then toss to coat evenly in the sauce. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using 1 tablespoon of the butter, grease the inside of a Bundt pan or a 3 1/2-quart Dutch oven, making sure to coat it very well. Dust the inside of the pan with 3 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs. Make sure it is evenly coated and there are no bald spots. This is very important to prevent sticking. Add the peas and diced mozzarella to the meat and sauce, and toss gently to incorporate. Spoon two-thirds of the rice mixture into the prepared bundt pan. Using damp hands, press the rice evenly over the bottom of the pan and 2 1/2-inches up the sides and middle of the pan. Spoon the meat filling into the well of rice and press gently to make sure it is evenly packed. Spoon the remaining rice over the filling and, using damp hands, press the rice evenly over the filling, being sure to press the rice on top into the rice along the edges to seal. Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs and dot with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter. Bake until lightly browned on top, 45 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes. Place a plate large enough to cover the top of the pan over the pan. Using heat-resistant pads or a towel, invert the sartu onto the plate. Carefully lift the pan off of the rice, shaking gently if needed. Warm the remaining sauce and fill the opening in the middle of the molded rice with the sauce to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 8810,&quot;Almond Meringues 3 large egg whites Pinch fine salt 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 3/4 cup superfine sugar 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract Instructions: Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 250 degrees F.

Add the cream of tartar and continue to beat until soft peaks form. While beating, gradually add the sugar and then continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Beat in the almond extract. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a star pastry tip and pipe 1-inch meringues onto the prepared baking sheets, about 1-inch apart. Bake until the meringues are no longer glossy and feel light and dry when picked up, about 1 hour. Turn off the oven but leave the meringues inside with the door cracked open until the meringues are completely cooled and dry, about 2 hours more. The meringues can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8811,&quot;Smothered BBQ Chicken on Texas Toast 2 pounds chicken thighs, boneless and skinless Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon canola oil 1 1/4 cups Chipotle Vinegar BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 4 slices Texas toast, brushed with butter and toasted until golden Southern White Sauce, recipe follows Pickled Red Onions, recipe follows: 2 cups ketchup 1/3 cup molasses 1/3 cup cider vinegar 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 medium clove garlic, grated 1 medium Vidalia onion, peeled, quartered and pureed in a food processer, solids strained and juice reserved (about 1/4 cup onion juice)<br> 1 medium Vidalia onion, peeled, quartered and pureed in a food processer, solids strained and juice reserved (about 1/4 cup onion juice) 1 chipotle pepper in adobo 1 to 2 tablespoons adobo sauce, depending on spice desired 1 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon lemon juice Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3/4 cup red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Red pepper flakes 1 bay leaf 1 large red onion, peeled, halved and sliced into half-moons, 1/4-inch thick 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.<br> Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat.

Lightly spray 12 cups of a nonstick mini muffin pan with cooking spray. For the crust: Place the graham crackers in a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Add the sugar and salt and pulse to combine. With the motor running, drizzle in the butter and process until the mixture resembles damp sand. Divide the mixture evenly among 12 cups of the prepared muffin tin (about 1 1/2 tablespoons for each cup) and use a shot glass or your fingers to press it evenly into the bottom and up the sides. Bake until browned and firm to the touch, about 10 minutes. Set aside while you prepare the filling. (If the crusts fell during baking, you can reform them while they are still hot with a lightly greased shot glass or the back of a lightly greased small spoon.) For the filling: Beat together the yolks and lime zest in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until the yolks have lightened in color and thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Add the condensed milk and lime juice and beat until combined. Divide the mixture evenly among the tartlet crusts in the muffin pan, filling just below the top of each crust. Bake just until the filling has set, about 6 minutes. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for about 30 minutes. Remove tarts from the pan (a small offset spatula works well here) and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour.

Add a good pinch of kosher salt, the cl flakes, fennel seeds, cayenne, breadcrumbs, and Parmesan. Mix to blend and then form the meat into small 2-inch patties. Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, shut off the heat to avoid splattering, and add the meat patties in a single layer in the pan. Take care they are spread somewhat apart so they have a chance to brown instead of steam. Put the heat back on high and brown them, turning them so they brown all around, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Touch them to make sure they are still tender and somewhat yielding in the center. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to remove them from the pan. Transfer the patties to a platter or individual plates. Use a kitchen towel to wipe clean the skillet, put the heat on medium, and add the butter. When it begins to brown, crack 2 eggs, a distance apart, into the butter. Lower the heat, season the eggs lightly with salt, and cook 2 to 3 minutes or longer, if desired. Repeat with additional eggs. Put the eggs on the patties and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 8826,&quot;Fennel and Red Onion Salad with Cran-Balsamic Dressing 1/4 cup whole berry cranberry sauce 2 tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 bulb fennel, thinly sliced by hand or with mandoline 1 small red onion, thinly sliced by hand or with mandoline 1 large or 2 small hearts of romaine, chopped Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine cranberry sauce and vinegar, whisk in olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add the fennel, onion and romaine, and toss to coat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 8827,&quot;Carrot Steamed Buns 1 cup warm water 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast<br> 6 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1 cup cake flour<br> 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for the bowl 1 1/4 pounds carrots (5 to 7 large), chopped into 1/2-inch pieces 1 tablespoon canola or olive oil<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 6 tablespoons teriyaki sauce, plus more for serving<br> 1/4 cup salted roasted peanuts, plus more for topping<br> 1 tablespoon rice vinegar<br> 6 scallions, minced, plus more for topping<br> Sriracha, for drizzling Instructions: For the steamed bun dough: In a small bowl, swirl together the water, yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar and let it sit until it becomes foamy on top, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, salt and remaining 6 tablespoons sugar. Pour in the yeast mixture and oil and mix to form a dough. Turn out onto a work surface and knead, dusting with flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.<br> For the filling: While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the carrots in a baking dish and toss with the oil and salt. (I like baking them in a high-sided dish like a casserole, so that I have room to add the other filling ingredients and then there&#39;s no need to transfer to a bowl.) Bake until tender, 30 to 35 minutes; let cool for 5 minutes. Add the teriyaki sauce, peanuts, rice vinegar, scallions and a drizzle of sriracha to the carrots and stir together. Set aside to continue to cool. It&#39;s ok if it&#39;s still a little warm when it&#39;s time to fill the buns. The filling can be made a day in advance and kept covered in the fridge. Once the dough has completed its rising time, turn it out onto a clean work surface and divide it into 16 balls. Keep the dough balls covered when you&#39;re not working with them. Working with 1 ball at a time, roll out to a 4 1/2- to 5-inch circle, fill with about 2 heaping tablespoons of filling and pinch the edges shut to seal well. Place on an individual 3-inch square of parchment paper. Space the buns out in a steamer basket 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart. (If your steamer doesn&#39;t fit all of the buns at once, do in batches.) Cover and let rise 30 more minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat (the water should come up high in the pot so it is close to the steamer). Place the steamer over it and steam the buns until light and fluffy, about 45 minutes. To serve, top with another little drizzle of sriracha and some sprinkles of peanuts and scallions. Dip in teriyaki sauce and enjoy! Leftovers can be cooled and kept in the fridge for a couple of days or in the freezer for a few months. To reheat, wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave until heated through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8828,&quot;Grilled Strip Steak 6 to 8 ounce Kansas City Steak or New York Strip Steak, about 1-inch thick Salt and pepper Softened butter, for serving (optional) Instructions: To panbroil: Heat a stove-top ridged grill pan over medium-high heat for 5 minutes.

Vegetable oil, for cooking Vegetable oil, for frying 1 Yellow Plantain 2 cups cooked beans 1/4 cup Sofrito (see recipe below) 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning 1 tablespoon sazon 1 tablespoon salt Quarter of a bunch cilantro Shredded mozzarella cheese, for serving 1 bunch green onions 7 garlic cloves Half a yellow onion Half a red bell pepper, seeded and stemmed 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Instructions: For the Shredded Beef: Cut the beef into small pieces. Add to a large pot along with the green onions and garlic. Add enough water to cover the beef. Bring to a boil, lower to a high simmer and cook until the beef is tender, about 3 hours. (Add more water as needed.) Once tender, reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid and drain the beef, discard the green onion and garlic. Shred the beef and add back to the pot. Add the Sofrito (see recipe below), sazon, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, paprika, salt, cilantro and the reserved 1 cup of cooking liquid. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Set the beef aside. For the Plantains: Add enough oil to a large saucepan so it comes up about halfway up the side. Attach a deep fat-fry thermometer and bring to 350 degrees F. Peel the plantain and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices on the diagonal. Fry batches in the hot oil until golden brown turning as needed, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. For the Beans: Add the beans, sofrito (see recipe below), garlic powder, Italian seasoning, sazon, salt and cilantro to a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring, enough for the beans to heat and the flavors to meld, about 6 minutes. For the Dough: Follow the package instructions on the bag of precooked cornmeal to make enough dough for 6 arepas (see Cook&#39;s Note). To shape the arepas, grab a portion of dough big enough to fit in your hand and roll it into a ball. Begin to flatten it like the shape and size of a hamburger patty. Add enough oil to a large skillet to just coat the bottom. Heat over medium-high. Add as many arepas as you can to skillet without overcrowding. Cook until golden, 5 minutes per side. Repeat if needed. Build the arepas: Insert a small, sharp knife into the edge of an arepa and work it slowly to open up a pocket. Once opened, stuff with some shredded beef, then some plantains, then some beans and finally cheese at the very top. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Take a big bite and enjoy! This is going to be messy but sooo delicious. Finely chop the green onions, garlic, yellow onion and pepper together. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable mixture and cook, stirring, until the onion is soft and translucent. Cool and refrigerate for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 8833,&quot;Provencal Roasted Chicken with Honey and Thyme 1 (3 to 4-pound) chicken, excess fat trimmed and giblets removed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 shallot, sliced 1 bunch fresh thyme 1 lemon, zested in large strips 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon honey 3 tablespoons water 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon honey 2 tablespoons minced shallot 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. For the chicken: Season the chicken cavity with salt and pepper, to taste. Stuff the chicken cavity with the shallot, half the thyme, and lemon zest. Set a v-rack or regular rack in a roasting pan, and brush chicken with a bit of the olive oil. Whisk the honey and remaining oil in a small bowl. Dip the remaining thyme in the mixture and use it to brush the chicken all over with the honey mixture. Season bird with salt and pepper, to taste. Tuck the wings under the back, cross the legs, and tie them with kitchen string. Place the chicken breast side down on the rack and roast until the back is golden brown, about 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and turn the chicken breast side up. Cut the string where it holds the legs together and open up the legs a bit. Baste the chicken with the pan drippings, using the thyme sprigs as a brush. Roast the chicken again until the breast is golden brown and a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 170 degrees F., 20 to 25 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a carving board, and let it rest 10 minutes before carving. For the sauce: Remove the rack from the roasting pan. Put the pan over medium-high heat, add the water, and stir with a wooden spoon to release the brown bits that cling to the pan. Strain the pan drippings into a small bowl and spoon off the fat. Whisk in the lemon juice, olive oil, honey, shallot, thyme, salt, and pepper to taste. Carve the chicken and serve drizzled with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 8834,&quot;Pesto Fried Chicken 1 3 1/2-pound whole chicken 1 cup milk 1/2 cup prepared pesto 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Cut the chicken into 8 pieces.

Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. For the eggs: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the bread on a baking sheet. Brush the bread with 1/4 cup of the olive oil. Toast in the oven until toasted and lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Heat the remaining 1 1/2 cups olive oil in a large nonstick saute pan set over medium heat. Crack 4 of the eggs into the pan making sure each egg has enough room for the white to spread out. Fry the eggs and, using a spoon, carefully baste them with the olive oil to cook the tops. Cook until the edges of the whites start to get golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining 4 eggs. Lay 2 pieces of toast on a plate and top each with a fried egg. Season the eggs with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and finish with a heaping spoonful of the Spanish pantry sauce. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8872,&quot;Pistachio Snowball Cookies 3/4 cup raw unsalted pistachios 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 2 to 2 1/2 teaspoons green gel food coloring Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350? F. Spread out the pistachios on a baking sheet and bake until toasted, 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool, then transfer to a food processor. Process until finely chopped but not ground to a powder. Transfer the pistachios to a medium bowl; add the flour and salt and whisk to combine. Beat the butter and 1/2 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and almond extracts and beat just to combine. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the pistachio mixture in 3 batches until fully combined. Scoop tablespoonfuls of dough; roll into balls. Arrange 1 inch apart on an unlined baking sheet and refrigerate 30 minutes. Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until the cookies are very lightly browned and dry to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, put 1 1/2 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar in a food processor. With the motor running, add 2 teaspoons green food coloring and process until the sugar is green; add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon food coloring, if desired, and process to combine. Remove the green sugar to a wide shallow bowl; it should feel like sand. Let the cookies cool 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then remove to a rack. Let cool 15 to 20 minutes more; they should be barely warm. (Do not roll the cookies in the colored sugar while hot or the coloring will bleed.) Break up any clumps of green sugar. Put the remaining 1 cup confectioners\u2019 sugar in a separate shallow bowl. Roll half the cookies in the green sugar to coat and the other half in the plain sugar. Return to the rack and let cool completely. Roll in the sugars again to coat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 8873,&quot;Taleggio and Roasted Grape Crostini 1/2 baguette, sliced 1/2-inch-thick on the bias (20 pieces) 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups seedless red or green grapes 6 ounces Taleggio cheese, at room temperature 1/4 cup hazelnuts, toasted and chopped Aged balsamic vinegar, for drizzling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Season with salt and bring the pan to medium heat. Cook the onion until soft and very aromatic, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool. In a large mixing bowl, combine the turkey, water chestnuts, soy sauce, cilantro, ginger, sambal if using and the cooked onions and garlic. (NOTE: Save the onion pan to cook the burgers in later!) Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to the mix--this will keep the burgers really moist! Use your hands to squish the mixture until everything is really well combined. Make, cook and eat a little tester patty to be sure the turkey is really delicious. If the seasoning isn&#39;t just right, add a little more soy or a sprinkey-dink of salt. When you&#39;re confident the burger mix is perfectly seasoned, form it into 4 equal patties. With a paper towel, wipe out the saute pan you used to cook the onion, coat the pan with fresh olive oil and bring it to medium-high heat. Add the burgers, being sure not to crowd the pan--if you need to work in batches, knock yourself out. Cook the burgers for 5 to 6 minutes on each side. The burgers should be browned and cooked through when done. (If working in batches, keep the first batch warm in the oven at 200 degrees F while cooking the second batch.) For the toppings: Mix together the mayo and sambal oelek in a small bowl. Toast the burger buns and top with the burgers.

Lower to a simmer and stir in the honey and maple syrup until well blended. Turn off heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Rinse the turkey inside and out with cold tap water. Reserve the neck and specialty meats for pan gravy. Set the turkey in the brine, making sure that the turkey is fully immersed in the brine. Place a weight on top of the turkey to make sure it is always covered with brine. Marinate for at least 4 hours to overnight, depending on the weight of the turkey, in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a shallow roasting pan, place the carrots, celery and onions. Remove turkey from brine. Mix together the butter, garlic, chopped rosemary, and sage to make a compound butter. Using your hands, loosen to the skin from the breast by gently inserting your fingers between the skin and the flesh. Rub the compound butter underneath the skin. Insert the apples, onions, and whole rosemary and sage into the cavity of the turkey. Place the turkey over the vegetables, breast-side up, in the roasting pan. Tuck the wings back and under the turkey. Using kitchen twine, tie the legs together. This will make a compact shape and will create a great presentation. Drizzle the turkey with olive oil and rub it into the skin. Roast the turkey to at least 165 degrees F in the breast, about 2 1/2 hours. If the skin gets too dark during roasting, tent with foil. Transfer turkey to a platter and allow to cool. Meanwhile, prepare the pan gravy. Tilt the pan and skim as much fat as possible off the juice with a spoon. Set the pan on 2 burners set on medium heat. Deglaze roasting pan with white wine and Madeira. Scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any brown bits. Reduce until only a quarter remains. Add the Turkey Stock, thyme and parsley. Bring to a boil and strain into a saucepan. Bring back to a boil, skim and lower to a simmer. Whisk in the beurre manie until well incorporated and continue to cook until gravy has thickened. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Heat a saucepan over high heat. When the pan is hot, add the olive oil and heat. Add the neck and giblets and cook until browned all over, about 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and deglaze with the port. Return the pan to the heat and cook until the port is almost completely evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add the carrots, onions, celery, rosemary and peppercorns. Cover with cold water by 4-inches. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and simmer for 2 hours, adding a little more water, if necessary. Skim any scum that rises to the surface of the stock and discard. Strain the stock. Use immediately, or cool and refrigerate for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 8894,&quot;French Cut Steak 1 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (1 pound) skirt steak, cut in half 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided 1/4 cup butter, divided 2 medium sweet onions, sliced 1/3 cup white wine 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/3 cup beef stock or broth Instructions: In a small bowl, combine spices and salt and pepper.

Heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the red onions, salami and soppressata and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, about 6 minutes. Add the giardiniera, oregano and the remaining garlic and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic starts browning, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Combine the toasted bread and broth mixture in a large bowl and gently mix until all the bread is moistened. Stir in the beaten eggs, provolone and parsley. Brush a 3-quart baking dish with olive oil. Add the stuffing and dot with the butter. Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes.

Add the yams, zucchini and pears. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours to marinate, (longer is better). Fire up the grill to medium-high. Put the yams, zucchini and pears on flat metal skewers. Grill for 30 to 40 minutes, basting with the marinade as they are cooking. Turn the skewers often until they are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. After they reach this stage I put them in a warm oven to stay hot. (If you have a giant grill, turn a burner down to low and just lay the kabobs there to stay hot, but not to cook any further.) Transfer the skewers to a serving plate and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8918,&quot;Smoked Salmon Souffle Roulade 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups milk 12 eggs, separated 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2 pound smoked salmon, roughly chopped 1 pound cream cheese, room temperature 1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Generously butter 2 (15 by 10 by 1-inch) baking (jelly roll) pans and line them with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Over medium heat, melt the butter in a saucepan. Whisk in the flour, cayenne, and salt. Cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring until the center bubbles. Remove from heat, and stir in the milk. Return to heat and cook 3 to 5 minutes more, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with a wire whisk. Gradually whisk in the flour mixture; beat until smooth. Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whites into the yolks, being careful not to overmix. Using rubber spatula, divide the batter between the 2 pans and spread evenly. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, until the roulade springs back when touched in the center. When completely cooled, invert the roulade sheets onto a clean surface, and discard the parchment paper. Whip together the salmon, cream cheese, and dill, until light and fluffy. Spread the salmon mixture evenly on the surface of the roulade. Place 1 of the 15-inch roulade sides in front of you. Carefully roll it toward the other 15-inch side, until the width of the roulade forms a spiral of egg and filling. Cut each roulade into 10 slices. Refrigerate if not serving immediately. Spread the roulade slices out on a greased baking tray in a single layer so that the sprial is on the top and bottom of each slice. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Reheat in a preheated 350 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Broil for 3 to 5 minutes, until lightly browned. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8919,&quot;Banana-Caramel Pudding 3 large eggs 2 tsp vanilla paste or extract 1 1/2 cups/360 ml milk 1 1/2 cups/360 ml heavy/double cream 3/4 cup/150 g sugar 1/8 tsp kosher salt 1/2 cup/115 g unsalted butter 3/4 cup/175 ml heavy/double cream 3/4 tsp kosher salt 1 cup/200 g sugar 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice 2 1/2/360 ml cups heavy cream 1/2 cup/100 g sugar 1 1/4 tsp vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, or 1/3 vanilla bean 5 bananas 4 cups/360 g vanilla wafers Instructions: To make the pudding: Whisk the eggs with the vanilla in a large bowl and set aside. Bring the milk, heavy cream, sugar, and salt to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat and whisk a little of the hot liquid into the egg mixture. Continue adding more hot milk until the eggs are tempered and the bottom of the bowl is warm to the touch and then return the egg mixture to the saucepan with the remaining milk. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk, until the pudding thickens and you can draw a clear line through the custard on the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes (don&#39;t let the custard boil--this will cause the eggs to curdle). Pour the custard through a medium sieve and into a medium bowl. Whisk to cool slightly, cover flush with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until it is completely cool, about 2 hours. To make the caramel sauce:<br> Microwave together the butter, heavy cream, and salt until the butter is melted (or melt the butter with the cream and salt in a small saucepan). Whisk to combine and set aside. Place the sugar and lemon juice in a medium saucepan. Melt the sugar over medium-high heat, swirling the pan occasionally to evenly distribute the heat, until the sugar is a deep nutty brown and smells bittersweet, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour in the butter mixture (be careful-the sauce will hiss and bubble up) and then place the mixture back over medium-high heat to return it to a boil. Turn off the heat and set the saucepan aside to let the caramel cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours. To make the whipped cream:<br> Place the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla (if using a vanilla bean, split the pod and scrape out the seeds, adding them to the cream; save the pod and place it in a jar of sugar to infuse it with vanilla flavor) in the bowl of a stand mixer (or large bowl if using a hand mixer) and whip it on medium speed until it is frothy. Increase the speed to medium-high and whip until you get stiff peaks. Refrigerate until you&#39;re ready to assemble the pudding. To assemble:<br> Peel and thinly slice the bananas and set aside (wait to slice the bananas until you&#39;re ready to assemble the dish, otherwise, they&#39;ll brown). Evenly spread 1 cup whipped cream over the bottom of a large trifle dish or punch bowl. Top with a layer of bananas and 1 cup/240 ml pudding. Place about 20 wafers in a flat layer on top of the pudding and evenly drizzle 1/2 cup/120 ml caramel over the wafers. Repeat the layering process three times beginning with the whipped cream, followed by some sliced bananas, pudding, wafers, and caramel. Finish the pudding with a final layer of whipped cream (you should have about 1 cup remaining after repeating four layers), cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. Serve in dessert bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 8920,&quot;Domino Brownies 1 box brownie mix 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1/4 cup milk 2 large eggs 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar *1 large egg white 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 13 by 9-inch metal baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. To make the brownie batter: In a large mixing bowl, combine the brownie mix, oil, milk, and eggs. Beat with a handheld electric mixer on medium speed until well combined and the batter is smooth. Sprinkle in the espresso powder, chili, powder, and cinnamon. Beat for another minute to evenly distribute. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Allow the brownies to cool in the pan completely. For the Icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, egg white, and lemon juice in a mixing bowl. Beat with the electric mixer on medium speed until it is very fluffy and the consistency of meringue. This will take about 5 minutes. Put the icing into a disposable plastic bag or use a pastry bag with a fine tip. Carefully cut off a tiny piece of the corner, making a tiny hole. To decorate the brownies: Once completely cool, cut the brownies into domino-size pieces, about 1 by 2-inches. Lay the brownies in a domino game pattern on a serving platter. Carefully, pipe small white dots and a line across the middle of the brownie so they look like domino pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 8921,&quot;Eggs with Hash Browns, Bacon and Rye Toast 1/2 pound thick-cut bacon 2 Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes Kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 onion, diced<br> 1 clove garlic, minced 2 to 3 hot cherry peppers, seeds removed and chopped<br> 1/2 small bunch chives, sliced<br> 1 tablespoon white vinegar<br> 2 large eggs<br> 2 slices rye bread<br> Butter, for the toast<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with a rack. Place the bacon on the prepared sheet pan and bake until crispy, 20 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and keep warm. Reserve some of the fat for the potatoes. While the bacon cooks, fill a medium saucepan with cold water. Add the potatoes and generously season with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Add the olive oil to a large saute pan and heat over medium-high heat. Add the onions and salt to taste and saute until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 2 minutes. Add about 1 tablespoon of the reserved bacon fat, the cherry peppers and cooked potatoes and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and toss in the chives. Keep the hash browns warm. Bring a low shallow pot of water to a simmer. Set up a small ice bath and set aside. Add the vinegar to the simmering water and reduce the heat until the water is just below a simmer and there are barely any bubbles. Crack and gently drop each egg into the water. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then transfer to the ice bath with a slotted spoon. When ready to serve, dip the eggs back into the warm water for 5 to 10 seconds, remove with a slotted spoon and gently dab on a paper towel to remove any excess water. (Alternatively, serve the eggs right away.) Toast the bread in a toaster, then spread with butter. Plate with the eggs, bacon and hash browns.

Butter half of a sheet pan crosswise with 1 tablespoon of the softened butter. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the celery and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken broth, chestnuts, sage, thyme, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and bring to a simmer. Turn off the heat and set aside.<br> Whisk the egg in a large bowl, add the bread cubes and the vegetable mixture and stir to combine. Transfer the stuffing mixture to the buttered half of the prepared sheet pan, spreading it in an even layer over just the buttered part of the pan. Dot the stuffing with 2 tablespoons butter cut into small cubes. Generously sprinkle the turkey breasts on both sides with salt and pepper and put them skin-side up on the other half of the sheet pan next to the stuffing. Rub the skin with 2 tablespoons of the butter. Combine the Brussels sprouts, bacon, olive oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Toss to coat and spread out over half of the second sheet pan. Prick the sweet potatoes all over with a fork and arrange them on the other half of the sheet pan next to the Brussels sprouts. Combine the cranberries, sugar and orange zest in a small ovenproof ceramic baking dish, then cover with foil and put on the sheet pan next to the sweet potatoes. Put the sheet pan with the turkey and stuffing on the rack in the upper third of the oven, and put the second sheet pan on the rack in the lower third. Cook 30 minutes, then remove both pans from the oven. Stir the Brussels sprouts and cranberry sauce once or twice, mashing the cranberries with the side of the spoon. Tent the stuffing with foil if it has started to brown too quickly. Rotate the pans but return them to their same racks. Continue cooking until the turkey skin is golden brown and crisp, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 160 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes more. At this point the potatoes should be tender, the stuffing browned in some areas, the Brussels sprouts browned and tender, and the cranberries softened and bubbling. (If the sweet potatoes are undercooked, take them off the pan and put them back in the oven directly on the rack to continue cooking until tender, up to 10 minutes more.) Transfer the turkey breasts to a cutting board to rest at least 10 minutes before slicing. Remove the foil from the cranberry sauce and set aside to cool. Use a fork to combine the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and the brown sugar in a small bowl. Split the sweet potatoes, fluff with a fork and stir in the butter and brown sugar mixture; sprinkle with salt. Top with the marshmallows and return to the pan with the Brussels sprouts. Put the dinner rolls on the same pan and return to the oven to warm the marshmallows and rolls, 3 to 5 minutes. Carve the turkey breasts and return them to the sheet pan with the stuffing to serve. Serve with gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 8942,&quot;Cholla Bud Pesto Kosher salt 1/2 pound bow-tie pasta 1/2 cup Cholla Bud Pesto, recipe follows 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, sliced in half 1/4 avocado, optional, diced 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro 1 cup cooked cholla buds 2 teaspoons roasted pine nuts 1 clove garlic, minced 1/4 cup queso fresco 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup olive oil Instructions: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, bring water to a boil.

Spray the parchment with non-stick spray. Place 18 marshmallows (about 4 ounces or 2 cups) in a medium bowl and set aside. Place the remaining 8 ounces of marshmallows (about 4 cups) in a large microwave-safe bowl along with the butter. Microwave on high until the marshmallows and butter are completely melted, about 1 minute, stirring halfway through. Stir to combine. Add the graham crackers and rice cereal and quickly stir them into the melted marshmallows. Immediately scrape the mixture into the prepared pan. Spray the bottom of a measuring cup with nonstick spray and use it to press the mixture into an even layer in the pan. Place 1 cup heavy cream to a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the cream until it is just starting to steam, about 1 minute. Add the chocolate chips and cocoa powder. Shake the bowl lightly to make sure the chips are completely submerged in the heavy cream. Let stand about 5 minutes. Whisk the heavy cream and chocolate together until smooth. If any chocolate isn\u2019t melted you can microwave for 10-second increments until completely melted. It\u2019s important to only microwave 10 seconds at a time so the mixture never gets too hot. Once melted set aside to cool slightly. Place the remaining 1 cup of heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer or a medium bowl and whip with a mixer or whisk until stiff peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the melted chocolate until you no longer see any streaks of white. Spoon the mousse over the graham cracker base and smooth the top to make an even layer. Cut the reserved 18 marshmallows that were set aside in half horizontally. Press 6 marshmallow halves in a row along the bottom border of the pan. Continue adding lines of marshmallows so that you have 6 rows of 6 marshmallows each covering the mousse. Cover with plastic wrap (preferably reusable) and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. When ready to serve, cut the bars into 6 long strips following the lines of the marshmallows. Then cut the strips in half so that each bar has 3 marshmallow halves on it. If desired, toast the marshmallows with a kitchen torch and serve. The bars can be refrigerated up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 8965,&quot;Mini Meatball Subs 12 frozen dinner rolls, thawed and risen 6 slices provolone, halved<br> 3/4 cup marinara sauce, plus more for serving<br> 12 frozen Italian meatballs, thawed<br> 1/2 cup sliced deli peppers<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan<br> Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Pour in the gin, vermouth and chili oil and give them a stir. Leave to steep for half an hour or so while you get ready for your party. You can put any leftover olives in a jar with a lid for another couple of days, or indeed longer though it&#39;s doubtful that will arise. &quot;,&quot;[Gin, Vodka, Vermouth]&quot; 8968,&quot;Grilled Eggplant Soup 2 eggplants (approximately 3 pounds), peeled and cut in 1/2inch slices 1 tablespoon fresh thyme 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus 4 tablespoons 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 2 leeks 2 cups beef stock 2 cups chicken stock Salt and pepper Instructions: Toss eggplant with the thyme, garlic, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Grill on both sides. Set aside. In a soup pot, heat the 4 tablespoons of olive oil, add garlic and leeks. When lightly brown, add the stocks and grilled eggplant. Simmer 20 minutes.

This is because the easiest way to poach salmon for this dish is to do it in the oven. So: pour the water into a roasting pan, add the lime leaves and then the salmon. Cover the pan with foil, put in the oven and cook for about 15 minutes, by which time the salmon should be tender. Remove the pan from the oven and drain the liquid off into a pitcher. Keep the fish warm simply by replacing the foil on the pan. Melt the butter in a wide, heavy saucepan that has a tight-fitting lid, and add the oil to stop the butter burning. Soften the onion in the pan and add the spices, then keep cooking till the onion is slightly translucent and suffused with soft perfume of the spices. Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon so that it&#39;s all well coated. There&#39;s not enough onion to give a heavy coating: just make sure the rice is fragrantly slicked. Pour in the reserved liquid from the pitcher, about 2 1/4 cups, and stir before covering with the lid and cooking gently for 15 minutes. If your stove is vociferous you may need a flame tamer. At the end of the cooking time, when the rice is tender and has lost all chalkiness, turn off the heat, remove the lid, cover the pan with a dish towel and then replace the lid. This will help absorb any extra moisture form the rice. It is also the best way to let the rice stand without getting sticky or cold, which is useful when you&#39;ve got a few friends and a few dishes to keep your eye on. Just before you want to eat, drain off any extra liquid that&#39;s collected in the dish with the salmon, then flake the fish with a fork. Add to it the rice, egg, cilantro, lime juice and a drop or 2 of fish sauce. Stir gently to mix - I use a couple of wooden paddles or spatulas - and taste to see if you want any more lime juice or fish sauce. Sprinkle over the zest from the 2 juiced halves of the lime and serve. I love it served just as it is in the roasting dish, but if you want to, and I often do (consistency is a requirement of a recipe but not of a cook), decant into large plate before you add the lime zest, then surround with lime segments and add the zest and a small handful of freshly chopped cilantro. This is one of those rare dishes that manages to be comforting and light at the same time. And - should you have leftovers, which I wouldn&#39;t count on - it&#39;s heavenly eaten, as all leftovers demand to be, standing up, straight from the fridge. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8970,&quot;Fiery Summer Bruschetta with Zesty Olive Spread and Spicy Candied Bacon 8 slices thick cut bacon, halved 1/4 cup good quality maple syrup 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste 4 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 lime, zested and juiced 1/4 cup olive oil 1 pint heirloom cherry tomatoes, halved 1 fresh sweet white corn on cob, kernels removed and reserved 1 mango, peeled, flesh removed and diced 1/4 cup bocconcini, torn into pieces 1/2 red onion, finely diced 4 tablespoons chiffonade fresh basil leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup olive oil, plus more as needed 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste 1 loaf sourdough bread, cut into 8 slices (not precut bread) 1 red bell pepper, coarsely chopped 1 red jalapeno, seeded and coarsely chopped 1/2 cup pitted black cerignola olives (can substitute black olives) 1/2 cup manzanella olives 2 tablespoons capers 1 shallot, coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or to taste 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves Instructions: For the bacon: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put a baking rack over a parchment paper lined tray and arrange the bacon slices across the rack - do not overlap. In small bowl combine the syrup and cayenne and brush the bacon generously with the mixture. Put in the oven and bake until cooked through, about 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside until ready to use. For the Summer Salad: In a large bowl, add the vinegar, honey, Dijon and lime zest and juice and whisk to combine. While whisking, slowly drizzle in the olive oil to make a dressing. Add the remaining ingredients and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside until ready to use. For the bruschetta: In large saute pan, add the olive oil, cayenne and garlic. When the garlic has browned, remove it and discard. Add the bread slices, in batches if necessary, and cook until browned on both sides. You may need to add more olive oil to the pan if the bread soaks up too much. Remove to sheet tray and set aside until ready to plate the dish. For the Zesty Olive Spread: Add all the ingredients to a food processor and pulse until pureed and smooth. Check for seasoning and set aside until ready to use. Assembly: Put 2 pieces of bread on each plate. Spread the zesty olive spread on top of the bread. Lay 1 piece of bacon on each bread slice and top with the summer salad.

Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a large braiser or cast-iron skillet. Using tongs, slip half of a tortilla in the hot oil to form a taco shell shape. Using a metal spatula with the other hand, keep half the tortilla submerged until golden. Turn the tortilla so that the fried part now sticks out of the oil, letting the bottom fry, while making sure to keep the tortilla open about 2 inches wide. (This creates the necessary space to stuff it!) Then gently turn the tortilla and repeat the process so that the remaining side fries to a golden brown while the rest stays out of the oil. Let the taco shell drain on the lined sheet pan. Fry another tortilla in this manner; reserve the other two tortillas. Preheat the broiler. Place one unfried tortilla in a pan and top it edge to edge with cheese. Lightly broil until the cheese is just melted, but the tortilla isn\u2019t toasted. While still hot, \u201cstick\u201d the cheesy, non-crispy tortilla to the outside of a fried tortilla shell. Repeat with the remaining tortilla, cheese and fried shell. Now build! Fill the cavity of the taco with some warm Taco Meat, followed by some lettuce, a drizzle of sour cream, tomatoes, jalape?os and cilantro. Serve with your favorite taco bib. Heat a pan over medium heat. Add the beef and chorizo and brown, breaking the meat up constantly into smaller little bits, until no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes. (If there is a lot of rendered fat, remove all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.) Add the onions, chipotle powder and cumin. Cook until the onions are soft, another 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for just another 30 seconds. Add the tomato puree and simmer, stirring frequently, for another 10 minutes.

Separate the leaves and blot dry. Trim any stems and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the beef, shallot, sugar, lemongrass, garlic, and fish sauce. Mix until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Divide the beef mixture into 32 equal portions (about 1 tablespoon per portion). Place a grape leaf flat (widest side closest to you) on a clean kitchen towel. Shape 1 meat mixture into a 1 1/2-inch-long sausage and place it horizontally across the wide end of the leaf. Fold the wide end over the filling once. Fold the sides in and roll up as you would a spring roll, enclosing the meat. The roll should be compact and fairly tight. Repeat to make 32 rolls. Thread 4 grape leaf rolls on 2 parallel bamboo skewers, leaving space in between the rolls. Repeat with remaining skewers and rolls. Brush each roll with vegetable oil. Heat a grill pan over high heat. Grill the rolls, flipping them once the oil becomes shiny, until crisp and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve with Sweet, Sour, and Spicy Dipping Sauce. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, lemon juice, and fish sauce, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add the garlic and chiles. Let stand for 20 minutes before serving.

In a non-reactive saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, salt, sugar and butter, and bring to a simmer. Once the butter has melted, quickly add the flour and stir constantly with a wooden spoon for about 3 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix to cool down, until the dough mostly stops steaming, 1 minute. Add the eggs and whites, slowly until evenly incorporated and glossy. To check the consistency of the batter, run your finger or spoon through it. It should leave a pathway that slowly falls in on itself. If it&#39;s too stiff, you may have to add an additional egg. Place the batter in a pastry bag or resealable plastic bag and cut a hot-dog-size hole in the corner. On a silicon-lined sheet tray, pipe long and fat hot-dog-size lines about 6-inches long, evenly spaced. Use a wet finger to press down any peaks and lightly mist with water from a spray bottle. Bake until slightly golden and puffed, 20 minutes. Then lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and bake an additional 20 minutes. For the whipped cream: In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and almond extract until stiff peaks form. For the glaze: Heat the cream in a small pot until slightly simmering. Pour over the chocolate in a metal bowl and whisk until smooth. If there are still chocolate chunks in the glaze, heat it briefly on the stovetop and stir until smooth. Set aside. To assemble: Split the baked pastry and, using a resealable plastic bag or pastry bag with a 1/2-inch hole cut in the corner, pipe in the almond filling. Top with the chocolate glaze, crushed roasted almonds, and a couple pinches of smoked sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 8979,&quot;Healthy Instant Pot Chicken Parmesan 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 small onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes 1 tablespoon tomato paste 2 teaspoons sugar Pinch red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 chicken cutlets (about 1 pound) 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning 1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 4 slices low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella 6 basil leaves, cut into strips Instructions: Turn the Instant Pot? to the low saute setting (see Cook&#39;s Note).

Do not remove the bone.<br> Heat the lard in a large stainless steel pot over high heat to 250 degrees F. The pot needs to be large enough to fit all the pieces of pork butt side by side, not on top of each other, and preferably not touching each other. Add enough lard to completely submerge the meat. Add the onion and garlic and let brown but do not burn. If garlic burns, you must start the process over. Remove onions and garlic from the lard and discard.<br> Carefully add the pork pieces to the lard and then allow the oil to reach 250 degrees F again. Do not let the pork stick to the bottom or sides of pot. Stir around every 30 minutes to insure even coloring. Cook for approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The pork should be caramel-colored with an internal temperature of 170 to 180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.<br> Five minutes before you are ready to remove the meat, sprinkle the kosher salt into the oil. Continue to cook pork for 5 more minutes and then remove the pork from the oil to a platter. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.<br> Shred the meat and serve with Pico de Gallo, warm tortillas, salsa, limes, and radish slices. Combine all ingredients and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Let sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 8983,&quot;Crazy Chocolate Shakes 1 cup chopped semisweet chocolate 1 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate 1 cup heavy cream<br> 3/4 cup whole milk 8 scoops vanilla ice cream<br> 8 scoops chocolate ice cream<br> Various sprinkles, chocolate chips, marshmallows, candies and pretzel pieces, for decorating Scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, for serving Whipped cream (in cans), for topping Chocolate Butterscotch Caramel Bars or store-bought caramel brownies, broken into pieces, recipe follows Caramel and strawberry sauces, for drizzling Cherries, for topping Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the pan 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 cups regular or quick oats<br> 1 cup packed brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 3/4 sticks (14 tablespoons) cold salted butter, cut into pieces<br> Two 13.5-ounce cans dulce de leche (I used Nestle La Lechera)<br> About 1 cup Spanish peanuts About 1 cup butterscotch chips About 1 cup mini chocolate chips Instructions: For the ganache: Put the semisweet and bittersweet chocolate in a heatsafe bowl. Heat the cream until very hot in a saucepan and pour over the chocolate. Stir until melted and combined. Let cool. For the milkshake: Put the milk, vanilla and chocolate ice cream and 1 cup of the ganache in a blender and blend until combined. To assemble: Spoon some ganache into large mason jars and spread on the sides. Spread some ganache around the rim of the jars. Dip the rims in sprinkles, chocolate chips, marshmallows and/or candies, or press on pretzels. Add a scoop of ice cream to each glass and pour in the blended milkshake. Squirt whipped cream onto the top of each glass and add pieces of the bars or brownies. Now go crazy and decorate the top with more whipped cream, ice cream, candies, etc. Drizzle with caramel or strawberry sauce and top with a cherry. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick spray. Mix together the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the mixture into the prepared pan and pat lightly to pack it slightly. Bake until light golden brown on top and done in the middle, watching to make sure it doesn&#39;t burn, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Spoon the dulce de leche into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave to just slightly soften it, about 45 seconds. Scoop it on top of the oatmeal base and use an offset spatula to spread it out to the edges and into an even layer. Sprinkle on a layer of peanuts so that they completely cover the caramel and use your hands to gently press them into the caramel. Sprinkle on the butterscotch chips and mini chocolate chips in generous layers. Note: The warmth of the cookie base and caramel should slightly soften the butterscotch and chocolate chips. When that happens, use your hands to very gently press the chips just enough to anchor them together (but not enough to misshape them). If the pan isn&#39;t warm enough, pop it into the oven for 30 seconds or so and gently press the chips to anchor them together. Chill the bars for 2 to 3 hours to make them easy to slice. Remove them from the pan, place on a cutting board and use a long serrated knife to cut into small squares (they&#39;re rich!). Serve cold or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Port]</p><p>&quot; 8984,&quot;Strawberry Shortcake with Balsamic Honey 4 medium buttermilk biscuits, recipe follows 2 cups strawberries, hulled and halved 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup honey 1/4 cup light whipping cream 4 sprigs fresh mint 2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 cup vegetable shortening 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk Egg wash or milk, for glazing Instructions: Buttermilk Biscuits: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Whip the egg whites until fluffy using a standing or hand held mixer. While on high speed, add 1/2 of the sugar. Slow to low speed and add the remainder of the sugar. Beat for 3 more minutes. Add the raspberry powder by hand and mix with a spatula. Place the mixture into a pastry bag. Place a piece of parchment paper onto a baking sheet. Using the pastry bag, create round domes with the mixture. Place in the oven at for 2 1/2 hours. Keep oven on. Remove from the oven and scoop out the insides with a spoon. Place back onto baking sheet and cook again for 1 hour at 190 degrees F. Let cool and store in a dry place. For Raspberry Sauce: Blend 1 basket of fresh raspberries with sugar to taste. (Frozen raspberries may be substituted). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 9004,&quot;Chocolate Winter Flan 6 eggs One 12-ounce can evaporated milk (full fat or 2 percent) One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk<br> 1 cup whole milk<br> 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 cup sugar<br> Instructions: In a blender, blend together the eggs, evaporated milk, condensed milk, whole milk, cocoa, allspice and cinnamon until well incorporated and creamy. Bake either using the water bath or double boiler method below. To bake using the water bath method: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Caramelize the sugar in a pan over the stovetop until a light golden brown, using a wooden spoon to stir. This is the trickiest part as sugar burns easily, so don&#39;t let it get too dark and keep mixing the sugar with the spoon. Don&#39;t step away from this process; once the sugar gets hot, it browns quickly. Once it is completely liquefied, pour into an ovensafe 6- to 8-inch round mold (a tempered glass pie dish works well) and coat the bottom and sides three-quarters of the way up. Fill an oven roasting pan or baking dish with about 1 inch of water and place the sugar-coated pie dish inside. Add the flan mixture to the pie dish and bake until the top is firm and the flan starts to pull away from the sides, about 45 minutes. Remove from the water bath and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. To transfer the flan to a serving plate, make sure the sides are loose (you can run a thin knife around the edges to make sure it is not sticking to the sides), put a plate on top and in one fluid motion, invert the flan onto the plate and remove the pie dish. Refrigerate to chill before slicing and serving. To bake using the double boiler method: If you have a double boiler pan (which is what I typically use and is easier!), caramelize the sugar in the double boiler insert on the stovetop using the same method as above. Remove from the heat and, using a wooden spoon and by tilting and rotating the pan, coat all sides of the pan three-quarters of the way up. Fill the other double boiler pan with water about one-quarter full and bring to a boil while the sugar is caramelizing. Pour the flan mixture into the caramel and put the double boiler insert over the pan with the hot water. Cover and cook over medium low until the flan appears more solid and pulls away from the sides, about 45 minutes. Let cool to room temperature for about 2 hours before inverting onto a serving plate using the same method as above. Refrigerate and serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 9005,&quot;Braised Oxtails \Anton<br> 1/4 cup canola oil 1 large red onion, sliced 3 cloves garlic, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or enough as needed to coat oxtails Salt and black pepper 4 pounds oxtails, cut into 2-inch cross sections 1 (750 mL) bottle red wine 1/2 cup demi-glace 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 bay leaf 1 large sprig fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 large sprig thyme 4 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon lime zest 1 large clove garlic, finely minced 1 tablespoon flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely minced 1 loaf French bread 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon garlic powder Instructions: Heat canola oil over medium-high in a large saute pot. Add onion and garlic and saute until the onions begin to turn translucent. While they are cooking, season the flour with salt and pepper and coat the oxtails, allowing any excess flour to fall away. Sear the oxtails on both sides in the pot with the onions and garlic, then remove them to a utility platter. De-glaze the pan with the red wine. Whisk in demi-glace and tomato paste and add bay leaf, parsley and thyme. Lower heat and return oxtails to pot. Cover and let simmer until meat is tender (it should easily fall away from bone), about 3 hours. Remove oxtails to a platter, cover, and let rest in a warm place. Strain braising liquid into another pot to make it into a sauce. Spoon off any excess fat that may be on the surface. Increase heat, allowing the braising liquid to reduce by one-half to two thirds. Combine the Gremolata ingredients and set aside. While the sauce is reducing, prepare the toasted French bread. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the olive oil on the bread and sprinkle with garlic powder. Lightly toast in the oven. Remove the reduced sauce from the heat and whisk in the butter. Spoon sauce over oxtails and top with a small amount of gremolata. Serve with toasted French garlic bread. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 9006,&quot;Roasted Sliced Tomatoes 4 small vine-ripe tomatoes Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Salt and freshly ground black pepper A few stems thyme, leaves finely chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Put a cooling rack over a baking sheet. Slice the tomatoes, horizontally, into thirds and arrange the slices on the rack. Put the top and bottom of the tomatoes, cut side up, on the rack. Dress the tomatoes with a little extra-virgin olive oil, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and a little fresh thyme. Roast the tomatoes for 1 hour. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and arrange them on a serving platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 9007,&quot;GZ&#39;s Red Sangria 2 bottles fruity red wine, such as Beaujolais 1 cup orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier 1 cup brandied pitted cherries<br> 1 cup sliced fresh peaches or nectarines<br> 1 cup fresh raspberries<br> 1/4 cup elderflower liqueur, such as St-Germain Zest of 1 lemon<br> 1/2 bottle cava<br> Fresh mint or basil sprigs, for garnish<br> Instructions: Combine the wine, orange liqueur, cherries, peaches, raspberries, elderflower liqueur and lemon zest in a large-mouth glass bowl or cruet. Stir gently with a wooden spoon, then refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Just before serving, pour in the cava and stir very gently. Put large ice cubes in glasses, ladle the sangria into the glasses and garnish with fresh mint or basil sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Cava]&quot; 9008,&quot;Date Shake 1 to 2 cups cream or half-and-half 1 cup plain yogurt 1/4 cup honey 1/2 cup dried, pitted dates, roughly chopped Grated nutmeg Instructions: Put all the ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to brown. Add the quince and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened and nicely browned in spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sugar and 1/4 cup water, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is syrupy and the quince is tender, 4 to 5 minutes more. Stir in the salt. Transfer the mixture to a metal bowl and refrigerate to cool, about 10 minutes. Fill a small bowl with water. Dice the remaining 4 tablespoons cold butter into bits and fold it into the fruit. Dust a cutting board with flour and roll out the puff pastry to a 12-inch square. Cut into 4 6-inch squares. Brush the edges of one of the pastry squares with water. Spoon 1/2 cup of the filling into the center of the square and spread it out a bit towards 2 opposite corners. Fold the dough diagonally over the filling to make a triangle and seal by pressing the edges with a fork. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pastry squares and filling. Arrange the turnovers 2-inches apart. Make 2 or 3 vents in the top of each turnover with a sharp knife, using the tip to open the vents to expose the fruit (this will prevent the vents from closing in the oven). If your kitchen is very hot, pop each turnover in the freezer while you work and cut vents them when they are chilled. You can fill and freeze the turnovers for up to 5 days before baking; add an additional 5 minutes to the baking time. Bake the turnovers until deep golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes, rotating the pan after 10 minutes. Place the pan on a rack and let the turnovers cool for 5 minutes before serving. The turnovers can also be served at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9010,&quot;Red Wine Spaghetti with Meatballs Three 28-ounce cans Italian plum tomatoes, crushed with hands 2 large yellow onions, large diced (about 3 cups)<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1/2 bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large yellow onion, small diced (about 1 1/2 cups)<br> 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning<br> 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 1/4 teaspoon dried sage<br> 1/2 to 3/4 cup whole milk<br> 2 pounds lean ground beef (90/10)<br> 1/2 cup couscous<br> 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus shaved Parmesan for garnish 1/2 cup ricotta<br> 2 large eggs<br> 2 cloves garlic, grated<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 bottle red wine, preferably Chianti Kosher salt<br> 1 pound spaghetti<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. For the sauce: Combine the tomatoes, onions, garlic and bay leaf in large Dutch oven. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer, partially covered, until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce has slightly thickened, 30 to 45 minutes. (If needed, cook uncovered for another 10 minutes until thickened to desired consistency.) Remove the bay leaf and pulse the sauce with an immersion blender until slightly smooth but still rough. Add the butter and half of the parsley and season to taste. Keep warm over medium heat until the meatballs are ready. For the meatballs: While the sauce is simmering, start on the meatballs. In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Combine the Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, sage and 1/2 cup of the milk in a small bowl and set aside to allow the dried herbs to reconstitute, about 5 minutes. This will soften the spices and release their flavors. Transfer the sauteed onions and milk mixture to a large bowl. Add the ground beef, couscous, grated Parmesan, ricotta, eggs, garlic and 2 teaspoons kosher salt. Combine with your hands, making sure not to overmix. If the mixture looks too dry, add the remaining 1/4 cup milk. Using a 1 1/2-ounce-portion scoop or a scant 1/4 cup, scoop the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. The mixture should yield 30 meatballs. Bake the meatballs until firm on the outside but slightly undercooked in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the meatballs to the blended sauce and cook until cooked through, 10 minutes. For the pasta: In a large high-sided saute pan, bring 5 cups water, 3 cups of wine, and some salt to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 9 minutes, pressing the pasta down as it cooks to make sure it is fully submerged in the liquid. Strain the cooked pasta and return it to the pan along with any remaining wine (there should only be a little bit, less than 1/4 cup) and 1 cup of the sauce. Toss to combine. Serve immediately, topped with more sauce and the meatballs. Garnish with the remaining parsley and shaved Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 9011,&quot;Pork Shank Osso Buco with Polenta and Gremolata Four 8-ounce pork shanks, tied with twine Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 2 carrots, diced<br> 2 stalks celery, diced<br> 2 yellow onions, diced<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 cups dry white wine<br> 2 cups warm chicken stock<br> One 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> 2 bay leaves Creamy Polenta, recipe follows Gremolata, recipe follows Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 1/2 cups medium-grind stone-ground cornmeal 1/3 cup heavy cream<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano<br> 1 cup fresh parsley, minced 2 teaspoons lemon zest<br> 1 teaspoon orange zest<br> 2 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp grater Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Liberally season all sides of the shanks with salt and pepper. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil to the pan and sear the shanks until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes a side. Transfer to a plate. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the Dutch oven, then add the carrots, celery and onions. Season with salt and pepper and saute until the vegetables are slightly soft and browned, about 8 minutes. Add the tomato paste and garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 second. Add the wine to deglaze, scraping all the bits off the bottom. Add the shanks, any accumulated juices, the warm stock, tomatoes and bay leaves. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook until the shanks are extremely fork-tender, about 2 hours. Remove the shanks and tent with foil on a plate. If the braising liquid is a bit thin, right before serving, simmer the remaining liquid until thickened slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Add additional salt and pepper if necessary. For each serving, put a ladle of Creamy Polenta in a shallow bowl, followed by a warm shank with a ladle of rich braising liquid, then top with the fresh Gremolata. Bring 6 cups water to a rolling boil in a heavy-bottomed 4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting, add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and pour the cornmeal into the water in a very slow stream from a measuring cup, all the while whisking in a circular motion to prevent lumps. Cover and cook, vigorously stirring the polenta with a wooden spoon for about 10 seconds once every 5 minutes and making sure to scrape clean the bottom and corners of the pot, until the polenta has lost its raw cornmeal taste and becomes soft and smooth, about 30 minutes. Stir in the cream, butter, cheese and salt and pepper to taste. Mix the parsley, lemon zest, orange zest and garlic together in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 9012,&quot;Cold Cucumber Soup 6 pounds cucumbers (about 6 cucumbers), peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped (12 cups) 2 yellow bell peppers, stem and seeds removed, coarsely chopped 4 green onions, chopped 2 jalapeno peppers, minced 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill 3 to 4 garlic cloves, mashed to a paste with 1 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons Essence, recipe follows 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 3 cups plain yogurt 3 cups sour cream, divided 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Combine the cucumbers, bell peppers, green onions, jalapenos, cilantro, mint, dill, garlic, Essence, salt, cayenne, yogurt, 2 cups sour cream, olive oil, and white wine vinegar in a large bowl.

For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Cut three 12-inch pieces of heavy-duty foil. Working one piece at a time, fold in half lengthwise. Fold in half again and fold in half one more time; you should have a long strip of foil about 1 1/2 inches wide. Twist the two ends of the strip in opposite directions making a twisted rope of foil. Repeat with the remaining two pieces of foil. Set all three ropes in the center of a small disposable aluminum roaster about 1 inch apart and place the ham on top. (The ropes will prevent the bottom of the ham from burning.) Cover tightly with foil and place over indirect heat (if your grill has a thermometer, it should be at around 325 degrees F). Cover the grill and cook until just warmed through, 35 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, boil the pineapple juice, brown sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until the glaze is very thick and has the consistency of honey, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and remove from the heat. Carefully remove the foil cover from the ham and discard; baste with the glaze, making sure to get in between each slice. Increase the heat to medium-high and move the ham over direct heat. Cover the grill and cook until the glaze begins to bubble, about 5 minutes. Baste again with the remaining glaze, then cover and cook until the glaze bubbles, 5 minutes more. Continue basting and cooking until the ham is shiny and the glaze begins to brown, about 10 more minutes. Remove from the grill and let sit 10 minutes, uncovered, before serving. Meanwhile, grill the pineapple rings over direct heat until charred on one side, 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool. Arrange the pineapple rings on the uncut portion of the ham, grill marks facing up, and use toothpicks to secure them in place. Place a cherry in the center of each ring and secure with a toothpick. Serve the ham with any accumulated juices, remaining pineapple rings and cherries on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9016,&quot;Mixed Seafood Paella with Sausage and Pink Beans 1 1/2 cups quick-cooking rice 1 to 2 cups leftover salmon broken into pieces 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 2 links chorizo or andouille sausage (or kielbasa), cut in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes 1 (15-ounce) can pink beans, drained 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and diced 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Cook the rice according to the package directions.

Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and add the maple syrup, sage, garlic, rosemary and thyme. Reduce the heat to low and cook while you prepare the turkey, about 10 minutes. Place the turkey breast-side down on a work surface. Cut down both sides of the backbone with kitchen shears, then remove and set the backbone aside (reserve for stock). Flip the turkey over and press firmly with the palm of your hand on the center of the breast. The breastbone should pop and the turkey should sit relatively flat. Grab a roasting pan or a sheet pan. Spread the celery, carrot and onion onto the pan. Top with the turkey breast-side up. Brush the bird with the butter mixture, then season generously with salt and pepper. Roast the turkey for 30 minutes to begin the browning process. Lower the temperature to 375 degrees F and baste the turkey with the herb butter. Continue to roast the turkey, basting with the pan juices every 20 minutes, until it is deep golden and registers 165 degrees F when a meat thermometer is inserted in the thigh, another 40 to 50 minutes.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself. Start with 2 pieces of colored sugar. I used red and green. Pull them into a rectangular shape that is about 1 1/2-inches wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick. Place the pieces side-to-side and let them stick together on the long side. Place a piece of white sugar that is about 1/2-inch wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick in the middle. Close the red and green around it. Roll it and twist it while pulling it. When it gets to the desired thickness, use a scissor to cut the length and shape into a cane. Allow to cool completely. The white is inside and will become apparent when eaten. Jacques? tips: Vinegar keeps the sugar from crystallizing. You will not taste the flavor. It serves as an acid in this recipe. Sometimes candy cane recipes contain corn syrup, which makes the sugar very dry and very hot. Adding corn syrup makes it more difficult to work with the sugar at home. Remember, the sugar is at 320 degrees F, and that will burn you. The ideal work surface is a silpat placed over cool marble or granite. If you do not have marble or stone, use wood. It is a good idea to use gloves to help protect your hands from the heat and to prevent burning. I use a special sugar box that includes a special heat source, If you don?t have one, you can work in front of the oven. Set the oven to 300 degrees F. Open the oven door and place the silpat on the oven door. It provides a similar effect to the sugar box heater. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9044,&quot;Funked Out Pork Quesadilla 1 cup low-fat Greek yogurt 1 lime, zested and juiced 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 2 teaspoons chipotle en adobo sauce Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 red onion, chopped 1/2 cup chopped pickled jalapenos, juices reserved 2 cups shredded Simple Roasted Pork Shoulder, recipe follows 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack or Mexican blend cheese Nonstick olive oil spray 4 large whole wheat tortillas (or white, corn or sun-dried tomato) 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons chopped garlic Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (4 pound) pork shoulder Instructions: For the crema: Combine the yogurt, lime zest and juice, cilantro and adobo sauce in a small bowl, stirring well to combine. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. For the quesadillas: Preheat a grill pan and spray with nonstick spray. Soak the onions in the jalapeno juice about 10 minutes. Drain. In a large bowl, mix together the jalapenos, onions, pork and cheese. Divide the mix on top of 2 tortilla rounds. Top each with another tortilla round. Spray the round with olive oil and place face down onto the grill. Grill until the cheese is melted and the tortillas begin to brown, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 3 minutes. Remove the quesadillas from the grill pan, cut each into quarters and serve with the crema. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Using a pastry brush, spread the mixture all over the pork shoulder. Set the meat on a rack set into a roasting pan. Roast for 20 minutes, and then reduce the heat to 325 degrees F. Continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the shoulder reads 185 degrees F, about 4 hours.

Grease two 8-inch and two 6-inch round cake pans with flour-based baking spray. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Whisk together the egg whites and milk in a separate bowl. Beat the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer using the paddle attachment until soft and creamy. Add the granulated sugar gradually and beat until light and fluffy. Scrape down the bowl intermittently. Beat in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture alternately with the egg white and milk mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until smooth on medium-low speed after each addition. Divide the batter among the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes spring back when pressed in their centers, about 25 minutes for the 6-inch cakes and 35 minutes for the 8-inch cakes. Allow the cakes to cool slightly in the pans and then turn out on wire racks to cool completely. When cool, level the cakes using a large serrated knife or cake leveler. For the buttercream: Cream the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar together on low speed in the bowl of an electric mixer. When the mixture is combined, increase the speed to high and whip until light in color. Turn the mixer off and add the vanilla extract and 1/3 cup heavy cream. Beat again until the frosting is light and fluffy. Add additional heavy cream if the mixture is too thick to spread or pipe.<br> Transfer the frosting to a large piping bag with a 1/2-inch opening. Pipe a line of frosting around the top edge of one of the leveled 8-inch cakes. Spoon lemon curd in the center and spread evenly. Place the second cake layer on top of the filled cake and cover with frosting. Spread the buttercream as evenly as possible and refrigerate until the frosting is firm, about 1 hour. Repeat this process with the 6-inch cakes. Reserve the leftover buttercream for later use. When both cakes are well chilled and the frosting is firm, use a large spatula to transfer the smaller cake to the top center of the larger cake. Keep the cake chilled<br> For the candy brushstrokes and decor: Place a sheet of parchment paper over a large baking sheet. Place the different colors of wafers in separate microwave-safe bowls and heat each in the microwave at 100 percent power until they can be stirred smooth, about 30 seconds for 6 ounces of candy. In separate bowls, combine different colors of the candy to create new colors. Make as many hues as desired. Use a spoon to place quarter-sized dollops of the candy on the parchment sheet. Hold the parchment sheet steady with one hand as you place a craft brush over the melted candy. Use quick motions to brush the candy upward, resulting in one long candy brushstroke. Repeat the process with the other colors of candy. Transfer the brushed candy to the refrigerator to chill, 5 to 7 minutes.<br> When firm, transfer the chilled candy to a large plate. Repeat the candy brushing process until you have about 40 candy brushstrokes for decorating the cake. Transfer any leftover melted candy to squeeze bottles and drizzle decoratively over one side of both cake tiers. Use leftover buttercream to attach the firm candy brushstrokes to the opposite side of the cake; arrange them upright on both tiers. Press a few small brushstrokes into the frosting on top of the cake so they also stand upright. Use as many candy brushstrokes as possible to fill up one side of the cake. Before serving, arrange fresh sliced citrus on the edges of the candy-drizzled side of the cake. Tuck fresh mint between the fruit and candy brushstrokes. Present to delighted guests. To serve, move aside the fruit slices and cut the cake into pieces. Serve the fruit slices alongside pieces of cake, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 9049,&quot;No-Bake Peanut Butter Cheesecake Pops Two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, chilled 1 cup creamy honey-roasted peanut butter<br> 1 cup crushed honey-roasted peanuts<br> One 12-ounce bag miniature semisweet chocolate chips<br> 2 tablespoons unrefined coconut oil<br> Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment.

Meanwhile, chop the strawberries and mix with the granulated sugar. Place into a strainer over a bowl and let the strawberries sit for 4 hours or up to overnight in the refrigerator to drain the excess liquid. Add the strained ricotta and heavy cream to the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the whisk attachment, whisk the mixture until soft peaks form. Add the powdered sugar and whisk just until combined. Add the strained strawberries and stir by hand to incorporate. For the waffle cookie: Cream the butter and granulated sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the eggs one at a time. Add the flour, salt, cardamom, milk and vanilla and mix until combined. For the cannoli: Heat a krumkake iron on medium. Line a sheet tray with parchment paper. When the iron is ready, spray cooking spray lightly on both sides. Add 1 tablespoon of the batter in the center. (Use another spoon to help scoop out the batter from your tablespoon, because the batter is slightly thick.) Close the iron and cook the waffle cookies for 1 1/2 minutes. Working quickly, open the iron and immediately roll one of the waffle cookies with a non-metal spoon over a krumkake mold. Remove to the parchment-lined sheet tray to cool in the mold. Repeat with the other waffle cookie. Each cookie will crisp up as it cools, about 2 minutes. Gently slide the waffle cookie off the krumkake mold and repeat with the remaining batter. For the chocolate sauce: Fill a pot with 1 inch of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and fit a heat resistant bowl into the pot. (The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water.) The steam will heat and melt the chocolate. Add the chocolate chips and the coconut oil to the bowl and stir to melt. Working quickly, dip the larger end of a waffle cookie in the chocolate and return the cookie to the parchment-lined sheet tray to cool. Repeat with the remaining cookies. Place the tray of cookies into the fridge or freezer to quickly cool, approximately 10 minutes. Snip the end of a piping bag, then place it into a tall glass and fold the top of the bag over the lip of the glass. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the strawberry filling into the piping bag. Twist the top to close. Taking one waffle cookie at a time, pipe the strawberry filling into the cone. Sprinkle with the crushed freeze-dried strawberries. Repeat with the remaining waffle cookies.

Add whole eggs, yolks, and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. Divide the ball of dough in small sections, cover and reserve the dough you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through the pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening and rolling until the sheet is about 1/4-inch thick. Keep in mind, overly thick pasta tastes gummy. Cut the long sheet into workable 18-inch pieces. Now, using the fettuccine cutting attachment, run the sheets through the cutting slot. Dust the noodles and a baking sheet with cornmeal. Coil the strands into a nest. Allow to dry for about 10 minutes before cooking. To prepare Alfredo sauce: Heat heavy cream over low-medium heat in a deep saute pan. Add butter and whisk gently to melt. Sprinkle in cheese and stir to incorporate. Season with freshly cracked black pepper. In a large stockpot, cook pasta in plenty of boiling salted water for 3 minutes. Quickly drain the pasta and add it to the saute pan, gently toss the noodles to coat in the Alfredo. Transfer pasta to a warm serving bowl. Top with more grated cheese and chopped parsley.

Place the sliced duck breast on top of the confit in a fanned circular fashion. Place 1 piece of foie gras on top of each breast and garnish with a sprig of parsley and fried parsnip strips. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> French each breast by scrapping the meat, skin and tissue off of the wing bone while keeping it attached to the breast. With the heel of a chef&#39;s knife make a clean break on the bone without creating any fragments. (You can also purchase boneless duck breasts if you desire.)<br> Score the skin on each breast by lightly cutting through the skin but not into the meat. Make a criss cross pattern to allow for easy rendering. Preheat a large saute pan and add the canola oil. Season the duck with salt and pepper on all sides. Place the breasts into the skillet, skin side down. Turn the heat down to low and allow the breasts to render for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the skin is very crispy.<br> Turn the breasts over and place in the oven and cook for 2 to 4 minutes or until desired doneness. Remove the duck and allow it to rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Slice the breast into 4 to 6 equal pieces and serve immediately. The duck should be served medium rare. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F.<br> Place a heavy gauge skillet on the stove over medium heat. Add 1 ounce of canola oil to the pan and add the duck legs, skin side down. Turn up the heat to make sure that the legs are rendering but not burning. Render the legs for 15 to 20 minutes or until the skin is completely crispy. Remove the legs from the pan, saving the duck fat, and place the duck legs into a deep oven proof dish. Place the onions, garlic, celery and thyme over the duck legs. Poor the rendered duck fat over the legs and add as much canola oil as you need to completely cover the duck. Cover the dish with tin foil and place in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. Remove the dish and allow it to cool. Remove the duck legs from the fat and remove the skin. With a fork or small knife begin to shred and remove all the meat from the legs. The meat should be very tender and shredded into thin even pieces. This can be done days in advance and reheated when needed. Heat a saute pan over very high heat and allow it to get extremely hot. Place the foie gras into the pan with no oil and saute for 30 to 40 seconds on each side or until crisp and golden brown. Serve immediately. In a large sauce pot add the potatoes and the parsnips and season with salt. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Allow it to simmer until the potatoes are tender. Drain the potatoes and parsnips and place into a blender or food processor. Add the heavy cream to form a mashed consistency. Add the horseradish and puree until very smooth and season with salt, to taste. Do not over mix. Place the mixture into a pastry (piping) bag and reserve hot for the assembly. In a small saucepan add all ingredients together and bring to a boil. Reduce by 2/3 and season with lemon juice and salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Ribera del Duero]&quot; 9062,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Oktoberfest Cheat Sheet Four 1/2-inch-thick slices red cabbage 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon grainy Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon orange juice 1 teaspoon hot honey (I like Mike\u2019s Hot Honey here) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/2-inch planks lengthwise, flesh patted dry Olive oil, for brushing Garlic powder, for dusting Onion powder, for dusting Paprika, for dusting Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 bratwurst or knockwurst sausages 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup grainy Dijon mustard 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon hot honey (I like Mike\u2019s Hot Honey here) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the cabbage: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

In a small glass bowl, combine the rum, lime juice, Worcestershire, and cumin. Whisk together and pour the mixture over the shrimp. Toss the shrimp to coat them evenly, cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and preferably 2. Preheat a grill or broiler to high heat. In a small saucepan heat the butter and olive oil over low heat. When the mixture is hot and foamy, add the garlic and stir for 1 or 2 minutes, until the aroma of the garlic is released. Do not allow the garlic to burn. Remove 2 tablespoons of the marinade from the shrimp dish and add to the garlic mixture. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 minute. Remove the shrimp from the marinade with a slotted spoon and discard the remaining marinade. Place the shrimp in a shallow ovenproof dish that will hold them all in one layer. Or, make a single layer of shrimp in the base of individual gratin dishes. Pour an equal amount of the garlic mixture over each, and sprinkle with the salt, pepper, and bread crumbs. Broil the shrimp about 4 inches from the heat source until golden and bubbling, about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes, then squeeze a little lime juice over each and sprinkle with the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 9065,&quot;Upside-Down Banana Split Cake 1 pint premium vanilla ice cream, softened slightly to a spreadable consistency 1 pint premium chocolate ice cream, softened slightly to a spreadable consistency<br> 1 pint premium strawberry ice cream, softened slightly to a spreadable consistency Nonstick cooking spray, for the pans All-purpose flour, for dusting<br> 3/4 cup sugar<br> 3 ripe but firm bananas<br> 3 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3 tablespoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 3/4 cups sugar<br> 1 cup vegetable oil<br> 3 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 2 cups buttermilk<br> Refrigerated canned whipped cream, for topping 10 to 12 maraschino cherries with stems<br> 2 tablespoons finely chopped roasted peanuts<br> 2 tablespoons colored sprinkles<br> Hot fudge and caramel sauce, for serving<br> Instructions: For the ice cream layer: Line a 9-inch round cake pan with two layers of plastic wrap, pressing into the sides and corners to smooth it out as much as possible and leaving an overhang so you can lift the ice cream out. Spread the vanilla ice cream in the prepared pan in an even layer using a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon, then freeze until solid, about 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Repeat with the chocolate and strawberry ice creams, spreading the layers on top of each other and freezing each layer until firm. (See Cook&#39;s Note.)<br> For the topping: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the sides of two 9-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and dust the sides lightly with flour. Line the bottoms with parchment paper rounds.<br> Combine the sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons water in a medium skillet and stir until the mixture looks like wet sand. Cook over medium-high heat, gently swirling the pan occasionally but not stirring, until light amber, about 5 minutes. Pour the caramel syrup into the bottom of one of the prepared cake pans.<br> Peel and cut each of the bananas crosswise into 3 equal pieces. Cut each piece in half lengthwise. Arrange two banana pieces cut-side down in the pan with the caramel so they from an upside-down V. Continue making upside-down Vs with the banana pieces all the way across the pan. Fill in any empty spaces with the remaining banana pieces.<br> For the cake: Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Add the sugar and vegetable oil to the bowl of a stand mixer and beat to combine. Add the eggs one at a time, beating to incorporate after each addition, then beat in the vanilla until combined. With the mixer on low speed, alternate adding the flour and buttermilk in 3 parts each, scraping down the bowl as needed, then beat on medium-high for 1 full minute.<br> Divide the batter between the two prepared pans, covering the bananas evenly (use an offset spatula if needed). Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour (the plain cake will bake faster than the one with the topping, so check both). Let cool on a rack until cool enough to handle, about 25 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto racks to cool completely.<br> Place the plain cake layer on a cake pedestal or plate. Remove the ice cream from the freezer and lift it out of the pan using the plastic wrap. Invert the ice cream layer directly on the cake layer. Top with the second cake layer, bananas facing up. Decorate the top with whipped cream rosettes, then top with cherries and sprinkle with chopped peanuts and sprinkles.

Lightly butter two 9-inch/23-cm round cake pans/tins. Line with parchment/baking paper. Butter the parchment/baking paper. Dust the inside of both pans with cocoa powder and knock against the side of the counter to settle a thin dusting of cocoa inside the pans; discard any extra cocoa. Whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda/bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer.<br> Add 1 cup/240 ml of the warm water, the oil, and melted butter and mix on medium speed until combined. Stop the mixer to scrape down the sides of the bowl and make sure all the ingredients are fully incorporated. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well between additions to incorporate and aerate the batter, which gives the cake a more even crumb. Add the remaining 3/4 cup/180 ml warm water and vanilla and beat until smooth and aerated, about 2 minutes. The batter will look loose and watery, about the consistency of heavy cream or hot fudge.<br> Divide evenly between the prepared pans and tap lightly on the counter to smooth the top. Bake until the cakes are evenly domed and spring back lightly when touched, about 40 minutes. Test the cakes with a toothpick inserted into the centers; if it comes out clean your cakes are done.<br> Remove the cakes from the oven and let cool on a wire rack until they are just warm to the touch, about 15 minutes. The cakes will pull away from the sides of the pans slightly as they cool. Flip the pans to unmold the cakes onto a rack to cool completely, 1 hour.<br> Make the frosting: Before you begin, check to make sure the butter is room temperature, just soft enough to press easily with your finger. Beat together the butter, agave, confectioners&#39;/icing sugar, cocoa powder, and warm water with a stand mixer until light and creamy and evenly combined, about 2 minutes. Stop to scrape down the sides and make sure all the butter is fully combined. Add the cool cream and beat on medium-high until fluffy and creamy.<br> When the cakes are completely cooled, slice off the dome from one of the layers with a serrated knife so that you can stack the layers easily. Lay the trimmed cake layer on a cake stand or serving platter, trimmed-side up. Tear four sheets of parchment/baking paper or wax/greaseproof paper into long strips and tuck under the edges of the cake around all the sides (this will help to keep your serving platter clean as you frost). Scoop about one-third of the frosting onto the top of the cake. Using an offset spatula or the back of a spoon, spread the frosting evenly over the top of the cake and around the sides. Cover with the second cake layer, domed-side up, and press down slightly to flatten. Look down at the cake and slide the top cake layer until it lines up perfectly with the bottom layer. Add another one-third of the frosting to the top and spread evenly over the top. Spread the remaining one-third of the icing around the sides of the cake to create a smooth, even layer.<br> Make careless swirls of icing all over the top of the cake using the back of a large spoon. Serve immediately or store in a cool place until ready to serve.<br> If you plan to make ahead and refrigerate, note that the icing will set up in the fridge and will sweat slightly when it comes out. Remove from the fridge about 1 hour before serving to restore the frosting to its luscious, creamy state. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9088,&quot;Boardwalk Dog 1/2 cup ketchup 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo, finely chopped, plus 2 teaspoons adobo sauce 8 ounces tomatillos (about 3 medium), finely chopped 3 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped or torn 1 tablespoon lime juice (1 to 2 limes) 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 jalapeno, seeds and ribs removed if desired, finely chopped 1/2 medium red onion, finely chopped 1 cup milk 2 tablespoons melted butter One 8.5-ounce box cornbread mix, such as Jiffy 1 egg Cooking spray, for greasing pan 6 all-beef hot dogs, grilled 1/2 cup tortilla chips, crushed 1/2 cup cotija cheese Instructions: For the chipotle ketchup: Pour the ketchup, vinegar, chipotles and adobo sauce directly into a food processor and run until pureed.

Heat a medium nonstick skillet or cast-iron griddle pan over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray and spread 1/3 cup of the batter into the heated skillet with the bottom of a spoon or measuring cup, making sure the cornbread bun will be big enough to fit the length of the hot dog. Cook the cornbread until you start to see the batter bubble on the top and brown around the edges, about 2 minutes, and then flip and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute longer. Repeat with the remaining batter. To serve, place a cornbread bun on a plate and top with the grilled hot dog, Chipotle Ketchup, Tomatillo Relish, crushed tortilla chips and cotija cheese.

For a charcoal grill, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Slice off the top and bottom of the pineapple with a sharp knife and set the pieces aside. Remove the peel from the pineapple, cutting it off in strips. Using a paring knife, carefully hollow out the pineapple to a 3/4-inch-thick shell. Stuff the pineapple with the ribs. Place the top and bottom pieces back on the pineapple and secure them in place with 4 long bamboo skewers. Place a large piece of parchment on your work surface. Arrange 6 slices bacon horizontally on the parchment. The edges of the slices should touch but not overlap. Working with the remaining 6 slices, weave the bacon in an over-under pattern by lifting alternating slices of the horizontal bacon and vertically placing a slice of bacon over or under as needed to create a woven lattice design. Wrap the bacon lattice around the pineapple and secure it in place with 8 long bamboo skewers. Trim the protruding skewer tips down to 1/2 inch lengths with kitchen shears. Put the swineapple on the grill over the drip pan with the bacon seam-side down. Cover the grill and cook until the bacon is crispy and golden brown and the meat is hot in the center, about 1 hour.

Put the egg whites, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, the cream of tartar, almond extract and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whip on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to high, slowly add the remaining 3/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff peaks form. Remove the bowl from the mixer and sift the cake flour mixture over the whites. Add the poppy seeds and use a rubber spatula to fold in the flour and poppy seeds until completely combined. Pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch angel food cake tube pan and bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Invert the pan and cool for 1 hour, then remove from the pan and turn upright onto a serving plate. Whisk the lemon zest and the remaining 3 tablespoons lemon juice with the confectioners&#39; sugar and just enough water to make a smooth, pourable glaze. Pour the glaze over the cooled cake. Let the glaze set for 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 9108,&quot;Pulled Pork Sandwich with BBQ Sauce and Coleslaw 1 1/2 cups ketchup 1/2 cup yellow mustard<br> 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar<br> 3 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped<br> 3 tablespoons cider vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced 4 medium cloves garlic, crushed<br> 2 cup chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth<br> 3 tablespoons Cajun seasoning 1 tablespoon packed dark brown sugar<br> One 4 1/2- to 5-pound boneless or bone-in pork shoulder (also known as pork<br> butt), twine or netting removed<br> 1/2 head green cabbage, finely shredded 1/2 head red cabbage, finely shredded 2 large carrots, finely shredded<br> 1/2 red onion, finely sliced<br> 3/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 3 tablespoons cider vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 15 soft hamburger buns Instructions: For the BBQ sauce: Combine the ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, garlic, cider vinegar, Worcestershire, Cajun seasoning and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring until ingredients are completely incorporated. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently until the flavors have melded and sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. If not using right away, cover and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. For the pulled pork: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Spread out the onions and garlic in an even layer in a roasting pan and pour in the chicken stock. Combine the Cajun seasoning and brown sugar in a small bowl. Pat the pork shoulder dry with paper towels and then rub all over with the spice mixture. Set the pork on top of the onions and garlic and cover the roasting pan with foil. Transfer to the oven and cook until the pork is fork tender, 6 to 8 hours. Remove the pork to a cutting board to cool. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve and reserve. If the pork has a bone, remove and discard it. With two forks, shred the meat into bite-size pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat. Return the shredded meat to the roasting pan. Add 2 cups of the BBQ sauce and a bit of the reserved cooking liquid if too dry. For the coleslaw: Combine the red and green cabbage, carrots and red onions in a large bowl. Whisk together the mayonnaise, cider vinegar, sugar, and some salt and pepper in a medium bowl, and then add to the cabbage mixture. Mix well to combine. Taste for seasoning; adjust with more salt, pepper or sugar as needed. Serve the pulled pork on buns topped with coleslaw. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Zinfandel, Merlot, Tempranillo]&quot; 9109,&quot;Pizza Pizzas 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon kosher salt* 1 tablespoon pure olive oil 3/4 cup warm water 2 cups bread flour (for bread machines) 1 teaspoon instant yeast 2 teaspoons olive oil Olive oil, for the pizza crust Flour, for dusting the pizza peel 1 1/2 ounces pizza sauce 1/2 teaspoon each chopped fresh herbs such as thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, for example A combination of 3 grated cheeses such as mozzarella, Monterey Jack, and provolone Instructions: Place the sugar, salt, olive oil, water, 1 cup of flour, yeast, and remaining cup of flour into a standing mixer&#39;s work bowl. Using the paddle attachment, start the mixer on low and mix until the dough just comes together, forming a ball. Lube the hook attachment with cooking spray. Attach the hook to the mixer and knead for 15 minutes on medium speed. Tear off a small piece of dough and flatten into a disc. Stretch the dough until thin. Hold it up to the light and look to see if the baker&#39;s windowpane, or taut membrane, has formed. If the dough tears before it forms, knead the dough for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Roll the pizza dough into a smooth ball on the countertop. Place into a stainless steel or glass bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil to the bowl and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours. Place the pizza stone or tile onto the bottom of a cold oven and turn the oven to its highest temperature, about 500 degrees F. If the oven has coils on the oven floor, place the tile onto the lowest rack of the oven. Split the pizza dough into 2 equal parts using a knife or a dough scraper. Flatten into a disk onto the countertop and then fold the dough into a ball. Wet hands barely with water and rub them onto the countertop to dampen the surface. Roll the dough on the surface until it tightens. Cover one ball with a tea towel and rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the steps with the other piece of dough. If not baking the remaining pizza immediately, spray the inside of a ziptop bag with cooking spray and place the dough ball into the bag. Refrigerate for up to 6 days. Sprinkle the flour onto the peel and place the dough onto the peel. Using your hands, form a lip around the edges of the pizza. Stretch the dough into a round disc, rotating after each stretch. Toss the dough in the air if you dare. Shake the pizza on the peel to be sure that it will slide onto the pizza stone or tile. (Dress and bake the pizza immediately for a crisp crust or rest the dough for 30 minutes if you want a chewy texture.) Brush the rim of the pizza with olive oil. Spread the pizza sauce evenly onto the pizza. Sprinkle the herbs onto the pizza and top with the cheese. Slide the pizza onto the tile and bake for 7 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown. Rest for 3 minutes before slicing. *This recipe&#39;s been on the web for some time now and although most of the reactions have been darned positive, some of you have commented that the dough was way too salty. At first we chalked this up to personal preference; some folks are just not as sensitive as others to this basic flavor. And of course salty toppings would definitley change the dynamic. Still, we didn&#39;t want to leave it at that. We went back to the lab and found that the flake size of kosher salt differs quite a bit from brand to brand. This could easily result in a too salty crust. So unless you&#39;ve had success with the recipe in the past, we suggest you cut the salt by one teaspoon, from a tablespoon to two teaspoons. So that the yeast doesn&#39;t go crazy, you should also cut back on the sugar by half a teaspoon.

Sprinkle the beef medallions on both sides with salt and black pepper. When the pan is hot, add the medallions and sear on both sides, cooking until the desired temperature is reached. Remove from the pan and let rest. Reduce the heat under the pan to medium. Add the mushrooms, cut side down, and the green peppercorns and shallots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms begin to brown and the shallots become translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the cognac. Replace the pan to the burner, and carefully tip to flamb. (If you don&#39;t wish to flamb, just bring the sauce to a boil and reduce to a simmer.) Once the flame has burned out, add the demi-glace, mustard and lemon juice. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes. Stir in the cream and reduce until the sauce is thick and rich in color, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the beef medallions to the sauce, spooning sauce over so they are submerged. Remove the pan from the heat; stir in the butter and add some parsley. Keep warm. For the matchstick frites: Heat 3 inches of vegetable oil in a Dutch oven to 365 degrees F. Add the rosemary, sage, thyme and garlic and fry until the herbs are crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Using a mandoline, cut the potatoes into matchsticks and place in a large bowl of ice water to remove any starch. Let soak for a few minutes, then rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the matchsticks and pat dry with a kitchen towel to remove as much water as possible. Fry the matchsticks in small batches until crispy and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet and sprinkle immediately with salt to taste. Transfer the frites to a large bowl and toss with the crispy herbs and more salt to taste.

For the sauce: Peel a clove of garlic with a crack of knife against the heel of your hand. In a small bowl, whisk up yogurt, tahini, the juice of 1 lemon and cumin. Then grate the garlic into the sauce with a zester or paste it with a knife (add a fat pinch of salt). Whisk sauce again. For the burgers: Preheat a cast-iron skillet or heavy griddle or frying pan over medium to medium-high heat. Place ground lamb or chicken in a mixing bowl. Season the meat with salt and pepper, cumin, coriander, paprika, sumac if using, turmeric, cardamom, crushed red pepper, allspice and nutmeg. Crack 2 cloves garlic and grate them into the bowl or finely chop. Peel the onion and grate about 3 tablespoons of it into the bowl. Finley chop the mint and parsley then add them to the lamb. Combine all the ingredients and mound up. Score meat into 4 equal portions and form 4 patties, thinner at the center for even cooking. To prepare the burgers, add EVOO, 1 slow turn of the pan, to skillet (a thin layer to just glaze the surface). Add patties and cook about 7 minutes for lamb, a minute or two longer for chicken, turning occasionally. If cooking lamb, press down with spatula when you turn the patties -- lean ground lamb tends to tighten as it cooks more so than other ground meats. When you remove the patties they can be served as such but for a more authentic facsimile of shawarma, we rest the patties and very thinly slice them on a bias. Regardless, while the burgers cook, prepare your toppings of choice. Assemble burgers: bun bottoms, sauce, patty or thinly sliced shawarma, lettuce, hot cherry peppers, cucumbers, herb leaves, dressed fennel and onions, bun top. OR split a pita and fill with giardiniera and Israeli pickles. Poke with a couple of toothpicks and split burgers down the middle.

Add the shallot and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: Be attentive to this. You don&#39;t want any brown crispy shallot edges. Reduce the heat to medium, and add 2 tablespoons butter along with the alphabet pasta. Cook, stirring often, until the pasta is coated in the butter and is light and golden, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup chicken stock, and bring everything to a boil. Let the liquid get incorporated, then once absorbed add another 2 cups or more stock about a cup at a time. Continue boiling, stirring all the while, until the pasta absorbs the stock, about 10 minutes. If the mixture becomes too thick before the pasta finishes, pour in a little more stock or water. Stir in the grated Parmesan, salt and pepper to taste. Check the pasta&#39;s consistency, and add more stock, if needed. Cook&#39;s Note: You are looking for a slightly loose consistency with the pasta having a bit of a bite in its center. Fold in the chopped parsley, and add a bit more salt and pepper, if needed.

Set an extra-large skillet, or a large heavy saucepan, over medium-low heat and cook the bacon until crispy and the fat renders out, 10 to 12 minutes. Set the bacon aside, reserving the fat to build your sauce. At this point you should have about 1/4 cup of reserved fat. If needed, add some olive oil or butter to make sure you have a 1/4 cup of fat in the pan. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until the paste bubbles a bit, about 2 minutes (make sure it doesn&#39;t brown). Continuing to whisk, add 3 cups of the hot milk and cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Stir in the dry mustard, and then gradually add the Cheddar and Muenster cheeses, stirring constantly until all of the cheese has melted into the sauce. Stir in the hot sauce and the remaining 1 cup milk. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and stir to coat. Stir in the crispy bacon and season with salt and pepper. You&#39;ll need 1 to 2 cups of mac and cheese for the tomatoes. For the baked tomatoes: Set your oven rack to the middle position and preheat your oven to broil. Using a paring knife, remove the tops of your tomatoes (the stem end), and then carefully hollow each one out with a spoon. You want to create a bowl, while removing all the seeds and some of the flesh, leaving about 1/2-inch of flesh in each tomato. Season the inside of the tomatoes with salt and pepper. Then stuff each one with as much mac and cheese as you can, 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Mix the panko, Parmesan and parsley together, and season with salt and pepper. Pile some of the breadcrumb topping onto each tomato. Each one will accommodate about 2 tablespoons of the topping. Now, drizzle the breadcrumbs with olive oil, so the panko browns up nicely. Broil the tomatoes until the breadcrumb topping is golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 9181,&quot;Strawberry Cobbler Squares 3 cups chopped strawberries 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch<br> 1 lime, zested and juiced 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 sticks (20 tablespoons) salted butter, cubed and chilled, plus more for the pan 1 cup packed brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar<br> 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice<br> Instructions: For the filling: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the strawberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch and lime zest and juice to a bowl. Toss to combine and set aside. For the crust and crumble: In a food processor, combine the flour, butter, brown sugar and baking powder. Pulse until a loose crumb forms; continue to pulse as you add the cream.

In a food processor, combine the chopped herbs with the garlic, crushed red pepper, a generous pinch of salt, and enough olive oil to make a paste. Brush the paste on the outside of the pork rib roast. Toss the onions with olive oil and salt and place in the bottom of a roasting pan. Add the thyme, bay leaves, and two-thirds of the cider. Place the pork on top of the onions and place in the oven. Roast the pork until it has developed a lovely brown crust, 20 to 25 minutes. Check on the pork and stir the onions and cider if they are starting to burn. Add more cider when the level starts to go down. Lower the oven to 375 degrees F and roast until an instant-read thermometer reads 150 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes. If the crust on the pork starts to get too dark, cover it with foil. Remove 1 1/2 cups of the cider from the bottom of the roasting pan and reserve for the applesauce. Let the pork rest for at least 15 minutes before carving. When ready to carve, remove the pork from the bone and cut the loin into thin slices. Serve with the onions braised in cider and Chunky Applesauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan large enough to accommodate the apples. Add the apples and saute over medium-low heat until the apples start to soften. Add the reserved cider, apple cider, and cinnamon and cook over medium-low heat until most of the cider has evaporated and the apples are cooked and very soft. Add the heavy cream and walnuts and cook until the cream has reduced by half. The end result should be a very chunky, sweet/savory applesauce. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 9194,&quot;Grilled Shrimp with Peach Cocktail Sauce 4 almost ripe peaches, peeled and diced 1/2 cup white wine<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish, drained<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> Lemon juice, for serving Instructions: In a small sauce pan, combine the peaches and white wine.

Remove the turkey; mark the line where the water is in the pot. Empty the water and dry the fryer and turkey well. Mix the smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, thyme, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle some of the spice rub inside the cavity of the turkey. Separate the skin from the breast meat with your fingers, starting at the top of the breast and sliding to the right and left, then working down. Massage some of the rub onto the meat under the skin. Sprinkle the remaining rub on the turkey&#39;s skin. Place the turkey on a sheet tray and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours so the flavors can marry. Fill your fryer with peanut oil to the line you marked (do not fill more than three-quarters of the way). Preheat the oil to 400 degrees F; it will take about 1 hour. Meanwhile, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature as your oil heats. Once the oil reaches 400 degrees F, very carefully lower the turkey into the hot oil. (Most turkey fryers come with a basket for the turkey that has hooks and a handle to lower and lift; otherwise, get yourself a long set of sturdy tongs to grip the inside cavity and breast and an industrial kitchen fork to hold the back side of the bird.) Make sure the oil maintains its temperature while frying. Fry the turkey until the skin is dark golden brown and crisp, or until the internal temperature of the breast reaches 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 45 minutes. Carefully remove the turkey from the oil and let it rest and drain on a wire rack, about 30 minutes. Do not cover the turkey with foil or it will lose some of its crispness. The internal temperature will rise to 165 degrees F while resting. Transfer the turkey to a board or platter. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 9198,&quot;Mini Crab Croissants 12 mini croissants 3/4 cup seafood salad<br> 1/2 cup baby spinach leaves<br> 24 large capers<br> 24 grape tomatoes<br> Instructions: Split the croissants open sandwich-style but not all the way, so they have a hinge at the back. Spoon in 1 tablespoon of seafood salad, then tuck 1 or 2 baby spinach leaves underneath. Insert 2 toothpicks into the top middle of each croissant and press a caper onto the point of each toothpick for crab eyes. To make crab claws, cut the grape tomatoes open from bottom end to stem end but not all the way, leaving them hinged.

Bring to a simmer. While the liquids are heating, crack the egg yolks into a bowl, and place the other half of the sugar to the side. Place the passion fruit puree into a bain marie and set it into an ice bath for cooling purposes. Now that the liquids are hot, temper the yolks with the hot milks. First whisk the sugar into the yolks and then, slowly pour the milks into the yolks whisking constantly. Now pour it back into the pan. On low heat, cook the mixture until thickened enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Strain the ice cream base through a chinois over the passion fruit puree and allow it to cool in the ice bath. Spin the ice cream in the machine. Allow it to freeze for at least 1 hour before serving. For the Tres Leches Ice Cream: In a saucepan place the milk, cream, and coconut milk. Whisk together the sugar and stabilizer, then whisk it well into the milks. Add the condensed milk to the pan, along with the dry milk, and salt. Place the pan on medium heat, and allow the mixture to come to a steam. While heating, place the eggs and trimolene in a bowl together and set aside. Prepare your ice bath, by placing a bain marie into ice for cooling the ice cream mixture. Now that your milks are hot, very slowly whisk into your egg mixture some of the milk. Add everything back to the pan, and stir for 30 seconds, then strain it through a chinois into the prepared ice bath. Once cooled, add the rum. Pour the ice cream mixture into your ice cream machine and spin until set. Place in the freezer for at least 1 hour before serving. For the Coconut Croquant: Place the fondant and glucose in a small saucepan. Cook the mixture until 120 degrees C or 274 degrees F, then add the toasted coconut and stir well. Quickly, pour the mixture onto a silpat, and lay another silpat on top. Using a rolling pin, roll the mixture out as thin as you can, and place in a preheated 325 degrees F oven for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Allow it to cool completely. Approximately 10 minutes. Crush the croquant by placing it in a food processor and pulsing until small. If you do not have a processor it can be chopped by hand using a serrated knife. Once crushed, place it aside until assembly. For the Whipping the Cream: Place all the ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer with the whip attachment. Be sure that the cream is very cold to allow it to whip nicely. Whip it on medium speed until ribbons form, then turn the machine on high to finish whipping. Place in a pastry bag with a star tip. Refrigerate until ready to use. For the Coconut Rum Caramel Sauce: Place the sugar and glucose in a small saucepan. Add just enough water to loosen the sugar and make it like \wet sand. Wash the sides of the pan down with water so that it is clean. Place a lid on the pan to allow it to boil and allow the sugar to dissolve faster. While the sugar is heating, warm the coconut milk. Prepare an ice bath with a bain marie placed in ice. Once the sugar has caramelized to a golden brown color, add the butter, and whisk it in carefully. Add the warm coconut milk slowly, then once the sugar stops boiling, whisk everything carefully. Add the rum. Place it back on the fire to dissolve any remaining sugar. Pour the sauce in the bain marie, and cool completely. Place the sauce into a squeeze bottle until ready to serve. For the Piping Tuile: Place the whites and the powdered sugar in a bowl, place it over small pan with simmering water and whisk until the whites are warm (110 degrees F). Add the flour and whisk everything until combined. Slowly add the melted butter. Mix well, scraping down the sides. Strain the mixture through a chinois. Cool before using. Place in a piping bag with a very small tip. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F, and on a silpat draw your desired shape with the batter, and bake until golden brown. Start with 5 minutes, and then rotate the pan, for another 5 minutes. Bend the tuile as desired. Set-aside until ready to finish Sundae. For the Mango Coulis: Peel the mangoes and place the flesh of the fruit into a blender. Taste the puree. If the puree is sweet, do not add sugar. If you want it sweeter, add to your taste and blend once more to dissolve the sugar. Pass the puree through a fine sieve. Put into a squeeze bottle until ready to serve. Assembly: Peel the kiwi and slice 5 of them into thin rounds. Dice the remaining kiwi. Cut the passion fruit in half and scoop out the fruit and seeds. Begin the assembly, by placing the kiwi slices around the base of the glass. Fill the inside base of the glass with some mango coulis. Pipe in a layer of whipped cream. Sprinkle with some croquant, and place 1 scoop passion ice cream in the center. Drizzle caramel around the sides of the ice cream. Add another layer of whipped cream, 1 scoop tres leches, drizzle mango sauce, sprinkle kiwi dice, and another drizzle of caramel. Pipe another layer of whip cream then center the passion ice cream. Drizzle caramel sauce around the ice cream, sprinkle with some fresh passion seeds and add kiwi. Finish with whipped cream, and then sprinkle with toasted sweet coconut, a momo berry, and a tuile.

This will be your bloomed saffron. Rinse the rice in a bowl a few times until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the vermicelli and saute until the noodles turn deep brown but do not burn, 6 to 8 minutes. Set aside. Fill a 6-quart pot halfway with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons salt and the rice. Simmer over medium heat until the rice is al dente (if you press a grain between your thumb and index finger, it should break but still be firm in the center), about 7 minutes. Add the vermicelli to the pot and cook for 1 minute. Drain the rice and vermicelli in a colander and rinse briefly with cold water. Reserve the pot. Peel the potato and cut it into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Add the vegetable oil to the reserved pot and sprinkle with the turmeric. Arrange the potato slices over the bottom of the pot.

Using a sharp pair of scissors cut the face off the crab, this seems really mean - it is- accept it and move on.<br> Soft-shell crabs usually have a lot of water in them which can be very dangerous during frying. Pat the crabs with paper towels to remove excess water.<br> Add the frying oil to a large saute pan until it reaches a depth of 1/4-inch. Bring to a medium-high heat.<br> While the oil is heating, in a large bowl, toss together the mesclun, zucchini, some of the pickled onions and radishes with some of the pickling liquid, and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. The salad should be lightly dressed, very flavorful and not soggy. Arrange the salad on 4 individual salad plates.<br> Set up a plate lined with paper towels to drain the crabs when they come out of the frying pan. Check the temperature of the oil by flicking flour into the pan. The flour will sizzle when the oil is hot. Put the flour into a shallow dish. When the oil is hot dredge the crabs the flour and pat off the excess. Gently add the crabs to the pan. When putting the crabs in the pan, be careful not to throw them in the oil because the hot oil will splash. Fry the crabs until crispy on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove them from the pan to paper towels to blot excess oil. Sprinkle with salt and put 1 crab on each of the prepared salads. Garnish with a dollop of the garlic aioli and serve.<br> That&#39;s crabby! In the bowl of a food processor, add the garlic, vinegar and egg yolks. Turn the machine on. While the machine is running begin adding the oil, drop by drop, until you see the mixture thicken. When the mixture begins to look like a smooth homogeneous mixture, the oil can be added in a slow thin stream. If the mixture is too thick, add a few drops of water to thin it down. Season with salt and taste to make sure it is delicious. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 9205,&quot;Grilled Flank Steak with Mustard Greens 1 (2 lb.) flank steak 6 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil Gray salt freshly-ground black pepper 3 Tbs. dried oregano 1 Tbs. minced garlic 12 cups of greens (mustard, chard or spinach), washed red wine vinegar hot sauce (optional) Instructions: Prepare the grill pan and let it get smoking hot.

To make the dough: In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the water, 2 1/2 ounces of olive oil, yeast and honey. Allow the yeast to proof for 5 minutes. Add the flour and salt, and mix with a dough hook on medium speed until the dough is pliable and elastic, about 5 minutes. If the dough is a little wet, you may need to add a little more flour. The dough should be moist, but not stick to the hands. Cover with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 20 minutes. Brush the remaining olive oil on a rimmed baking sheet about 18-by-26-inches and dust with the cornmeal. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4-inch thick and prick the dough all over with a fork or rolling docker. Brush off any excess flour and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Bake the dough until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Cool. When the dough has cooled, evenly top with focaccia with the tomato slices, covering the entire surface and lightly season with kosher salt and white pepper. Sprinkle with the basil chiffonade and lightly top with the mozzarella. You should be able to see the tomatoes through the cheese. Return to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and slightly colored. Cool the pizza slightly and cut into 2-bite triangles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 9214,&quot;Kale and Radicchio Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon Raspberry Syrup, recipe follows 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 bunch Tuscan kale, center ribs removed and leaves chopped into ribbons<br> 1 small head radicchio, chopped into ribbons<br> 1 pint raspberries<br> 3 ounces ricotta salata, cubed<br> 1/4 cup chopped pecans<br> 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br> 2 pints raspberries<br> Instructions: Combine the oil, vinegar, Raspberry Syrup, salt and pepper in a jar.

Halve the Cubanelle peppers lengthwise, trim the tops and remove the seeds. Drizzle the peppers, tomatoes and onion rounds with oil, and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Place the vegetables on the hot grill, cut-side down, and cook 6 to 7 minutes, flipping halfway through, to get some charred areas and dark grill marks. Set aside the grilled pepper halves. Put the grilled tomatoes and onion, garlic, chipotles, cilantro, juice of 1 lime and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a food processor, and pulse about 20 times for a chunky salsa. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits and scoop out the flesh with a spoon into a medium bowl. Add the remaining lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mash the avocado lightly with a fork so that some large pieces remain. Stuff about 2 tablespoons of the Monterey Jack into each pepper half. Place a piece of aluminum foil, large enough to hold all the peppers, on the grill. Arrange the stuffed pepper halves on the foil. Cover the grill to melt the cheese, about 4 minutes. Heat the tortillas on the grill for about 30 seconds to 1 minute per side for light grill marks. Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil to keep them warm and soft.

Lay the potatoes on a baking sheet and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, while the potatoes are cooking, bring the butter and cream to a boil in a medium pot. Reduce the heat to low and keep at a simmer until the potatoes come out of the oven. Just before the potatoes are finished cooking, soak the gelatin sheets in cold water for 5 minutes. Ring out the sheets and add them to the warm cream mixture. Whisk into the cream until the sheets dissolve. Remove the potatoes from the oven and fill a blender with half of the cream and half of the potatoes. Using a plunger, blend until smooth. (The starchiness of the potatoes is a job for your blender, patience will be useful here.) Transfer the blended potatoes to a bowl and repeat with the remaining cream and potatoes. Mix together the salt and sugar and taste before adding it all; depending on the person you may find it too much or not enough. Transfer the potatoes to a parchment-lined baking sheet and let cool overnight in the refrigerator. When ready to cook, flip the potatoes onto a cutting board and peel off the parchment paper. Cut to desired shape and size. Preheat a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. In three separate shallow bowls or containers, set up your breading station. Fill the first bowl with the flour, the second with the egg and milk (whisked to combine) and the third with the panko. Bread the potato mash pieces by first going in flour, then the egg, then the panko, then back in the egg and then the panko. After the mash bites are breaded, you can store them in the refrigerator until ready to fry, or freeze them for long term storage. Deep-fry the mash bites until golden brown, about 1 minute. They should be soft to the touch and warm all the way through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 9220,&quot;Grilled Swordfish with Salsa Fresca 2 heirloom tomatoes, small dice 1 jalape?o, minced (ribs and seeds removed if you\u2019d like less heat) 1 small red onion, minced 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro Juice of 2 limes Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 4 swordfish steaks, skin and bloodline removed Instructions: Add the tomatoes, jalape?o, onions, cilantro and lime juice to a bowl and mix to combine.

Place the mushroom caps on the other side of the baking sheet; drizzle with the olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill the mushrooms until tender and juicy, turning once, about 6 minutes. Next, lightly drizzle the wrapped goat cheese with oil and grill until slightly charred and warm, turning occasionally, about 1 minute. Immediately remove and slice in half on the diagonal. Slice the grilled mushroom caps into strips and add them to a bowl with the lemon juice and sherry wine vinegar. Toss to combine. In a bowl, toss the lettuce mix with the mushrooms and arrange in 4 bowls. Arrange 2 goat cheese halves in the center of each.

Place the butternut squash on a rimmed baking sheet, toss with the olive oil and spread out into a single layer. Season with salt and pepper. Place the red and yellow pepper halves cut-side down on another rimmed baking sheet.<br> Place both baking sheets on the middle rack and roast until the squash has softened and browned and the peppers have charred, about 25 minutes. Set the vegetables aside. When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and discard. Slice the peppers into 1/2-inch strips, season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and mushrooms and cook until soft and browned and any liquid is evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the sage and thyme, season with salt and pepper and mix thoroughly. Set the mushroom mixture aside to cool.<br> Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Place the spinach in a colander in the sink and pour the boiling water over the leaves to wilt them. Shake the colander to drain the water, then lay the spinach on paper towels and pat dry, removing as much of the remaining water as possible. Set the spinach aside.<br> To make the base for the pithivier, lay 1 sheet of the puff pastry on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper set on a baking sheet. Using an upside-down bowl with a 10-inch-wide rim as a guide, cut out a 10-inch circle from the pastry using a sharp knife. Gather the scraps and set aside for another use (see Cook\u2019s Note).<br> Spread the cooled mushroom mixture over the puff pastry base, leaving a 1/2-inch border all around. Arrange the cooled butternut squash cubes on top of the mushroom mixture. Sprinkle the goat cheese over the squash, then top with the reserved spinach and roasted pepper strips. Wet your hands and gently mold the filling into a dome shape, then set aside.<br> To make the puff pastry top, lay another sheet of puff pastry on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper. Using an upside-down bowl with a 12-inch-wide rim as a guide, cut out a 12-inch circle from the pastry using a sharp knife. Gather the scraps and add to the existing scraps.<br> Whisk together the egg yolk and water in a small bowl. Brush the egg wash around the border of the 10-inch pithivier base. Gently lay the 12-inch circle over the base so that it completely covers the filling. Press down all around the edges of the pithivier to seal the filling inside, making sure to press out any air bubbles as you go. Don\u2019t worry if the base is no longer a perfect circle. You will trim it later. Egg wash the entire top of the pithivier and set aside.<br> Cut the remaining sheet of puff pastry in half lengthwise so that you have two pieces, each approximately 6 by 15 inches. Set 1 piece aside. Firmly roll a lattice roller lengthwise down the other piece. Repeat until the entire piece has been cut with the lattice.<br> Use your fingers to gently pull the lattice apart, starting from the middle of the lattice and working your way out. As you work, use a sharp knife to open up any sections where the cutter did not go all the way through the lattice. Gently drape the lattice over the pithivier, then use your hands to smooth it into shape, ensuring that the entire top is covered.<br> Place the 10-inch-wide bowl used earlier over the pithivier and use a sharp knife to trim the base into a neat 10-inch circle. Add any dough scraps to the existing scraps. Use the back of the knife to make 1/2-inch-deep vertical indentations around the base. Evenly egg wash the entire surface of the pithivier, being careful not to let the egg wash pool in the lattice as that will create uneven browning.<br> Stir together the turmeric and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl until completely combined. Lay the remaining 6-by-15-inch piece of pastry on a piece of lightly floured parchment paper and roll out the pastry as thinly as possible. (That will help ensure that the petals do not puff up and distort in the oven.) Using a small pastry brush, brush the top of the sheet with the turmeric mixture. Don\u2019t worry if the mixture seems to go on a bit unevenly. The variegated shades of yellow will look lovely once you begin to make the flowers.<br> Using a 1 1/2-inch and 1-inch petal cutter, cut petals from the sheet of pastry. The number of petals you cut depends on how many flowers you want to make (and what size you\u2019d like them to be). To create the 4 large flowers and 6 small flowers shown in the picture, you will need to cut sixty-six 1-inch petals and forty-four 1 1/2-inch petals.<br> To assemble a flower, dab a small amount of egg wash on the lattice. Place 6 petals in a circle, ensuring that the top of the petals meet in the center. Place another dab of egg wash in the center of the flower and add a second layer of 5 petals, offsetting each slightly from the one below it. Place another dab of egg wash in the center and attach a mushroom cap (see Cook\u2019s Note). Press firmly to adhere the cap to the petals. Transfer the finished pithivier to the freezer for at least 2 hours and preferably overnight.<br> When you are ready to bake the pithivier, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F with a rack in the lower-middle position.<br> Bake the pithivier until golden brown, 55 to 60 minutes. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Add the egg and butter, process until smooth. Cover and freeze for 35 minutes. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. Cake: Place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Remove the frangipane from the refrigerator. Grease and lightly flour a 12-cup bundt pan. Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, salt and cocoa, set aside. Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy and smooth, about 30 to 45 seconds. Add the sugar and beat for 4 to 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. On low speed, add the dry ingredients alternately with the milk in 3 additions, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Spoon about 2 cups of the batter into the prepared pan, spreading evenly. Spoon half the frangipane filling in dollops over the center of the batter. Spread the filling evenly over the batter, avoiding the center tube and the sides of the pan. Spoon about 1 1/2 cups of the batter evenly over the filling and spoon the remaining frangipane over the batter. Spoon the remaining batter over the filling. Bake until the cake springs back lightly when touched in the center and just begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 60 to 65 minutes. Transfer the cake to a cooling rack and cool upright for 15 to 20 minutes. Invert the cake and cool completely on a wire rack. Garnish with Chocolate Bow. Chocolate Bow: In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate. Let cool 10 to 15 minutes and blend in the corn syrup. Form the mixture into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and let set overnight at room temperature. Roll out between sheets of waxed paper. Cut strips with a pastry cutter and form a ribbon. Use spools of thread covered in waxed paper to support the bow. Refrigerate until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 9259,&quot;Apple-Spinach Salad 4 cups baby spinach leaves 2 apples, sliced 1/4 cup chopped celery 1/4 cup toasted PLANTERS Pecans, chopped 1/4 cup KRAFT Light House Italian Dressing Instructions: TOSS spinach with apples, celery and pecans in large bowl. ADD dressing; mix lightly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 9260,&quot;Green Onion, Thyme and Sage Rolls 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons white bread flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat bread flour 1 1/4 ounce packet active dry yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 cups warm water (from the tap) 6 green onions, finely sliced Leaves from 5 sprigs fresh thyme, finely chopped Cooking spray 1 large egg, lightly beaten 30 small fresh sage leaves Instructions: Put the flours, yeast and salt in a large bowl (or stand mixer bowl). Make a well in the center and pour in the water. Mix everything together well (by hand with a wooden spoon or, if by machine, with a dough hook on medium speed) to make a smooth, soft dough ball, 2 to 4 minutes. If doing by machine, continue to knead on medium-high speed for 5 minutes. Otherwise, put the dough on a clean work surface sprinkled with a little flour and knead for about 10 minutes. To test to see if the dough has been kneaded enough, form into a ball with a nice taut top. Put some flour on your finger and then prod the dough to make a small indent. If the dent springs back all the way, this means the dough is kneaded enough. If not, then knead a little bit more. Put the dough on the work surface (sprinkled with a little flour if you haven&#39;t already done so) and then flatten it out with a rolling pin to about an 8-inch round, 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Put the green onions and thyme in a pile in the center and then bring the sides of the dough up over the filling to enclose. Flip it over so the seam side is down and roll it out to the same size again. Once again, gather the edges up and over, but then knead the dough by hand to incorporate the filling ingredients evenly throughout. You may need to dust with a little more flour as you go if the green onions make things a little damp. Divide the dough into 10 equal-size pieces and knead each one into a ball with a nice taut top. Put the rolls, seam-side down and spaced apart, on a large nonstick baking sheet. Spray the rolls with a light spritz of cooking spray and then cover with plastic wrap so that it is airtight, but not too tight as the bread needs to grow. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and leave the bread on a chair about 3 feet away from the oven for 45 minutes, or until the bread has almost doubled in size. To test that the rolls are ready, remove the plastic wrap, put some flour on your finger and prod the side of the dough to make a small dent. The dent should spring back about halfway. When it does, it is ready. If necessary, leave it to rise a bit longer. Once ready, brush the dough balls with the beaten egg and lay 3 sage leaves in whatever decorative fashion you like on top of each one. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped underneath. Once ready, remove from the oven and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 9261,&quot;Tomato and Okra Salad 1 pound okra 3 large ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped 1 small head Boston lettuce 1/4 cup Classic Vinaigrette, recipe follows 2 teaspoons cl Oil, or to taste, recipe follows 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1/2 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard Pinch of sugar Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 9 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup peanut oil 6 fresh bird chiles, or to taste 1 1/2 pounds fresh okra pods<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> 1 medium onion, minced<br> 2 1/2 cups beef stock<br> 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> Instructions: Wash and top and tail the okra, discarding any blemished or hard pods. Cook the okra as for boiled okra (see recipe below). Drain it and allow it to cool. Prepare the tomatoes. Wash the lettuce, break it into leaves, pat dry, and arrange the leaves on a large platter. Mound the okra on top of the lettuce and top with the chopped tomatoes. When ready to serve, dress the salad with vinaigrette to which you have added 2 teaspoons of cl oil. Combine all the ingredients except the olive oil in a small glass bowl and beat well with a fork or wire whisk. Gradually drizzle in the olive oil, making sure that all the ingredients are well mixed. Serve at once in a sauceboat or drizzle over the salad and toss. Yield: about 3/4 cup Place the chiles in the oil in a fancy cruet and allow them to rest for 1 week, until they have flavored the oil. Add a drop or two of the oil to your usual cooking oil for a special zap. Yield: 1 cup Wash and top and tail the okra, discarding any blemished or hard pods. Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan and saute the onion until it is translucent. Add the okra and cook it for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the stock, cover, and cook for an additional 10 minutes, or until the okra is fork-tender. Add the lemon juice and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 9262,&quot;Fish for Crish: Red \Mole\ Swordfish Steaks with Pickled Shallots 4 small shallots, peeled, and sliced into thin rings (about 1/2 cup) 1/2 cup rice vinegar Small handful picked fresh cilantro leaves Extra-virgin olive oil for dressing Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 teaspoon brown or black mustard seeds 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 4 teaspoons ancho cl powder 4 teaspoons rice vinegar 4 teaspoons mirin 2 teaspoons honey 1/2 teaspoon sriracha Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 (1-pound) swordfish steaks, about 1-inch thick or 4 (6 to 8-ounce) steaks, see Cook&#39;s Note</em> 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pull the swordfish out of the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature while you make the shallots and the sauce. For the pickled shallots: Separate the shallots into little rings. Put them in a small saucepan, add the rice vinegar and 1/4 cup of water, and set over medium heat making sure the shallots are covered by the liquid. Bring to a boil. Once it&#39;s bubbling, turn the heat off and set aside until you&#39;re ready to serve. The pickling will bring out a natural pink hue in the shallots; beautiful! For the \mole: Grind the mustard seeds and cumin seeds to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle. Pour into a bowl with the ginger, ancho cl powder, rice vinegar, mirin, honey, sriracha and honey. Whisk together until smooth. Taste for seasoning and adjust as necessary. Set a large cast-iron or other heavy-bottomed, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until lightly smoking. Sprinkle the swordfish with salt. Add the swordfish to the skillet. Cook until browned, about 3 minutes on one side. Quickly, flip the steaks and smear with a little \mole. Put the pan in the oven and cook the fish until a thermometer inserted into the middle of the fish registers 125 degrees F, 5 to 7 minutes. While the fish is cooking in the oven, drain the shallots and place in a small bowl. Rip the cilantro with your hands into the bowl, then drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. Toss together and taste for seasoning. When the fish is cooked (remember that it will keep cooking even when it&#39;s out of the oven) remove to a platter. Add the butter to the skillet, scraping up any caramelized bits stuck on the bottom of the skillet. Stir in the remaining \mole\ and cook until hot and bubbly. Pour over the swordfish steaks. Top with a handful of the pickled shallots and serve immediately! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 9263,&quot;Pumpkin Pie with Whipped Cream and Cinnamon 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon cold water 1 1/2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, cubed and chilled<br> One 15-ounce can pumpkin puree 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1/3 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup maple syrup<br> 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> 3/4 cup whole milk<br> 3 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for serving<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1 vanilla bean, scraped<br> Fresh whipped cream, for serving<br> Instructions: For the crust: Combine the water and vinegar in a liquid measuring cup and stick it in the fridge (or even the freezer) to get really cold. In a large bowl or food processor, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Add the butter and either use your hands to toss it with the flour and pinch the butter into flat sheets or pulse in the food processor, incorporating the butter so that about three-quarters of the mixture is mealy. (It&#39;s ok if there are still some slightly larger bits of butter.) Drizzle in the cold water and vinegar and mix with your hands or continue to pulse in the food processor just until the mixture comes together to form a dough. If it seems dry or is having a hard time coming together, add a bit more water, a few drops at a time, until it comes together. Turn it out onto a clean surface, divide the dough in two and pat into discs. One disc will be used for the pie; save the other disc for another use. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Adjust a rack to the lower third of the oven (with a pizza stone if you have one) and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a floured surface, roll out one of the discs to a circle just larger than 12 to 13 inches.<br> Press the dough into a 9 1/2-inch pie plate, trim any excess off, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang, fold the edges under so they sit flush with the plate and crimp them with your fingers. Dock the pie crust using a fork. Freeze for 15 minutes. Place a piece of parchment paper over the crust and fill with dried beans or pie weights and bake, about 15 minutes. Remove the parchment and then bake until pale, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F.<br> For the filling: Combine the pumpkin, brown sugar, granulated sugar, maple syrup and salt in a heavy-bottomed pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring until glossy to caramelize the sugars, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and whisk in the cream and milk. Place the eggs in a heat safe bowl. Once the milk mixture is steamy, temper the eggs by adding a few ladles of the mixture, one at a time, to the eggs while whisking vigorously, then add them to the pumpkin mixture, whisking to combine until very smooth. Stir in the cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. Pour the mixture into the pie crust and bake until the edges are set but the center is still a little jiggly, 30 to 40 minutes. The internal temperature should be 175 degrees F. Let cool completely. Serve with fresh whipped cream and extra cinnamon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 9264,&quot;Asparagus and Egg Wrap with Barn Burner cl de Arbol Salsa 2 whole wheat tortillas, warmed 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 onion, julienned 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1/2 russet potato, washed and cubed 2 ounces shiitake mushrooms, sliced 2 ounces button mushrooms, sliced 1/4 tomato, chopped 1/4 pound asparagus, thinly sliced 1 cup chopped kale 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil leaves 1 lime, squeezed Sea salt and pepper 6 egg whites, lightly beaten 1 cup Barn Burner cl de Arbol Salsa, recipe follows 20 cl de arbol, toasted 1 teaspoon olive oil 1 onion, chopped 4 tomatoes, chopped 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves 2 cups water 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves Sea salt Instructions: Preheat the oven 375 degrees F.

Serve the stuffed grape leaves with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo, Barolo]&quot; 9295,&quot;Melon Salad 1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons finely grated peeled ginger 2 teaspoons finely chopped lemongrass 1 lime, zest finely grated plus 2 limes, juiced 1/8 teaspoon hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco) Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 ripe honeydew melon 1 ripe, small round red watermelon 1 tablespoon finely chopped purple-basil leaves, plus additional small leaves 1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro leaves, plus additional small leaves Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Turn off heat and add shrimp and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Drain. When cool enough to handle, slice each shrimp in half lengthwise. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, ginger, lemongrass, lime zest and juice, and hot sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Halve the honeydew and watermelon, cut away from rind, and remove the seeds. Slice the melons into 1/8-inch-thick pieces. Remove the watermelon seeds (it&#39;s okay if the slices don&#39;t stay intact). Using a cake ring or a glass whose mouth is slightly smaller than a 14 to 16-ounce martini glass or champagne coupe, cut out 16 slices from the watermelon, and 16 slices from the honeydew. Save the best-looking 4 watermelon slices. Set out 4 (8 to 12-ounce) martini glasses or Champagne coupes. Layer 2 slices of watermelon and honeydew in each glass, lightly sprinkling each melon layer with the lemongrass dressing, chopped basil, chopped cilantro, salt, and pepper. (You may need to trim the melon slices so they fit neatly into the glasses, which should be half-full at this point.) Divide the shrimp among the glasses, arranging them in concentric circles. Season the shrimp with the dressing, basil, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Add another layer of melon in the reverse order: honeydew, then watermelon, seasoning as before. Top each salad with a reserved watermelon slice, and sprinkle lightly with the dressing, basil, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Garnish with 1 basil and 1 cilantro leaf. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving (the melon and shrimp taste best when well chilled). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros, Vermentino]&quot; 9296,&quot;Cherry-Lime Rickey 2 cups pitted fresh or frozen cherries, plus pitted frozen cherries, for serving 1 cup sugar<br> 3/4 cup frozen limeade concentrate (half of a 12-ounce can)<br> 1/2 cup fresh lime juice, plus lime wheels, for serving Seltzer, for serving, optional<br> Instructions: Combine the cherries, sugar and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Carefully smash the cherries with a potato masher, then simmer the mixture until slightly reduced and dark red, about 10 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Strain the mixture through a strainer into a heatproof container, pressing on the cherry solids to extract all the juice. There should be about 1 3/4 cups of syrup. Let cool for 30 minutes. Combine the cherry syrup with the limeade and lime juice in a pitcher and stir well. There will be about 3 cups total. To serve: Either stir in 3 cups water if you want a still drink, or mix equal parts of the drink mix with seltzer in a glass. Serve over ice with frozen cherries and lime wheels. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 9297,&quot;How To Build a Perfect Charcuterie Board 4 to 5 ounces thinly sliced dry-cured pork, such as prosciutto, country ham, speck, Serrano ham, capicola, Iberico ham or coppa 4 to 5 ounces thinly sliced salami, such as sweet or hot soppressata, finocchiona or Genoa salami 4 ounces thinly sliced dry-cured beef or other meats, such as bresaola or mortadella 4 ounces meat or poultry spreads, such as rillettes, pat or &#39;nduja 7 to 8 ounces soft cheese, such as Brie, Camembert, burrata, goat cheese, Gorgonzola dolce, fresh ricotta or triple-cream 7 to 8 ounces semi-soft cheese, such as drunken goat, fontina, muenster, Roquefort or Havarti 7 to 8 ounces firm cheese, such as Cheddar, Gouda, Gruyre, Stilton, Jarlsberg or manchego 7 to 8 ounces hard cheese, such as Parmigiano-Reggiano, Pecorino Romano, asiago or mimolette 1/2 cup local honey Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 cup quince paste 1/2 cup fig jam 1 small bunch seedless green, red or other varietal grapes (about 1 pound), separated into smaller bundles Pickled vegetables, such as radishes, okra, peppers or green beans, drained, for serving 1/2 cup cornichons, gherkins, kosher dill slices, bread and butter or your favorite pickles, drained 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard 1 cup spiced or candied nuts 1/2 cup dried apricots or your favorite dried fruit 1 pint fresh figs or other ripe fruit, halved or sliced 1 baguette, half torn into pieces and half sliced and toasted for crostini Two 5.3-ounce boxes seed and fruit crisps 2 packages crackers or breadsticks Instructions: Place each type of meat on a different section of a large serving board. To make the slices easy to grab and visually interesting, fold and shape them in a variety of ways. You can make rosettes by folding pieces of meat in half and then rolling each up like a cigar. Pinch the cured ham into little mounds or arrange in swirls. Salamis can be rolled or folded into quarters and stretched across a section of the board in little \rivers.\ Add the spreads to the board next, either mounded directly on the board or in small containers or on plates with a broad knife for spreading. Divide the cheeses among the sections, pairing them with the meats and spreads to contrast flavors and textures. Experiment with combinations. Try a creamy burrata or Brie as a companion to salty-sweet prosciutto; match a firm or hard cheese like asiago with a soft, mild mortadella; place a mild buttery fontina with a spicy salami to mellow it out. To encourage noshing, break the hard cheese into large shards, cut a wedge or two from a full wheel and slice some of the bigger blocks into easy-to-grab pieces. Pour the honey into a small glass jar or bowl, sprinkle in a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and nestle it among the meats and cheeses with a little spoon for serving. Place the quince paste on a small plate or cutting board and the fig jam in a small bowl and place them among the meats. Arrange bundles of grapes near the saltier cheeses. Put the pickled vegetables, cornichons and mustard in separate small bowls and add them to the board. Fill in some the empty spaces with piles of nuts and apricots. Plug other blank spots with the figs or other fresh fruit. Fill in any remaining spaces with the baguette pieces, crostini, crisps and crackers, then put any remaining in a separate dish or basket. Serve the board at room temperature with an assortment of knives for cutting and spreading, small forks for spearing and spoons for drizzling and scooping. The board can sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 9298,&quot;Bun Bowl 2 pounds pork shoulder, 8 ounces of it ground or finely minced 25 ounces medium rice vermicelli, preferably Three Ladies Brand 6 ounces shrimp, peeled and finely minced<br> 2 shallots, finely diced<br> 2 cloves garlic, one minced, one left whole 3 medium carrots (1/2 finely minced, 2 1/2 julienned)<br> 3 cups fresh cilantro leaves (from 1 large bunch or 2 small bunches), 1/4 cup chopped<br> 2/3 cup fish sauce<br> 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> Six to eight 8-inch rice papers<br> 2 limes, juiced (about 2 ounces)<br> 4 Thai chiles, finely minced<br> 1 medium European or Persian cucumber, peeled and cut into 2-inch julienne<br> 1 bunch scallions, white and green part, julienned 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, julienned<br> 1 small head romaine lettuce, julienned<br> 3 cups vegetable oil Sriracha sauce and fried shallots, for serving<br> Instructions: Place the unground portion of the pork shoulder in the freezer for 30 minutes so it is easier to cut thinly. In a large pot of boiling water, cook the vermicelli for 8 minutes, then rinse thoroughly in cold water. Take a handful of the noodles and set aside. Drain and place into 6 piles on a tray to dry out a little. Cut the reserved handful rice noodles with scissor tips into 1-inch lengths and place in a mixing bowl. Add the ground pork, shrimp, half the shallots, minced garlic, minced carrot, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, 3 tablespoons fish sauce, 2 tablespoons sugar and freshly ground pepper and mix all together very well. Dip a rice paper into very hot water briefly and place on a cutting board to soften for 1 minute. Place 3 ounces of the shrimp and meat mixture into the middle of the rice paper to form a sausage shape 1 inch in diameter, then fold the ends in and roll into a tight roll. Set aside for later on a plastic wrap-lined sheet pan, making sure the rolls are not touching, or they will stick together. Continue with the remaining rice paper and filling to make 6 to 10 rolls. (These can be made in advance and frozen, then cooked from frozen.) Remove the pork shoulder from the freezer and cut as thinly as possible into 1/8-inch-thick pieces. Place on a quarter-sheet tray or large platter. Top with 3 tablespoons fish sauce and 3 tablespoons sugar and let marinate for 30 minutes. Combine the remaining 5 tablespoons fish sauce with 1 1/4 cups water, the lime juice, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, the Thai chiles, the remaining whole garlic clove and remaining diced shallots, then mix well and set aside until ready to serve. In 6 large individual bowls, arrange in equal portions the cold rice noodles, julienned cucumber, remaining carrot, scallion, mint, remaining cilantro leaves and romaine. Set aside the bowls until the rolls are fried and pork is grilled. To assemble: Place the vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven and heat to 350 degrees F. Fry the imperial rolls two to three at a time, making sure they don&#39;t touch, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. (If frying from frozen, they will take a little longer.) Place on a paper towel-lined tray to drain. Cut each roll into 4 pieces. Heat a grill to 400 degrees F or a broiler to high. Cook the pork until well caramelized on each side, about 4 minutes per side. Cut into 1-inch pieces. Place equal portions of the grilled pork and an imperial roll on each noodle bowl. Remove the garlic clove from the sauce and pour about 2 ounces sauce into each bowl. Place the remaining sauce on the table and have the sriracha sauce available as well. Guests should mix the noodles and vegetables together with the sauce and add additional sauce as needed. Sprinkle on the fried shallots. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 9299,&quot;Grilled Salmon with a Pineapple, Mango and Strawberry Salsa 4 teaspoons olive oil, divided 4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, skin-on 2 teaspoons Essence, recipe follows 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 1 recipe Fruit Salsa, recipe follows 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme 3/4 cup small diced pineapple 3/4 cup small diced mango 1/2 cup small diced strawberries 1/4 cup small diced red onion 1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded and finely chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium. Brush both sides of the salmon with the olive oil. Season the salmon on both sides with the Essence, salt and pepper. Place the fish on the grill, skin side down and cook for about 3 minutes then turn the fish 45 degrees and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Turn the fish over and cook for an additional 2 minutes, or until cooked through to the desired degree of doneness. Remove the fish from the grill and serve with the fruit salsa spooned over the fish. Serve immediately. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. In a medium non-reactive bowl, combine all of the ingredients and stir to blend. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the salsa to macerate for 20 to 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 9300,&quot;Chicken-Fried Oyster Sandwich 1 cup real mayonnaise 2 heaping tablespoons finely diced salty gherkins 1 tightly packed tablespoon finely chopped capers Zest of 1 lemon plus juice of 1/2 lemon 1 cup buttermilk 1 tablespoon sriracha chili sauce (more if you&#39;re feeling feisty!) 12 jumbo oysters, shucked (8 if they are huge beach oysters) Vegetable oil, for frying 2 cups all-purpose flour, for dredging 4 sesame-seed hamburger buns Pinch kosher salt 2 cups finely sliced (chiffonade) romaine lettuce Instructions: For the tartar sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, gherkins, capers, lemon zest and lemon juice and mix well. Refrigerate until needed. The sauce is best when made the day before use.<br> For the fried oyster sandwich: Combine the buttermilk and chili sauce and mix well. Soak the shucked oysters in the mixture and refrigerate, overnight if you can. Preheat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees F. Pour the flour out onto a plate. Gently remove the oysters one by one from the buttermilk, being careful not to tear them, and lay them quickly in the flour. The excess buttermilk will help for the delicious crunchy bits so don&#39;t worry about making a mess. Cover the oysters completely with flour, using clean hands, and gently press them down to make sure they are completely coated. Remove from the flour, shaking off the excess, and place them in the fryer. Cook until nicely browned, just past golden (think of your favorite fried chicken).<br> While the oysters are cooking, toast the insides of the buns and set aside. Transfer the oysters to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, and season with the salt.<br> Spread the tartar sauce on both sides of the buns. Place the oysters on the bottom half then top with the shredded romaine.
