(8 ounces) mascarpone cheese, at room temperature 1 cup (4 ounces) finely grated Pecorino Romano, plus 1/2 cup (2 ounces) 1 large lemon, zested 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup packed chopped fresh basil leaves 1 1/2 cups (6 ounces) shredded sharp Provolone Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Special equipment: 6 (10-ounce) ramekins, each 2 1/2 inches tall and 3 1/2 inches in diameter Instructions: Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter 6 (10-ounce) ramekins. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Drain. Using 2 cooked lasagna noodles in an \x\ shape, line each ramekin, pushing the noodles gently into the bottom of the ramekins, allowing any excess pasta to overhang on the sides. In a food processor, blend the corn, cream and garlic until chunky. Add the mascarpone, 1 cup of the Pecorino Romano cheese, the lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth. Add the basil and pulse until just combined. Spoon 1/4 cup of the filling into the bottom of each ramekin and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the Provolone. Fold 2 overhanging pieces of pasta over the filling, (trim the ends of the pasta with scissors, if necessary). Add another 1/4 cup of filling to each ramekin and top with another 2 tablespoons Provolone. Fold over the 2 remaining overhanging pieces of pasta. Spoon any remaining filling on top of the pasta. Sprinkle the tops with the remaining 1/2 cup Pecorino Romano and drizzle with olive oil. Arrange the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake until the tops are golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes. To serve: Run a knife around the edge of the ramekins to loosen the lasagnas. Unmold the lasagnas onto serving plates and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 61207,&quot;Tandoori Chicken One 3 1/2-pound whole chicken 7 tablespoons yogurt 3 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic ginger paste 5 teaspoons Kashmiri cl powder 1 teaspoon kasuri methi 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, optional 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon garam masala 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder 1/4 teaspoon pepper powder Pinch red food color Salt 1 to 2 tablespoons butter or ghee Instructions: Pat dry the whole chicken, and then make slits on it. Whisk together the yogurt, oil, garlic ginger paste, cl powder, kasuri methi, cardamom if using, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, pepper, food coloring and salt in a bowl to make a smooth paste. Add the chicken and mix it well, making sure that the marinade is coating the chicken and rubbed into the slits. Cover the bowl and refrigerate 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Preheat a tandoor or grill to the highest heat for 20 to 30 minutes. Grill the chicken until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Smoke the chicken: Put an iron skillet on the high heat, then add the tandoori chicken and immediately pour in the ghee or butter. It will begin to smoke immediately. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 61208,&quot;Lemon Blueberry Pancakes 1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon cake flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 heaping tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups evaporated milk (more if needed) 1 lemon, zested and juiced (more juice if lemon isn&#39;t very juicy) 2 tablespoons butter, melted, plus more softened for serving 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 large egg 1 cup blueberries Maple or pancake syrup, warmed, for serving Instructions: Heat a heavy skillet or grill over medium-low heat. In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In a separate bowl, mix the evaporated milk, lemon zest and juice. Allow to sit for 5 minutes, then add the egg and vanilla. Mix to combine. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently to combine. Stir in the melted butter. Splash in more evaporated milk if the mixture is overly thick. Stir in the blueberries. Melt a little of the softened butter in the heated skillet. Drop the batter by 1/4 or 1/3 cup measures and fry the pancakes on both sides for a couple of minutes until golden. Serve with more softened butter and warm syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 61209,&quot;Baked Croissant French Toast With Orange Syrup 3 large eggs 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 1 cup whole milk Grated zest of 1 orange 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 4 croissants 1/2 cup orange marmalade Instructions: Whisk the eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, the milk, orange zest, orange juice and vanilla in a large bowl. Put the croissants in an 8-inch-square flameproof baking dish, squeezing them in to fit in a single layer. Pour the egg mixture over the croissants, then put a plate on top and press down to keep them submerged. Let soak in the refrigerator, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plate from the croissants, cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake until set, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn on the broiler. Uncover the baking dish, sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and broil until the sugar is bubbling in spots, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the marmalade with 1/4 cup water in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until warm, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve on the side.

Put the potatoes in a pot and add water to cover them by about 2 inches. Salt the water generously. Cover the pot and set it over high heat. Bring the water to a boil, then add the eggs. Reduce the heat to a brisk simmer and cook, covered, until the potatoes can just be pierced by a fork, about 15 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the eggs from the pot and set them aside. Drain the potatoes and place them in a large bowl. Rinse the eggs under cold running water until cool enough to handle. Peel and chop 2 of the eggs and add them to the potatoes. Add the onion, pimento, and relish to the potatoes. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise and mustard. Spoon over the potato salad, season with salt and pepper, and mix gently. Peel the remaining egg and slice it, placing the slices on top of the potato salad. Sprinkle with the paprika. Serve immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Serve chilled or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 61212,&quot;Spicy Salami Mozzarella Sticks with Vodka Sauce 36 very thin slices spicy salami, about 3 1/2 to 4 inches in diameter 18 mozzarella string cheese sticks 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 5 large eggs, lightly beaten with 1/4 cup water 3/4 cup Italian-style breadcrumbs 1 quart canola oil, for frying Vodka Sauce, warmed, recipe follows 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped 2 large cloves fresh garlic, minced Kosher salt 1/4 cup vodka 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes One 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes 1/4 cup heavy cream, at room temperature Instructions: Form the sticks: Place two slices of salami on a cutting board so that they are overlapping and slightly longer than the mozzarella stick. Wrap up the mozzarella stick so it is completely covered in the salami and transfer, seam side down, to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Repeat wrapping the remaining mozzarella sticks with the salami. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. While the mozzarella sticks are chilling, place the flour, egg mixture and breadcrumbs in separate wide shallow containers. Working with one at a time, roll the mozzarella sticks in the flour and shake off any excess. Roll the sticks in the egg mixture, then in the breadcrumbs. Double coat by rolling the sticks in the egg mixture and breadcrumbs a second time. Arrange on a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with all of the sticks and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Fry the sticks: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Pour the oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed pot and heat over medium heat until it reaches 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Working in batches, carefully drop the sticks into the oil and gently \u201cswirl\u201d the oil so they fry more evenly on all sides. Fry until they are light to medium brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the mozzarella sticks with a slotted spoon or spider and lay them out in a single layer on the wire rack. Repeat until all are cooked. Keep warm in the oven if needed. Serve: Serve the mozzarella sticks with warm vodka sauce for dunking. In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and garlic and season with salt. Stir in the vodka, sugar and red pepper flakes and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook for an additional 5 to 8 minutes over high heat, stirring from time to time. Taste for seasoning. Stir in the cream. Puree in a blender until smooth. Set aside until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 61213,&quot;Filet of Beef au Poivre 6 filet mignon, cut 1 1/4 inches thick Kosher salt 2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper 3 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 3/4 cup chopped shallots (3 to 4 shallots) 1 cup canned beef broth 1/2 cup good Cognac or brandy Instructions: Place the filets on a board and pat them dry with paper towels.

In a large skillet, heat about 1/2 cup of the oil over low heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, add the prosciutto slices to the oil in the pan and cook until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to remove them. Place them on the kitchen towel to drain. Next, add the sage leaves and cook until they pale in color and become crispy, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove and season them with salt. Set aside. Make the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and red wine vinegar. Prepare the chicken cutlets: Prepare another baking sheet fitted with parchment paper. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken cutlets with the oregano and salt. Put the eggs in one bowl and the breadcrumbs in another. Dip each piece of chicken in the egg (on both sides) and then the breadcrumbs. Shake any excess off each one. Cook the chicken cutlets: Add the remaining oil to the pan used to fry the prosciutto and heat it until it smokes lightly. Use a pair of tongs to carefully add a couple of the chicken cutlets to the oil in a single layer. Cook over medium heat on the first side until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn on their second side and cook 3 to 5 additional minutes. Cut a small incision in the middle of each cutlet to make sure they are completely cooked. If any are underdone, place in a warm oven to cook for a few additional minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining cutlets. Assemble the sandwiches: Spoon a generous helping of the mayonnaise mixture on the bottom half of the roll. Top with a mound of lettuce. Top with the chicken cutlets, some Parmesan, sage leaves and prosciutto slices. Drizzle with additional mayonnaise if desired. Top with the other half of the roll. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 61218,&quot;Cherry Lime Ricky 6 fresh cherries, pitted 1/2 lime, cut into 3 wedges 2 teaspoons sugar 3 ounces gin 1 cup crushed ice Instructions: Put the cherries, lime, and sugar into a large rocks glass.

Working 1 potato at a time, slice very thin on the mandoline. It is important to work with purpose here (quickly) because the potatoes will discolor. Do not put the potatoes in water because this will wash the starch off the potatoes. Coat an 8-inch nonstick saute pan with olive oil, using the potato slices starting from the center make concentric circles of potatoes. Remember that eventually the bottom will be the top so it is important for the first circles of potatoes to look pretty. Brush each layer with olive oil and every 2nd or 3rd layer sprinkle liberally with grated Parmigiano and salt. After every layer of potatoes press the potatoes so they are very compact. Repeat this process with the remaining 2 potatoes. Place the pan of potatoes over medium heat and cook until the olive oil begins to sizzle and the potatoes begin to brown on the bottom. Put the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and place a tight fitting lid on the pan. Drain the excess oil out the side of the pan. THIS STEP IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!! After the excess oil has been drained, completely flip the pan so the cake is turned out onto the bottom of the lid, then slide the cake off the lid back into the pan so the brown side of the cake is now up and the top becomes the bottom. We see now why draining the excess oil is important- if you attempt this without draining the oil it will drain out on your wrist and burn you. Return the cake to the oven and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes or until the cake is fork tender.

Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let the mixture sit for 30 minutes. Pour the brine into a plastic container or pot large enough to hold the turkey, add 20 cups (5 quarts) ice water and stir to combine. Submerge the turkey, adding more ice water if needed. Weigh it down with a plate to keep it submerged and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. The next day, drain, rinse and pat the turkey dry. Put on a large paper-towel-lined cutting board and let sit out at room temperature until it reaches room temperature, about 1 hour. Mix the butter, garlic, rosemary, fennel, lemon zest and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl until well combined. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Pat the turkey skin dry again and rub the porchetta spiced butter evenly over the surface, also getting underneath the skin of the breasts. Lay the turkey in a large roasting pan as flat as possible. If the pan is a bit small, tuck the wings behind the back with the drumsticks resting on the ledge of the pan and place a large rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil at the bottom of the oven to catch drippings. Roast until a thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 30 minutes before serving. Garnish the serving platter with lemons, rosemary and bay leaves if using.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61239,&quot;Dark Chocolate Brownie Sundae 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter 12 ounces (about 2 cups) bittersweet chocolate chips, plus 1/3 cup (or use chopped bittersweet chocolate) 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar 4 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Dark chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce, chocolate-covered nuts and/or other sundae toppings Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325? F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with foil or parchment paper, leaving an overhang on 2 sides. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder and salt in a medium bowl. Combine the butter and 12 ounces chocolate chips in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, until melted and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in both sugars until dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat, then whisk in the eggs and vanilla until fully combined. Whisk in the flour mixture until the batter is completely smooth. Spread the batter evenly in the baking dish, then scatter the remaining 1/3 cup chocolate chips on top. Bake until the top has a slightly matte finish and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, 30 to 35 minutes (these are fudgy brownies). Transfer the pan to a rack and let cool completely (or let cool 15 minutes and serve slightly warm). Slice the brownies and serve with chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce, chocolate-covered nuts and/or other sundae toppings.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 61240,&quot;Simple Roast Chicken with Gravy One 4- to 5-pound chicken, giblets removed and reserved for another use Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 sprigs thyme 3 cloves garlic, unpeeled 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 cups homemade chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth Instructions: Pat the chicken dry inside and out with paper towels, and let sit at room temperature to take the chill off, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 450 degrees F. Put a rack in a small roasting pan. Season the cavity of the chicken generously with salt and pepper, and stuff it with the thyme and garlic. Tie the legs together with butcher&#39;s twine. Season the outside with salt (generously) and a few grinds of pepper, and place the chicken breast-side up on the rack. (Seasoning the chicken when on the rack could result in gravy that&#39;s too salty.) Roast the chicken until the skin is golden brown and crispy and a thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the thigh registers 165 to 170 degrees F, depending on how you like your dark meat, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let the chicken rest on the rack for a few minutes, then carefully tip it forward to drain all the collected juices into the roasting pan. Discard the thyme and garlic. Let the chicken rest on a cutting board while you make the gravy. (To transfer the chicken easily, hold a wooden spoon handle in the cavity with one hand and use the other hand to lift the chicken with tongs.) Remove the rack from the pan, and pour the pan drippings into a small bowl. Skim off 2 tablespoons of the fat, and stir them into the flour and 2 tablespoons water in another small bowl. Heat the roasting pan over medium-high heat, add the wine, scrape up any browned bits and simmer until the wine reduces by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken stock and any remaining pan drippings, bring to a simmer, add the flour mixture and whisk constantly until the liquid thickens into a gravy, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the gravy with salt and pepper. Remove the butcher&#39;s twine from the chicken. Snip off the wingtips using kitchen shears; reserve to make stock. Remove the leg quarters by slicing between the thigh and the body, then finding the hip joints near the backbone and slicing through them. Separate the drumsticks and thighs, and transfer to a platter. Sit the carcass upright; snip out the backbone and reserve it to make stock. Lay the breast skin-side up and slice in half through the breastbone. Separate the wings and breast, and transfer to the platter. Serve the chicken with the warm gravy. Reserve the carcass to make stock. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61241,&quot;Arancini Al Ragu 6 cups beef stock 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon saffron strands 2 1/2 cups Arborio rice 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 cup grated Pecorino 1 pound ground beef 8 ounces ground pork Sea salt and freshly ground pepper 4 ounces pancetta, finely chopped 1 teaspoon olive oil 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped 1 small carrot, finely chopped 1 celery stick, finely chopped 1 bay leaf 1/2 cup white wine 1 cup tomato puree 2 tablespoons tomato paste dissolved in 1 cup warm water 3/4 cup peas 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 8 ounces mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch cubes 1 1/2 cups flour Salt 2 cups plain breadcrumbs Canola oil, for frying Instructions: For the rice: In a medium saucepot over high heat, add the beef stock, butter, salt and saffron. When the stock reaches a boil, add the rice and stir it a bit to prevent sticking. Let it come to a rolling boil and lower the heat a bit to medium. Stir the rice once in a while, you want the rice to absorb all of the liquid; it should take 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the rice; it should be slightly al dente but creamy. Remove the pot from the heat, add the cheeses and stir well. Pour the rice onto a baking sheet and spread into a thin layer. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool, preferably overnight in the fridge. For the ragu: Mix the ground beef and pork together with your hands and add salt and pepper generously. Set aside. In a medium saucepot over medium low heat, saute the pancetta with the olive oil until the fat is melted. Add the onions and let cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the carrot and celery along with the bay leaf and cook until soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the ground meat and turn the heat to high. Keep mixing with a wooden spoon until the meat is well done and browned. Add the white wine and stir until it is evaporated. Add the tomato puree and tomato paste in water. Bring to a boil, and then lower the heat to medium, stirring occasionally. There will be some fat that comes to the top. Skim it off with a ladle but you want to leave some for the flavor. Let cook for about 1 1/2 hours. About 5 minutes before the ragu is done, saute the peas in a touch of butter with a pinch of salt and add to the ragu. Put the ragu in a bowl and set aside to cool. You can leave it overnight covered in the fridge. For the filling and assembly: Portion out cooled rice into identical portions. We weigh ours to 1.6 ounces. Take one portion and form it into a semi-circle in the palm of your hand, making a cup-like shape to place the ragu and mozzarella into. Scoop a generous amount of ragu, about 2 teaspoons, into the half ball and then a few cubes of mozzarella. Take another portion of rice and flatten it into a disk shape. Place that disk over the half ball to enclose the ragu and cheese in the center. Have a bowl of warm water nearby to dip your hands into&#39; it&#39;ll make the process easier and less sticky. Roll the ball around to enclose all ingredients in the center and shape into a perfectly round ball. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. For the batter and breading: Place the flour and 1 1/2 cups cold water into a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Mix with a whisk until smooth and about the consistency of eggnog. Add the breadcrumbs to a large bowl or baking dish. Roll each rice ball in the batter and shake off excess batter. Then roll each ball in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with all the balls. Use a heavy duty pot with enough canola oil to submerge the balls in. Make sure the oil isn&#39;t near the top of the pot because it will overflow when you drop your balls in. Bring the oil to 350 degrees F, using a high temp thermometer if you have one. If not you can throw a small piece of white bread in to test; it should brown quickly and float when the oil is hot enough. Use a slotted spoon or wire basket to lower your balls into the hot oil. Don&#39;t overcrowd the balls - maybe 2 or 3 at a time. Fry in batches until they are golden like arancini (\little oranges), about 5 minutes. Remove and place on paper towels to drain. Eat hot. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 61242,&quot;Herby Sausage and Artichoke Baked Pasta 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes One 28-ounce can whole plum tomatoes, crushed by hand One 15-ounce can whole plum tomatoes, crushed by hand 4 large sprigs fresh basil, plus 1 cup chopped fresh basil 1 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more, for serving Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 pound spicy Italian sausage, casing removed 10 ounces frozen artichoke hearts, thawed 1 pound dried rigatoni 3 cups shredded fontina cheese 1 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add both cans of tomatoes and 1 cup of water. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat slightly, add the basil sprigs and simmer rapidly, uncovered, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard the basil sprigs and stir in the chopped basil and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon, until brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a large bowl with a slotted spoon. Add the artichokes to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until hot, about 3 minutes. Add the artichokes to the bowl with the sausage. Cook the rigatoni in the salted boiling water until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than the package directions. Drain the pasta and add it to the bowl. Add the tomato sauce, half of the fontina and half of the Parmesan to the bowl and stir well to combine. Transfer the pasta to a 3- to 4-quart baking dish and top with the remaining fontina and Parmesan. Bake, uncovered, until browned, about 15 minutes. Let the pasta stand about 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 61243,&quot;\Eye-studded\ Turkey Tenderloin (Pearl Onions and Black Olives) Cooking spray 2 turkey breast tenderloins Salt and ground black pepper 1/4 cup hoisin sauce 2 frozen pearl onions, thawed 1 large black olive, halved crosswise Wooden pick Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions for al dente. While the pasta cooks, trim the top and bottom off of each squash. Peel the squash in ribbons into a colander, using a vegetable peeler, turning the squash as you peel. Stop peeling the squash when you only have the center core of seeds left. Discard the core and seeds. Reserve 1/4 cup of the pasta water, and then drain the pasta over the squash ribbons. Put in a medium bowl and toss to evenly distribute the pasta with the squash ribbons. Toss the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and some pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, spread into a single layer and cook without stirring, until just turning pink around the edges, about 2 minutes. Stir the shrimp, add the tomatoes, garlic and pepper flakes and continue to cook until the tomatoes have softened and the garlic has toasted, about 1 minute. Add the pasta and squash ribbons, broth and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Cook, tossing, until warmed through and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Add the pasta water a bit at a time, if needed, if the noodles seem dry. Season with additional salt and pepper. Divide among 4 bowls and top with the chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 61245,&quot;Sour Cherry Bulgur Salad Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Olive oil, for drizzling<br> 1 cup bulgur wheat<br> 1 cup chopped sour cherries<br> 2/3 cup finely chopped fresh parsley 2/3 cup finely chopped toasted walnuts<br> 1/2 cup finely chopped red onion<br> 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh dill 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 2 cloves grated garlic<br> 1/2 cup crumbled feta<br> Instructions: Add 2 cups water to a medium saucepot.

With your fingers, work the wine gradually into the dry ingredients to form a stiff dough. Form into a ball, wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thickness. With a cutter, cut out rounds 5-inches in diameter. In batches, as necessary, wrap each round onto a cannoli mold, sealing the edges with egg white. In a deep saute pan, heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry the cannoli in batches until just golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels, let cool, then gently slip the molds from the cannoli. (Note: Shells can be made 3 days in advance and kept at room temperature in an airtight container.) For the filling: In a mixing bowl whip the cream. Fold in the ricotta with a rubber spatula, working until creamy. Fold in the sugar, nut liqueur, and dates. Place 1 cannoli shell on a flat surface. Working from either end, fill the cannoli with the ricotta filling (using a pastry bag, if desired), pressing gently to ensure that the middle is filled. Dip both ends in the melted chocolate, then into the pistachios and place on a waxed paper lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining cannoli, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 61257,&quot;Sourdough Pancakes 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup Sourdough Starter, recipe follows 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 cup milk 1 egg, beaten 2 tablespoons oil Butter or cooking spray, for griddle 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups warm water 1 package dry yeast 1/4 cup sugar 1 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees F) 1 cup all-purpose flour Instructions: Combine flour, Starter, sugar, baking powder, salt and soda in a medium mixing bowl and mix.

Find a durable, thick cloth and fold it over several times to create a square; this will steady the oysters as you shuck them and also protect your hand. Using the towel as a mitt, hold the oyster firmly on a flat surface. Insert the tip of your oyster knife between the shell halves, and work it around 1 side to the other as you pry it open. Using the knife, cut the muscles away from the top, flat shell, bend the shell back, and discard it. Run the knife underneath the oyster to detach it completely, but leave it in its shell (take care not to cut the meat itself). Nestle the oysters in a bed of crushed ice or wet rock salt to keep them steady. Serve immediately. For the Cucumber Mignonette Sauce: In a small bowl, combine the rice wine vinegar, shallots, ginger, cucumber, sugar and black pepper; mixing with a fork. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or up to the day before you plan to serve, to allow the flavors to come together. Serve with raw oysters. For the Cocktail Sauce: Mix ingredients in a blender to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 61282,&quot;The Cluckster Chicken Sandwich 1/2 cup salt Four 6- to 7-ounce chicken breasts, butterflied<br> 3 cups buttermilk<br> 2 cups buffalo sauce<br> 2 ounces butter<br> 3 cups all-purpose flour 5 teaspoons paprika<br> 4 teaspoons ground white pepper<br> 3 teaspoons garlic salt<br> 1 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1 teaspoon dry mustard<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon celery salt<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil<br> 1/3 teaspoon oregano<br> 1 quart rice bran oil 1 cup ranch dressing<br> 4 brioche buns<br> 1 cup shredded lettuce<br> Pickle chips, for serving<br> Instructions: For the chicken: Stir together salt and 2 quarts water in a large bowl, then add chicken and let brine for 2 hours. Remove from brine and add chicken to buttermilk. Let sit for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine buffalo sauce and butter in a saucepan and heat until butter is melted. For the dredging mixture: Stir together the flour, paprika, white pepper, garlic salt, ginger, dry mustard, black pepper, celery salt, salt, basil and oregano in a large wide dish. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk and coat in the dredging mixture. For the sandwiches: Heat the rice bran oil to 350 degrees F in a heavy-duty skillet. Cook the dredged chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 3 minutes per side. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes. Toss the fried chicken in a large bowl with the buffalo sauce. Reserve any remaining sauce to serve on the side for some extra kick. Add ranch dressing to both the tops and bottoms of the buns and add 1/4 cup shredded lettuce and 4 pickle chips to each sandwich. Top with chicken. Serve sandwiches with any leftover ranch or buffalo sauce on the side.

Stir in the flour and seasonings and mix well. Cover and let rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Into a saucepan of lightly salted, simmering water drop spoonfuls of the batter and poach for about 5 minutes. Test one for doneness by cutting it open; the batter should be completely firm in the center. Drain the dumpling and toss them in melted butter with a little chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61285,&quot;Almond-Pine Nut Macaroons 2 cups (10 ounces) untoasted pine nuts 8 ounces almond paste 1 cup superfine sugar 2 large egg whites, room temperature Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 cookie trays with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Spread the pine nuts onto a jelly-roll pan lined with waxed or parchment paper. Break the almond paste into chunks and place in the bowl of a food processor. Add the sugar and process until the mixture is homogenous, stopping once to scrape down the bowl using a rubber spatula. Add the egg whites and process until smooth. Scrape again and process for a few more seconds. The mixture will be sticky, but with a light touch and moist hands it can be gently rolled. Keep a damp towel nearby to wipe and wet your hands. Using damp hands, round the mix into scant 1-inch balls and drop the balls onto the tray of pine nuts. Once you have 3 to 4 balls formed, roll them in the nuts to cover completely. Place about 16 balls 1 1/2-inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake the first tray while preparing the second, until the cookies are pale golden, and puffy, about 25 minutes. Place the baking sheets on wire cooling racks and cool the cookies completely before lifting them off. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days, or freeze for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61286,&quot;Salvadoran Pulled Pork Pupusas with Pickled Cabbage 1/2 medium green cabbage, shredded 1 chayote squash, shredded 2 carrots, shredded 1 red onion, thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced 1 1/2 cups cider vinegar 1 cup water 1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano leaves, crushed 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1/2 tablespoon salt 3 pounds pork butt, trimmed and cubed 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 6 cups water 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes 1 sweet onion, diced 2 cloves garlic 1 jalapeno, diced 1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon For the corn dough: 3 1/2 cups masa harina 2 1/4 cups warm water 1/2 teaspoon salt Olive oil 1 1/2 cups shredded Cotija cheese Instructions: For the pickled cabbage: Combine the vegetables in a large bowl. In a medium saucepan, add the vinegar, water, spices, brown sugar and salt and bring to a boil. Pour the hot pickling liquid over the vegetables. Mix the ingredients well and let stand for at least 24 hours before serving, stirring occasionally. This mixture will keep for 2 to 3 weeks covered in the refrigerator. For the pork filling: Season the pork with the salt and pepper and place in a medium saucepan. Add enough water to cover by 2-inches, about 6 cups. Bring to a simmer and partially cover the pot; cook until the meat is very tender and almost all of the liquid has evaporated, about 3 hours. Uncover the pork and let it slightly pan fry in its own fat, stirring, until golden brown. Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, jalapeno, oregano and cinnamon in a blender. Puree until smooth. Add the tomato mixture to the pork in the saucepan and stir to loosen any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Lower the heat and simmer for another 30 minutes, or until pork is falling apart and most of the liquid has reduced from the sauce. The pork mixture should be very thick. Set aside to cool while you prepare the masa dough. (This will yield more pork than you need for this recipe but any leftover can be frozen and/or used in other recipes. It makes a great filling for tacos, burritos, quesadillas or enchiladas and also works well as a sandwich filling when mixed with a tangy barbecue sauce.) For the dough: In a bowl, combine the masa harina with the warm water and salt mix until soft dough forms. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes. Stir in up to a 1/4 cup of cold water, until the dough become soft but not sticky. Divide the dough into 16 golf ball size pieces. Keep the dough covered as you work. To form a pupusa: Rub the palm of your hands with a little olive oil. While holding of the dough balls in 1 hand, press the thumb of the other hand in the middle of the ball of dough to form an indentation, then turning the dough, begin to flatten it with your fingertips into a 4-inch concave disk resembling a small bowl. In the center of the disk add 2 tablespoons of the pork and 1/2 tablespoon of the shredded cheese. Bring the edges of the dough together over the filling and squeeze to form a seal. Working gently, press the dough into a flattened disk, flattening the dough middle and edges to form a thick pancake shape about 4-inches in diameter. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Lightly rub the pupusas with oil and place them on a heated, greased griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each side until golden brown in spots and slightly puffy, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve hot, with a serving of the pickled cabbage on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 61287,&quot;Elegant Shrimp and Artichoke Salad 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper 1 can (14 ounces) artichoke hearts, rinsed, drained and chopped 1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened<br> 1 packet (1 ounce) Hidden Valley?

Transfer to a counter dusted lightly with flour and knead gently until the dough comes together and is smooth, about 1 minute. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. With your hands, flatten and shape one piece of dough into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Dust it lightly with flour and pass it through the widest setting on the pasta machine. If the dough comes out oddly shaped, reform into a rectangle. Fold it in thirds, like a letter, and if necessary, flatten it to a 1/2-inch thickness. Pass it through the widest setting again with the seam of the letter perpendicular to the rollers. Repeat this folding and rolling step 10 to 12 times, dusting the dough with flour if it becomes sticky. Without folding the dough, pass it through the next setting on the pasta machine. Keep reducing the space between the rollers after each pass, lightly dusting the pasta with flour on both sides each time, until the pasta is about 1/16-inch thick and 3 inches wide. Lay the rolled-out dough on a counter. Roll out the remaining dough in the same manner. Cut each strip of dough into 11-inch lengths. Cut the dough into fettuccine. (Alternatively, use store-bought dried or fresh fettuccine.) For the meat: Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook slowly until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels. Increase the heat to high, add the chuck and pork to the pan and season with the fennel, cl flakes, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drain the excess fat from the pan. For the quick bolognese sauce: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the celery, fennel, onion and carrot and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and ground fennel and cook for 1 minute more. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and chicken stock and cook until the tomatoes begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Coarsely mash the tomatoes using a potato masher or wooden spoon, season with salt and pepper and cook until the sauce comes to a boil and begins to thicken slightly, about 15 minutes. Add the cooked bacon, chuck and pork to the pan and continue cooking until the sauce is thick, about 15 minutes more. Fold in the parsley and oregano and season with salt and pepper. For the garlic bread: Preheat the broiler. Place the ciabatta on a baking sheet cut-side up. Heat it under the broiler until lightly golden brown. Combine the butter, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Slather the garlic butter over the bread and broil until bubbly and golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove, let cool for a few minutes and cut into slices. To serve: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente, about 4 minutes (if using dried noodles, follow package directions). Reserve a cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta. Put about 2 cups of the sauce in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the pasta, creme fraiche, some of the pasta water and a few handfuls of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Toss, top with the parsley and serve. Reserve remaining sauce for another use. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Aglianico]&quot; 61292,&quot;Go-To Vanilla Cupcakes 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon fine salt<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 2/3 cup sugar<br> 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted<br> 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> Your favorite frosting, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position a rack in the middle of the oven.

Place parchment paper on baking sheet. Mix together cheeses, parsley, egg yolk, garlic, pepper and Essence. Lay out the prosciutto on a flat surface so it overlaps slightly. It should create a surface that is about 12 to 13 inches long. Place the cheese mixture in the center of the prosciutto and roughly shape into a mummy form. Wrap the prosciutto around the cheese mixture sealing it in completely and reshape the mixture to look like a mummy with a rounded head and the body tapering at the bottom. Place a sheet of phyllo on a work surface, brush with melted butter, repeat with 2 more sheets, placing them on top of one another. Do not brush top sheet with butter. Lay the prosciutto wrapped cheese in the center of the phyllo and wrap the phyllo around the \mummy. Butter the outside of the phyllo and then reshape into the mummy shape.

To make the marinade: while the steak is cooling, toast the cumin seeds in a small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking the constantly so they don&#39;t burn or stick, just until they are fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let them cool, Squeeze the juice from the limes into 1-gallon heavy plastic resealable bag. Add the cumin seeds, garlic, salt, and the pepper flakes and swish the marinade around to dissolve the salt. Slip the cooled steaks into the marinade, press out most of the air from the bag, and seal the bag very tightly. Refrigerate the beef for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day, turning the bag several times. To prepare the accompaniments, heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep, skillet over medium heat. Stir in the red onions and cook, stirring often, until they are wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the green peppers and cook until they are wilted enough t make room for the red peppers. Add the red peppers, season the vegetables lightly with salt and adjust the heat to low. Cook, stirring often, until tender, about 20 minutes. The vegetables can be prepared several hours in advance. Reheat them over low heat just before serving. To prepare the fajitas indoors: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil. Reheat the vegetables if necessary. Drain the steak well and discard the marinade. Heat a lightly oiled large grill pan or heavy skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Cook the steak, turning once, just until seared on both sides, about 5 minutes. At this point the steak will be about medium-rare. Turn off the heat and continue cook in the hot pan for a more well-done steak. Remove the steak from the skillet to a carving board and let it rest about 5 minutes. Pop the tortillas into the oven and let them warm while the steak is resting. To prepare the fajitas on a charcoal or gas grill: Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil. Reheat the vegetables if necessary, using a corner of the grill if there is room. Drain the steak well and discard the marinade. Cook the steak on the hottest part of the grill until both sides are well browned, about 6 minutes. The steak at this point will be about medium-rare, move the steak to a cooler part of the grill and continue to cook it for a more well-done steak. Remove the steak to a carving board and let it rest about 5 minutes. Set the tortilla on a moderately hot part of the grill and let them warm, turning once or twice, while the steak rests. To serve: Cut the steak crosswise into thin slices and pile the slices on a serving plate. Serve the vegetables directly from the skillet or scoop them into a serving bowl. Pass the tortillas, salsa, sour cream, steak, and vegetables around the table and let everyone dress their own fajitas as they like. Prepare stovetop smoker with soaked wood chips according to manufacturers&#39; instructions. Trim any excess fat from the surface of the steak and cut the steak in half crosswise. Season the skirt steak with a generous rubbing of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper or Southwestern rub. One end of the steak will be considerably thinner and cook faster than the other half. If you would like to cook both halves to the same doneness, add the thinner pieces to the smoker after the thicker pieces have been smoking for about 8 minutes. If you are not planning to finish the steak on the grill as described above, smoke the halves until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each half registers 125 degrees F. for a medium-rare steak, about 24 minutes after closing the smoker lid, longer for more well done steaks. (Skirt steaks are a little tricky to check for doneness with an instant-read thermometer. Poke the thickest part of the steak with the thermometer in a few places, aiming for the center of the steak.) If you do plan to grill the steak after smoking, cook the steaks to a temperature of 100 to 105 degrees F, which will take about 18 minutes. The steaks can be smoked up to 2 days before grilling them. Smoke the tomatoes according to the directions below. Cool them to room temperature. Peel off as much of the skins as will come off easily. Chop the tomatoes coarsely and toss them together with the chiles, red onion and cilantro in a bowl. Season with salt to taste. The salsa improves if it stands at room temperature for about half an hour before serving. You can refrigerate the salsa for up to one day. Bring it to room temperature and drain off any liquid before serving. Prepare stovetop smoker with soaked wood chips according to manufacturers? instructions. Cut the cored from the tomatoes with a paring knife then cut the tomatoes in half through the core end. Squeeze out the seeds and juice. Line the tomato halves side by side and cut side up on the smoking rack. Season the cut side of the tomatoes with a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Smoke until the tomatoes are softened, but not mushy; 10 minutes over the heat after closing the smoker lid and about 20 minutes off the heat with the smoker lid closed. Check the tomatoes for doneness after they&#39;ve been standing off the heat for 10 minutes. Serve smoked tomatoes as a side dish with just about any grilled or roasted meat, or seafood dish. Snap the stems off the dried peppers, if using them. For a milder rub, tap out and discard the seeds. Crumble all the peppers into a small saucepan and add the coriander and cumin seeds. Toast the mix over low heat, stirring constantly, until the seeds are lightly browned and little wisps of smoke rise from the pan. Pour the spices onto a plate and cool them to room temperature. Grind them to a powder in a spice mill. Store the rub in an airtight jar in a cool, dark place for up to two weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]</p><p>These four wines are excellent choices to pair with the flavors in the recipe.

Butterfly the chicken breasts open by cutting into and across but not all the way through the breast with a sharp knife. Lightly pound out the chicken under plastic wrap and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set up a breading station: 1 pan of flour, 1 pan of eggs beaten with 2 tablespoons flour and a splash of milk, and 1 pan of bread crumbs seasoned with nutmeg and combined with cheese. Coat the chicken pieces in the flour, then in the egg and then in the bread crumb mixture. Set aside. Arrange a cooling rack over a baking sheet and put it in the middle of the oven. Add the butter to a pot with tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Add the orzo to the warm butter and toast for 2 to 3 minutes, then add garlic and stir a minute more. Add rice and coat in butter. Stir in the stock and the saffron threads and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pot. Cook the rice until tender, about 17 to 18 minutes. Add the parsley and fluff with a fork. Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a very large skillet over medium heat. Fry the chicken, 2 cutlets at a time, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer the first 2 cutlets to the cooling rack in the oven to keep warm while you cook the second batch. While the chicken cooks, combine the tomatoes, onions, basil, tarragon, and 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer the chicken from the oven to serving dishes and top with the raw tomato sauce. Serve the Milanese rice alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 61320,&quot;Potato Pizzas with Arugula Salad 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the baking sheets 1 pound prepared pizza dough 2 large red-skinned potatoes (12 ounces), very thinly sliced (we love a mandolin for this) 1/2 cup thinly sliced red onions 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus some larger shavings for topping the pizzas One 5-ounce container baby arugula (about 6 cups) 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar Serving suggestion: sliced salami or prosciutto.

Toss the potatoes, onions, garlic and thyme in a medium bowl with 2 tablespoons of the oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Divide the mixture among the 4 crusts and sprinkle with the grated cheese. Bake until the crusts are golden and crisp and the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the arugula with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and the vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Top the warm pizzas with the salad and some Parmesan shavings. Serve with salami and/or prosciutto to complete the meal. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]</li></ol><p>&quot; 61321,&quot;Kent&#39;s BBQ Cornbread 1 tablespoon butter, for greasing the pan, plus 1 1/2 cups butter, melted 3/4 pound left over BBQ pork or beef 1 1/2 cups white sugar 6 eggs 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk 1 1/2 (15-ounce) cans cream-style corn 1/4 cup drained canned chopped green cl peppers 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese (Recommended: combination Monterey Jack and Cheddar) 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal 2 tablespoons baking powder Pinch salt 6 tablespoons butter 3 tablespoons your favorite bbq sauce 1 1/2 tablespoons cayenne pepper 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly butter a deep 9 by 13-inch baking dish. Shred left over BBQ into fine pieces and set aside. In a large bowl, stir together the butter, milk, and sugar. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, until well incorporated. Add the creamed corn, chiles, cheese, and shredded BBQ and stir until well incorporated. In a separate bowl, stir together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Add flour mixture to corn mixture; stir until smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan.

Remove from the bag and let cool until cool enough to handle, then cut the larger potatoes into sixths and the smaller ones into fourths. In a mid-sized pan on the stovetop or on a grill on medium heat, add the bacon and cook until crispy. Remove the bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving the bacon fat in the pan. Roughly chop the bacon and set aside. Add the butter to the bacon fat. Once it has melted, add the potatoes in one layer if possible. (If not, do the potatoes in batches.) Cook the potatoes on one side until a peek beneath reveals a golden crust, 10 to 15 minutes, then toss and repeat. Do this a few times; if doing in batches, you can pile the cooked potatoes on the side of the pan while the new ones get attention. Once the potatoes are almost done, push them all to the sides of the pan. To the center of the pan add the peppers, onions, steak seasoning, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook the veggies, stirring, until the peppers and onions are tender but still have some crunch, about 5 minutes. Add the bacon back to the pan and toss everything together. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with the scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 61324,&quot;BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich with Watercress Salad with Shaved Fennel and Grapefruit 4 ounces watercress 4 slices or wedges ruby grapefruit 1/2-ounce shaved fennel Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 lemon, juiced 1/2-ounce extra-virgin olive oil 2 1/2 ounces BBQ sauce 5 ounces sliced beef brisket 3 slices sharp Cheddar Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 brioche roll, sliced and toasted Instructions: For the salad: Put the watercress, grapefruit and fennel into a large bowl and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the lemon juice and the olive oil and toss to combine. For the brisket: In a small saute pan, add the BBQ sauce and brisket, and cook over medium heat until beef is hot and cooked through. Top the brisket with 3 slices of Cheddar and toss together until combined. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Put the brisket on the toasted brioche bun and serve with the watercress salad. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 61325,&quot;One-Dish Chicken Macaroni Casserole Kosher salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the baking dish 8 ounces elbow macaroni 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thickly sliced Freshly ground pepper 1 bunch scallions (white and light green parts only), chopped (about 1 cup) 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons dry white wine 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 cup half-and-half Generous pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 3 cups chopped rotisserie chicken, skin and bones removed (or use leftover cooked chicken or turkey)<br> 3 cups chopped rotisserie chicken, skin and bones removed (or use leftover cooked chicken or turkey) 1 1/2 cups frozen peas and carrots, thawed (8 ounces) 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley<br> 4 ounces cream cheese, cut into chunks and softened 1/4 cup breadcrumbs 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter a 3-quart baking dish. When the water is boiling, add the elbow macaroni and cook until very al dente, several minutes shy of the package cooking time. Drain, rinse and pat dry, then put in a large bowl. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter. Add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the mushrooms have given up their liquid. Increase the heat to boil away any excess liquid, about 5 minutes. Add the scallions, thyme and garlic and cook until the scallions are wilted, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the vegetables with the flour and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add the wine and cook until just absorbed. Pour in the chicken broth and half-and-half. Bring to a simmer and season with salt, pepper and the nutmeg. Simmer until the sauce is thickened and has lost the raw flour taste, about 7 minutes. Stir in the chicken, peas and carrots, and parsley and simmer just to heat the chicken through. Off the heat, whisk in the cream cheese until smooth. Pour the chicken and sauce into the bowl with the macaroni and toss well. Spread in the prepared baking dish. In a small bowl, toss together the breadcrumbs and parmesan. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over the top of the baking dish. Dot the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces. Bake until the casserole is very bubbly and the top is crispy and golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 61326,&quot;Maple-Marinated Pineapple Skewers 1 fresh pineapple or 1 (16-ounce) can pineapple chunks 1 cup maple syrup 2 tablespoons dark rum, optional 1/4 cup blueberries 8 to 9-inch wooden skewers, as needed (soaked in warm water for 10 minutes) 1 pint vanilla ice cream Instructions: To prepare the pineapple, pull off the green top by \unscrewing\ it. Reserve the best leaves for decoration by placing them in cold water, trimming them if needed to make their shape a little more perfect. With a large sharp knife, cut the peel off the pineapple and halve it lengthwise. Reserve half the pineapple for another use. Cut the remaining pineapple in half lengthwise and cut out the core. Cut the pineapple into 1 1/2-inch thick slices and then into chunks. In a bowl, whisk together the syrup and rum, if using. Toss the chunks in the maple syrup and thread them, alternating with blueberries, onto the wooden skewers. Lay the skewers in a shallow dish. Pour the remaining syrup over skewers. Cover and chill. (The skewers can be assembled up to a day in advance.) To grill skewers: Brush the fruit 1 more time with maple syrup from the bottom of the dish. Fire up your grill and place the skewers on to cook them, turning occasionally, until caramelized. To serve: Place scoops of vanilla ice cream in dessert bowls, arranging 2 pineapple leaves at the back like rabbit ears, then place a skewer across each bowl. Pour any remaining maple syrup over the ice cream and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61327,&quot;Chocolate-Hazelnut Macarons 3/4 cup blanched hazelnuts 1 cup blanched almonds 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup egg whites (from about 4 eggs) 1/4 cup granulated sugar 7 ounces dark chocolate (disks or chopped bars) 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/3 cup hazelnut praline paste or hazelnut butter (about 3 ounces) 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons finely chopped hazelnuts, toasted Instructions: Grind the nuts: Pulse the blanched hazelnuts in a food processor until finely ground. (Don&#39;t walk away; if you overprocess, you&#39;ll have hazelnut butter.) Transfer to a bowl and repeat with the almonds.<br> Mix the dry ingredients: Combine 3/4 cup of the ground hazelnuts and 1 cup minus 1 tablespoon of the ground almonds in a large bowl. Sift in the cocoa powder and confectioners&#39; sugar. Make the meringue: Whisk the egg whites and granulated sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. (Don&#39;t let the bowl touch the water.)<br> Continue whisking until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. (If you can still feel the sugar, keep whisking.) Turn off the heat but leave the water in the saucepan. Using a rubber spatula, transfer the egg white mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.<br> Beat on medium-high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, 5 to 6 minutes. (If you turn the bowl over, the whites shouldn&#39;t move.)<br> Finish the batter: Fold a few dollops of the meringue into the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until incorporated. Gently fold in the rest until smooth and fluffy, scooping from the bottom of the bowl to the top. Pipe into rounds: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Fit a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch plain tip and fill with the batter; press out the air. Pipe the batter into 1-inch rounds on the baking sheets, about 1 inch apart. Rest and bake: Tap the baking sheets on the counter a few times to remove any air bubbles.<br> Let sit at room temperature until slightly dry, 15 to 30 minutes.<br> Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F.<br> Bake 12 to 14 minutes, or until you can slide a spatula underneath the cookies, switching the position of the pans halfway through. Pull the parchment and cookies off the pans; cool.<br> Make the filling: Meanwhile, bring the water in the saucepan back to a simmer. Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set it over the water.<br> Stir with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is almost completely melted. Remove the bowl from the pan. Heat the heavy cream in a saucepan until simmering. Stir the warm cream and praline paste into the chocolate. Fold in the butter, salt and chopped hazelnuts. Let the filling cool until spreadable, about 15 minutes.<br> Sandwich the cookies: Spread the filling on half of the cookies with the back of a spoon and sandwich with the remaining cookies. Refrigerate the macarons, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, for up to 1 week.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Pinot Noir, Barolo]&quot; 61328,&quot;Chicken Pita Pockets 3 Tyson Grilled and Ready Breast Fillets 3/4 cup ranch-style salad dressing 1 teaspoon dill weed, dried 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 cup mushrooms, fresh; sliced 1 medium onion, thinly sliced, separated into rings 1 cup lettuce, shredded 4 large pita bread pockets, halved Instructions:</p><ol><li>Blend salad dressing and dill in a small bowl.

Drain and reserve about 1 cup of the cooking water. Heat 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil in medium nonstick skillet. Add artichokes to heat through and lightly brown at edges. To clean spinach, fill sink with water, swish spinach around and let grit fall to bottom of sink. Dry leaves before using. In the bowl of a food processor add the shallot, 1/2 cup chicken stock, spinach leaves, mint, almonds and salt and pepper, to taste. If you have a hand held small-holed grater or a zester, grate garlic into the food processor. Adding a whole clove can result in stray big pieces of raw garlic, too bitter to bite down on. If you do not have a hand held grater, mince garlic and mash up into paste with a little salt. Turn processor on and add in about 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil. Scrape the spinach pesto into the artichoke pan and loosely cover with foil. Bring mixture to a simmer over low to medium-low heat and cook for about 2 minutes. Add the reserved pasta cooking water, the pasta and the cheese. Toss to coat the pasta with the sauce and heat for 1 minute.

Line 3 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature covered by a clean kitchen cloth, about 30 minutes. While the pastry is thawing, combine cheese, olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt and cayenne in a small mixing bowl. Stir well to combine. In a clean small mixing bowl, beat the egg with a fork. On a lightly floured surface, gently unfold the pastry. Sprinkle the pastry lightly with flour and using a rolling pin, roll into a 14 by 10-inch rectangle. Brush the top of the pastry with a beaten egg. Cut in 1/2 lengthwise to form 2 (7 by 10-inch) rectangles. Spread the herb-cheese mixture with the back of a spoon evenly across 1 rectangle. Lay the second rectangle across the coated piece, egg side-down. With the rolling pin lightly roll the 2 sheets together to seal. With a large knife cut crosswise into strips, about 1/3-inch wide each. (Alternately, you can use a pizza wheel to cut the strips.) One at a time, grab the ends of each strip and twist in opposite directions to form a spiral. Transfer to the prepared baking sheets. Bake until light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on baking sheets until cool enough to handle. Serve either warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 61334,&quot;Garlic Soup 1 quart chicken stock, preferably homemade or half of stock and water 1 bay leaf Pinch dried sage 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 head of garlic cloves, peeled Salt 1 ounce each of freshly grated Parmesan and Swiss cheese 1 egg mixed with 1 egg yolk 1/4 cup good quality olive oil Freshly ground black pepper 4 toasted bread croutons made of sliced French bread, optional 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped parsley for garnish Instructions: Bring stock to a boil in a nonreactive saucepan (do not use aluminum which will react with eggs which come into play later on). Add bay leaf, sage, thyme and garlic cloves and cook, covered, at a bare simmer for 30 minutes. Strain broth and discard herbs; pass and press garlic through to liquid and season to taste with salt. In a mixing bowl combine the cheese with egg and yolk, olive oil and pepper to taste. Everything can be done in advance up to this point. Just before serving, reheat the soup and drizzle a ladleful of hot soup into the egg and oil mixture to temper the eggs.

(Don&#39;t soak them in water and then drain them. Mushrooms are like little sponges. They&#39;ll suck up water and get mushy.) Trim and discard the dried up part on the end of the mushroom stems.<br> Spread the mushrooms on a large sheet pan and drizzle with some olive oil. Season with salt and toss to coat. Roast the mushrooms for 30 to 45 minutes.<br> Using a paper towel, blot the filets and flank steak to remove excess moisture. Sprinkle both sides of the beef with salt and pepper. Rub the tops of the filets with 1 tablespoon of the chopped thyme. Let the filets sit out, covered, to bring them up to room temperature before cooking.<br> Slice the flank steak lengthwise into 1-inch strips and wrap each filet around the edges with the flank steak strips. You may have leftover flank steak. Tie each filet with kitchen string, or insert a toothpick through to hold the flank steak to the filet.<br> When the mushrooms are roasted and nice and golden brown, remove from the oven, let cool a bit and then roughly chop.<br> Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.<br> In a large fry pan, heat 3 tablespoons of the butter on medium-high heat. As soon as the butter starts to bubble and get frothy, throw in the roasted mushrooms and any oil and drippings from the baking sheet. Saute the mushrooms for 8 to 10 minutes, and then deglaze the pan with the red wine. Cook until most of the red wine has reduced to almost nothing.<br> Add the half-and-half to the pan while stirring the mushrooms. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then lower the heat to a simmer and reduce by half. Add the milk, and reduce that by one-third. You should have nice rich sauce that coats the back of a spoon and holds a line through it. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Keep the sauce warm until ready to serve. (Can place it in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of gently simmering water.)<br> Wash the asparagus, and, with a vegetable peeler, remove the outer layer of asparagus. Cut the asparagus into 2-inch pieces.<br> Heat a large fry pan with 1 teaspoon olive oil and add the bacon. Stir and cook the bacon until it begins to brown. Add the asparagus and cook until just softened. Add the white wine vinegar and cook for a few seconds, and then remove from the heat and keep warm. Heat a large ovenproof fry pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. (If you have a really large frying pan you can put all 4 filets in the pan. If you don&#39;t, cook in batches using 1 tablespoon of oil per batch. You don&#39;t want the steaks to touch. We want to get a nice sear on the outside of the filets and to achieve this, your filets need room.)<br> Add the filets to the hot pan and sear until your filet has relaxed to the point where it will let go of the pan, about 3 minutes on one side, and then flip. Add a generous clump of butter to the hot pan and, when it&#39;s melted, tip the fry pan towards you so the butter pools in one spot. Add the 3 full sprigs of thyme. Now, with a large spoon, start basting your filets with the melted thyme flavored butter. Flip the filets, baste each one again and transfer to the oven for a few minutes until just cooked through to medium.<br> To serve: Plate the Smashed Potatoes with Creme Fraiche just off to one side of the center of the plate. Retrieve your filets from the oven and remove the string or toothpicks. Lean a filet up against the potatoes. Top with the mushroom gravy and place the asparagus in front of the filet. Dust with the chopped parsley. Wash the potatoes and place in a pot of salted water, enough to just cover the tops of the potatoes. Bring to a boil, and then turn down to a simmer and cook until fork tender. (When you stick a fork into the potato and it falls off with no resistance, they&#39;re done.)<br> Drain the potatoes and place on a tea towel or paper towel. With the palm of your hand, lightly smash the potatoes so they just pop open a bit and split. Make sure they kind of keep their shape.<br> In a large fry pan on medium heat, melt the butter and add the garlic, shallots, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon white pepper. When the garlic and shallots are translucent, add the smashed potatoes and toss so they all get kissed with the butter, shallots and garlic. Heat for 5 minutes, and then add the creme fraiche to the pan with half the amount of chopped chives. Toss so everything is nicely coated.<br> Serve family style or on individual plates and top with the rest of the chives and a little lemon zest. The zest gives the spuds an extra little tang and zip. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Barolo]&quot; 61342,&quot;Potage from Meat 2 1/3 pound beef stew meat 4 cups water \Rich juice: 31 ounces (3 cans) concentrated beef broth 1 1/2 cups dry bread crumbs 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 8 threads saffron 5 eggs 1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan or Romano 3/8 cup chopped parsley 3/4 teaspoon dried or 1 teaspoon fresh marjoram 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint 3 tablespoons wine vinegar Salt Instructions: Bring meat and water to a boil and cook 10 minutes; take meat out and cut up small; put back in water with broth, bread crumbs, pepper, and saffron. Simmer 30 minutes over low flame, being careful that it does not stick. Mix in remaining ingredients; cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Ladle into pewter serving bowls and serve warm. Original Recipe for Potage from Meat: Take lean meat and let it boil, then cut it up finely, and cook it again for 30 minutes in rich juice, having first added bread crumbs. Add a little pepper and saffron. When it has cooled a little, add beaten eggs, grated cheese, parsley, marjoram, and finely chopped mint with a little vinegar. Blend them all together in a pot, stirring them slowly with a spoon so that they do not form a ball.

Add the butter and shortening and toss in the flour mixture. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until a pebbly mixture forms. Add 1/3 cup cold water and pulse until a ball of dough forms, adding more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed. Divide the dough in half and sandwich each half between 2 pieces of parchment paper. Press the dough flat so it spreads between the parchment. Transfer to a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. For the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the jam, vinegar and molasses. Set aside. To roll and cut the dough: On a lightly floured surface (or on a sheet of parchment), roll each piece of dough into a 12-inch square. Cut each square into four 3-inch strips. Then, cut each strip into three 4-inch rectangles. Repeat the same with the other piece of dough. You will have a total of 24 rectangular pieces of dough approximately 3 inches by 4 inches. To assemble: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Transfer 6 dough rectangles to each of the baking sheets; these will be the bottom pieces of the toaster pastries. Using a fork, dock the remaining 12 dough rectangles all over; these will be the top pieces of the toaster pastries. Brush a 1/2-inch border along the edges of a bottom piece of dough with the beaten egg. Spread a tablespoon of filling in the center of the piece of dough. Place a piece of the docked dough on top. Gently press from the center outward to press out any air bubbles and to seal the edges. Crimp all around the edges gently with the tines of a fork. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces and filling. You should have 12 toaster pastries total. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the pastries, rotating the baking sheets halfway through, until light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Set the baking sheets on wire racks to let cool. For the icing: In a small bowl, stir together the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk until smooth. Spread the icing over the pastries when cooled.

Cook at a steady boil, adding more water to cover the potatoes if necessary, until the potatoes can be pierced easily with the tip of a knife, 40 to 50 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, make the vodka sauce: Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes and a generous pinch each of salt and black pepper and continue to cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vodka and tomato sauce. Return the saucepan to medium heat and simmer, stirring often, until all the alcohol cooks off, about 7 minutes. Add the cream and cook, stirring often, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan and basil. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Peel the potatoes and cut the flesh into large pieces. Pass the potato flesh through a ricer (or the large holes of a box grater) into a mound on a clean work surface and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Let the potatoes cool completely. Sprinkle the flour over the mound of potatoes. Drizzle the egg over the flour and begin to combine with a fork until everything starts to clump together. Use your hands to gently knead and fully combine the ingredients, about 2 minutes; do not overwork the dough. Gather the dough into a ball. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Cut the dough into 4 wedges. Working with one wedge at a time, roll the dough into a log 3/4 inch in diameter on a lightly floured surface. Use a bench scraper or knife to cut the log into 1-inch pieces. Roll each piece into a ball between your palms. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Transfer half of the potato dough balls to the basket of a 6-quart air fryer, spacing them apart, and spray generously with olive oil cooking spray. Cook at 350 degrees F, shaking the basket halfway through, until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Repeat with the remaining potato dough balls.

Allow it to sit until the yeast starts to bubble, 5 to 10 minutes. In a small bowl, beat the eggs and then pour them into a bowl with the melted butter, whisking constantly. Add the butter/egg mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer. Pour in the milk/sugar/yeast mixture. With the hook attachment, turn the mixer to low speed. Mix the flour and salt in a bowl, and then retrieve 1/2 cup at a time and add it to the mixing bowl, allowing it to slowly incorporate into the liquid mixture. Continue mixing for 5 minutes after the flour is combined. Stop the mixer, scrape the bowl and then mix about 30 seconds more. Then place the dough in a lightly-oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 to 12 hours. The next morning, remove the dough from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature and rise, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Put the dough in a warm spot, if necessary, to facilitate rising. Turn out the dough on to a floured surface and roll it out to about 1/4-inch thick. Use a doughnut cutter (or 2 concentric cutters) to cut out the doughnuts. Remove the holes and transfer the doughnuts to a lightly-floured baking sheet lined with a baking mat or parchment. Then - and this is the vital part - cover the doughnuts lightly with tea towels and place it in a draft-free area, at least 1 1/2 to 2 hours. It will take that long for them to rise. If they don&#39;t seem to be rising much, move the pan to a warm place. Melt the shortening in a pot over a medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F on a candy thermometer. (Or you can drop one of the doughnut holes in the oil, if it sizzles and immediately rises to the surface, the oil is ready.) The doughnuts should immediately float to the top and puff up. Then use a metal spoon or spatula to carefully flip them over to the other side. Remove them from the oil as soon as they&#39;re golden brown on both sides (this should take less than 1 minute in total). At the end, drop in the doughnut holes and fry them until they are golden brown. Place the doughnuts on paper-towel-lined-plates to drain. Don&#39;t worry if they&#39;re a little imperfect; if your fingers leave impressions when you dropped them into the oil, that just means they were extra light and fluffy. For the glaze: To glaze the doughnuts, mix the powdered sugar, 1/2 cup cold water, salt and vanilla in a bowl until smooth. Drop in the doughnuts one at a time. Quickly turn them over then remove them. Place them on a rack so any excess glaze can drip off. To make the most of the glaze, set the holes underneath the doughnuts so they can catch the extra good stuff. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61368,&quot;Grapefruit Margarita 1 quart ruby red grapefruit juice 10 fresh mint leaves , torn in 1/2 2 shots orange liqueur 8 shots tequila Instructions: Combine all the ingredients in a pitcher and stir to combine.

Brush the corn with vegetable oil, sprinkle with a little salt and grill, turning, until slightly charred, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the red onion, garlic, bell peppers and jalape?o. Stir and cook the veggies until they?re soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Cut the corn kernels off the cobs. (You can stand the cob in the center of a Bundt pan to keep the kernels from winding up all over the universe!) In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream and two-thirds of the monterey jack. Mix on low speed until combined. Add the scallions, veggie mixture, corn and canned chiles in their liquid. Mix until just combined. Spread the mixture in a 3-quart baking dish and sprinkle with the rest of the monterey jack and a little chili powder. (At this point, you can cover the pan with foil and keep it in the fridge for up to 2 days. Just let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before baking.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the dip until bubbling and golden, 20 to 22 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve warm with tortilla chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 61384,&quot;Roasted Acorn Squash 2 acorn or dumpling squash, about 1 pound each Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil, optional 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup brown sugar 3 tablespoons amaretto 8 fresh sage leaves 1/2 pound crushed pignoli cookies, almond biscotti, or vanilla wafers Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Split the squash in half through the equator and scrape out the seeds with a spoon. Set the squash halves, cut sides up, on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, if desired. If squash are very large, cut lengthwise into quarters. In a bowl, cream the butter with the sugar, and almond liqueur. With a brush or a spoon coat the cut sides of each squash half with the butter mixture and put 2 sage leaves on top of each. Sprinkle with the crushed cookies. Bake until tender, 30 to 35 minutes, basting every 15 minutes with any remaining butter. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 61385,&quot;Crab Arancini 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 shallots, chopped 1 clove garlic, chopped<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup Arborio rice<br> 1 cup white wine<br> 2 cups seafood broth<br> 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons mascarpone, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest (from 1 large lemon) 2 cups lump crabmeat, picked through for shells<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 eggs, at room temperature<br> 1 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 2 cups jarred marinara, warmed, for serving, optional Instructions: For the risotto: Heat a 3 1/2-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the oil and butter. When the butter is melted, add the shallots and garlic; cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables are soft and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the salt and the rice; stir to coat with the flavors of the pan. Cook for 1 minute, then deglaze with the white wine. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring often, until the wine is almost fully absorbed. Add the broth and stir to combine; cook, stirring often, until the rice is tender but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan, mascarpone, lemon zest, crab and chives. Spread the risotto out on a parchment-lined baking sheet and let cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely cold. For the arancini: Prepare a breading station using three shallow bowls: Place the flour and salt in one bowl, the eggs in another, and the panko in yet another. Using a 1-tablespoon ice cream scoop or spoon, scoop a round of risotto into the palm of your hand and form it into a ball. Roll the ball in the flour, then the egg, and then the panko; make sure the entire ball is well coated. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and repeat with the remaining risotto. Add enough oil to a medium saucepan to come 2 inches up the side of the pan. Heat over medium-high until the oil reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Using a spider or slotted spoon, lower 5 or 6 rice balls into the oil, or as many as the pan will allow without crowding. Fry until deep golden brown and heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Continue with the rest of the rice balls. Serve warm, with marinara alongside for dipping, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 61386,&quot;Squash and Chestnut Lasagna 1/4 pound pancetta, chopped 1 medium yellow onion, minced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons fresh sage leaves, chopped, plus additional leaves for garnish 1 pound fresh chestnuts, shelled and skinned 3 cups butternut squash or pumpkin pieces 2 cups chicken stock 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 egg 1 cup ricotta Pasta Dough, recipe follows 1 cup freshly grated pecorino cheese 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon salt 3 large eggs 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Cornmeal, for dusting Instructions: Place the pancetta in a large skillet over a medium flame. Cook for 5 minutes, until slightly crispy. Toss in the onion and olive oil and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, sage, and chestnuts to the pan and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often. Toss in the squash pieces, chicken stock, and freshly grated nutmeg. Cover to steam. Let the squash cook for 20 minutes or until soft. Allow the stock to evaporate and then toss the squash and chestnut mixture into a large mixing bowl with the egg and ricotta. Stir and press with a wooden spoon. You can pulse with an immersion blender if you desire. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. The lasagna will resemble ribbon candy when finished. To assemble the lasagna, place the pasta sheet on your work surface. Coat the first 4 inches of the pasta with the squash filling and fold the long end of the pasta over the layer. Spread the next side of the pasta with a thin layer of the filling, fold over the pasta sheet, again about 4 inches, to cover the bottom layers. Sprinkle with pecorino and fold over the pasta again. Repeat until you have used the full length of the pasta sheet. Sprinkle the top with Pecorino and a sage leaf. Transfer to a greased sheet pan. Repeat for the remaining 3 sheets of pasta to make 4 \free form\ lasagnas. Place the pan in the oven to bake for 20 minutes. To make the pasta dough: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use one hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. Cut the ball of dough in half, cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (keep in mind, overly thick pasta tastes gummy.) Make 4 pieces, about 20-inches long and 6-inches wide. Right before assembling the lasagna, bring 5 quarts of well-salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta sheets in the water, one at a time, for 2 minutes each. Drain, cool and set aside till ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 61387,&quot;Blue Cheese Souffle with Fresh Figs and Honey 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing the ramekins 2 tablespoons sugar, plus more for the ramekins 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup milk, warmed 5 eggs, separated Pinch salt Ground white pepper Pinch ground nutmeg 1 cup crumbled blue cheese Pinch cream of tartar 8 fresh black mission figs, split in 1/2 lengthwise 1/2 cup honey Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare 4 (8-ounce) ramekins by greasing them with softened butter and then coating them with sugar, tapping out any excess. Make a thick bechamel sauce base by melting the 3 tablespoons of butter over low-medium heat in a thick-bottomed pot. Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a whisk to prevent lumps. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to coat the flour with fat and remove the starchy taste; do not allow the roux to brown. Add the warm milk to the mixture and continue to whisk until smooth and thick. Remove from the heat. Beat in the egg yolks 1 at a time. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir in the cheese until incorporated evenly. Chill the mixture while whipping the egg whites. In a separate clean bowl beat the egg whites and cream of tartar just until soft peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the bechamel mixture to lighten it. Then gently fold in the rest. Pour the batter into the prepared ramekins and place on a cookie sheet. Bake on the middle rack for about 25 minutes. The souffle is done when it has puffed over the rim, the outside is golden, and the center jiggles slightly. Serve with fresh figs and a drizzle of honey. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 61388,&quot;Creamy Lemon Chicken 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Six 3- to 4-ounce boneless, skinless chicken thighs<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/4 cup white wine<br> 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1 lemon, zested and juiced, plus lemon slices, for garnish 3 big handfuls spinach (about 3 cups)<br> Fresh basil, for garnish<br> Instructions: Place the flour in a shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat, then add the oil. Dredge the chicken in the flour, shaking off any excess, and place in the hot oil. Cook until golden brown on both sides and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the chicken to a plate. Add the garlic to the pan, carefully add the wine and, using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pan to release any flavor stuck to the bottom. Add the cream, Parmesan, lemon zest and juice and some salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes. Add the spinach, stir and return the chicken to the pan. Cook for 1 minute more, until the spinach has wilted.

Heat half the butter, the oil and the shallot and celery mixture in a wide saucepan, and cook to soften the mixture for about 5 minutes, making sure it doesn&#39;t stick. Mix in the rice, stirring to give it a good coating of oil and butter. Meanwhile, heat the stock in another saucepan and keep it at the simmering point. Put a ladleful of the stock into the rice and keep stirring until the stock is absorbed. Then add another ladleful and stir again. Continue doing this until the rice is al dente. You may not need all of the stock, equally, you may need to add hot water from the kettle. Mix the lemon zest and the rosemary into the risotto, and in a small bowl beat the egg yolk, lemon juice, Parmesan, cream and pepper. When the risotto is ready - when the rice is no longer chalky, but still has some bite - take it off the heat and add the bowl of eggy, lemony mixture, and the remaining butter and salt, to taste. Serve with more Parmesan if you wish, check the seasoning and dive in. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 61391,&quot;Heirloom Garlic Clove Chicken Thighs 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 1 tablespoon canola oil<br> 3/4 cup dry white wine<br> 1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives, halved<br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 head garlic (preferably heirloom; see Cook&#39;s Note), separated into cloves and peeled (about 10 cloves) 1 medium shallot, sliced into rings<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Season the chicken with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Heat the butter and oil in a large, deep cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add the chicken skin-side down and cook, undisturbed, until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over and turn off the heat. Add the wine, then nestle the olives, thyme, garlic and shallot around the chicken. Return the liquid to a simmer over medium-high heat, then transfer to the oven and roast until the chicken is golden and cooked through, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Transfer the chicken, garlic and olives to a serving dish with a slotted spoon.

Turn the chiles until the skins are black. Remove and cool the chiles in a tightly covered bowl, then peel and finely chop or process into coarse puree in food processor. Heat extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat and add zucchini, onions, garlic, hot pepper, cumin, coriander, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper, stir frequently for 10 minutes. Add in the tomato paste, and stir 1 minute more. Deglaze the pan with beer, stir in poblanos and beans and about half of the stock, bring to a bubble then reduce heat and simmer 10 to 15 minutes to combine flavors. Cool completely, cover and store for make-ahead meal. Reheat over medium heat. While the chili reheats make the rice. Melt the butter in a saucepot over medium heat and add the rice, toast a minute or 2, then stir in 1 1/2 cups stock, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook covered, over low heat 15 minutes. To food processor, add the spinach, cilantro, if using, and a little salt, and pulse into a fine paste. Stir the paste into the rice after 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the pot and let the rice stand another 5 to 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve in shallow bowls with zucchini chili and toppings of choice to garnish. Toppers to choose from: crushed tortillas or warm soft tortillas, sour cream, shredded cheeses, scallions or finely chopped onions, lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 61393,&quot;Bite-Size Cheesecakes on Lemon-Pepper-Cornmeal Crusts 2 large lemons 1 cup sugar 2 cups water 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/4 cup sugar 1 egg 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/4 cups polenta, or yellow cornmeal, if unavailable 1/2 lemon, rind grated 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Pinch salt 1 pound cream cheese 1/2 cup sugar 2 eggs 1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour Pinch salt Lemon confit, finely chopped, for garnish Instructions: To make the confit: Cut a slice off the top and bottom of each lemon to expose the flesh. Cutting from top to bottom and following the contours of the fruit, cut off the peel and white pith in 1-inch-wide strips. Scrape off any pulp adhering to the strips, but leave the pith intact. You should have several 1-inch wide strips of lemon peel and pith. Cut each 1 into long strips, about 1/4-inch by 3 inches each. Meanwhile, boil a kettleful of water. Pour about 2 cups of the boiling water into a small saucepan, bring back to a boil, add all the lemon rind, and boil 30 seconds. Drain in a strainer and rinse under cold running water. Repeat 2 times more, using fresh boiling water each time. Combine the sugar and 2 cups of water in the saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the blanched rind and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer until tender, about 1 hour. Drain in a strainer (reserve the sweet, lemony syrup for sweetening drinks, if you like). Arrange the strips on a wire rack, using your fingers to gently spread them out so that they do not touch each other. Let cool and store in an airtight container. To make the crust: Cream the butter until soft and smooth in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the sugar and continue creaming until light and fluffy. Mix in the egg and the vanilla. In a separate bowl, stir together the dry ingredients. Add the dry ingredients to the mixer and mix at low speed until almost blended. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead briefly, just until the dough comes together. Form into a disk and chill at least 2 hours or overnight. Flour a work surface. Roll out the dough 1/8-inch thick and prick all over with a fork. Use a cutter to cut out rounds of pastry that are slightly larger in diameter than your mini-muffin cups. Transfer the pastry rounds to a sheet pan and chill 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and bake until light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool. Butter 2 mini-muffin tins and then lay a large piece of heavy duty plastic wrap over the tin. Push the plastic wrap down into each cup (this is to line it very well). Do not worry, the plastic wrap will not burn or melt in the oven. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. To make the filling: Whip the cream cheese until light and fluffy in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the sugar and mix. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, then the flour and salt. Divide the filling among the lined cups, filling each one all the way up. Bake for 20 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, then chill. When ready to serve, cut the plastic wrap so you can remove each cup of cheesecake individually. Lift each one out of the cup and invert onto a cornmeal crust. Peel off the plastic wrap. When all the cakes have been assembled, top each one with a tiny mound of chopped lemon confit and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61394,&quot;Braised Salmon Mediterranean Style 1 medium carrot 2 small celery branches 2 seedless clementines 1 medium tomato 1 small onion 1 cup water 2 clementines, juiced 1 cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt and pepper 4 (5-ounce) salmon fillets 4 large lettuce leaves 1/2 lemon, juiced 12 pitted black olives, sliced 1 scallion, sliced 4 small bouquets celery leaves 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: Prepare the fruit and vegetable garnish. Peel the carrot and slice in thin half moons. Slice the celery branches and peel the clementines and remove as much as the white filaments as possible. Cube the tomato, and peel and thinly slice the onion. In a medium size pot, add the water, clementine juice, white wine, red wine vinegar and olive oil and bring to a boil. Add the carrots, onions, celery and tomato and salt and pepper (it should taste under-seasoned, as it will go through reduction). Then cover, lower the heat and let cook for 10 to 15 minutes while you prepare the fish. Remove any dark flesh from the fish if present. Wash the lettuce leaves, remove the hard white part and blanch the lettuce by plunging them in boiling water for 5 to 10 seconds, until it becomes limp and dark green. Remove and refresh immediately in cold water. When cold, drain and squeeze out the excess water. Then season each piece of salmon individually on both sides, and wrap them neatly in the lettuce leaves so that you get nice small bundles. Place the fish in the braising liquid, on top of the vegetables. The liquid should reach halfway up the sides of the salmon. Lower the heat to very low, cover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes. (The cooking time depends on your preferences. Some people like their fish slightly underdone in the middle, others like it cooked through. Check the inside of one fish by gently pulling the lettuce aside and separate the flakes of the salmon. The inside color will tell you how done it is. The best is when it is slightly orange inside and pink on the outside) When the fish is cooked, remove from the pot and reduce the cooking liquid by 1/3 to 1/2, until full-flavored. Add the clementine segments to warm them. Do not allow them to overcook and fall apart. Check the seasoning and add the lemon juice. Place each piece of fish in a small soup plate. Surround the fish with a nice mix of garnish and cover it with the cooking juice. Decorate with pieces of black olives, sliced scallion, and little celery leaves bouquets. Finally, brush the fish with some olive oil to make it shiny, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 61395,&quot;Baked Apples 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons unfiltered apple juice 2 tablespoons currants 2 tablespoons apricot jam 2 tablespoons toasted chopped almonds 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 medium apples, cored 2/3 of the way down and the top 1/3 peeled Crema, for serving (optional), recipe follows 2 cups heavy cream 1/4 cup buttermilk Instructions: In a small saucepan, bring 2 tablespoons of the apple juice just to a simmer and remove from the heat. Add the currants, stir, and let them sit for 10 minutes to swell. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a bowl, stir together the apricot jam, almonds, and brown sugar. Add the currants with their juice and mix together well. Use this mixture to stuff the apples. Place them in a small roasting pan and place a dab of butter on the top of each. Pour the remaining 1 cup of apple juice into the pan and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until tender but not split or mushy. Serve hot, with a dollop of Crema, if desired. Whisk the cream and the buttermilk together in a bowl. Cover and set in a warm place (a gas oven with just the heat from the pilot light is fine) for 8 hours. Crema may be kept in the refrigerator for as long as a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 61396,&quot;Spiced Apple and Pear Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sugar 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup cold unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), diced 1 large egg 3 to 4 tablespoons very cold water 1/2 lemon 3 pounds baking apples, such as Golden Delicious, Cortland, or Mutsu (about 6 apples) 1 1/2 pounds baking pears, such as Bosc or firm Bartletts (about 3 pears) 2/3 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling on the pie 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon fine salt Generous pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick) 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg, beaten Instructions: Dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl. Rub 1/4 cup of the butter into the dry ingredients with your fingers until completely absorbed. Then rub in the remaining butter until it resembles cornmeal mixed with pea-size bits of butter. (If it gets warm and sticky, refrigerate it to chill.) Beat the egg with 3 tablespoons of the water; then drizzle it evenly over the dough. Lightly stir the dough together with a fork. (The dough should just hold together when you squeeze it together, with some dry crumbly bits.) If the dough is really dry, sprinkle it with the final tablespoon of water. (To make the dough in food processor, see below.) Divide the dough in half and wrap each half in plastic wrap and shape into disks. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. (The dough can be frozen for 2 months. Defrost dough in the fridge overnight.) Filling: Finely grate the lemon zest and set aside. Peel, core and then slice both the apple and pear into 1/2-inch slices. Squeeze the lemon juice over the fruit, then toss fruit with the sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt and nutmeg. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fruit and cook, stirring until the sugar dissolves and juices simmer, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, until the fruit softens and the juices evaporate some, about 10 minutes. Evenly mix the flour into the fruit; then cook about a minute more to thicken the juices slightly. Stir in the vanilla and lemon zest; and remove from the heat. (The filling should resemble a tight compote.) Cool completely. Form the pie: Lightly dust the work surface with flour. Roll a disk of dough into an 11 to 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough to 9-inch glass pie pan (see photo), trimming so it hangs about 1/2-inch over the edge of the pan. Fill the crust with the prepared fruit so it mounds slightly in the center. Roll the remaining dough into a 12-inch circle. Brush the rim of the crust with some of the egg. Roll the dough onto the rolling pin and unroll it over the fruit so it hangs over the edge of the pie pan by about 1/2-inch. Trim crust if needed, reserving the scraps for decorations or for patching, if needed. Fold the top crust edge under the bottom one, then press the edges together to seal. Cut trimmed scraps into designs if desired and set aside. Flute the crust by pressing a finger into the crust against the other hand&#39;s index finger and thumb to make an even impression. Repeat every 1/2 inch around the pie to create a ruffled edge (see photo). Refrigerate the pie for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 425 degrees F. Brush pie with egg and place cut dough designs on top if desired. Brush again and sprinkle with sugar. Cut 6 to 8 small steam vents into the top of the dough. Place pie on a baking sheet and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F. Bake until the crust (both top and bottom) is golden brown, about 50 minutes more. If the edges begin to brown too quickly, cut a pie shield out of a piece of aluminum foil and cover the edges (see photo). Cool on a rack. Serve pie warm or at room temperature with whipped or ice cream. Keep pie, covered, at room temperature for a day, or refrigerate for up to four. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61397,&quot;Apple-Pecan-Oat Quick Bread with Cream Cheese Glaze 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter or vegetable oil, plus more melted butter or oil for brushing the pan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 cup Old-Fashioned rolled oats 3/4 cup chopped toasted pecans 1/2 cup plain yogurt or sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest, optional 1 cup shredded apples, excess moisture squeezed out 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 3 tablespoons cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons milk 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush one 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan or three 6-by-3-by-2-inch mini loaf pans with melted butter and set aside. Combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add the oats and pecans and toss together. Set aside. Whisk together the melted butter, yogurt, vanilla extract, eggs and grated zest if using in a small bowl. Stir in the shredded apples. Fold this mixture into the flour mixture until just incorporated. Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan(s). Tap the bottom on a hard surface a few times and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes for the regular and 35 to 40 minutes for the minis. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes, then turn the bread out and let cool completely on the rack. Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, cream cheese, milk and vanilla extract in a small bowl until smooth. Pour the glaze over the bread and allow to set at room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes.

Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Make the filling: Beat the cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and slightly fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the lemon juice and vanilla. Pour the batter into the prepared crust. Transfer to the oven and bake until the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes. Turn off the oven and keep the cheesecake in the oven with the door ajar, 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and run a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen. Transfer to a rack; let cool completely, then refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours or overnight. Make the lemon curd: Finely grate the ginger; put in a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl and press with a rubber spatula to extract the juice.

Now, I know that it is not strictly right to indicate that you cook couscous by pouring boiling water over it. In an ideal world, I accept, one should soak the grains in cold water before steaming them over hot, but I take the shortcut, and repeatedly and I apologize to those whom I thereby offend. Put the couscous into a heatproof bowl, with 2 teaspoons kosher salt (or 1 teaspoon table salt), 1/4 teaspoon of the paprika, and all the grated ginger. Give everything a bit of a mix before adding the hot boiled water. Cover the bowl, either with plastic wrap or a plate, and set aside. Into another bowl, put the finely chopped onion. In a wide, shallow dish, big enough to take the salmon fillets later, zest the lemon into the dish. Squeeze the lemon juice into the bowl with the onions. Add the remaining salt and the paprika to the bowl with the lemon zest and stir in 1 tablespoon garlic flavored oil. Halve the cherry or grape tomatoes and put them into yet another bowl. Stir in the remaining teaspoon of garlic flavored oil and set aside. Heat a large frying pan for the salmon fillets. While the pan is getting hot, add the fillets to the dish with the lemon zest and coat both sides with the mixture. Put the fillets in the hot pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, depending on thickness. The fillets should be juicy and have a vivid coral color in the middle, so do check as you cook. Meanwhile, uncover and fluff the couscous, which should have absorbed all the water. Add the tomatoes with lemony onion mixture and stir with a fork. Add nearly all of the cilantro to the couscous, and stir it through, then taste for seasoning, adding more salt if needed. Spoon some couscous onto each plate and arrange a salmon fillet alongside. Sprinkle with a little more cilantro as you hand out each plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 61415,&quot;Sweet Pepper Crostini 6 slices baguette (1/2-inch-thick) 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 to 3/4 cup roasted red bell pepper strips 1/3 to 1/2 cup grated smoked mozzarella or fontina Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Pound the meat to a 1/4-inch thickness with a meat mallet. Season both sides of the meat with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Essence. Fry the bacon in a large skillet until just crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, leaving the fat in the pan. Set the pan aside. Combine the flour with 1 tablespoon of the Essence in a large shallow bowl. Whisk the egg with 1/2 cup of the milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Essence in another bowl. Combine the bread crumbs and the remaining 1 tablespoon Essence in another shallow bowl or baking dish. Dredge the meat in the seasoned flour, then dip in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off. Dredge the meat in the seasoned bread crumbs, coating each side evenly. Shake off any excess bread crumbs. Reserve the seasoned flour. Reheat the bacon fat in the skillet over high heat until very hot but not smoking. In batches, without crowding (you may only be able to cook 1 portion at a time), carefully add the meat and fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes on each side, adding a small amount of the vegetable oil, if necessary, for frying. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Add 3 tablespoons of the reserved seasoned flour to the pan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes, to make a light roux. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 2 cups milk, the salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the sauce is thickened and there is no raw flour taste, about 5 minutes. Stir in the bacon. Serve the steaks with the hot gravy and cheesy grits, if desired. Combine all ingredients thoroughly.

Add the beer and stir until just incorporated. Mix no more than is necessary to prevent dissipation of the bubbles. Put at least 3 inches of canola oil in a deep fryer, and bring to 375 degrees F (or in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F.) Cut the haddock fillets into 3-inch pieces. Season the fish with sea salt and black pepper. When the oil is at temperature, (if you don&#39;t have a thermometer you can test it by dropping a bread crouton in. If it sizzles on hitting the oil, it&#39;s ready), dip the haddock pieces in the batter, and let the excess drain by holding it up briefly above the bowl before placing into the pan. Lay the fish into the hot oil slowly to make sure the oil hits all the surface area. Cook about 2 to 3 minutes on one side and flip over for another 2 minutes. You are looking for a golden brown color and crisp exterior. When ready, lift the fillets out with tongs and lay on paper towels, to absorb the excess surface oil. Open out the split baguette and place inside down in a large pan coated with a nub of butter, melted, on medium heat, for about a minute.

Drizzle in the melted butter and mix with your fingertips until the mixture lumps into unevenly sized crumbs. Refrigerate until ready to use. Combine the chocolate, sugar and cinnamon. Brush a 8 x 4 x 2 1/2 inch pan, or 5 cup loaf pan with melted butter. Roll the dough into a rectangle measuring 9 x 22 inches and brush off any excess flour. Brush the dough generously with the melted butter, leaving a 1/2 inch along the top edge of the dough. Sprinkle the chocolate mixture evenly over the dough, leaving the top 1/2 inch border free. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the mixture. Sprinkle the streusel over the chocolate, reserving about 3 tablespoons. Brush the 1/2 inch border along the top lightly with water. Beginning at the bottom edge, roll the dough into a log and pinch along the seam to seal it well. Moisten the ends of the log with water and bring them together to form a ring. Pinch the ends to seal. Gently twist the circle of dough twice into a double figure 8 and place in the prepared loaf pan, keeping the joint and seam down. Brush the top with melted butter. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cover the pan with a towel and set in a warm draft free place to proof for about 1 1/4 hours, or until a finger gently pressed into the dough leaves an indentation. It will not quite double, but will increase more than half again in size when fully proofed. Brush the top with more melted butter and sprinkle with the reserved chocolate/sugar and streusel. Bake 45 to 50 minutes, or until the dough in the crevices appears baked. If the top browns too quickly, cover loosely with foil. Cool on a rack, in the pan, for 15 minutes. Slip a knife around the edge to loosen it and turn out onto the rack. Cool before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 61470,&quot;Ode to Mustard Sandwich Board 8 large eggs 5 tablespoons mayonnaise 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard 4 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh dill, plus more for serving 4 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon, plus more for serving 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh chives, plus more for serving 1 rib celery, finely diced Freshly cracked black pepper Kosher salt, optional 2 baguettes Dijon mustard 8 ounces French ham, thinly sliced 8 ounces Brie, thinly sliced 1 pear, thinly sliced 1/2 cup caramelized onions Honey, for serving 12 ounces sliced smoked salmon 4 red radishes, thinly sliced 1 heirloom tomato, thinly sliced 1 cucumber, sliced Instructions: For the Dijon herb egg salad: Fill a large stockpot three-quarters full of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Use a slotted spoon to gently place the eggs in the water, then simmer for 9 minutes. Prepare an ice bath. Remove the eggs to the ice bath to cool for 10 minutes. Gently peel the eggs while they are still submerged in the ice bath. Discard the shells and rinse the eggs with cold water to ensure no shell remnants are stuck to the outside. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise and Dijon mustard. Coarsely chop the hard-boiled eggs to your liking and put them in a large bowl. Add the mayonnaise mixture, dill, tarragon, chives, celery and 2 teaspoons pepper and gently mix to combine. Add a pinch of salt if needed and mix again. Transfer the egg salad to a decorative serving bowl. Mix together additional chopped tarragon, dill and chives in a small bowl.

Sprinkle in the meat tenderizer and mix thoroughly. Sprinkle in the baking soda and mix thoroughly. Sprinkle in sugar, chicken bouillon, white pepper and MSG if using and mix thoroughly. Pour in soy sauce and mix thoroughly, then sprinkle in potato starch and mix thoroughly. Pour in sesame oil and vegetable oil and mix thoroughly. Let sit for 15 to 20 minutes. For rice noodles: Heat some water in a large pot and fit it with a steamer rack. Using a grain mill, grind the soaked rice with the soaking water, catching the ground mixture in an extra-large bowl. Add 1/2 cup water in increments if mill stone is not saturated enough with water to get a fine grind. Add oil, salt, tapioca starch, half the potato starch and half the cake flour to the ground rice water. Using a hand blender, blend all ingredients together, being careful not to splatter. Add about 1/2 cup water if the mixture is too thick. Once the mixture is blended and smooth, add the remaining potato starch and cake flour. (If the mixture is too thick, add water slowly in increments of 1/2 cup at a time.) When the mixture sticks to your blender beaters and drips a single trail of liquid back into the bowl, the mixture is ready for cooking. Cover a flat surface with plastic wrap and brush the plastic with oil. Put a 9- to 10-inch round cake pan into the steamer rack and cover. (Have the heat on high to ensure the water is on a constant boil.) When the pan is hot, remove the lid and brush the pan with oil. Ladle in a thin layer of the rice mixture to cover the bottom of the pan. Replace cover and steam, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pan from the pot and flip the noodle sheet out onto the oiled plastic wrap. Fold noodle sheet into halves or thirds and set aside to cool. Continue with remaining rice noodle mixture. Cut noodles 1/2-inch thick. For chow fung: Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat; add 1 tablespoon oil. When oil is hot, add rice noodles. Sear each side of noodles to golden brown. Adjust heat as necessary to avoid burning or under-browning the noodles. When noodles are golden brown, turn of heat and remove noodles from skillet. Set aside. Mix together oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper, MSG, if using and 1 teaspoon cooking wine in a small bowl. Set aside.

Let stand for 3 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture and the cool water. Using your fingers, mix the dough into a sticky mass. When all of the flour is incorporated, move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 4 minutes. The dough should be sticky and will not look smooth. If the dough feels stiff or dry, knead in additional cool water, a tablespoon at a time. Put the dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover, and let rest for 20 minutes. Return the dough to the lightly floured surface and knead it for 7 to 8 minutes. The dough will go from being sticky to smooth and will become supple but not too firm. Place the dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not spring back.) Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough and pat it into a rectangle. The short sides should be the top and bottom edges. Fold the top edge down and the bottom edge up, overlapping them slightly, then turn the dough a quarter turn and fold the top down and the bottom up again to form an envelope. Shape the dough into a log shape by rolling the loaf down two to three times and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Roll the loaf back and forth on the table to smooth out. Place the loaf seam side down in a lightly oiled 9 by 5inch loaf pan. Gently press down on the loaf to spread it to fill the corners of the pan, and cover it with oiled plastic wrap. Let the loaf rise at 75 degrees to 77 degrees for about 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until it has doubled and risen about 1-inch above the edge of the pan. Meanwhile preheat oven to 425 degrees. Gently place the loaf pan on the center rack of the oven. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaf with water 6 to 8 times, then shut the oven door. After 3 minutes, mist the loaf again. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees and bake for 30 minutes longer, or until the top is a deep golden brown. Remove the loaf from the panit should come out with ease. The bread should sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom, and the sides of the loaf should be brown. Immediately place the loaf from the pan on a wire rack to cool.

Using a mandolin or super-sharp knife, cut onion into paper thin slices. Clean and slice the mushrooms. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat; add onion and saute until caramelized. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Heat remaining teaspoon of oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saute until they release all their liquid and most of it boils away, should take about 5 minutes. Combine caramelized onions with mushrooms and saute together briefly; season with salt and pepper. Remove the pan from heat. Unfold puff pastry onto a floured surface; cut in half lengthwise to form 2 long rectangles. Gently roll out each rectangle to approximately 5 by 14 inches and place on cookie sheet. Trim edges by 1/4-inch strips all around; set strips aside. Break 1 egg into a small bowl; beat slightly. Brush edges of pastry with some of the egg. Use trimmed strips to make a raised border on each. Brush entire surface with remaining beaten egg. Prick the interior of pastry all over with a fork. Bake until pale gold, about 10 minutes. If pastry has puffed up inside edge, press it down gently. Set aside. Meanwhile, combine remaining eggs with 6 ounces goat cheese and blend until smooth. Spread the mixture onto pastry. Return to oven and bake just until set, about 4 minutes. Add the thyme to the mushroom mixture. Remove cookie sheet from oven and spread with thyme-mushroom mixture. Crumble remaining cheese on top. Just before serving, broil tarts on low heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until tarts are warm and cheese softens. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61479,&quot;Meatball Curry 1 pound ground beef 1 green serrano cl, minced 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro Kosher salt 3 tablespoons coconut oil or canola oil 1/2 teaspoon brown or black mustard seeds 4 shallots, thinly sliced (about 1 cup) 5 cloves garlic, minced 1 (1-inch piece) ginger, peeled and minced 2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 medium tomatoes, finely diced 1 (14-ounce can) full-fat coconut milk Kosher salt 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro 2 teaspoons lime juice (about half a lime) Serving suggestions: Rice, Indian bread, such as naan or chapatti or spaghetti.

(Don&#39;t mix any more than this or you&#39;ll end up with tough meatballs!) Make 16 balls like this: divide the mixture in half, and then in half again. Take each quarter and divide it into 4 small portions. Roll each portion between your palms until smooth. Set aside and repeat for all 16 meatballs For the curry: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the coconut oil until nearly smoking. Add the mustard seeds, covering the pan with a lid so you don&#39;t get popping seeds all over you. When the spluttering subsides, add the shallots, garlic and ginger and cook until golden brown. Then add the ground coriander, cumin and cayenne pepper. Stir, and cook 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and cook until they soften, about 5 minutes. Add the coconut milk, 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and bring to boil. Turn down to a simmer and add the meatballs. Simmer until the meatballs are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.

Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Using the large holes of a hand grater, grate the butter into the mixing bowl with the flour mixture. Lightly blend the butter and flour mixture with your fingertips until the texture is like coarse cornmeal. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Add the ice water and blend until thoroughly incorporated. Form the dough into a ball and place it on a floured cutting board. Roll out the dough, adding flour as necessary, to 1/8-inch thick. Place an 8 1/2-inch pie pan face down on the dough and cut the dough to fit the pan, leaving a border of about 1-inch. Line the pie pan with the dough, trim the edges, and refrigerate until ready to use. For the filling:<br> In an electric mixer with the wire whisk attachment, add the eggs and beat on high speed until frothy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar, corn syrup, butter, vanilla, salt, and ground roasted pecans. Beat on medium speed until well blended. Stir in the pecan pieces. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees and bake until the filling is browned on top and the crust is light golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.

Place the fresh salmon in a single layer in a medium ovenproof skillet and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bring the fish stock to a boil and pour it over the salmon. Over medium high heat, bring the stock to a simmer. Place a buttered sheet of parchment paper over the skillet and transfer it to the oven. Cook for 2 minutes, until the salmon is not quite done. Strain, reserving the salmon and stock in separate bowls. In a medium saucepan, heat the butter over medium low heat. Add the shallots and the mushrooms and cook for about 3 minutes, or until almost tender. Add the brandy and flame it with a match, standing well away from the pan. Cook over high heat until reduced by half, then add the reserved stock and again reduce by half. Remove from the heat and sprinkle the gelatin over the top. Stir until the gelatin has dissolved, then strain into a food processor and discard the solids. Add the cooked salmon and the Tabasco to the food processor and puree the mixture until smooth. Whip the cream to soft peaks and reserve in the refrigerator. Transfer the salmon mixture to a metal bowl set inside a larger bowl filled with ice water. Stir until the mixture has cooled to room temperature, but not colder. Stir in 1/4 of the whipped cream to loosen the mixture, then fold in the remaining whipped cream gently. Stop folding as soon as the last trace of white disappears. Pour 1/2 of the mixture into a 10 by 5 by 3inch glass loaf pan and, using half of the smoked salmon, gently lay a layer of smoked salmon over the top, laying the strips crosswise. Fit the avocado slices together into an even layer, taking care not to press down too hard or the mousse underneath will shift. Lay the remaining smoked salmon over the top of the avocado and then scoop the remaining salmon mousse into the pan. Spread the mousse into an even layer and cover with plastic wrap. Chill for at least 6 hours and up to 2 days before serving. To serve, run a thin knife along the inside edge of the pan. Dip the bottom of the pan in hot water for a few seconds and invert onto a rectangular serving platter.

Heat the olive oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is warm (not hot), add the garlic. When the garlic begins to get golden around the edges, about 2 minutes, stir in all of the milk and the salt. Bring the milk to a gentle simmer, stirring often to avoid a skin forming on the surface of the milk and to avoid scorching on the bottom. When the milk begins to lightly simmer, gradually stir in the semolina flour. Keep stirring and folding the mixture for about 3 minutes, until it begins to pull away from the sides of the saucepan. Add the melted butter and keep folding until all of the butter is incorporated into the semolina. When all of the butter has been absorbed, turn off the heat. Even out the surface of the semolina mixture with a flat, spatula and immediately add the egg yolk and the cheese, working quickly to spread the yolk over the entire surface of the semolina and then folding the yolk into the semolina. This must be done very quickly as you want to fold the mixture in on itself before the yolk has a chance to begin cooking. Once the yolk has been incorporated, add the Parmesan and continue alternating between stirring and folding the mixture until everything is blended together in a nice, dough-like mass. Turn mixture out onto the prepared cookie sheet and flatten the \dough\ with the same spatula you used before, until it&#39;s about 3/8-inch thick (you can go to a 1/2-inch if you want a heartier gnocchi, it will just take a bit longer to cook). Set the cookie sheet aside and allow the gnocchi &#39;dough&#39; to cool at room temperature until firm enough to handle, approximately 45 minutes. Cut the gnocchi into whatever shape or size you would like (at the restaurant we cut the gnocchi into rectangular &#39;fingers&#39;, but you can be creative and use a biscuit cutter or juice glass to make round gnocchi). Traditionally, Roman gnocchi are layered in a buttered dish and baked in the oven for 17 to 18 minutes at 425 degrees F. At 13 Gypsies we sear the gnocchi in a hot pan to form a crust of &#39;grilled&#39; cheese while keeping the center moist and tender.

Add the milk and eggs and mix with the dough hook to combine. With the mixer running, add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time until it is incorporated into the dough. The butter should be soft and pliable but not melty. When all the butter is incorporated, knead/mix, stopping to scrape the hook, sides and bottom of the bowl every few minutes, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky, another 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, flip over to coat and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest and rise until it&#39;s doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. For the Mexican chocolate babka filling: In a medium bowl with a stiff rubber spatula, mix together the sugar, butter, cocoa powder, cinnamon, chili powder and salt until combined. Add the oil to smooth it out to a spreadable consistency. Taste and add more chili powder if you like more heat. Reserve at room temperature. Grease a pullman loaf pan or standard loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment so that it comes up 2 of the sides and overhangs by an inch. On a clean countertop, roll the dough out into a 10-by-22-inch rectangle. The dough should be slightly sticky, but if it\u2019s too sticky to work with, you can dust with a little flour. Spread a thin even layer of filling all over the dough, reserving about 2 tablespoons of it. Roll the dough the long way into a tight log and cut it in half so you have 2 shorter logs. Spread the top of one of the logs with the reserved filling and then twist the logs together. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan, cover with plastic, and let rise until puffy and risen by about half, another 30 to 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Gently brush the top of the babka with heavy cream. Bake until the top is deep golden brown, about 50 minutes. For the simple syrup: Meanwhile, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan and warm until the sugar is completely dissolved. When the babka comes out of the oven, brush the simple syrup over the top. Cool for 15 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a rack to continue cooling. Of course, you should try it while it\u2019s still warm!! To store, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and keep at room temperature. This is best within a day or two--after that, use it for French toast! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61503,&quot;Tiffani&#39;s Hot Toddy 2 ounces bourbon 1 tablespoon lavender honey<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1/3 cup hot water Dried lavender, for garnish<br> 1 strip lemon peel, for garnish<br> Instructions: In a mug add the bourbon, honey and lemon juice.

With the machine running, gradually blend in 1/3 cup of oil until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Generously sprinkle the lamb racks with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a grill pan or heavy large skillet over high heat. Place 1 lamb rack in the skillet and cook just until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the lamb rack meat side up on a heavy large baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 2 lamb racks. Roast the lamb in the oven until cooked to desired doneness, about 20 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer the lamb racks to a work surface. Set aside for 10 minutes. Cut the lamb between the bones into single chops. Spread the pesto over 1 cut side of each chop. Arrange the chops, pesto side up, on plates or a platter, and serve. Do-Ahead Tip: The pesto and lamb racks may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead. Cover the pesto and lamb separately and refrigerate. Allow extra time for the chilled lamb to roast. Alternately, the racks of lamb can be sliced then broiled before serving. To broil the lamb: Use 18 to 24 meaty single lamb rib chops (about 2 1/2 ounces each, from 3 racks of lamb). Preheat the broiler. Arrange the lamb chops in a single layer over 2 heavy baking sheets. Lightly brush the lamb chops with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Watching closely, broil the lamb chops 3 inches from the heat source until cooked to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Spread the pesto over the chops. Arrange the chops pesto side up on plates or a platter, and serve.

In a large pot fitted with a steamer basket (or use a stainless steel colander with handles), steam the luau leaves until soft but still bright green, and then plunge the steamer basket into the ice water to stop the cooking. Set the steamer basket on a utility platter or over a pot to let drain well and cool. Lay the steamed luau leaves out on your work surface, then lay a piece of chicken or a piece of pork on each leaf topped with a piece of fish. Season with sea salt. Enclose the meat and fish in the luau leaves and then package them in ti leaves or aluminum foil. If you are using ti leaves, arrange the leaves perpendicular to each other in across arrangement. The stem of the ti leaf acts as the \string\ to tie the package shut. The chicken and pork lau lau can then be cooked in an imu (the earthen oven) or in a conventional oven at 350 degrees F until cooked through, about 1 hour.

Add the flour mixture in two parts, alternating with the milk and vanilla extract, and mix until well blended. Fold in the vanilla bean paste. For the salted caramel: Cook the sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisking it occasionally as it melts, until it turns a deep amber color. Add the butter and stir until melted. Add the heavy cream and whisk until the caramel is smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool in a glass bowl. Add the fleur de sel.

Add the onions, stir briefly, and lower the heat to medium. Add a pinch of salt to draw moisture out of the onions. Cook the onions until they are soft and translucent but without any browning, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the potatoes, bay leaf and chicken stock. Raise the flame to high to bring the stock to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Taste the stock and season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Add the asparagus and thyme. Return the stock to a simmer. Cook until the asparagus is barely tender. Remove the bay leaf. Working quickly, ladle some of the soup into a blender with the spinach and vitamin C. Process until the soup is smooth and homogenous. To cool quickly, remove to a large bowl set inside a larger bowl filled with ice water or a sink partially filled with ice water. Add the cream and lemon zest, and season with salt and pepper. Stir often until the soup is no longer steaming. (The soup can be made to this point, covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day or frozen for up to 1 month.) To make the zabaglione, bring 2 inches of water to a simmer in a large saucepan. In a large non-reactive bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and wine. Season with salt and pepper. Set the bowl inside the saucepan but not touching the water, and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened to point where the whisk can leave a clean trail on the bottom of the bowl, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat. Whisk vigorously for 1 minute to cool to room temperature and gradually whisk in the cheese. Season the mixture with pepper, to taste. (The zabaglione can be made to this point, covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day.) Add 1/3 of the whipped cream. Whisk until smooth and then fold in the remaining whipped cream, being careful keep the mixture light and airy.<br> To serve, in a large saucepot, warm the soup over medium heat. Ladle into espresso cups. Spoon the zabaglione over each serving (about 1 teaspoon for each espresso cup of soup). Serve warm or at room temperature.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 61550,&quot;Cabbage Salad with Squid 1 4-ounce tin squid packed in oil, chopped 1 1/2 cups shredded cabbage 1/2 cup shredded carrots 2 tablespoons chopped roasted peanuts 1 tablespoon sliced Fresno cl 1 tablespoon chopped scallions 4 teaspoons fresh lime juice 1 tablespoon fish sauce 2 teaspoons sugar Fresh cilantro leaves, for topping Instructions: Combine the squid, cabbage, carrots, peanuts, sliced cl and scallions in a large bowl.

The batter will be very stiff; it gets softer and more elastic after it has proofed. You may find it easier to mix the sponge using an electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the sponge into a 2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this point you have two options: If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to collapse. This may take 6 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature of the room and the strength of the yeast. The sponge will triple in volume and small dents will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then begins to deflate. The sponge is now in perfect condition to be used in a dough. It&#39;s best if you have already weighted or measured out all of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point so you can use it before it collapses too much. If you&#39;re not planning to make your dough until the next day or the day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water (85 degrees to 90 degrees F) in the dough instead of the cool water specified in the bread recipe. Or let the starter sit out, covered until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours), but don&#39;t let it collapse too much before you use it. Yield: 28 ounces Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Add the cool water and sponge starter to the yeast mixture and mix with your fingers for about 2 minutes, breaking up the sponge. The mixture should look milky and slightly foamy. Add the flour and salt and mix with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the ingredients together until the dough gathers into a mass. It will be wet and sticky, with long strands of dough hanging from your fingers. If the dough is not sticky, add 1 tablespoon of water. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until it becomes supple and fairly smooth. This is a sticky, wet dough; don&#39;t be tempted to add more flour to the work surface. Just dust lightly and use a dough scraper as necessary to loosen the dough from the table during kneading. Allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes, covered with oiled plastic wrap. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Knead the dough 3 to 5 minutes, until it is stretchy and smooth, yet still slightly sticky. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees) for about 1 hour, or until the dough looks slightly puffy but has not doubled. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, or preferably, overnight to let it relax, develop flavor, and become more manageable. Take the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, until it begins to warm up and starts to rise. Flour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it. Divide the dough into three equal pieces, about 13 ounces each. Gently flatten one piece, pressing out some of the air bubbles, and stretch it into a rectangle. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business letter. Now form the loaf into a short baguette by rolling the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Fold the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of the loaf while leaving some air bubbles in the dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or deflate its airy structure. Do not elongate. These loaves are about 10 inches long. Cover an area on the work surface with a thick layer of flour and place the loaf, seam side down, on the flour. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. The loaves will be loose and slightly irregular in shape. Leave plenty of space between the loaves they will spread as they rise. Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours, until bubbly and loose. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just below the stone. Sprinkle a peel very generously with cornmeal. Line an upsidedown baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle very generously with cornmeal. Lift one loaf, flip it over so the floured side is on top, and gently tug on the ends to stretch the loaf to the full length of the peel, or about 14 inches on a pan. Repeat with the remaining loaves, placing 2 on the peel and 1 on the pan. Dimple each loaf with your finger in about 6 places, but don&#39;t deflate them too much. Be sure the loaves are loosened from the peel, then carefully slide them onto the baking stone. Place the pan of bread on the rack below the stone. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaves with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist the loaves again after 1 minute. Then mist again 1 minute later. Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown. (If the crust is not brown enough, the loaves will soften as they cool.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 61552,&quot;Christmas Cutout Sugar Cookies 4 cups sifted all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 eggs 3/4 cup butter (1 1/2 sticks) 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Colored Icing, recipe follows 1/2 cup confectioners? sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons water 3 to 4 drops food coloring, plus more as needed Colored sprinkles, optional Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Gently stir in the flour until halfway incorporated. Add the white chocolate chips and stir just until combined. Pour the batter (it will be very thick!) into the baking pan and spread to even out the top. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, then check the brownies with a toothpick; if they are overly gooey/messy, return them to the oven for another 5 to 10 minutes. (Just be careful not to burn the edges.) Allow the brownies to cool completely. Cut into 1-by-2-inch fingers and place on a rack over a baking sheet. Melt the almond bark in a double-boiler (or in the microwave in 30-second intervals). Dip one end of each brownie finger into the almond bark and then return to the rack until the coating has hardened, 5 to 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 61567,&quot;Chicken Tarragon 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved 2 tablespoons flour 1/4 cup butter 1/4 cup shallots, chopped 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 teaspoon dried tarragon 3/4 cup chicken broth 1/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in the flour.

Simmer the mixture until the flavors blend, about 10 minutes then add the cream. Simmer for another 1 or 2 minutes, then remove the pot from the heat and steep for 15 minutes. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve and set aside until shortly before serving. To begin the zucchini rings: Cut each zucchini into 4 (1-inch thick) cylinders. Dice the remaining zucchini and set aside for garnish. Cut out the center of each zucchini cylinder, creating a hole in each ring about 1 1/2 inches across. Reserve the centers to make the custard below. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the zucchini rings until they are just tender, then drain and refresh in ice water. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. To make the custard: Mash the reserved zucchini centers. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the cream. Add the mashed zucchini, orange zest, rosemary and garlic. Divide the mixture between 4 ramekins then bake in a water bath until the custard is just set, about 15 minutes. Remove the custards from the oven and keep warm. Reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F. To assemble the zucchini and shrimp rings: Fit each shelled shrimp into a blanched zucchini ring by curling the shrimp. Skewer the remaining shrimp with toothpicks (so they will lie flat during cooking). To finish the sauce: Bring the strained sauce to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low. Gradually incorporate the butter, emulsifying it into the sauce with a handheld mixer or whisk. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and reserve over very low heat. To cook the shrimp and garnish: Heat several tablespoons of olive oil in 2 large skillets over medium heat. Working in batches if necessary, cook the diced zucchini in one pan and the sliced oranges in the other. Season the zucchini with salt and pepper and cook until golden and tender; keep warm in a low oven. Cook the orange slices just until firm, season with pepper then keep them warm in the oven as well. Wipe out the skillets. Add olive oil to each and heat over medium. Season the stuffed zucchini and the skewered shrimp liberally with salt and pepper. Working in batches, cook the zucchini and shrimp rings in 1 pan and the skewered shrimp in the other, in both cases cooking until the shrimp is firm and lightly browned. To plate the dish: Unmold the custards onto 4 large warm plates (run a paring knife around the outer edges of the molds first to prevent sticking). Arrange zucchini and shrimp ring around each custard. Remove the toothpicks from the shrimp and place 4 shrimp on each plate. Arrange a slice of blood orange and some diced zucchini on each plate. Drizzle the plates with blood orange sauce and basil oil. Garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner, Riesling]&quot; 61570,&quot;Skillet-Roasted Lamb Chops 6 cloves garlic, crushed 1 sprig fresh rosemary 1 sprig fresh thyme Pinch crushed red pepper 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Two 8-bone lamb racks (1 to 1 1/2 pounds each), frenched<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the garlic, rosemary, thyme, crushed red pepper and 1/2 cup of the olive oil.

Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil serve with freshly grated Parmesan and parsley. Add the flour and salt to the center of a large wooden board. Use your hands and make a well in the center of the mound. Whisk together the eggs and olive oil in a bowl and pour into the well. Use a fork to whisk the eggs into the flour, incorporating slowly into the rim of the flour until it is completely incorporated. Once incorporated, knead the pasta for about 8 minutes, adding just a bit more flour if the board is sticky. If the dough feels too dry, add a drop of water as you go. The dough should feel elastic, smooth and a bit sticky. Shape the pasta dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Let rest for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature to let the gluten relax so rolling will be easier.<br> Set your pasta machine to the widest setting. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece out from the widest setting to the thinnest. Hand cut the pasta into pappardelle.<br> Gather the strands together in your hands and shake loosely so they don&#39;t stick together.

Let rest and slice against the grain. Arrange the 2 pancakes on a work surface, and spread with mayonnaise. Divide the meat between them, then top with cucumbers, pickled peppers, scallions, mint, cilantro and a drizzle of chili oil. Roll up tightly and slice.<br> For the roux: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, then whisk in the flour, salt and sesame oil. Cook, whisking constantly, until light amber in color, 5 to 7 minutes. For the first dough: Mix the flour and boiling water together in a small bowl until a dough forms. Knead for a minute or two to make sure that everything comes together. Set aside. For the second dough: Meanwhile, pour the room temperature water into the bowl of a stand mixer and top with flour and salt. Mix with the dough hook on medium-low speed until dough starts to come together. While dough is in the beginning phase of mixing, add in the hot water dough in small chunks. Knead on medium-low speed until the dough comes together and leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a work surface (oiled so the dough does not stick) and knead by hand until smooth and one consistent temperature; be careful not to overwork. Wrap tightly in plastic and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. For rolling out: Divide dough into 65-gram portions and cover with plastic wrap. (The dough dries out very quickly before it is rolled out, so be sure to keep it covered if you are not working with it.) Squeeze a tablespoon or so of oil onto a very clean marble, stone or metal countertop and spread around. Place one dough ball in the center of the oiled surface. Gently but using force, roll dough ball with a floured rolling pin until very thin and slightly translucent. The rolled dough will be oddly shaped and that is okay. If the dough rips, that&#39;s also ok--it&#39;s still usable. Once dough is rolled to translucent point, brush with a layer of roux and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of sliced scallions. Working from the bottom end of the rolled dough (the end closest to your body), begin gently rolling dough up like a cigar. The end result will be a long \snake. Twist the snake into a coil. Smash the coil down with your palm and roll this into a 10-inch-wide pancake. Repeat until all your pancakes are complete. Store the pancakes in the refrigerator between layers of parchment paper greased with oil until you&#39;re ready to cook. Heat a pan over medium-low heat. Add a small amount of oil and a cold pancake to the pan. Cover with a lid and cook until light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes, before flipping and covering again. Cook the other side until golden brown, another 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to a plate.

Lightly spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray. For the cake, mash the bananas in a large bowl with a fork or potato masher until very smooth. Whisk in the dark brown sugar, melted butter, sour cream, eggs and vanilla until smooth and combined. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Fold the dry ingredients into the banana mixture in thirds until just combined. Pour into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Leave the cake in the pan to cool slightly, about 30 minutes. Use the foil overhang to remove the cake from the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, beat the butter, cream cheese and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Reduce to low speed, then add the powdered sugar a cup at a time until smooth. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. Transfer 1/2 cup of the frosting to a small bowl and stir in the dulce de leche until smooth. Cover both frostings with plastic wrap and keep at room temperature until ready to assemble the cake. For the candied banana chips, warm the maple syrup in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat until it just starts bubbling. Add the banana chips and cook, tossing and stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until the chips have absorbed almost all the maple syrup and are browned in spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Immediately transfer the banana chips to a baking sheet, spread in an even layer and cool completely. Once cool, roughly chop. Transfer the cake to a serving platter. Spread about 3/4 cup plain cream cheese frosting all over the top of the cake. Dollop the dulce de leche frosting and remaining plain frosting on top, then use a small offset spatula to swirl both frostings together in a swooping design, making sure the frosting goes all the way to the edges of the cake.

Cook while whisking over medium to low heat for 5 minutes. Reserve roux. Season the halibut and salmon with salt and pepper. In a deep saucepot, sear the fish in a 3 tablespoons of butter and a 2 tablespoon of olive oil. Sear and reserve leaving fish as raw as possible. Season with additional salt, pepper, and cayenne. In the same pan, add the potatoes, fennel wedges, poblano, leeks, turnips, carrots, and cauliflower with 2 tablespoons butter (this will help caramelize the vegetables). When caramelized, add the bay leaves, garlic, and pearl onions. Cook until vegetables just begin to color. Deglaze with brandy, allow to reduce until mostly dry. Add white wine and reduce to almost dry. Add fish stock or water. Allow to simmer for 5 minutes. Add cream and veal demi-glace. Return to moderate heat and allow to reduce slightly. Whisk in a few tablespoons at a time of the roux while the liquid is simmering gently. You may find you don&#39;t need to use all of the roux. Add thyme leaves. Return to light boil and add clams. As they begin to open, add spinach, shallots, and lemon juice to the sauce. Remove from the heat. Add Lemon Pepper Dumplings and stir gently. Add halibut and salmon. Ladle into bowls. Flake smoked sea bass over. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and drizzle with Parsley Oil. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat the potatoes with olive oil. Place them on a rack on a sheet pan. Roast in oven until soft to the center, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool enough to handle. It is very important that they be assembled out of hot potatoes. Squeeze the potato flesh out of the skins and into a food mill. Mill the potatoes. Weigh the potato puree and determine the amount of egg yolks and flour to be added. Shape the potato puree into a large well. Sprinkle the potatoes with the nutmeg and the grated Parmesan. Surround the well of potatoes with a larger well of flour, measured 1 cup to each pound of riced potatoes. Sprinkle the salt and pepper onto the flour. Add 2 yolks per pound of potatoes into the center of the well. Pour the lemon oil, zest, and juice in the center of the well. Using a meat fork, incorporate the eggs first into the potatoes and then into the flour, just enough to get them mostly together. Then, use your hands to need the mass into a dough. Use additional flour thrown on the dough and the work surface as necessary to form a soft dough. Allow to rest covered with plastic for 20 minutes. Knead the dough again and then shape it into a 2-inch thick rectangle. Using a dough cutter cut off a 1-inch ribbon of dough. Flour your work surface lightly and using your hands roll the dough into a round tube about 1/2-inch in diameter. With a dough cutter, make 1/2-inch long dumplings. Gently roll the pieces on the floured surface. Using a gnocchi board roll the pieces into dumplings with a dimple in the center. Place dumpling on a half sheet pan covered in parchment and sprinkled with flour and cornmeal. Blanch the parsley and spinach. Shock in salted ice water and squeeze the water out. Place the parsley spinach mix into a blender with the olive oil. Blend on low for 3 to 4 minutes. Place cheesecloth into china cap (or fine-mesh sieve) and pour the oil into it, to gravity strain. Reserve the resulting bright green parsley oil. Heat the oil to about 110 degrees F. Place the lemon zest in a blender. Pour the hot oil over it. Run blender on slowest speed for about 1 minute. Allow each to sit overnight. The next day, strain the oil through a cheesecloth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 61630,&quot;Scrumptious Scramble 1 teaspoon olive oil 1/2 cup red onion, diced 1 cup tomato, cored, seeded and diced 4 whole eggs 4 egg whites 2 tablespoons water, optional 1 tablespoon fresh dill, finely chopped, or 1 teaspoon dried dill Salt and pepper Instructions: In a medium sized, non-stick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.

In a bowl, mix by hand the masa, oil, baking powder and salt. Add the brown sugar and cinnamon and mix well. Gently mix in the apple pie filling and pecans. For small tamales, place about 3 tablespoons filling on the smooth side of 1 cornhusk and wrap. There is no rule to wrapping tamales, just do the best you can and have fun. However, peeling apart a cornhusk into strips and using as ties to hold together each tamale is helpful. Bring water to a boil in a tamale pot or steamer. Steam the tamales over medium heat until the masa is no longer white and doughy, about 40 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 61633,&quot;The World-Famous Maine Lobster Roll 1/2 pound fully cooked lobster meat or 1 (2 1/2 pound) live lobster 1/2 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded and finely diced 1/4 cup bottled mayonnaise 1/2 tablespoon fresh tarragon 2 small scallions, thinly sliced Kosher or sea salt Freshly ground pepper 2 to 3 New England-style hot dog buns 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened Pickles and potato chips as accompaniment Instructions: Prepare the lobster salad. If using live lobsters, steam or boil them. Let cool at room temperature. Use a cleaver to crack and remove the meat from the claws, knuckles and tails. Remove the cartilage from the claws and the intestines from the tails of the cooked meat. Cut the meat into 1/2-inch dice. You may pick all the meat from the carcass and add it to the meat or freeze the carcass for soup or broth. Place the cucumber in a colander for at least 5 minutes to drain the excess liquid. Combine the lobster, cucumber mayonnaise, and tarragon. Add the scallions. Season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat a large heavy skillet (12 to 14-inches) over medium-low heat (a black cast-iron pan is perfect). Lightly butter both sides of each bun.

Add the clams, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Uncover the pot and quickly stir the clams with a wooden spoon. Cover and cook 5 to 10 minutes longer (this will depend on the type and size of the clams), or until most of the clams are open. Transfer the clams to a large bowl or baking dish and strain the broth twice through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, being careful to strain out the sand. (You should have about 8 cups of clam broth. If not, add enough water to bring the volume up to 8 cups.) When the clams are cool enough to handle, remove them from their shells and chop into 1/2-inch pieces. Set the clams and broth aside. Cook the bacon in a large heavy pot over medium heat until crisp and the fat is rendered. Pour off all the bacon fat except 2 tablespoons. Add the 4 tablespoons butter, leeks, onions, and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and bay leaves and cook until the vegetables are thoroughly wilted, about 3 minutes, being careful not to brown. Add the potatoes and reserved clam broth and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the broth thickens slightly and the potatoes are very tender, about 30 minutes. (If you like a thicker broth, mash some of the potatoes against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon.). Remove from the heat, Discard the thyme stems and bay leaves, stir in the clams and cream, and season with the pepper and the salt to taste. Set the chowder aside for 1 hour, covered, to allow the flavors to marry. Place the pot over low heat and slowly reheat, being careful not to let boil. Serve hot; garnish each bowl with a pat of butter and some parsley and chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61650,&quot;Chocolate Cherry Dump Cake 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter Two 21-ounce cans cherry pie filling<br> One 15.25-ounce box chocolate cake mix<br> 1/4 cup toasted sliced almonds<br> Whipped cream, for serving<br> Instructions: Put the butter in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and place it in the oven while it preheats.

Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside. Whisk the egg yolks and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in the top of a double boiler over simmering water until pale and thick. Do not overcook. Remove the vanilla bean and the cardamom pods from the cream. Add the cream to the eggs in the double boiler, whisking constantly. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, approximately 10 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the butter and rosemary. Pour the custard mixture into a porcelain dish and chill thoroughly. Just before serving, sprinkle the custard with remaining sugar and caramelize it with a kitchen torch. Fire quickly and evenly until the sugar is cooked but not burned. Put the creme brulee into the freezer for about 30 seconds and then serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61671,&quot;Stuffed Artichokes 6 artichokes 1 lemon, thinly sliced 2 teaspoons crab boil 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup finely diced onion 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1 teaspoon chopped oregano leaves 1 1/2 cups Italian style bread crumbs 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish 1/4 cup olive oil plus 2 tablespoons, divided Salt and pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the stems from the artichokes to leave a neat, flat base. Lay each artichoke on its side, and cut away the upper third with a sharp knife. With kitchen shears, remove the prickly leaf tips from each remaining leaf. Rub the cut sides and bottom with a lemon slice, squeezing lemon juice onto the cut areas and set aside. Place the prepared artichokes, lemon slices, crab boil and bay leaves in the boiling water and simmer, partially covered, until the bottom is tender and can be pierced with a sharp knife and an outer leaf pulls out easily, about 25 minutes. Heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. To the onion pan, add the garlic and oregano and continue to cook for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and stir in the bread crumbs, lemon zest, Parmesan, and 1/4 cup of the olive oil. Mix well and adjust seasonings with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drain the artichokes upside down in a colander. When the artichokes are cool enough to handle, press the leaves gently back so that the artichoke opens to reveal the inner choke and prickly leaves. Pull out the cone of undeveloped white leaves and gently scrape out the choke with a spoon so as not to damage the heart. Gently pull the leaves outward from the center until the leaves open slightly. Fill the artichoke cavities with bread stuffing, and pack a little bit into the space between the leaves. Place the artichokes in an earthenware baking dish and drizzle the tops with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Pour 1/2 cup of water into the bottom of the dish and place in oven. Bake until the artichokes are golden brown and the bread crumbs develop a nice crust, about 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate, drizzle with some olive oil and sprinkle some grated Parmesan. Serve with additional lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 61672,&quot;Pizza with Parsley Pesto, Cremini Mushrooms, Fontina and Goat Cheese 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 2 tablespoons pine nuts<br> 8 fresh basil leaves<br> 5 to 6 cloves garlic 1/2 bunch fresh parsley<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 to 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 1/2 to 2 cups sliced cremini mushrooms<br> 1 clove garlic, chopped then mashed into a paste<br> 1 shallot, finely diced<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 ounces pizza dough, such as Anne Burrell&#39;s Pizza Dough, recipe follows All-purpose flour, for dusting Olive oil, for brushing dough Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup grated fontina About 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano About 1/2 cup goat cheese Crushed red pepper flakes, for topping Torn fresh basil leaves, for garnish 1 1/2 teaspoons dry yeast 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for coating bowl Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. For the parsley pesto: Add the Parmigiano-Reggiano, pine nuts, basil, garlic, parsley and some salt and pepper to a food processor. With the motor running, slowly add about 1/2 cup olive oil and process until smooth. Pulse a few times to incorporate, adding more oil if the mixture is too thick. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. For the mushrooms: Heat the canola oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until almost smoking. Add the mushrooms, garlic and shallots and saute until brown, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove to a plate and reserve. Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. For the pizzas: Portion the dough into six golf-ball-size pieces. Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like). Brush the tops of each piece with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss on the grill, oil-side down. Cook until the bottoms are an even golden brown, about 3 minutes. (The tops will also start bubbling up with air pockets.) Flip over and grill until golden brown on the other side and just firm, about a minute or so. Remove to a baking sheet. Top the pizzas with the fontina, mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano, dollops of goat cheese, crushed red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. Bake in the oven until the cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Top with the parsley pesto and garnish with a few more torn basil leaves. In a small bowl, add 1/2 cup warm water (if the water is too hot the yeast will die and if the water is too cold the yeast will not activate). Add the dry yeast and sugar, stir to combine and let sit for 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and it will smell very yeasty; this is what you want. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Using a fork, gradually stir the flour into the yeast/water mix. Once most of the flour has combined, turn the dough out to a smooth, clean work surface dusted with flour and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency. Lightly coat the mixing bowl with oil, return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour. When the dough is ready, portion it into six golf-ball-size pieces. (If you&#39;re not using the dough right away, wrap each ball individually in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.) Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like; I like irregular shapes). Top the pizzas as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 61673,&quot;Chocolate Waffle Sundaes with Flambed Cherries 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 large egg 1/3 cup vegetable oil 1/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips Melted butter, for brushing 1 pound fresh cherries, pitted (about 3 1/2 cups) 1/2 cup sugar 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons water 1/3 cup dark rum 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: Make the waffles: Put the milk in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave until warm, about 1 minute. Remove 1/2 cup of the warm milk to a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast on top and set aside until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir the cocoa powder into the remaining 1 cup warm milk and set aside 5 minutes. Whisk the egg, vegetable oil, sugar and vanilla into the cocoa mixture. In a large bowl, whisk the flour and salt, then add the egg-cocoa mixture and the yeast mixture and stir until combined. (It\u2019s OK if there are some lumps.) Fold in the chocolate chips. Cover and set aside until the batter is almost doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 250? F. Heat a waffle iron to medium high. Brush with melted butter, then add 2/3 cup to 1 cup batter and cook until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a baking sheet, then repeat to make more waffles. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven to keep the waffles warm. Make the flambed cherries: Combine the cherries, sugar, cinnamon stick, salt and water in a large skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring. Cover, reduce the heat to medium low and cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the cherries are softened, 4 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and pour in the rum. Return to medium-high heat and carefully tilt the pan to ignite the rum, then swirl the pan until the flame burns out. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to simmer until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the butter and swirl the pan until melted. Divide the waffles among plates. Top each with a scoop of ice cream, then spoon the cherries and sauce on top. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 61674,&quot;Foolproof Pizza Dough 1 teaspoon instant or active dry yeast 4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/3 cup olive oil, plus additional for drizzling<br> Instructions: Sprinkle the yeast over 1 1/2 cups of warm (not lukewarm) water.

Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, and oregano. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato sauce and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Stir in the stock, bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is lightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Set the rack about 4 inches from the broiler and preheat the broiler. Cook the chorizo in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and set aside Cut the avocados in half, remove the pit and peel the halves. Cut each half lengthwise into 6 thin slices. Toss together in a medium bowl with the lime juice. Divide the chorizo among 6 oven-proof, individual serving casseroles, about 5 1/ 2-inches wide by 1-inch deep. Cover the chorizo in each casserole with 4 thin slices of avocado. To cook the eggs: Spray a frying pan or griddle with the vegetable cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Add as many eggs as will fit without touching and cook until the underside of the eggs is set, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low and cook until the whites are completely set, about 3 minutes. Place 2 eggs on top of the avocado in each casserole. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Divide the tomato sauce among the 6 casseroles, topping the eggs with a thin, even layer of sauce. Sprinkle the cheese over the sauce, dividing it evenly. Broil just until the cheese melts, about 1 minute. Top each casserole with a teaspoon of crema and sprinkle the chopped cilantro over the cream. Pass the remaining crema separately. Cook&#39;s Notes: Crema Mexicana is a mildly acidic dairy product with a consistency that makes it perfect for drizzling over finished dishes. It is available in Latin markets and some supermarkets. If you cannot find it, substitute sour cream, thinned down with water. Oaxaca cheese is a mild string cheese from the state of Oaxaca in Mexico. It is available in Latin markets and some supermarkets. Whole milk mozzarella is the perfect substitute. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Rioja]&quot; 61700,&quot;Walnut and Dried Cherry Bars 1 cup quick-cooking oats 3/4 cup whole-wheat pastry flour or regular whole-wheat flour 1/4 cup toasted wheat germ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup honey 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce 1/4 cup canola oil 1 egg, beaten to mix 1 egg white 3/4 cup chopped dried tart cherries 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts Cooking spray 1/4 cup \fruit only\ apricot preserves Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the mustard mixture to loosen it. Paint this mixture generously all over the chicken and let sit for up to 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. If you have any of the mustard mixture left over, save it for repainting while the chicken is cooking.<br> Preheat the grill to medium (you want the chicken to cook on the grill as long as possible without burning to develop lovely crispy, tasty skin). Brush off any crud on the grill with a wire grill brush and run an oiled towel over the grill to pick up any bits of loosened crud. Season the chicken lightly with salt and arrange gently on the grill, skin side down, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. If the chicken flares up, move it to a cooler part of the grill; you don&#39;t want sooty film on the chicken (it won&#39;t taste good). Once the chicken has started to brown and crisp, it&#39;s a good idea to close the grill to allow the heat to cook the chicken from all directions. You want to cook the chicken skin side down for a total of 10 to 12 minutes, then turn it over and cook it for another 10 to 12 minutes. If you&#39;re using a grill pan, you can transfer the chicken to a 375 degree F oven when it&#39;s ready to flip so it can finish cooking. If there is leftover mustard mixture, use it to paint the skin of the chicken on the second side. The chicken is done when an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F. When the chicken is nearly done, place the lemon halves on the grill cut side down and leave them alone until brown and caramelized, 5 to 6 minutes. (These will smell great while they&#39;re grilling!) Remove the chicken from the heat and serve with the grilled lemon for extra lemony goodness. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 61707,&quot;Chocolate Gelato Baguettes 2 cups chocolate gelato or ice cream 16 store-bought sponge ladyfingers 1/2 cup nutella 10 strawberries, hulled and thinly sliced 32 fresh mint leaves Instructions: Using a melon baller, scoop the gelato into 48 (1-inch) balls.

While the onions cook, add the flour to a glass baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken and toss to coat. To the same skillet add 3 tablespoons olive oil, add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Saute the mushrooms until browned, about 8 minutes and remove to the baking sheet with the onions. Shake off any excess flour from the chicken and put on a plate. Add 3 tablespoons olive oil to the skillet and add the chicken. Cook the chicken until browned, about 6 minutes and transfer to the baking sheet. Turn the heat to medium and add the garlic and tomato paste. Cook for 2 minutes and deglaze the pan with 3/4 of the bottle of wine, making sure to scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. While the wine comes to a simmer, add the thyme, chicken, mushrooms and onions and let simmer for 3 minutes. If sauce is too thick add remaining red wine. Add butter, taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente about 8 to 10 minutes.

Add about a third of the chilled butter and process until thoroughly combined with no visible chunks of butter (the mixture will be slightly yellow). Add the remaining butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a very coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Add the vinegar in a single pulse. Gradually add 2 tablespoons ice water through the feed tube, pulsing just until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together-it should just hold its shape and be a little crumbly. If still very powdery, pulse again, adding up to 2 tablespoons ice water. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and pat together into a flat disk about 1/2-inch thick. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. For the galette: Adjust an oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the yellow squash and zucchini with 3/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Let sit for 15 minutes to draw out a good amount of water from the vegetables. Meanwhile, lay out the bacon slices in a large skillet. Place over medium heat and cook partially, flipping occasionally, to render out some fat but not to brown or crisp up, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; let cool slightly, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Reserve the bacon fat in the pan. Pat the squash slices dry; place in a large bowl with the red onion slices and toss with olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Let the dough stand at room temperature for a few minutes until slightly softened. Roll out on a lightly floured surface into a 12- to 13-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle the mozzarella and Parmesan on the circle, leaving empty a 1 1/2-inch border all around. Fan the squash, zucchini and onions in a circle, then scatter the bacon on top. Fold up the edges of the dough, pleating, to overlap the filling. Brush the dough border with the egg wash. Drizzle any bacon fat over the filling. Bake until golden brown all over and the filling is bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes. Brush the galette with a little vinegar while still warm and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 61719,&quot;Boneless Chicken Chasseur Handful dried porcini mushrooms (about 1/2 ounce) 1 1/2 cups chicken stock Salt 1 1/2 pounds chicken breast cutlets, each cutlet cut into 3 or 4 large pieces Pepper Flour, for dredging 1 tablespoon olive oil 5 tablespoons butter 2 carrots, finely chopped 2 large cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 large shallots, finely chopped 1/4 cup brandy 1/2 cup dry white wine One 14-ounce can petite diced tomatoes 3 tablespoons fresh tarragon leaves, chopped 8 ounces extra-wide egg noodles Instructions: Place the mushrooms in a small pot and cover with the stock.

Space the cuts evenly apart across each plantain. Gently peel away the skins, using the cuts as guides. Slice the flesh on a slight bias into 3/4-inch pieces, for about 24 pieces total. Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, dip the edge of 1 plantain piece into the oil. It should immediately start to bubble vigorously. If not, allow the oil to heat up for another minute. If the oil is ready, carefully add half of the plantains in an even layer. Cook until browned in spots on the first side, about 2 minutes, then use a slotted metal spatula to flip. Cook on the second side until browned in spots, about 2 minutes.<br> Flip the plantains again, immediately lower the heat to medium and continue to cook the plantains until they are very tender and deeply browned, 4 to 8 minutes, flipping every 2 minutes to ensure even cooking. The cooking time will depend on the ripeness of your plantains and some pieces may cook faster than others, but you can just remove them as they finish cooking.<br> Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Season generously with salt on both sides.

Melt the butter, chocolate, cinnamon, Aleppo pepper and chili powder together in the top of a double boiler or in the microwave (for 4 minutes). Stir with a rubber spatula until all the chocolate is melted. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Combine the eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla paste in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on high speed until the mixture becomes pale and pulls ribbons when the whisk is run through it, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold the melted chocolate into the egg mixture with a rubber spatula, gently stirring from bottom to top until the chocolate is fully incorporated. Add the salt to the cake flour, then fold half of the flour into the egg and chocolate mixture until thoroughly combined. Fold in the remaining flour. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan making sure the batter is level and evenly spread in the pan. Bake until a cake tester comes out clean when placed in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool completely. For the icing: Combine the cream cheese, butter, peanut butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer for 2 minutes. Wipe down the sides and the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Spread the icing on top of the brownies in an even layer. Dust with cocoa powder, then cut and serve. Alternately, place the icing in a piping bag and pipe icing stars on top. Dust with cocoa powder, then cut and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 61803,&quot;Zha Leung 1/2 cup rice flour 1/4 cup tapioca starch 1/4 cup light soy sauce 1 tablespoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil 2 to 3 refrigerated or frozen fried dough sticks (each about 10 inches long; see Cook\u2019s Note) Vegetable oil, for the pans 2 small scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat the oven or a toaster oven to 350 degrees F. Whisk the rice flour and tapioca starch in a medium bowl. Slowly add 1 1/2 cups room temperature water, whisking continuously, until a smooth yet loose mixture forms. Try to break up any little lumps and be sure to mix in any flour on the sides of the bowl. Let sit for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the soy sauce, sugar and 1 tablespoon water in a small saucepan over low heat, whisking occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in the sesame oil. Set aside. Split the fried dough sticks in half lengthwise, then cut the halves into 4-inch logs to make 10 logs. Place the logs on a baking sheet lined with a cooling rack. Bake until completely warmed through and crispy, about 2 minutes. Remove and let cool slightly. Set a steamer rack in a large wok or wide pot and fill with water up to the rack, about 2 inches. Bring to a full boil over high heat with the lid on. Generously grease two 8-inch nonstick round metal cake pans with vegetable oil, about 2 teaspoons. Set one aside. Add the scallions to the batter, then give it a nice whisk to make sure it is fully combined. You will have to whisk the batter each time before making a batch. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the prepared cake pan. It will not fully coat the bottom of the pan. Adjust the heat under the wok to medium high, carefully remove the lid and place the pan on the rack. Cover and let steam for 15 seconds. Remove the lid again and move the pan around to try to coat the bottom as much as possible; the batter should be slightly set but still loose enough to flow. Let steam for another minute. Carefully remove the lid and, using oven mitts, remove the pan to a trivet. Let sit for 30 seconds. Place 2 pieces of fried dough directly in the center of the rice noodle, creating a line down the middle. Using a silicone or plastic bench scraper or spatula, cut the rice noodle in half, creating 2 semicircles with a piece of fried dough on each side. Focusing on one rice noodle semicircle at a time, gently fold over one of the sides to cover the fried dough. Fold the remaining side directly on top, tucking the flap under the roll to hide the seam. Repeat with the remaining semicircle. Transfer to a dinner plate and use scissors to cut the roll in half crosswise, creating 2 pieces per roll. Repeat with the reserved prepared cake pan. Continue with the remaining batter and fried dough pieces, whisking the batter each time and using a clean paper towel to wipe down the pans before greasing them with vegetable oil. Otherwise, any residual batter could cause a rip. Drizzle half of the sweet soy mixture all over the rolls and serve the rest on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61804,&quot;Apple Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 14 tablespoons cold butter, diced 1 large egg, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons cold water 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 3 pounds baking apples like Golden Delicious, Cortland, or Mutsu 2/3 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling on pie 1/4 cup unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Generous pinch of ground nutmeg 1 large egg, lightly beaten Instructions: Make the dough by hand. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean sized bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture. Make the dough in a food processor. With the machine fitted with the metal blade, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean size bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand. Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. Make the filling. Put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve, and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Toss the apple with the lemon juice. Add the sugar and toss to combine evenly. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the apples, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, about 7 minutes. Strain the apples in a colander over a medium bowl to catch all the juice. Shake the colander to get as much liquid as possible. Return the juices to the skillet, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. In a medium bowl, toss the apples with the reduced juice and spices. Set aside to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen for up to 6 months.) Cut the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half of dough into a disc about 11 to 12 inches wide. Layer the dough between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with one of the discs of dough, and trim it so it lays about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pan. Put the apple filling in the pan and mound it slightly in the center. Brush the top edges of the dough with the egg. Place the second disc of dough over the top. Fold the top layer of dough under the edge of the bottom layer and press the edges together to form a seal. Flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Pierce the top of the dough in several places to allow steam to escape while baking. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. Bake the pie on a baking sheet until the crust is golden, about 50 minutes. Cool on a rack before serving. The pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61805,&quot;Shortcut Instant Pot Lasagna 1 1/2 cups whole-milk ricotta 1 cup shredded mozzarella 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus extra for topping 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1 large egg Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 24-ounce jar marinara sauce One 9-ounce package no-boil lasagna noodles Instructions: Add 2 cups water to a 6-quart Instant Pot? and set the rack inside with the handles folded under.

When the oil is hot add the onions and saute until translucent. Stir in the artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes. Saute for 3 to 5 minutes, then add the salt, pepper and garlic. When the garlic begins to lightly brown, deglaze with 1/4 cup of the white wine. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the butter, allow it to melt, then toss in the Parmesan and parsley. Remove from the heat and allow to cool before stuffing the chicken breast. Rinse, trim and pound out chicken breasts to about 1/4-inch thick. Do not over-pound as holes in the chicken will make it difficult for the chicken to retain the stuffing. Put 1/4 of the stuffing mixture at 1 end of a chicken breast. Gentle roll the chicken breast folding the ends in to help keep the stuffing from coming out during the cooking process. Secure the chicken roll with 2 toothpicks. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts and stuffing. Heat the 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil in a medium saute pan over high heat. Add the chicken breasts, with the secured side of the chicken first, to insure the roll with stay together. Brown the chicken on all sides, add remaining butter, and deglaze with remaining white wine. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and discard the toothpicks. Slice each breast on a bias into 5 pieces and transfer to a serving platter. Drizzle with remaining pan drippings, garnish with a sprinkle of Parmesan and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 61821,&quot;Color-Changing Pea Flower Granita 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons pea flower tea (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3/4 cup coconut milk 2 lemons, quartered Instructions: Put an 8-inch square glass baking dish in the freezer to chill. Combine the sugar with 2 cups water in a medium saucepot over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer to dissolve the sugar, about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from heat, add the pea flower tea and steep until the simple syrup turns a deep indigo, about 15 minutes; strain. Cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Whisk the coconut milk into the syrup. Pour the mixture into the chilled baking dish and freeze for 1 hour. Rake the mixture with a fork and freeze for another hour. Rake and freeze for 1 hour more. Rake one final time before serving. Serve the granita with the lemon wedges on the side. Invite your guests to squeeze the lemon over the granita and watch the color change from a cool blue to a vibrant purple.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Prosecco]&quot; 61822,&quot;Spicy Cauliflower Wings 1 1/2 cups whole milk 3 large eggs 4 to 6 teaspoons Louisiana-style hot sauce, plus more for serving 2 cups all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 4 teaspoons packed dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder Vegetable oil, for deep-frying 1 large head cauliflower, trimmed and cut into 2- to 3-inch florets<br> Sliced pickles, for serving Hot honey, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250? F. Set a rack on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven. Whisk the milk, eggs and hot sauce in a medium bowl. Stir together the flour, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper in another medium bowl. In a separate medium heatproof bowl, stir together the melted butter, brown sugar, cayenne, paprika, garlic powder and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Fill a medium saucepan halfway with vegetable oil. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350? F. Working in batches of about 8 florets at a time, toss the cauliflower in the flour mixture, then dip in the milk mixture, then dredge again in the flour mixture, allowing the excess to fall off between each step. Fry until deep golden brown, carefully turning as needed, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the cauliflower with a spider or a slotted spoon and transfer to the baking sheet in the oven; keep warm while you fry the remaining cauliflower.<br> When all the cauliflower is fried, carefully ladle about 1 cup of the frying oil into the melted butter mixture and stir. (It will sizzle slightly.) Working in batches, add the fried cauliflower to the hot spiced oil, then remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a platter. Spoon 2 to 3 more tablespoons of the spiced oil over all the florets. Serve with pickles, hot honey and more hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 61823,&quot;Shrimp Cacciucco Extra-virgin olive oil 1 large or 2 small onions, cut into 1/2-inch dice Kosher salt 1 fennel bulb, cut into 1/2-inch dice, fronds reserved</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/lasagna sheets.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><a class="prev-link" href="/guide/large%20egg%20yolk.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M15,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3l-6-6c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l6-6c0.4-0.4,1-0.4,1.4,0s0.4,1,0,1.4L10.4,12l5.3,5.3c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4C15.5,18.9,15.3,19,15,19z"></path></svg> Previous</span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>large egg yolk</span></a><a class="next-link" href="/guide/lemongrass%20stalks.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>lemongrass stalks</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
