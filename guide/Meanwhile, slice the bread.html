Add the butter to a skillet over medium heat. Let the butter melt and foam, swirling the pan to keep the butter moving, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and 1 tablespoon of the sage, then set aside off heat. Put the grated Havarti on a plate. Flatten 1 dinner roll into a 5-inch round with a rolling pin. Brush both sides with the butter mixture, then press the round into the grated cheese, covering both sides. Cut the round in half, stack together and place side by side in the loaf pan. Repeat with the remaining rolls. Top with the remaining butter mixture, cheese and 1 tablespoon sage. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake until golden and cooked through, 40 to 45 minutes. Best served warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9956,&quot;\On a Shoestring\ Shoestring Potatoes with Honey Mustard Dressing 6 cups canola oil, for frying 1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons paprika 4 tablespoons stone-ground mustard 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons mayonnaise Instructions: Heat the oil in a large deep heavy bottomed pan over medium heat to 375 degrees F. Peel potatoes and, using a mandoline, carefully cut into 1/8-inch thick julienne-style potatoes. Fry potatoes in small batches making sure to return the oil to correct temperature between each batch. Remove the potatoes from the oil and drain on paper towels. When all the potatoes have been fried, place in a serving bowl and season with salt, pepper and paprika. Mix together the mustard, honey and mayonnaise in a small bowl and drizzle over the potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9957,&quot;Pineapple Upside Down Cake with Pink Peppercorn Caramel 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 large pineapple, skinned, cored and cut into eight or nine 3/4-inch-thick slices<br> 3/4 cup dark brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup buttermilk<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs, lightly beaten<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons light corn syrup<br> Juice from 1 large lime<br> 2 teaspoons pink peppercorns<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a 9-inch skillet over medium heat and melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the slices of pineapple in a single layer and sprinkle the brown sugar over the fruit. Cook until the pineapple browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pineapple slices. Turn off the heat and keep warm. Whisk together the buttermilk, vanilla, eggs and the remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a medium bowl until smooth. Use a rubber spatula to stir in the flour, granulated sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda until completely smooth. (The batter will be fairly stiff.) Pour the batter over the pineapple. Transfer the skillet to the center of the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake emerges clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool for about 10 minutes before carefully unmolding onto a serving platter. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) For the caramel: Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup, lime juice and 1/4 cup cold water in a medium stainless saucepan. Stir in the pink peppercorns and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook until the sugar is dissolved, then cook, 10 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. When the cake is unmolded, pour the caramel over the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9958,&quot;Fortune Cookies 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 pinch of cardamom<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br> 2 large egg whites Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking sheet Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, salt and cardamom. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the extracts and egg whites. Sift in the dry ingredients and whisk it -- whisk it good -- until you have a smooth batter. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Spread 1 tablespoon of batter into a 3-inch circle on the baking sheet (it helps to use the lid of a mason jar as a guide); make 2 more circles on the baking sheet (only bake 3 circles at a time so you have time to mold the cookies before they cool). Bake until the edges are brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Working quickly (but carefully, so as to not burn your fingers), use a spatula to flip a circle over. Place a fortune in the center, fold the circle in half and then pick it up and bend the folded side over the edge of a bowl to form a fortune cookie shape. Place in a muffin tin so the shape holds while it cools. Repeat with the remaining circles. Bake and mold the remaining batches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9959,&quot;White Bean and Roasted Eggplant Hummus 1 (1 1/2-pound) eggplant or 3 Japanese eggplants, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces Olive oil, for drizzling, plus 1/3 cup Kosher salt, for seasoning, plus 1/2 teaspoon Freshly ground black pepper, for seasoning, plus 1/4 teaspoon 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed 1/3 cup loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from about 1 lemon) 1 clove garlic 1 hothouse cucumber, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and place an oven rack in the middle. Place the eggplant on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown. Set aside to cool. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the cooled eggplant, beans, parsley, lemon juice, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Pulse until the mixture is coarsely chopped. With the machine running, gradually add 1/3 cup of olive oil until the mixture is creamy. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Place the hummus in a dipping bowl and serve with the cucumber slices. Alternatively, spoon the hummus over the cucumber slices and arrange on a serving platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 9960,&quot;Green Chicken Chilaquiles Casserole 2 whole chicken breasts, split Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups chicken stock 3 1/2 cups Tomatillo Salsa, recipe follows 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 onion, sliced paper-thin 1/2 cup vegetable oil 12 day-old Corn Tortillas, recipe follows (18 if individual casseroles are being made) 1 cup grated Manchego cheese 1 cup grated Panela cheese 1/2 cup grated Anejo cheese 1 pound tomatillos, husked, washed and cut into quarters 2 - 4 large jalapeno chiles, stemmed, seeded if desired and roughly chopped 1/2 cup cold water 1/2 medium onion, cut in half 2 bunches cilantro, stems and leaves 2 teaspoons salt 4 cups finely ground deep yellow masa harina 2 3/4 cups cold water 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper. Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large saucepan. Place the breasts in the stock, reduce the heat to moderate, cover and cook until the meat is tender, about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool in the stock. When cool, remove the skin and bones and shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Strain and reserve the stock for another use. In a large mixing bowl, combine the fresh tomatillo salsa, heavy cream, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, the onion and shredded chicken pieces. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the tortillas just about 5 seconds per side to soften, and then transfer to a large colander to drain. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 4 quart casserole or 6 to 8 individual casseroles (at the restaurant, we use small soup bowls). Combine the cheeses in a mixing bowl. To assemble the chilaquiles, spread a thin layer of the cheese mixture over the bottom of the baking dish. Push the solids in the bowl of chicken and tomatillo sauce to the side so the liquids form a pool in the bottom. Dip all the softened tortillas in the pool to moisten. Layer one third of the moist tortillas over the cheese and top with half of the chicken mixture with its sauce. Sprinkle half of the remaining cheese over the chicken. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of tortillas on top. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake 30 minutes or until the edges are slightly brown. Let sit for 10 minutes before slicing and serving or unmolding. In blender place tomatillos, jalapenos and water. Puree until just chunky. Add remaining ingredients and puree about 2 minutes more, or until no large chunks remain. This salsa keeps in the refrigerator, in a covered container, about 3 days. In large bowl combine all ingredients and stir until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small piece of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Divide the dough into 24 golf ball size pieces for tacos and 12 large balls for quesadillas. Place on a platter and cover with a damp towel. Line a tortilla press with 2 sheets of plastic cut from a plastic freezer bag or other heavy duty plastic bag. Heat a dry cast iron skillet, or non-stick pan until moderately hot. Flatten each ball of dough in the tortilla press, then remove the plastic from the top and, holding the tortilla with your fingertips, peel off the bottom sheet. Lay the tortillas one by one on the skillet and cook about 30 to 45 seconds per side, pressing the top of each tortilla with your fingertips to make it puff. Place the hot tortillas on a towel. When they are still warm but not hot, stack and wrap in a towel. Serve immediately or let cool, wrap well in plastic or a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator up to a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 9961,&quot;Grilled Pineapple \Suzette<br> 1 firm-ripe pineapple 4 teaspoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup pineapple flavored rum, preferably Cruzan brand 1/4 cup pineapple juice Juice of 1 lime 1 tablespoon thinly chopped fresh mint, for garnish Vanilla ice cream, for serving, optional Instructions: Remove the top end of the pineapple by holding it firmly and twisting it off. Use a sharp serrated knife to trim off both ends of the pineapple. Set the pineapple on the bottom cut-end and, starting at the top, cut the skin off of the pineapple by following the curve of the fruit. Overlap your cuts to ensure that you cut out all of the eyes (the brown indentations on the pineapple). Once all of the skin has been removed from the pineapple, slice the pineapple in half from the top down. Slice each half in half again, from the top down. Slice each quarter lengthwise into 3 wedges of equal size. Use your knife to cut the core out of each wedge so that you have a total of 12 trapezoidal shaped wedges. Set 8 wedges aside, and take the remaining wedges and cut into small dice, about 1/4-inch cubes. You should have about 1 cup of small diced pineapple. Preheat a grill to medium-high and spray or brush the grates with vegetable oil. Lay the pineapple wedges on the grill and cook for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Rotate the pineapples 90 degrees and cook another 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Turn onto the second side and cook 2 to 2 1/2 minutes longer. Turn onto the third side and cook a final 2 to2 1/2 minutes. Transfer grilled pineapple to a platter. While the pineapple cooks, set a 10-inch grillproof saute pan on the grill and add 2 teaspoons of the butter. Once the butter melts, add the diced pineapples and saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the sugar and cook until the sugar dissolves and starts to form large bubbles and turns golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the lime juice and swirl the pan to incorporate. Continue to cook for 3 minutes. Add the rum to the pan and tilt the pan to try and flame the rum. Cook for 3 minutes, then add the pineapple juice to the pan. Continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half, 4 to 5 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and swirl the remaining 2 teaspoons of the butter into the sauce. Pour the hot sauce over the grilled pineapple with the cross-hatched sides facing up. Garnish with the chopped mint. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 9962,&quot;Shawarma Stuffed Peppers 2 tablespoons olive oil or canola oil 1 yellow onion, chopped<br> Kosher salt and black pepper<br> 2 teaspoons Shawarma Seasoning, homemade (recipe follows) or store-bought 1 pound ground turkey<br> 1 cup cooked basmati rice or 1 cup cauliflower rice<br> One 14-ounce can diced tomatoes<br> 4 large or 6 small bell peppers 1/4 cup tahini<br> 1 lemon<br> Fresh herbs (such as cilantro, parsley or mint), for serving<br> 2 tablespoons garam masala 2 tablespoons curry powder<br> 1 tablespoon powdered chicken bouillon 2 teaspoons ground turmeric<br> Instructions: In a large skillet or pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the Shawarma Seasoning and cook for another minute. Add the ground turkey and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few turns of black pepper. Brown the turkey, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula. When it\u2019s all cooked through and no longer pink, reduce the heat to low. If you\u2019re using cauliflower rice, microwave it (covered in a bowl or in the bag it came in if the package says that it\u2019s okay) for 3 minutes. Add the basmati rice or cauliflower rice to the skillet and stir in the tomatoes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. Cut off the tops of the bell peppers, core them and place them in a casserole dish. Fill the peppers with the turkey mixture and then bake for 35 minutes. Meanwhile, make the tahini sauce. Stir together the tahini, 3 tablespoons cold water<br> water, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. When the peppers are done, squeeze them with additional lemon juice, top with a nice big blob of tahini sauce and a pile of fresh herbs. Enjoy! Combine the garam masala, curry powder, powdered chicken bouillon and turmeric in a small bowl and whisk together.

Add the garlic and swirl to release the aroma. Add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until brown. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the beaten egg mixture (be sure that the mixture is smooth?no hunks of egg white). Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked egg mixture to run to the sides of the pan to create a wide, flat \scrambled egg.\ Swirl the pan around occasionally to loosen the eggs from the bottom of the pan. When the eggs are three-quarters of the way cooked through, sprinkle the middle third of the omelet with the mushrooms and goat cheese. Turn off the heat and sprinkle with the chives. Using the spatula, fold the left third of the omelet over the filling. Press gently to secure. Gently shake the pan to be sure that the omelet is loosened from the pan. Gently slide the right third of the omelet out onto a serving plate and flip the other two-thirds of the omelet on top. (The omelet should be folded like a letter.) Serve the omelet with the Potato Hash. Garnish with chives. Plunge the potatoes into boiling water, then immediately drain and place them in a bowl of ice water. To a medium cast-iron skillet, add the bacon. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon has rendered. Add the onion and cook over low heat, partially covered, until translucent. Add the potatoes and cook until browned and slightly crisp. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9964,&quot;Tartar Sauce 1 pint mayonnaise 2/3 cup dill pickle relish 2 tablespoons minced white onion 1 ounce lemon juice Pickle juice Instructions: Mix ingredients together, refrigerate, and serve as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 9965,&quot;Smoked Crayfish Salad 2 pounds uncooked crayfish tails, split down the back to give 2 identical halves 2 large handfuls assorted salad leaves and greens (rocket, endive, salad burnet, radicchio, escarole, tat soi, etc) 16 small tomatoes, halved or whole 7 ounces (200 grams) goats cheese, choose one that isn&#39;t too dry, and crumble it 2/3 cup (150 milliliters) avocado oil 1 lemon, juiced Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Note: The only tricky part of this dish is smoking the crayfish. I used a domestic smoker that you should be able to find at a good hardware or kitchenware store. Follow the instructions with your smoker and you shouldn&#39;t have any problems. Bring the smoker to heat, then place in the crayfish tails and smoke over a moderate heat for 10 to15 minutes. To check if the tails are ready, take 1 piece out of the smoker and using a sharp knife, insert it into the thickest part of the tail. The flesh should be opaque in color, neither raw nor totally white. Take the tails from the smoker and leave to cool. If the tails aren&#39;t quite ready, just put back in the smoker and smoke a little more. The smoker will generate heat, so the hotter the smoker, the quicker the tails will cook. Once the crayfish are cool enough to handle, pry the meat from the shells and cut into thick chunks. Place the salad leaves in a large bowl and scatter on the crayfish, the tomatoes and the cheese. Whisk the avocado oil and the lemon juice together, season well, then pour dressing over the salad, and gently toss together. Eat immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 9966,&quot;Chunky Eggplant Bruschetta 1 eggplant, peeled, medium dice 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper, plus more for seasoning 4 tablespoons olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 3 tablespoons minced garlic 1 onion, medium dice 1/2 cup pitted and halved kalamata olives 1/4 cup drained capers 3/4 cup diced roasted red peppers 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves Pinch smoky paprika 1 French baguette, sliced on bias Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss the eggplant with 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange the eggplant on a half sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Reserve the bowl. Put it in the oven and bake until nicely charred, about 15 to 20 minutes. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the red pepper flakes and the garlic. Cook until the garlic browns, about for 1 to 2 minutes, then add the onion. Cook until onion softens, about 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Remove the eggplant from the oven and transfer it back to same bowl it was tossed in prior to baking. Add the onion mixture, the olives, capers, and roasted red peppers. Toss to combine. Add the sherry vinegar, fresh parsley and oregano and toss until the ingredients are evenly distributed. Cover and refrigerate for 25 to 30 minutes to cool and marry the flavors. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt and pepper, to taste, and the smoky paprika. Spread the oil mixture on both sides of each piece of bread. Heat a grill pan over high heat and toast the bread until grill marks form, flipping once. Remove the eggplant from the refrigerator and spoon about 2 heaping tablespoons on top of each piece of bread.

Add the butter and mix thoroughly with your fingers or a fork until all of the butter has been evenly distributed and incorporated into the flour mixture. Form into small to medium clumps with your fingers. Set aside. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger, salt and allspice in a large bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour mixture and beating until just incorporated. Spoon half of the cake batter (it will be very thick) into the prepared pan and smooth with an offset spatula. Sprinkle the blueberries on top.

Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook until the sauce is thickened, about 1 1/2 hours. For the chicken: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Lightly drizzle some olive oil onto the chicken to prevent the chicken from sticking to the grill pan. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. When the grill pan is hot, add the chicken and cook until char marks appear and the chicken is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Toss the chicken with the barbecue sauce. Let simmer on low until ready to serve, to infuse the chicken with the flavor of the sauce.

Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and sprinkle with the salt. Saute until almost tender, tossing occasionally, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. Whisk the sugar, spices and arrowroot in a small bowl until no cornstarch lumps remain. Sprinkle the spiced sugar and lemon juice over the apples in skillet, and toss to blend. Cool to lukewarm. Place a large sheet of parchment paper on the work surface. Unfold the pastry sheet on the parchment and sprinkle both sides lightly with flour. Roll out the pastry to 12-inch square, lifting, turning and sprinkling with more flour to keep from sticking. Cut off the corners (with a rounded cut), making a 12-inch-diameter pastry round. Brush the pastry all over with some beaten egg. Starting 2 inches in from the edge (to leave wide border), arrange the apple wedges close together in a circle on the pastry. Arrange the remaining apples in a smaller circle in center (ends may overlap first ring of apples). Fold the pastry border partially over the filling, pleating the pastry in loose folds. Brush the folded-up pastry border with some beaten egg. Slide the galette with the parchment onto a heavy baking sheet. Scrape the juices from the skillet over the apples. Bake galette until pastry edge is deep golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, make the topping: Toss the goat cheese, almonds and cherries in a medium bowl until evenly distributed (the cheese should remain in distinct pieces). Chill until ready to use. Remove the galette from the oven. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the filling. Return the galette to the oven and bake for 5 minutes longer to soften the cheese and cherries. Cool 20 minutes and serve warm, or cool for 2 hours to serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 9976,&quot;Fresh Peach Cremolata 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 pounds fresh ripe peaches (Cook&#39;s Note) 1 tablespoon Grand Marnier liqueur Seeds scraped from 1/2 vanilla bean Instructions: Place the sugar and 1 1/2 cups water in a small saucepan and simmer until the sugar dissolves. Set aside. Fill a large saucepan with water and bring it to a boil. Add the peaches and cook for between 15 seconds and 3 minutes, just until the skins peel off easily. (Ripe peaches will be ready sooner.) Transfer the peaches to a bowl of cool water, peel and cut in wedges into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, discarding the pits. Puree the peaches completely and pour into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Whisk the sugar syrup, Grand Marnier and vanilla seeds into the peach puree. Place the dish uncovered on a level shelf in the freezer for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until it begins to crystallize around the edges. Scrape the entire mixture, including the edges, with the tines of a fork and freeze for another 30 minutes. Continue freezing and scraping every 30 minutes, until the mixture is soft-frozen. It should take 2 to 3 hours to freeze and will be good to serve for up to 4 hours afterward. If the mixture gets too frozen, allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, and scrape it again with a dinner fork. Serve frozen in glasses. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Vinho Verde]&quot; 9977,&quot;Banana Cream Pi 1.5 liters milk About 18 ounces cream 7 vanilla beans (Indonesian), seeds scraped About 8 1/2 ounces sugar 8 ounces glucose (atomized/powder) About 4 1/2 ounces milk powder About 1/4 ounce stabilizer (cremodan ice cream) 3 eggs About 3 1/2 ounces egg yolks About 1 3/4 ounce trimoline 7 ounces white chocolate 7 ounces butter About 3 1/2 ounces feullantine About 18 ounces banana 7 ounces maple syrup About 1/8 ounce curry powder Instructions: In a medium saucepan combine milk with cream, scraped vanilla beans, sugar, glucose; and milk powder.

Toast the spices until aromatic, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in the cider, carrot juice, ginger juice, sugar, orange zest, nutmeg and kosher salt. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture sit uncovered until the cider is aromatic and the spices are well infused, 1 to 2 hours. Strain the cider through a fine sieve or cheesecloth; discard the solids. (The cider can be made in advance and reheated prior to serving.) For the eggnog batter: Separate the whites and yolks of the eggs into 2 medium size mixing bowls. Whip the yolks with the nutmeg, cinnamon, rum and salt. Gradually add 1/4 cup of the sugar. Mix until the texture is silky and the sugar is fully incorporated. Set aside. Whip the egg whites on medium-high speed, gradually incorporating the remaining 1/8 cup of sugar. Whip until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg white mixture into the yolk mixture. This batter has a lifespan of about one evening. Be sure to use fresh eggs as these will be served in a raw state. To assemble the holiday eggnog: For each drink, mix together 4 ounces of the hot mulled cider, 2 ounces of the eggnog batter, 1 ounce of the rum and 1/2 ounce of the brandy in a heat-treated glass or mug. Garnish with grated nutmeg. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 9996,&quot;Cow Patties 20 ounces melting chocolate, such as almond bark 1 cup raisins, dried cranberries or dried cherries<br> 1/2 cup slivered almonds<br> 1/2 cup whole peanuts Instructions: Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a bowl, toss the poblano peppers with the canola oil. Place on the grill along with the scallions and corn and cook, turning occasionally, until the vegetables are nicely charred. Immediately place the peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 10 minutes to sweat and soften. Chop the charred scallions and put them into a large bowl. Cut the corn kernels off the ear and add to the bowl. Peel the skins off the peppers, finely chop and then add them to the corn and scallions. Stir in the goat cheese and Parmesan. Heat a large saute pan on the grill, add the chorizo and cook until the oils are released and the chorizo is slightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chorizo to the poblano-cheese mixture and gently fold together. Set aside until ready to use. For the arepas: Combine the masa flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in 2 1/2 cups hot water and, using a wooden spoon, stir to combine. Add in the melted butter, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 12 small balls. Place each ball in between two pieces of plastic wrap and flatten using a heavy-bottomed skillet or tortilla press to about 3 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Heat the canola oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Fry the arepas until lightly browned--they should have a nice crust on the outside but still be soft inside--about 5 minutes per side. Using a sharp knife, slice the arepas in half, similar to an English muffin. Stuff 1 to 2 teaspoons of the filling inside each. Garnish with some chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 9998,&quot;Butter-Braised Cipollini Onions with Arugula and Balsamic Syrup on Multi-grain Toast 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/4 cup (1 1/2 ounces) lightly packed light brown sugar 1 cup high-quality 3-year-old balsamic vinegar Small pinch of crushed red pepper flakes 1 (3-inch) fresh thyme sprig 18 medium cipollini onions (about 8 ounces) 1 cup banyuls vinegar 6 (3/4-inch-thick) slices multi-grain bread 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 8 lightly packed cups baby arugula Arugula blossoms for garnish (optional) Instructions: To prepare the balsamic syrup, in a small saucepan, stir together the brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, red pepper flakes, and thyme. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and simmer until the mixture has reduced by one-third and is syrupy enough to coat the back of the spoon, about 20 minutes. Let cool to room temperature and then strain. Store the syrup in a covered jar at room temperature for up to 1 month. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a simmer. Place the onions in a medium, heat-proof bowl and cover them with the simmering water. Let sit for 10 minutes and then slip off their skins, using a paring knife to loosen the ends if necessary. In a deep, medium saute pan, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until they are golden brown on both sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the vinegar and scrape up the browned glaze from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and add the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan tightly, and simmer until the onions are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let them sit, still covered. Generously brush both sides of the bread with oil. Toast the slices in a large skillet over medium heat until they are crispy and golden on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Divide them among 6 serving plates. In a large bowl, toss the arugula with enough of the warm onion cooking liquid to make the leaves glossy. Divide the arugula among the pieces of toast. Top each with 3 onions and drizzle with about 1 tablespoon of the balsamic syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 9999,&quot;Roasted Root Jumble with Feta 1/4 cup raw hazelnuts 1 tablespoon coriander seeds<br> 2 teaspoons cumin seeds<br> 1 large fennel bulb, cut into 1/2-inch wedges<br> 1 large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges<br> 1 large lemon, cut into 1/4-inch slices<br> 2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch rounds<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled<br> Minced fresh cilantro or parsley, to garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the hazelnuts in an ovenproof skillet. Place them in the oven to toast for 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool and roughly chop. In the same skillet, lightly toast the coriander and cumin on the stove over low heat, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool. Grind the cumin and coriander along with the chopped toasted hazelnuts in a spice grinder. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Lay the fennel, red onion, lemon and carrots in a baking dish. Drizzle with the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, sprinkle with the hazelnut and spice mixture and toss to coat. Bake for 20 minutes. Sprinkle the feta cheese over the top and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes, until the vegetables are caramelized and soft. Garnish with a drizzle of olive and sprinkle with cilantro or parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 10000,&quot;Vegetable Tempura 7 ounces plain flour 3 1/2 ounces corn flour Ice-cold water, preferably soda or sparkling 3 pounds of assorted vegetables (see below) Tempura Dipping Sauce: 1 cup rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 handful cilantro, chopped 1 small cl, seeded and finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Add all the flour to a bowl. With the handle of a spoon, or a chopstick, mix, and stir in the ice-cold water until the mixture is slightly thicker than buttermilk consistency. Make a point of not mixing thoroughly, as tempura is renowned for lumps of flour. Dip sliced vegetables (zucchini, onions, eggplants, carrots, bell peppers, sweet potatoes, string beans, broccoli, wild mushrooms, fresh herbs, and bok choy) any vegetables will work but these are the most commonly used) into the batter mixture and shake off any excess. Deep fry vegetables in a wok or deep fat fryer (you can use a frying pan if you do not have anything else, you just need about 7cm/3 inches of clean oil) at 200C/400F/Gas 6 until the batter is light golden in color and crisp. (Any large amounts of hot oil in a kitchen, especially in woks which are not always that sturdy, scare me, please be careful and do not leave the pan unattended.) Turn the vegetables at intervals to ensure that both sides are cooked equally and then fish them out with a slotted spoon, shaking off any excess oil. Place them on kitchen paper towels and eat as soon as possible. The reason that I keep going on about eating them so quickly is because as your hot cooked vegetables cool down inside the batter they begin to steam, making them less crisp as time goes on. Good tempura should be crispy and is one of those things that should be made and cooked quickly and eaten straight away. Pour the rice wine vinegar into a small bowl. Add the sugar and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Taste for sweetness. Add cilantro, cl, and garlic and mix well. Season with salt and pepper and allow to sit for 10 minutes to 1 hour, for flavors to combine.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 10001,&quot;Braised Collards in Tomato-Onion Gravy 4 ripe, medium Roma tomatoes, cored 2 teaspoons canola oil 1 sweet onion, chopped 3 garlic cloves Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 16 cups chopped collard greens (1 pound) Instructions: Heat a medium skillet over high heat.

Drizzle with the Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Rub this mixture all over both sides of the flank steak and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Pre-heat a grill pan for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together the mayonnaise, horseradish and whole-grain mustard in a small bowl. Set aside. When the grill is hot, cook the flank steak until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the middle of the steak reads 125 degrees F for medium rare, about 6 minutes per side. (Leave the grill pan over the heat.) Let the steak rest 15 minutes before slicing very thinly across the grain. Drizzle the onion slices with the remaining tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the onion on both sides to char and soften, about 2 minutes per side. (Turn down the heat if they char too quickly.) Transfer to a bowl. Check seasoning and add more salt and pepper, if necessary. Cover with plastic wrap to continue softening. Slice the bread loaf in half horizontally and lay the two halves cut-side up. Pull out some of the bread from both halves (reserve for another use), leaving a 1/4-inch border. Spread the horseradish mayonnaise on both halves. Layer half of the arugula, then the onion and the steak on the bottom half of the loaf and season with salt and pepper. Add the tomatoes, remaining arugula, more salt and pepper and top half of the loaf. Wrap tightly in parchment, wax paper or plastic wrap and tie with twine if necessary. Press 3 hours with a brick (see Cook&#39;s Note) or cast-iron skillet on top to flatten the sandwich, refrigerated. About 45 minutes before serving, bring the sandwich to room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 10041,&quot;Sauteed Red Snapper with Basil Oil and Sundried Tomatoes 4 five ounce pieces of red snapper fillet, skin on, but with all pin bones removed 2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 clove garlic, finelyminced 1/4 cup sundried tomatoes, soaked in hot water, drained, and julienne 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves 3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 4 teaspoons basil flavored olive oil Instructions: Season the snapper fillets with salt and pepper. Preheat a saute pan with the olive oil until the oil is hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the snapper to the hot pan, flesh side down, and cook over medium heat 4 to 5 minutes. Turn to cook the skin side an additional 3 to 4 minutes. The fillets will curl inwards briefly, but once they have cooked for a minute, they will begin to relax and lay flat again, allowing you to cook the skin side to a crispy texture. Lift out the snapper with a slotted spatula, leaving the juices and oil in the pan. Add the sundried tomatoes, garlic, and shallots, and saute together for 2 minutes. Add the fresh herbs to the pan. Stir quickly, just to heat the herbs enough to release their aromas. Pour the sundried tomato and herb mixture over the snapper. Then drizzle a teaspoon of basil oil over each fillet and around the dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 10042,&quot;Grilled Rack of Pork with Sherry Vinegar BBQ Sauce 1/2 cup plus 4 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/4 cup yellow mustard seeds 1/4 cup whole black peppercorns 8 sprigs fresh thyme 1 Spanish onion, peeled and quartered One 4-pound center cut rack of pork, chine and feather bones removed 4 tablespoons Spanish paprika 4 teaspoons cumin seeds, ground 4 teaspoons fennel seeds, ground 4 teaspoons black mustard seeds, ground 2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper Canola oil<br> Sherry Vinegar BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 1 cup ketchup 1 cup aged sherry vinegar 1/2 cup homemade chicken stock 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons Spanish paprika 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Honey Instructions: Combine 10 cups water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, brown sugar, mustard seeds, peppercorns, thyme and onions in a large glass bowl or a plastic container. Add the pork, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours. Thirty minutes before grilling, remove the pork from the brine, rinse with cold water, pat dry and let sit out at room temperature. Prepare a charcoal grill for direct and indirect cooking. Combine the paprika, cumin, mustard, fennel, the remaining 4 teaspoons salt and ground pepper in a bowl. Rub the pork with the spices and drizzle with canola oil. Sear the pork over direct heat on both sides until lightly golden brown and a crust has formed, about 5 minutes per side. Move the pork over indirect heat (inside of grill should be at about 375 degrees F) and cook, brushing with the Sherry Vinegar BBQ Sauce every 5 minutes or so, until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 145 degrees F, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Brush with the sauce every 10 minutes or so after the first 45 minutes. Remove from the grill, loosely tent with foil and let rest 15 minutes before slicing. You can either slice into individual chops, or slice the loin off the bones and thinly slice.

Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce the heat to medium. Gradually whisk in the polenta in a slow, steady stream.<br> Whisk until the liquid boils again and the grains are suspended in the liquid. Keep whisking so the polenta doesn&#39;t scorch. Once it comes to a simmer, switch to a wooden spoon and stir every few minutes until the polenta is creamy without any hint of grittiness, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the fontina, Parmesan and nutmeg.<br> Line a table with butcher paper and pour the polenta onto the table, down the center. Serve with Basil Pesto Sauce and Bolognese Sauce. (These sauces also go great with pasta.) Prepare an ice water bath in a large bowl, and bring a large pot of water to a boil. Put the basil in a large sieve and plunge it into the boiling water. Immediately immerse all the basil and stir so that it blanches evenly. Blanch for about 15 seconds. Remove, shake off the excess water, then plunge the basil into the ice water bath and stir again so it cools as fast as possible. Drain well.<br> Squeeze the water out of the basil with your hands until very dry. Roughly chop the basil and put in a blender. Add the olive oil, pine nuts, garlic, vitamin C if using and salt and pepper to taste. Blend for at least 30 seconds. In this way, the green of the basil will thoroughly color the oil. Add the cheese and pulse to combine. The pesto will keep several days in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator. Makes about 3/4 cup.

Stir until chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and shiny. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, mascarpone and chocolate mixture with an electric mixer at medium to medium-high speed until soft and creamy. Pause occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. In another bowl, with clean beaters, whip the egg yolks and sugar until frothy, about 30 seconds on high. With a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently fold the egg mixture into the chocolate-cream cheese mixture until blended. Cover the mousse and refrigerate until ready to assemble the tiramisu. (You should have about 2 cups mousse. The mousse may be made ahead, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 day.) To make the zabaglione, prepare an ice water bath. Combine the yolks, rum, Marsala and 1/2 cup sugar in the top of a double boiler. Place over (not touching) barely simmering water in the lower pan and whisk vigorously, or beat with an electric mixer, until the mixture begins to foam. Whisk continuously until the mixture triples in volume and thickens to form soft mounds when the whisk is lifted, about 7 minutes. Immediately place the top of the double boiler in the ice water bath to stop the cooking. Let cool, stirring occasionally. In a small bowl, beat the 1/2 cup heavy cream until it begins to foam. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons sugar and continue to beat until the cream holds soft peaks. Fold whipped cream into the cooled zabaglione. Cover and chill for several hours before assembling the tiramisu. You should have about 2 cups. To assemble the dessert, in a small bowl or pitcher, add the sugar to the hot espresso. Stir well to dissolve the sugar, then add the rum. Cut off the top of the cake and reserve for another use (see Chef&#39;s Note). Cut the cake in half horizontally. Arrange a layer of cake, cut side up, in the bottom of a deep 2 1/2-quart bowl. Moisten evenly with some of the espresso syrup. Spread half the mousse on top, and then spread half of the zabaglione on top of the mousse. Arrange the second layer of cake, again cut side up, on the mousse. Moisten well with syrup. Spread the remaining mousse on top in an even layer, followed by the remaining zabaglione. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight before serving.

Put the potato sticks in a large bowl, cover with cold water and swish them around to get off the extra starch. Pour off the starchy water and add fresh water. Continue washing the potatoes until the water runs clear. Cover with water again and allow them to soak for 2 or 3 hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak for up to 3 days.) When you&#39;re ready to make the fries, drain off the water and lay the potatoes sticks on baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot them with more paper towels to dry them. Heat a few inches of oil in a heavy pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 300 degrees F. In 3 or 4 batches, cook the potatoes until soft, about 1 minute per batch. They should not be brown at all at this point! You just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain them on new/dry paper towels. When all the potatoes have been fried once, turn up the heat until the oil reaches 400 degrees F. Start frying the potatoes in batches again, cooking until the fries are golden and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.

Drop the chilled balls into the coating, and roll them around with a fork to fully coat. Remove each truffle with the fork, letting any excess coating drip off, and return to the baking sheet. (If the coating begins to harden, microwave it for a few seconds to warm it up and thin it out.) Refrigerate the truffles until the coating is completely set, about 1 hour. (The truffles can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 10056,&quot;Lavender Syrup 2 cups water 1 cup sugar 1 tablespoon dried lavender buds Instructions: Place the water, sugar, and lavender in a saucepan and bring to a boil.

Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cumin, chili powder, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook 3 minutes. Stir in the ketchup and cook, stirring regularly, until the beef is browned and completely cooked through, about 2 minutes. Stir in the rice and 1/4 cup water and cook until the rice is heated through, about 3 minutes. Spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Lay the tortillas on the sheet. Divide the beef mixture among the tortillas and top evenly with the mozzarella. Bake until the mozzarella is melted and the tortilla is beginning to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the quesadillas to individual plates and serve with toppings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 10058,&quot;Buttery Lemon Parsley Noodles 1 pound pasta (fettuccine, linguine, angel hair) 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup finely minced fresh parsley 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 lemon, zested and juiced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. (If using angel hair, stop just short of the al dente stage.) Drain and set aside. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the olive oil. Add the parsley, garlic and lemon zest and stir. Throw in the drained pasta and cook, tossing and coating it in the mixture, so that a few of the pieces get a little bit of a pan-fried texture to them, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the lemon juice and some salt and pepper and toss again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 10059,&quot;Spanish Turkey Meatball Stew 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 5 cloves garlic, minced Kosher salt 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1 cup sliced small carrots 2 14-ounce cans low-sodium diced fire-roasted tomatoes 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed 1 1/4 pounds lean ground turkey 3/4 cup loosely packed fresh parsley (about 1 bunch), chopped, plus more for topping Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer half of the mixture to a large bowl. Add the paprika and carrots to the remaining onion mixture in the skillet and cook 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, chicken broth and chickpeas; bring to a rapid simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 6 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, add the ground turkey, parsley, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to the bowl with the reserved onion mixture and mix with your hands. Form the turkey mixture into 20 meatballs. Place the meatballs in the skillet with the sauce and simmer, turning once, until cooked through, about 7 minutes. Serve with more pepper and parsley.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 10060,&quot;Sweet Cherry Tomato and Sausage Bake 4 1/4 pounds lovely ripe cherry tomatoes, mixed colors if you can find them 2 sprigs each fresh thyme, rosemary and bay 1 tablespoon dried oregano 3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped 12 good-quality coarse Italian pork sausages Extra-virgin olive oil Balsamic vinegar Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Get yourself an appropriately sized roasting pan, large enough to take the tomatoes in 1 snug-fitting layer. Put in all your tomatoes, the herb sprigs, oregano, garlic and sausages. Drizzle well with extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Toss together, then make sure the sausages are on top and pop the pan into the oven for half an hour. After this time, give it a shake and turn the sausages over. Put back into the oven for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how golden and sticky you like your sausages. Once cooked, you&#39;ll have an intense, tomatoey sauce. If it&#39;s a little too thin, lift out the sausages and place the pan on the stove to cook it down to the consistency you like - I tend to make mine quite thick - then put the sausages back in. Check the seasoning and serve either with a good-quality loaf of bread warmed through in a low oven for 10 minutes (great for mopping up the sauce!) or with mashed potato, rice or polenta, a green salad and a nice glass of wine. \Our agreement with the producers of \Jamie at Home\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Slice the top off the head of garlic. Put it on a large square of aluminum foil and drizzle 1 teaspoon of the extra-virgin olive oil over the exposed cloves. Wrap the foil around and over the garlic. Roast until it is soft, about 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool. Pour the 2 cans of broth into a saucepan, over low heat, and add 3 cans of water. Bring to a simmer. In a large, heavy bottomed skillet, heat the remaining olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute for 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook until the mushrooms release their juices, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook for 1 minute to toast. Add 2 ladles full of hot broth to the pan and gently stir the rice. Cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Adjust the heat so that the pan is just gently bubbling. Continue adding broth and stirring until all the broth is used and the rice is cooked but not mushy, about 20 to 25 minutes. Once the rice has absorbed all the liquid and is nice and creamy, stir in the butter, Parmesan and the garlic pulp. Cover and let rest for 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish and serve hot. Reserve 3 cups for the round 2 recipe, Risotto Cakes.<br> In a large bowl add the leftover risotto, eggs, corn, bread crumbs, and Parmesan and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Mix to combine well. Form into 12 balls about the size of a walnut, then flatten into patties and arrange on a baking sheet. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the patties and cook until they are golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the patties from the oil to a baking sheet lined with a brown bag or paper towels to drain the excess oil. Transfer to a serving tray and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 10063,&quot;Pizza Pot Pie 8 ounces store-bought pizza dough 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 1 green bell pepper, roughly chopped 1 small yellow onion, roughly chopped 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed One 24-ounce jar marinara sauce 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano Pinch of red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 12 ounces sliced Havarti Instructions: Put the pizza dough in a medium bowl and coat well with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Cover with plastic wrap and put in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour depending on the dough. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the garlic, bell peppers and onions in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, scraping down the sides of the bowl halfway through. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the moisture has evaporated from the pan and the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium low and cook, uncovered, stirring often, until thick, about 15 minutes. Brush the sides and lip of a 1-quart (6-inch) ramekin with the butter. Line the bottom and sides with the Havarti. Fill with 1 1/2 cups of the hot marinara-sausage sauce. Reserve the remaining sauce for another use. Gently pull and stretch the pizza dough into a 10-inch circle and place it over the ramekin, leaving a 2-inch overhang all around. Gently press around the edges of the ramekin to lightly seal. Put on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown and the top sounds hollow when you tap it, about 30 minutes. Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven, transfer the ramekin to a heatproof surface and place a plate on top. Carefully invert the ramekin onto the plate, using a spoon to gently pry the dough from the dish. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 10064,&quot;Korean BBQ Short Ribs 1/4 cup soy sauce (regular or low-sodium) 1/4 cup Coca-Cola 3 tablespoons packed brown sugar 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil<br> 1/2 apple pear (Asian pear), grated on the large holes of a box grater 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 pounds flanken-cut beef short ribs<br> Vegetable oil, for the grill Kosher salt 2 scallions, very thinly sliced on an angle 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds Instructions: Combine the soy sauce, Coca-Cola, brown sugar, sesame oil, apple pear and garlic in a large bowl. Using whisk or fork, stir all the ingredients together until the sugar is dissolved and the garlic is distributed evenly. Add the short ribs and massage the marinade into the beef. Cover and allow the short ribs to marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Prepare a grill for direct cooking over high heat; preheat for at least 5 minutes. Wipe the grill grates with a lightly oiled towel right before cooking to clean any char and debris. This will give you great grill marks and keep the beef from sticking. Pat any marinade off the short ribs and grill for about 4 minutes on each side, or until desired doneness, moving the ribs around a bit if they start to flare up. Remove from the grill and sprinkle with salt. Garnish with the scallions and sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 10065,&quot;Chicken and Dumplings 1 (3 to 31/2 pound) whole organic chicken 2 bay leaves 6 sprigs thyme 4 to 5 black peppercorns 1 head garlic, split through the equator 2 tablespoons salt 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 1/4 cup chopped chives 3/4 to 1 cup buttermilk 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons oil 2 carrots, diced 2 stalks celery, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 6 cups chicken stock 1 cup frozen peas 1 cup frozen pearl onions 1/4 cup heavy cream Freshly ground black pepper, for garnish Chopped chives, for garnish Instructions: For the stock: Place the chicken and all stock ingredients in a large Dutch oven and cover with water. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 1 hour until the chicken is tender. Skim the surface of fat and scum as it cooks. When done remove the chicken to a cutting board. Strain the stock and shred the meat into big pieces - the stock will be used for the sauce and the chicken will be folded into it. For the dumplings: Sift the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. In a small bowl, using a whisk, lightly beat the eggs, chives and buttermilk together; pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently fold. Mix just until the dough comes together; the batter should be thick and cake-like. To prepare sauce: In a Dutch oven, over medium heat, add the butter and oil. Add the carrot, celery, garlic, and bay leaves and saute until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour to make a roux. Continue to stir and cook for 2 minutes to coat the flour and remove the starchy taste. Slowly pour in the chicken stock, 1 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. Add frozen peas and pearl onions. Let sauce simmer until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. Fold the reserved shredded chicken into the sauce and bring up to a simmer. Using 2 spoons, carefully drop heaping tablespoonfuls of the dumpling batter into the hot mixture. The dumplings should cover the top of the sauce, but should not be touching or crowded. Let the dumplings poach for 10 to 15 minutes until they are firm and puffy. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Season with freshly cracked black pepper and garnish with chopped chives before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10066,&quot;Chocolate Pudding 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 cup milk 1/4 cup sugar 3 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips 1 large egg plus 2 large egg yolks 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Sift together the cocoa and cornstarch in a small bowl.

Serve warm or at room temperature with creme fraiche. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 10068,&quot;Ovenbaked Purple Potato Chips 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1/4 teaspoon sugar 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper Juice of 1/2 lime 3 large purple potatoes, very thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Mix oil, salt, sugar, cayenne pepper and lime juice in large bowl. Add to potatoes and toss to coat. Arrange potatoes in single layer on baking sheets. Bake until potatoes begin to brown on bottom, about 15 minutes. Turn potatoes over and bake until crisp and brown, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with additional salt if necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 10069,&quot;Warm Savoy Cabbage Slaw Extra-virgin olive oil 6 slices thick cut bacon, cut into lardons 2 red onions, julienned Kosher salt 3 carrots, peeled and grated 1 medium head savoy cabbage, thick ribs removed, shredded 1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar 3 tablespoons mustard seeds 1 bundle fresh thyme, tied with string 4 bay leaves 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup apple cider 1 small bunch fresh chives, cut into 2-inch pieces Instructions: Coat a large, wide pot with olive oil and add the bacon. Render the bacon over medium heat. Add the red onions, season with salt, and sweat for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the carrots and stir to combine. Add the cabbage, cider vinegar, mustard seeds, thyme, and bay leaves. Season with salt and taste. This will taste very vinegary but the salt will help offset the sharpness of the vinegar. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until the cabbage is very soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the lid, add the apple cider, and simmer until most of the vinegar has absorbed but the cabbage is still moist but not soupy, an additional 10 minutes. Serve right away or let it hang out in the refrigerator. It will probably be better in a couple of days. Garnish with chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10070,&quot;Potato Salad \New Jersey\ Style 2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes 3 hard boiled eggs, finely chopped 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/2 medium yellow onion, finely diced 2 stalks celery, finely diced Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Sugar, to taste Instructions: Boil potatoes in skin and let cool.

Pulse 3 cups flour with the baking powder, salt, sugar and baking soda in a food processor. Add the butter and pulse just until the butter is in pieces the size of small peas (might take longer than usual because it is frozen). Remove the mixture to a large bowl and fold in 1 1/2 cups buttermilk with a fork, just until the dry mixture has absorbed the liquid. Do not overmix. Place the remaining 1/2 cup flour on a work surface and dust a rolling pin with it; knead the dough just until it holds together, 2 or 3 turns. Roll out into a square shape, using a pastry scraper or knife to shape. Roll out about 1 inch thick. Cut four equal squares and stack on top of each other. Roll out again, same thickness (about 1 inch). Use pastry scraper or knife to cut into 8 to 12 biscuits, depending on the desired size (Full Belly Deli size or normal human size). (You should be able to see multiple layers in each biscuit.) Place about 1 inch apart on a sheet pan lined with a silicone pad or parchment paper. Brush the top of each biscuit with the remaining 1/4 cup buttermilk and then add a pinch of salt and fresh cracked pepper to the top of each biscuit. Bake for 25 minutes. Set aside. For the chorizo-sausage gravy: Add canola oil to a large stockpot and heat, about 2 minutes. Add Basque chorizo and breakfast sausage to hot oil (be careful not to splash; add meat slowly). Sear meat, stirring, and cook through thoroughly, about 10 minutes. Add flour, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika and cook on medium-low heat to cook out flour flavor, 5 to 7 minutes Gradually add half-and-half and whole milk, continually stirring. Increase heat and bring to a boil slowly to thicken, being careful not to scorch the gravy. Add salt and pepper to taste. For the burrito: Deep-fry hash brown triangles in a saute pan with canola oil for about 2 minutes on medium heat. (If using another style of hash brown, saute in pan with 2 tablespoons of canola oil until crispy, 10 to 15 minutes.) Lightly toast tortillas. Set warm tortillas on cutting boards or a work surface. Add 2 slices Cheddar to each. Slice 1 buttermilk biscuit for each and place on top of cheese. Add crispy hash browns and cover with desired amount of chorizo-sausage gravy. Wrap burritos and grill on a panini press or in a cast-iron pan over medium heat, 1 minute. Slice in half and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10081,&quot;Black Bean Soup (Sopa de Frijoles) 2 pounds black turtle beans 1 1/2 ounces olive oil 8 ounces onion small diced 4 garlic cloves chopped 2 ounces jalapeno or other fresh green cl, chopped 4 tablespoons paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 bay leaf 5 quarts white stock, vegetable stock, or water 1 pounds drained canned tomatoes chopped Salt Hot pepper sauce 8 ounces avocado, medium diced, for garnish 8 ounces Spanish dry chorizo medium diced, for garnish 8 ounces tomatoes, medium diced for, garnish Instructions: Soak the beans overnight in cold water.

Add the butter and, using your fingers or a pastry cutter, cut and snap the butter into the flour until the pieces are about the size of a pea. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and 4 tablespoons of milk, add it to the flour mixture and stir to combine, adding another 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk if needed until the pastry holds together in a ball when squeezed in your hands. Knead the dough once or twice to bring it together, divide in two, wrap each in plastic wrap and press into two 1-inch-thick disks. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to two days. Meanwhile, make the filling by melting the butter over medium-high heat in a large frying pan or saucepan. Add the apples, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and stir to combine. Cook the apples for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, just to soften a little and allow the apples to start releasing their juices. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Once cool, set your oven rack to the lowest position and preheat it to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Roll one disk of dough out to a 1/2-centimeter (1/4-inch) thick circle and drape it into a pie plate. Scatter the bottom with the oats and top with the apples. If your apples are extra juicy, feel free to leave some of the juice behind and use as a sauce for the pie. Roll out the second disk of dough, cut a steam vent into the center and drape it over the top of the pie. If you want to get creative, feel free to weave your top crust into a lattice but if you want a classic look, just a circle will do. Crimp the edges of the top and bottom crust together to seal. Whisk together the egg and milk or water and brush over the pie. Scatter a little turbinado or granulated sugar over the top of the pie if using. Place the pie onto a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Lower the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Allow the pie to cool before slicing and serving on its own or with ice cream and reserved apple liquid. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10084,&quot;Tomato and Olive Foccacia 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound package pizza dough 1 cup seeded tomatoes, chopped and drained Salt and pepper to taste Oregano 2 to 3 tablespoons oil-cured olives halved and pitted 1 clove garlic, sliced into paper-thin shreds Instructions: On a baking pan spread olive oil. Press the pizza dough into the pan until the dough fills pan completely. Cover the dough with a piece of oiled plastic wrap (oiled side down) and allow it to rise, until doubled, up to 1 hour. Scatter tomatoes on risen focaccia. Sprinkle with salt; pepper; oregano; olives and garlic. Set a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees. Bake the focaccia for about 25 minutes, or until deep golden. Lift the side of the focaccia with a spatula or pancake turner and check the bottom about halfway through baking time. If it is getting too dark, slide the pan onto another pan to insulate the bottom. To serve immediately, slide the focaccia from the pan to a cutting board. If it will be served later, slide it off the pan onto a rack to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10085,&quot;Blood Orange-Shrimp Stir-Fry 1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined Kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch 5 blood oranges 3 tablespoons rice vinegar 3 tablespoons honey 3 tablespoons ketchup 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 8 ounces snow peas, trimmed<br> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/3 cup dried chiles de arbol (about 24) or other small dried chiles 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon minced peeled ginger 4 scallions, cut into 1- to 2-inch pieces 1 tablespoon sesame seeds Cooked white rice, for serving Instructions: Season the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.

Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, add the chopped onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the carrots and celery and cook for 2 minutes. Add the flour, stirring to coat the vegetables, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth and 1 teaspoon each kosher salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chicken, peas and parsley. Pour the mixture into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Put the baking soda, 2 teaspoons kosher salt and 8 cups water in a large, heavy pot and bring to a boil.<br> While the water comes to a boil, divide the pizza dough into 4 equal parts (each portion weighing about 6 ounces). Roll each portion of dough into a snake about 3 feet long. Pick up the ends of the dough, forming a U shape. Next, twist the ends of the dough together twice. Bring the twisted end of the dough towards you and fold it down onto the bottom curve. Press each of the ends into the dough, using a bit of water to help them stick. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces. Use a slotted spoon or mesh strainer to carefully lower one of the shaped pretzels into the boiling water. Cook for 30 seconds, then gently flip and cook for another 30 seconds. Remove the boiled pretzel and drain on a cutting board. Repeat this process with the remaining 3 pretzels. Arrange the boiled pretzels on top of the pot pie mixture, with the rounded edges touching the edge of the pie dish and the tail ends of the pretzels hanging over. Whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Brush each pretzel with the egg wash and sprinkle with the pretzel salt.<br> Bake until the pretzels are dark brown and the filling is bubbling and hot throughout, 45 to 50 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 10103,&quot;Berry Walnut Salad 1/4 cup mayonnaise, regular or low fat 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind 2 tablespoons lemon juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped 1 cup precooked wheat berries 2 stalks celery, finely diced 1 small red bell pepper, finely diced 1 McIntosh apple, cored and finely diced Bibb or Boston lettuce leaves Instructions: In the bottom of a mixing bowl blend the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon rind and juice; season to taste with salt and pepper.

Locate the thickest part of the stem and use a small, sharp knife to just shave the top off for even thickness (this makes rolling the leaves up easier). Fill a large wide skillet or pan with about 1/4 inch of water. Arrange a few leaves at a time, overlapping, in a circle on the bottom of the pan and sprinkle lightly with salt. Repeat with the remaining leaves. Put the skillet over medium-high heat and as soon as steam appears, lower the heat to medium, cover and steam until the collards are green, tender and pliable, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and use tongs to transfer the leaves to a baking sheet to cool completely. Lay out 2 large leaves and slightly overlap (or 3 leaves if they are smaller). If desired, add a few splashes of hot sauce to the mayonnaise. Spread the center of the leaves with 1/2 tablespoon of the mayonnaise, and then top with a slice of cheese followed by three slices of red pepper. Top with another collard leaf, and then with two slices of the ham or 1/4 cup of the chicken. Fold in the sides of the leaves and tightly roll up like a burrito.

Put the eggs, half-and-half, salt and pepper in a bowl and whisk until frothy. Melt the butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the egg mixture and let sit until the bottom starts to cook. Using a rubber spatula, slowly push the cooked egg from 1 side of the skillet to the other, allowing the raw egg to reach the bottom and cook--this creates fluffiness and keeps the bottom from burning. When the omelet is cooked on the bottom and the top is still runny, place the skillet just under the broiler with the oven door open and the handle sticking out, and broil until the omelet rises and browns lightly, about 1 minute. (Alternatively, flip the omelet in the skillet and cook briefly, to finish.) Scatter the cream cheese and smoked salmon over the omelet; then sprinkle with the onion and capers. Broil again to warm the topping, about 30 seconds Transfer the omelet to a cutting board, and cut into 4 triangles.

With a wooden spoon stir the mixture slowly and constantly. After about 5 minutes the mixture will begin to foam. Keep stirring. As the roux cooks, the color will darken and the flour will have a nice nutty aroma. It should take about 15 minutes to fully develop a nice dark brown roux. When the roux is ready add the celery, onions and peppers (the Trinity) and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. Once the vegetables have softened, add the bourbon and stir for 2 minutes, add chicken broth a little at a time to make sure the roux mixes well and is incorporated. Add the remaining ingredients, diced tomatoes, chicken, okra, bay leaves, Hot Sauce and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then lower heat and simmer uncovered for 1 1/2 hours, skimming off any fat that rises to the surface and stirring occasionally. In the last 7 minutes, add the shrimp and cook until no longer pink. At the very last minute add the fresh cilantro. Season with more salt and pepper, if necessary. Remove bay leaves and serve with rice and crusty flat bread. Roughly chop the chiles and jalepenos discarding the seeds. Add to a food processor, along with the tomatoes, apple cider vinegar, garlic, sugar and salt. Process until desired consistency. If it&#39;s too dry add a little water. Pour mixture into a small saucepan and simmer for about 10 minutes. At this point you can strain it for a loose hot sauce or leave it as it is for a chunky hot sauce. Season with more salt, if necessary. In a medium covered saucepan bring salted water to a boil. Add the rice, cover and lower the heat. Cook for 20 minutes until water is absorbed. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 10120,&quot;Trio of Duck Roasted Breast, Leg Confit and Seared Foie Gras with Horseradish Parsnip Puree and Huckleberry Brandy Sauce 4 duck breasts, recipe follows 1 cup (8 ounces) duck leg confit, recipe follows 4 ounces foie gras, recipe follows 2 cups Horseradish Parsnip puree, recipe follows 1 cup Huckleberry brandy sauce, recipe follows Parsnip strips and parsley sprigs for garnish Parsnip strips and parsley sprigs for garnish<br> 4 duck breasts, skin on 1-ounce canola oil Salt and pepper 1-ounce canola oil, plus 10 ounces 3 duck legs, seasoned with salt and pepper on all sides 3 duck legs, seasoned with salt and pepper on all sides<br> 1 white onion, chopped 4 garlic cloves, whole 1 celery stalk, chopped 5 thyme sprigs, whole 4 ounces foie gras, cut into 4 (1-ounce) portions Salt and pepper 3 Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into even pieces 6 parsnips, peeled and cut into even pieces Water, as needed Salt 2 to 4 ounces heavy whipping cream 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish 8 ounces huckleberries 2 ounces brandy 1-ounce butter 2 ounces sugar<br> 4 ounces veal demi-glace (optional) Lemon juice, to taste Salt Instructions: On 4 warm dinner plates pipe the horseradish parsnip puree through a piping bag slightly off center on each plate. Spoon or ladle the huckleberry brandy sauce around the parsnip puree. Place a quarter of the hot duck confit around 1/2 of the parsnip puree towards the center of the plate. Place the sliced duck breast on top of the confit in a fanned circular fashion. Place 1 piece of foie gras on top of each breast and garnish with a sprig of parsley and fried parsnip strips. Duck Breasts: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> French each breast by scrapping the meat, skin and tissue off of the wing bone while keeping it attached to the breast. With the heel of a chef&#39;s knife make a clean break on the bone without creating any fragments. (You can also purchase boneless duck breasts if you desire.)<br> Score the skin on each breast by lightly cutting through the skin but not into the meat. Make a criss cross pattern to allow for easy rendering. Preheat a large saute pan and add the canola oil. Season the duck with salt and pepper on all sides. Place the breasts into the skillet, skin side down. Turn the heat down to low and allow the breasts to render for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the skin is very crispy.<br> Turn the breasts over and place in the oven and cook for 2 to 4 minutes or until desired doneness. Remove the duck and allow it to rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Slice the breast into 4 to 6 equal pieces and serve immediately. The duck should be served medium rare. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F.<br> Place a heavy gauge skillet on the stove over medium heat. Add 1 ounce of canola oil to the pan and add the duck legs, skin side down. Turn up the heat to make sure that the legs are rendering but not burning. Render the legs for 15 to 20 minutes or until the skin is completely crispy. Remove the legs from the pan, saving the duck fat, and place the duck legs into a deep oven proof dish. Place the onions, garlic, celery and thyme over the duck legs. Poor the rendered duck fat over the legs and add as much canola oil as you need to completely cover the duck. Cover the dish with tin foil and place in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. Remove the dish and allow it to cool. Remove the duck legs from the fat and remove the skin. With a fork or small knife begin to shred and remove all the meat from the legs. The meat should be very tender and shredded into thin even pieces. This can be done days in advance and reheated when needed. Heat a saute pan over very high heat and allow it to get extremely hot. Place the foie gras into the pan with no oil and saute for 30 to 40 seconds on each side or until crisp and golden brown. Serve immediately. In a large sauce pot add the potatoes and the parsnips and season with salt. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Allow it to simmer until the potatoes are tender. Drain the potatoes and parsnips and place into a blender or food processor. Add the heavy cream to form a mashed consistency. Add the horseradish and puree until very smooth and season with salt, to taste. Do not over mix. Place the mixture into a pastry (piping) bag and reserve hot for the assembly. In a small saucepan add all ingredients together and bring to a boil. Reduce by 2/3 and season with lemon juice and salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 10121,&quot;Potato, Caramelized Leek, and Bacon-Stuffed Puff Pastry 3 cups chopped leeks, about 1 large leek 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed 3 large russet potatoes, sliced into 1/16-inch disks Salt and freshly ground pepper 12 ounces bacon, cooked until crisp and crumbled 4 ounces freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 egg, lightly beaten Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Caramelize the leeks by cooking them in 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large skillet over medium heat for 10 minutes. Roll out the puff pastry into a 20 by 10-inch rectangle, move the pastry to a baking sheet and start by layering the potato slices on one half of the rectangle (we are going to fold the other empty half over and on top in order to seal it up, sort of like a calzone). Season the potatoes with salt and pepper, then add the crumbled bacon and leeks. Top with the Parmesan and seal up the puff pastry square, then crimp the edges. Brush the top of the puff pastry with the egg and cut 3 slits in the top of the puff pastry to allow the steam to escape.<br> Bake for 20 minutes until golden brown and puffed.

Preheat the broiler. While it is heating, prepare the corn. Holding each ear upright, cut off the kernels with a sharp knife. Heat a large heavy-based skillet or frying pan without any fat over high heat until almost smoking. Add the kernels and dry-roast until tender, smoky and dark, tossing continuously as they tend to stick, 4 to 5 minutes. Cook the peppers under the broiler, turning them until the skin chars and bursts, 7 to 10 minutes. Put them in a plastic bag and leave to sweat and cool so the skins loosen. Peel the peppers, discarding cores and seeds. Dice the flesh. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the onion and saute until soft but not brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Take the pan from the heat and stir in the roasted corn, chopped tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, diced peppers, vinegar and remaining oil. Heat, stirring, until hot. Take from the heat and keep warm. Rinse fish steaks and pat dry with paper towels. Brush with half the oil, season with salt and pepper and set on oiled grill pan or grill. Broil 3 to 4 minutes. Turn steaks over, brush with the remaining oil and grill until done to taste, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Meanwhile, stir the cilantro and lime juice into the salsa, taste and adjust seasoning. Make a bed of salsa on 4 warmed plates and place a tuna steak on top of each. Serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 10146,&quot;Chocolate Beet Cake with Cinnamon-Cream Cheese Frosting 2 medium beets, scrubbed, tops trimmed to about 1 inch (about 7 ounces each) 3/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for drizzling Unsalted butter, at room temperature, for the cake pans 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the cake pans 1 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1/3 cup sour cream 1/3 cup water 2 large eggs 1 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cups packed dark or light brown sugar 1 pound cream cheese, at room temperature 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt Baked Beet Chips, recipe follows 1 medium beet, scrubbed 1 teaspoon vegetable oil or other neutral oil 1 tablespoon granulated sugar Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Set each beet on a square of foil and drizzle lightly with vegetable oil. Seal the edges to wrap each beet and roast until tender when pierced with a knife, 40 to 45 minutes. Carefully unwrap and let rest until cool enough to handle. Peel the beets while they are still warm and cut into chunks. Add to a food processor and puree until smooth. Let cool completely. You should have 1 cup beet puree. (Save any extra puree for another use.)<br> Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour two 8-inch cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment.<br> Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl.<br> Whisk together the beet puree, 3/4 cup vegetable oil, sour cream, water and eggs in a large bowl until combined. Whisk in the granulated sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and fold to combine. Do not overmix.<br> Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans. Bake until the cake tops spring back when pressed gently and a tester inserted in the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs, 28 to 30 minutes. Transfer the pans to a rack to cool for 15 minutes. Turn the cakes out onto the racks and let cool completely. Remove the parchment.<br> For the frosting: Beat the cream cheese and butter together with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and salt and and beat on low until combined. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until very smooth and light, about 2 minutes.<br> Transfer one cake layer to a serving plate. Spread about 1 1/2 cups of the frosting over the top of the cake. Top with the remaining cake layer. Spread a thin layer of frosting (about 1 1/2 cups) over the entire cake to create a crumb coat. Refrigerate until the frosting is cold and firm, about 20 minutes.<br> Transfer about 1 cup frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Frost the entire cake with the remaining frosting in the bowl. Pipe rosettes on the top of the cake and garnish with baked beet chips. Chill 30 minutes to set the frosting before serving. Transfer the cake to a serving platter and pipe smaller rosettes of the remaining frosting around the base. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Trim one end of the beet so it can sit flat on your mandoline (it is not necessary to peel it). Thinly slice the beet about 1/16 inch thick. Separate the slices and put in a medium bowl. Drizzle with the oil and toss well to lightly coat each slice. Sprinkle with the sugar and toss to distribute.<br> Arrange the slices in a single layer without touching on the prepared baking sheet. Bake, rotating the tray halfway through, until the chips are browned on the edges and crisp almost to the center, 25 to 30 minutes. (It&#39;s ok if the very center is still a bit pliable, they will continue to crisp as they cool.)<br> Let the beet chips cool slightly on the baking sheet, then remove to a cooling rack to completely crisp up.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]&quot; 10147,&quot;Buttermilk Baked Chicken 2 cups buttermilk Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 tablespoon hot sauce 1/2 yellow onion, sliced 5 sprigs fresh thyme 3 cloves garlic, smashed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (3 pound) chicken cut into 8 pieces, rinsed and patted dry 2 cups crushed corn flakes 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Bring the potatoes to a boil and cook for 20 to 25 minutes until soft enough to mash. Check with a knife to see if potatoes are cooked through and tender. Once ready drain the potatoes. When cool enough to handle peel each potato and cut into small pieces and pass them through a potato ricer over a medium size bowl. Add the flour, Parmesan, egg yolks, nutmeg, thyme, salt and pepper and mix into a doughy consistency adding more flour as needed. Transfer dough to a well floured surface. Using your hands roll pieces of the dough into a rope about 1/2-inch in diameter. With a knife cut the rope into 1/2 to 3/4-inch-long pieces. Flour the pieces as you cut them placing them on a floured baking sheet tray or lined with wax paper. Once rolled you can place the gnocchi in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap until ready to cook. When ready to cook place gnocchi in boiling salted water for about 1 to 2 minutes. They will rise to the top when done. Using a slotted spoon remove gnocchi from pot. For the sauce In a skillet add the butter and mushrooms and saute until nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the white wine and reduce by half, about 5 minutes. Add the cream and gently simmer for another 2 to 5 minutes. Once the sauce has simmered, add the gnocchi and cook for 2 minutes.

Add the water and stir with a stiff rubber spatula until combined and there are no longer bits of flour, 20 to 30 seconds. (It will be very sticky.) Cover with plastic and let sit on the counter at room temperature overnight, 12 to 18 hours. Remove the plastic cover and smell the funky fermented aroma and appreciate the bubbles. Sprinkle one-third of the salami and chives over the top. Using a rubber spatula, fold the outside of the dough over the salami to cover. Repeat this process two more times until all of the salami and chives are folded in. Lay a piece of parchment paper on the counter and sprinkle with an even layer of flour to cover the surface (about 1/4 cup or so). Scrape the dough onto the floured parchment and use heavily-floured hands to shape it into a roundish blob. Press in any exposed salami bits and pinch the dough to seal. Sprinkle the top with another layer of flour and cover with a piece of plastic wrap. Let sit until the dough has risen by half, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Place an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Place a 3- or 4-quart lidded Dutch oven on the rack and allow to heat while the oven reaches the desired temperature. When the dough has proofed, carefully remove the Dutch oven from the oven and remove the lid. Uncover the plastic from the bread dough and gently lower the dough into the Dutch oven on the parchment. Cover the Dutch oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid, then bake until the top is golden brown and crusty, another 10 to 20 minutes. Let it cool on a rack for about an hour, then slice and serve with butter if desired. This is best on the first day, but it will freeze well wrapped tightly in plastic. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 10152,&quot;Manhattan Beer Slushie Two 12-ounce bottles American lager, such as Budweiser 12 pitted fresh or frozen cherries 3 ounces orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier 10 1/2 ounces sweet vermouth 9 ounces bourbon 2 tablespoons bitters Instructions: Pour the beers into an 8-by-8-inch baking dish.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Cream the butter and granulated sugar together with an electric mixer. Scrape the bowl and mix in the eggs. Scrape the bowl again and add the sour cream, vanilla and lemon zest. Mix to combine, then add the dry ingredients and mix until just combined\u2014do not overmix. Using a 3-ounce ice cream scoop, scoop the batter for 6 cookies onto each prepared baking sheet. They will spread, so make sure there is plenty of room around each scoop. Bake, rotating the baking sheets once during baking so they bake evenly, until the edges of the cookies just start to brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Let the cookies cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. If you don&#39;t cool on a rack the cookies can steam themselves and get gummy. For the icing: Whisk together the milk, corn syrup, vanilla and salt in a liquid measuring cup. Add the powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer). Add the milk mixture and mix on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to high and whip until fluffy and smooth. Stir in the cardamom and lemon zest. Transfer 3/4 cup of the icing to a small bowl and whisk in the cocoa powder until well combined. Divide the remaining icing evenly between 2 more small bowls; add the pistachio paste to one of the bowls and whisk well to combine. To decorate: Spread the pistachio icing on half of the flat side of each cookie. Refrigerate the cookies for 5 minutes, then spread the other half of each cookie with the white cardamom icing. Drizzle the chocolate icing over the tops. Sprinkle with the ground pistachios, if desired. Let the icing set for 5 minutes in the fridge and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10166,&quot;cl Sweet Corn Fritters One 10-ounce bag frozen sweet corn, thawed (about 2 cups) 1 small red onion, finely chopped 1 fresh red cl, deseeded and finely chopped, optional 1 medium clove garlic, finely chopped 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast flakes, optional (or 1 tablespoon soy sauce) 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder A scant 1/2 cup (100 ml) unsweetened almond milk Flaky sea salt\u202fand freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Olive oil, for frying Store-bought sweet chili sauce, warmed, for serving Instructions: In a medium bowl, mix the corn, onion, cl if using, garlic, parsley and yeast flakes.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Unroll one tube of dough and shape into a rectangle. Cut it into an oval shape using as much of the sheet as possible, tapering the long edges to a point to resemble the shape of a football; reserve the dough scraps. Unroll, shape and cut the other tube of the dough to make the same shape; this second piece is your base. Place the base piece of dough on the prepared baking sheet. Add the fillings evenly to the center of the base, leaving a 1-inch border for crimping later. Starting at the base and in order add: half of the Brie slices, all of the soppressata, the jam in dollops, the pecans, cranberries and the rest of the Brie. Cover the fillings with the other piece of dough and press to form into a mound to resemble half of a football. Crimp the top to the base, tucking the dough under to seal. Use the extra dough scraps to make 1 strip half the length of the football and 4 to 6 thinner 1-inch-long strips. Arrange the longest strip in the center along the length of the football and place the smaller strips centered and perpendicular to the first strip to mimic the look of a football. Lightly brush the dough all over with the milk. Bake until the football is golden brown, 20 to 24 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes. In a small pot, heat the honey and lemon juice.

Coat six 6-inch round cake pans with flour-based baking spray. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the flour, granulated sugar, cake mixes and salt. Whisk on low speed until combined. Add the sour cream, eggs and 2 cups of water. Mix on medium speed until just combined. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl; add the vanilla extract. Mix again until no streaks of the dry ingredients remain. Divide the batter into 3 bowls. Tint one bowl of batter with the neon green food color and tint a second bowl with the orange food color. Add the food color a little at a time until a bright hue is achieved. Leave the last bowl of batter plain (white). Divide the plain white cake batter among the prepared pans. Spoon a little green and orange batter into each pan and swirl the colors together with a skewer or butter knife. Bake the cakes until they are lightly browned and a toothpick tester inserted near the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let the cakes cool completely. Level each cake layer using a serrated knife or a wire cake leveler. For the green vanilla buttercream: Cream together the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar on low speed in the bowl of an electric mixer. When the mixture is combined, increase the speed to high and whip until light in color, about 3 minutes. Turn the mixer off and add the vanilla extract. Beat again until the buttercream is light and fluffy, about another 3 minutes. Add milk or cream if the mixture is too thick to spread or pipe. Place 1/4 cup of the buttercream in a small bowl and cover with a damp towel. Tint the remaining buttercream with the neon green food color. Add a little at a time while beating until a vibrant hue is achieved. Drape a damp towel over the bowl so the buttercream doesn\u2019t dry out. Use the green buttercream to fill the cake layers and to apply a thin crumb coat to the outside of the cake. Use an offset spatula or bench scraper to even the buttercream. Place the cake in the refrigerator to chill until the buttercream is firm, about 15 minutes. When the crumb coat layer is well chilled, apply a second layer of green buttercream and smooth it using an offset spatula or bench scraper. Chill while you prepare the black chocolate drip topping. For the black chocolate drip: Place the candy melting wafers and heavy cream in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat the mixture in the microwave at 100% power for 1 minute. Allow the mixture to stand for 1 minute longer. Gently whisk together until the mixture creates a smooth, glossy candy ganache. Let the mixture cool slightly. Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Spoon the ganache over the cake, pooling it in the center of the top first, and then using the spoon to gently push some of the ganache over the edge to create a drip effect. Allow the cake to stand until the ganache is set, about 15 minutes at room temperature. For the rice puff ghosts: Use kitchen-dedicated scissors to trim the rice paper into roughly ghost-shaped pieces. Make varied shapes of ghosts with and without arms. Each rice paper round should yield about 2 ghosts, giving you at least 12 from all 6 wrappers. In a large saucepan or an electric skillet, heat the sunflower oil to 350 degrees F. Using tongs, place the rice paper ghosts in the oil. They will instantly puff, wrinkle and twist in the hot oil. Remove the puffs to paper towels to drain and cool completely, about 5 minutes. Dab a paint brush into the piping gel and dot it onto the head of the ghost puffs. Place the eyeballs on the rice paper. Allow the candy to set about 10 minutes before using to decorate the cake. Place the reserved white vanilla buttercream in a disposable piping bag. Use dots of buttercream on the backs of the ghosts to adhere them to the outside of the cake. Some of the ghosts will adhere without additional buttercream when placed on the black drip. Insert a wooden skewer into the top of the cake leaving about 2 inches sticking out from the top. Place a ghost puff on each side of the skewer standing upright.

Add the olive oil and heat. When the oil is hot, add the onions and cook for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and chicken and cook until the mushrooms begin to give off their liquid and the chicken is no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and add the port. Return to the heat and cook until the port is reduced by 1/4. Be careful as the mixture may ignite. Add the chicken stock and cook for 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the chicken and mushroom mixture and place in a bowl. Return the pan to the heat and reduce the liquid down until it is a syrupy consistency, about 5 minutes. Add the reduced liquid to the chicken mixture. Add the parsley and mix well. Cool. Remove the bone from the thigh to the first joint of the leg. Reserve the bones and scraps for the steaming liquid. You can ask your butcher to do this for you. Season the legs, inside and out, with salt and pepper. Lay the legs down, skin-side down. Place 1/4 cup of the cooled filling inside each leg. Fold the meat over the filling and secure closed with a toothpick. In the bottom of a steamer, combine the chicken stock, reserved bones, thyme, and olive oil and bring to a boil. Place the steamer basket in the steamer. Add the chicken legs in 1 layer and cover. Steam until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the chicken legs from the steamer and keep warm while you make the sauce. Place 1/2 cup of the steaming liquid in a blender. Add the watercress and blend well. With the blender running on low, add the butter, a little bit at a time. Season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Slice the boneless part of the chicken leg into 3 slices. Place some sauce on a plate and top with the chicken leg. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 10188,&quot;Grapefruit in a Simple Rosemary Syrup 1 pink grapefruit, cut into supremes 1 white grapefruit, cut into supremes 1 cup grapefruit juice 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon rosemary Instructions: Combine grapefruit juice, sugar and rosemary in a small saucepan.

Add the flour, cornmeal, cayenne and remaining 1/2 tablespoon each of the seasoned salt, BBQ seasoning and garlic salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper to a separate resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to combine. When the chicken is done marinating, add a few pieces at a time to the seasoned flour and shake to coat. Remove the chicken from the bag and shake off the excess flour mixture. Place the chicken pieces on the air fryer rack in an even layer without the pieces touching. Seal the fryer and cook until the chicken is golden brown and crispy and reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, 30 to 40 minutes.

Soak, rinse, and drain if packed in salt, then chop fine. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the salmon&#39;s skin, any loose membranes, and carefully pick out all the bones. Dice the fish finely and put it in a bowl, together with 2 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, the chopped parsley, garlic, capers, 1 tablespoon of bread crumbs, salt, and several grindings of black pepper. Toss thoroughly. Wash the tomatoes, cut them horizontally in half, and scoop out all the seeds and the centers to make a cup-like hollow. Pat the insides of the tomatoes with paper towels to soak up excess juice, then stuff the tomatoes with the salmon mixture, pressing it down lightly as you do so. There should be enough to form a mound. Sprinkle the tops with the remaining bread crumbs and drizzle with the remaining olive oil, holding back a few drops of the oil to smear the bottom of a baking pan. Place the tomatoes in the oiled baking pan and bake in the upper level of the preheated oven for 35 minutes or until the salmon stuffing has formed a light golden crust.

Blend until totally combined. Put the flank steak in a large resealable plastic bag or baking dish. Pour in the marinade and make sure it adequately coats the meat. Seal the bag or cover tightly and refrigerate for 24 hours at least. For the nachos: When ready to make the nachos, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat an indoor grill pan to high. Remove the meat from the marinade (discard the marinade). Drizzle a little olive oil on the grill and grill the meat over very high heat, about 4 minutes per side. (Turn it 45 degrees halfway through on both sides to get nifty grill marks.) Set aside to rest. In a large skillet, heat a couple of tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and peppers, sprinkle over the taco seasoning and cook until the vegetables are somewhat soft and starting to get black bits, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside. Slice half of the flank steak into strips against the grain, then chop the slices into smaller bites (see Cook&#39;s Note). Put the sauteed veggies on a cutting board and roughly chop to get them into smaller pieces. Arrange the tortilla chips on a large ovenproof platter (or baking sheet). Sprinkle plenty of cheese all over the top. Put the platter in the oven for 3 minutes or so, just long enough to melt the cheese (but not burn the chips). Generously sprinkle the peppers, onions and chopped steak all over the top. Garnish with cilantro leaves.

The milk should be just a little hotter than warm, between 100 and 115 degrees F (but no warmer than 115 degrees F). Remove the saucepan from the heat and whisk in the sugar, yeast and 2 teaspoons salt. Let the mixture sit until the yeast is activated and foam covers the top, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the flour, egg and yeast liquid to a large bowl. Make the dough by mixing the ingredients together with a rubber spatula. Make sure all ingredients are incorporated; the dough will be sticky and loose. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Remove the plastic and gently re-knead the dough in order to deflate it while still in the bowl. Form into a ball, as best you can, and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Transfer the dough to a very generously floured surface, kneading to bring together. Cut the dough into 8 pieces, about 3 1/2 ounces each. Gently form each piece into a ball, incorporating more flour as needed so the dough is no longer sticky but still pliable. Use your hands to flatten each ball to a 4 1/2-inch circle. Brush a piece of pepperoni with oil and place in the center of the circle, along with 2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella. Fold the dough over the pepperoni, like a burrito, and place on the prepared baking sheets seam-side down. (It&#39;s ok if the filling is not fully encased at this point.) Repeat with the remaining pepperoni and cheese, placing the bundles on the baking sheets at least 1 inch apart to allow for a third rise. Cover the rolls loosely with plastic wrap and place in a warm place for 30 minutes. The rolls will puff up just a bit.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the tops of the rolls with the remaining oil and bake until the crust is crispy and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 10207,&quot;Chipotle Pork Chops 2 chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, seeds removed, plus 2 tablespoons sauce from the can 4 cloves garlic 4 bay leaves 1 teaspoon ground cumin 3/4 teaspoon dried thyme 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Kosher salt 1 large onion, halved and sliced 1 cup canned fire-roasted diced tomatoes 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 6 bone-in pork blade chops (1/2 to 3/4 inch thick; about 3 1/2 pounds total) Instructions: Combine the chiles and adobo sauce, garlic, bay leaves, cumin, thyme, cinnamon and 5 teaspoons salt in a food processor and pulse to make a paste. Transfer to a shallow dish and add the onion, tomatoes, cilantro and 1/3 cup olive oil; mix well. Add the pork chops, turning to coat; cover and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Preheat a grill to medium. Meanwhile, remove the pork chops from the marinade, scraping off the excess, and transfer to a plate. Transfer the marinade to a skillet; add 1/4 cup water and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the liquid simmers and the onions start sizzling, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for basting. (You can also do this in a cast-iron skillet on the grill.) Brush the chops with olive oil and transfer to the grill. Cook until marked, 7 to 8 minutes, rotating the pork 45 degrees halfway through to create a crosshatch pattern and brushing with the liquid from the marinade. Flip and repeat, brushing with more marinade, including some pieces of onion and tomato.

Bruise the stalks with the back of a thick knife. Wrap each stalk in a piece of cheesecloth and tie with strings. In a stainless steel saucepan combine the water and sugar and bring to a boil, stirring once to make sure sugar has dissolved. Add one prepared lemon grass stalk and remove from heat. Allow lemon grass to steep in syrup until cooled. In a stainless steel saucepan combine heavy cream and the second prepared lemon grass stalk. Bring cream to a boil, remove pan from heat and allow to cool. Remove lemon grass stalks from cream and sugar syrup. Place yogurt in a large stainless steel bowl. Whisk in the cool lemon grass-infused cream and lemon grass syrup. Keep mixture chilled until ready to serve. Just before serving add lime juice to yogurt mixture. Adding lime juice too early will cause soup to curdle. Ladle soup into chilled bowls or flat soup plates. Place a scoop of lime granita (or sherbet) in the center of the bowl and garnish with lime zest. Additional accompaniments include gingersnap cookies and/or thinly sliced tropical fruits such as papaya or kiwi. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 10255,&quot;S&#39;mores Monster Cupcakes 1 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 cup whole milk 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup vegetable oil 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg 3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 cups marshmallow creme 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar Purple, orange, neon green, blue and black gel food coloring, for coloring the frosting 12 chocolate-covered graham cracker cookies Candy eyeballs, as needed Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with black cupcake liners. Mix the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Microwave the milk in a large microwave-safe bowl until bubbling, about 1 minute. Whisk in the cocoa until dissolved. Whisk in the granulated sugar, oil, vanilla and egg until smooth. Fold in the flour mixture until combined.<br> Divide the batter among the cupcake liners (about 1/4 cup per liner). Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.<br> For the frosting: Meanwhile, beat the butter in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light, fluffy and almost double in size, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the mixer to low, add the marshmallow creme and confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until just combined, about 1 minute.<br> Divide the frosting into 5 separate bowls. Color one bowl with purple gel food coloring, one bowl with orange gel food coloring, one bowl with neon green gel food coloring, one bowl with blue gel food coloring and one with black. Spoon into 5 separate piping bags fitted with small star tips (we used a size 15 tip).<br> For the decorations: Pipe monster faces and hair on top of the chocolate-covered graham cookies. Decorate with candy eyes. Use the remaining frosting to pipe on top of the cupcakes. Place one decorated cookie on top of each cupcake.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10256,&quot;Cheese-and-Broccoli-Stuffed Pork Roulade with Grilled Tomato Relish 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing 1 1/2 cups broccoli florets, cut into 1-inch chunks (about 7 ounces) 2 cloves garlic, sliced Kosher salt One 7.5-ounce bag Sargento Chef Blends Shredded 4 State Cheddar (about 2 cups) 2 pork tenderloins, trimmed (2 to 2 1/2 pounds total) Freshly ground black pepper 1 medium red onion, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds 2 cups cherry tomatoes 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar<br> Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and cook, stirring, until the broccoli begins to brown in spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1 cup water, and continue to cook until the water evaporates and the broccoli is tender, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl, stir in the Cheddar and reserve.<br> Butterfly the tenderloins by making a 1-inch-deep incision down the length of each without cutting all the way through. Open the tenderloins like books so they lie flat, cover with plastic wrap and pound with the flat side of a meat mallet until they&#39;re about 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread the broccoli mixture over the 2 tenderloins, leaving a 1-inch border around all the sides except the long one closest to you. Tightly roll up each tenderloin, tucking the narrow ends inside as you roll. Tie each roulade with butcher&#39;s twine tightly (without piercing the meat) on each end and at 2-inch intervals in between. Brush with oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.<br> Prepare an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, leaving 1 burner off for indirect heat (to finish the roulades). Oil the grill grates. Grill the roulades over direct heat, turning, until the outside is well marked, about 12 minutes. Move them to indirect heat, cover and cook until a thermometer inserted in the center of each roulade registers 145 degrees F, about 15 minutes more. Transfer them to a cutting board to rest 10 minutes.<br> While the roulades are cooking, make the relish: Lay an onion slice on a cutting board. Place the palm of 1 hand on top of the slice, and with the other hand push a metal skewer through the slice crosswise until it comes out the other side. Repeat with the other slices, leaving an inch of skewer uncovered on each end and using as many skewers as necessary. Thread the tomatoes on the skewers. Brush the onions and tomatoes with oil. Grill, turning, until the tomatoes are charred and bursting and the onion slices are tender with brown edges, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the tomatoes and onions from the skewers, and chop. Mix with the parsley, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl.<br> Cut the strings off the roulades with scissors, and slice the roulades on the bias. Serve with the relish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10257,&quot;Soft-Shell Crabs with Lime Sauce 1/2 cup all purpose flour Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 medium-sized soft-shell crabs, cleaned 4 tablespoons butter 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest Juice of 2 limes 1/2 cup water Optional: 1/2 cup roasted sliced almonds Lemon wedges or rounds for garnish Instructions: Season the flour with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Coat the crabs with flour and shake off excess. Heat butter and oil in a large skillet. When hot, add the crabs, shell side down first and saute for about 3 to 4 minutes a side (stand back a bit from skillet as crab will pop and splatter as you saute them.) Remove the crabs and keep them warm. Add lime zest, juice and water to the pan. Deglaze the pan by scraping up all the browned particles with a wooden spoon and incorporating them into the lime juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Boil the juices down until syrupy. Set crabs on warmed dinner plates and pour pan juices over them. For fancier occasions, garnish the plate with lemon rounds and sprinkle toasted almonds over the crabs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10258,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Spicy Ranch Dipping Sauce 1/2 cup ranch dressing 2 tablespoons hot sauce, such as Texas Pete 3 basil leaves, snipped with scissors<br> Instructions: Combine the dressing, hot sauce and basil in a bowl and mix. Serving suggestion: Drizzle over pizza. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Zinfandel, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 10259,&quot;Cucumber Kimchi 4 tablespoons Korean coarse sea salt (see Cook\u2019s Note) 2 pounds Kirby cucumbers (about 6 to 8)<br> 1 tablespoon glutinous rice flour<br> 1 1/4 teaspoons sugar<br> 1 ounce carrot (about a 1-inch piece), julienned<br> 1 ounce Chinese chives, chopped<br> 1/4 small onion, thinly sliced<br> 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons coarse gochugaru (Korean red cl flakes)<br> 2 tablespoons fish sauce<br> 2 tablespoons minced garlic<br> 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 1 tablespoon fermented salted shrimp Instructions: Whisk together the sea salt and 5 cups lukewarm water in a large bowl until most of the salt is dissolved, then set the brine aside. Cut off a small piece from both ends of the cucumbers, then halve each cucumber crosswise. Cut each half lengthwise from the wider end until you reach 1/2 inch from the thinner end. (Do not cut all the way through the cucumber.) Turn the cucumber 90 degrees and repeat the process. What you have now is 4 equal \u201cspears\u201d of the cucumber held together at the thinner end.<br> Add the cucumbers to the brine and let soak until the spears can bend slightly without breaking, 3 to 4 hours. Drain the cucumbers cut-side down in a colander for 1 hour.<br> Meanwhile, whisk together rice flour, 1/4 teaspoon of the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small pot. Heat over medium-high heat and whisk constantly until thickened, 4 to 5 minutes. (The mixture will start bubbling at about 2 minutes.) It is ready when you tilt the pot and streaks/lines in the mixture formed from the whisk on bottom of the pot don\u2019t fill in. Set the paste aside until ready to use.<br> Combine the carrots, chives, onions, gochugaru, fish sauce, garlic, chili flakes, salted shrimp, the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar and reserved paste in a medium bowl.<br> Working with one cucumber at a time, hold the spears open with one hand and use your other hand to stuff the vegetable mixture between the spears and slather it all over. (Distribute the mixture evenly among the cucumbers.) Serve immediately or transfer to an airtight container and let sit at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours so the flavors develop more. I think the kimchi tastes best cold, so also like to refrigerate it for at least an hour before serving. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10260,&quot;Chicken Salad and Cranberry Brie Toast 1 (2 to 3-pound) whole chicken 1 gallon water 2 carrots, cut in 2-inch pieces 3 celery stalks, cut in 2-inch pieces 1 onion, halved 1 head garlic, halved horizontally 2 turnips, halved 4 fresh thyme sprigs 2 fresh rosemary sprigs 10 peppercorns 3 bay leaves 1/2 cup walnuts, roughly chopped Kosher salt About 1 cup mayonnaise 1 heaping tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/2 lemon, juiced 2 celery stalks, small diced 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves plus sprigs, for garnish 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper 2 cups shredded chicken meat, roughly chopped 8 slices sourdough bread, cut 1/2-inch thick 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature 1/4 cup cranberry sauce 1/2 pound brie 1 green apple, thinly sliced Instructions: Begin by poaching the chicken. Put the chicken in a large stockpot and cover with 1 gallon of cool water. Add the vegetables and herbs and bring the pot up to a boil over medium-high heat. Skim well; then simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes, skimming frequently as the oil rises to the surface. When done, remove to a platter and set aside to cool. Strain the liquid and reserve it for use as chicken stock. Shred the chicken meat and discard the skin and bones.; Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Roughly chop the walnuts and then gently toast in a dry skillet over medium heat until they brown and are slightly fragrant. Season walnuts with salt once they are finished toasting. Add the walnuts, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, celery, parsley, olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste, in a large mixing bowl and combine. Fold in the shredded chicken and set aside while you prepare the bread. Toast the bread in a hot oven until golden. Smear each piece with a little butter and then a tablespoon of cranberry sauce over 4 of the pieces. Lay the 4 cranberry-smeared pieces out on a sheet tray and top each piece with 2 to 3 slices of thick-cut brie. Pop this back in the oven for a minute or 2 so the cheese is slightly melted and creamy. Remove from the oven and top with a few slices of green apple. Top with a scoop of the chicken salad and cover with the other half of the bread to complete the sandwich. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 10261,&quot;White Pizzas with Arugula 1 1/4 cups warm (100 to 110) water 2 packages dry yeast 1 tablespoon honey Good olive oil 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for kneading Kosher salt 4 cloves garlic, sliced 5 sprigs fresh thyme 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 3 cups grated Italian fontina cheese (8 ounces) 1 1/2 cups grated fresh mozzarella cheese (7 ounces) 11 ounces creamy goat cheese, such as montrachet, crumbled 1/2 cup good olive oil 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice Freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces baby arugula 1 lemon, sliced Instructions: Mix the dough: Combine the water, yeast, honey and 3 tablespoons of olive oil in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. When the yeast is dissolved, add 3 cups of flour, then 2 teaspoons salt, and mix on medium-low speed. While mixing, add up to 1 more cup of flour, or just enough to make a soft dough. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth, sprinkling it with the flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to the bowl. Knead by hand: When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured board and knead it by hand a dozen times. It should be smooth and elastic. Let it rise: Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl and turn it to cover it lightly with oil. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 30 minutes. Make garlic oil: Place 1/2 cup of olive oil, the garlic, thyme and red pepper flakes in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook for 10 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn&#39;t burn. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. (Be sure your oven is clean!) Portion the dough: Dump the dough onto a board and divide it into 6 equal pieces. Place the doughs on sheet pans lined with parchment paper and cover them with a damp towel. Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes. Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 4 hours. Stretch the dough: Press and stretch each ball into an 8-inch circle and place 2 circles on each sheet pan lined with parchment paper. (If you&#39;ve chilled the dough, take it out of the refrigerator approximately 30 minutes ahead to let it come to room temperature.) Top the dough: Brush the pizzas with the garlic oil, and sprinkle each one liberally with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the pizzas evenly with fontina, mozzarella and goat cheese. Drizzle each pizza with 1 tablespoon more of the garlic oil and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the crusts are crisp and the cheeses begin to brown. Make the vinaigrette: Meanwhile, whisk together 1/2 cup of olive oil, the lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the greens: When the pizzas are done, place the arugula in a large bowl and toss with just enough lemon vinaigrette to moisten. Place a large bunch of arugula on each pizza and a slice of lemon and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 10262,&quot;Spinach-Bacon Stuffed Potatoes 4 small russet potatoes (about 8 ounces each) 1 red or green bell pepper 1 bunch scallions 3 slices bacon 8 cups packed baby spinach (about 8 ounces) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese (about 4 ounces) 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1/4 teaspoon hot sauce, plus more for serving 4 large eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Pierce the potatoes a few times with a fork. Microwave until tender, about 12 minutes. Place directly on the oven rack and bake until the skin is crisp, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, chop the bell pepper and scallions. Cook the bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, turning, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels, then chop. Add the bell pepper and all but 1 tablespoon of the scallions to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 4 minutes. Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper and cook until wilted, 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl; reserve the skillet. Split the potatoes and scoop out half of the flesh from each; stir into the vegetables along with the cheese, broth, hot sauce and all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon back into the potatoes. Set on a baking sheet and bake 5 minutes. Return the skillet to medium-high heat; crack the eggs into the pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the whites are set, 5 minutes. Serve the eggs over the potatoes; top with the reserved scallions and bacon. Serve with more hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 10263,&quot;Thai Toast 1/2 cup peanut butter, room temperature 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 teaspoon soy sauce 5 slices bread, toasted Diced cucumbers Diced scallions Instructions: Whisk together the peanut butter, sesame oil and soy sauce.

Rub the potatoes with olive oil and salt; prick them a few times with a fork. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake until tender, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool slightly. Make a slit in the potatoes and scoop out most of the flesh into a large bowl, leaving 1/2 inch behind so the skins hold their shape. To the bowl, add 1/2 cup of the Parmesan as well as the milk, sour cream, melted butter and half of the scallions; fold together to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture among the potato skins, mounding a bit, and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Bake the stuffed potatoes until golden brown on top, 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10265,&quot;Edamame 1 pound soybeans in the pod Salt Instructions: Steam soybeans for 20 minutes until slightly soft.

Gradually whisk the beer into the well to make a smooth, thin batter. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour. (You can make the batter up to 12 hours in advance; it gets better the longer it sits.) Preheat the oven to 400. Cover the potatoes with water in a medium pot and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Toss the potatoes with the melted butter and spread on a baking sheet. Slightly flatten each potato with a spatula (do not mash completely) and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until crisp and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 375 degrees. Season the fish all over with salt and pepper. Working in batches, dip the fish into the batter, let the excess drip off and lower into the hot oil. Fry until evenly brown, turning with tongs, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Transfer the potatoes to bowls or plates along with the fried fish. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve with malt vinegar, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 10267,&quot;Come &#39;ere Puddin&#39; Pie - Chocolate-Ginger Pudding Pie 15 chocolate wafer cookies 15 gingersnaps 3/4 stick unsalted butter, melted Generous pinch salt 2 cups whole milk 3 yolks 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup cornstarch 5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped Pinch salt 2 tablespoons chopped candied ginger 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons powdered sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Crust: Crush the cookies in a food processor with the melted butter until almost finely crushed, or in a plastic food storage bag, using a rolling pin). Pour the cookie crumbs into pie dish.

Add the beaten egg to a small bowl and add the vinegar and water and mix together. In a large mixing bowl cut the lard into the flour. Add the liquid and mix together. The less you handle the dough the better the crust will be. When the mixture is totally combined into the dough cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place into the refrigerator until you will be putting the pasties together. Trim all of the fat from the steak and dice into 1/2-inch cubes. Peel and dice potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes. Peel and dice rutabaga into pieces smaller than the potatoes. Peel and dice carrots into pieces smaller than the potatoes. Place all ingredients into a very large mixing bowl and combine thoroughly with your hands. Be sure to start with clean hands and nails. Add the salt and pepper and mix the ingredients to combine. My mother used enough pepper to turn the entire bowl black before mixing the ingredients. Roll out the pie crust and place bottom crusts into 2 (9-inch) pie tins. Do not grease the pie tins before adding the crust. Next, fill the pie tin with the meat and vegetable mixture. It should be heaping since the mixture will cook down. Before placing the top crust in place, add a large pat of butter to the top of the pie filling. Remember we cut off all the fat on the meat earlier. Place top pie crust and trim to finish. You can use the finger-and-thumb method to finish the crust, like Grandma did, or you can use a fork to finish the crust. Before placing into the oven, cut 2 slits in the crust for steam to leave the pastie while cooking. Also using the egg and a little water, make an egg wash to brush on the crust. This will give the crust a golden, shiny finish. Bake the Pasties in a preheated 350 to 375 degree oven, middle rack for 90 minutes. Watch the crust so that it doesn&#39;t get too brown in the cooking process. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10276,&quot;Cornbread Stuffing 3 cups cornbread mix, prepared as directed, cooled then crumbled 1 medium onion, small dice 2 stalks celery, minced 1/2 cup chicken broth 1/2 cup pecans, chopped 1/2 cup dried cranberries 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning 2 tbsp. butter Instructions: In a saute pan, saute onions and celery in butter. Stir until translucent. Pour in chicken stock, bring to a simmer. Off the heat combine the rest of ingredients. Serve alongside Sam&#39;s Club rotisserie chicken.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 10277,&quot;Olive Oil Gelato 2 3/4 cups milk 1 1/4 cups heavy cream 1 vanilla bean, seeded 7 large egg yolks 1 cup sugar Pinch salt 3/4 cup good extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Add the milk, heavy cream, vanilla bean seeds and vanilla bean to a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Set over medium heat and bring to a very low simmer. Keep an eye on it and stir often while you prepare the egg yolks. Meanwhile, add the yolks, sugar and salt to a large bowl and whisk until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the olive oil and beat vigorously for another minute or so until it&#39;s completely emulsified.<br> Slowly ladle in about 1 cup of the hot milk mixture into the eggs and olive oil, whisking the whole time. This is called tempering - it&#39;s getting the yolks used to the hot temperature of the milk and preventing them from scrambling. Add the tempered eggs back into the milk in the saucepan and stir until it thickens just slightly and coats the back of a spoon. This should take about 5 minutes.<br> Strain the custard through a fine mesh strainer into an 8-cup measuring cup. Let cool, and then cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge. You want the mixture to cool down completely and be well chilled before you run it in your ice cream machine. You can make this the night before.<br> Freeze the ice cream according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions - you should let it run about 30 minutes - until it looks like soft serve. Then place the ice cream back into the freezer until firm, another hour. Keep in mind that gelato is softer than ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10278,&quot;Giant Easter Egg Cookie One 16.5-ounce tube ready-made sugar cookie dough, at room temperature 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons pasteurized egg whites 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2 cups assorted Easter candy, such as jelly beans and mini eggs, etc. 2 cups assorted Easter candy, such as jelly beans and mini eggs, etc.<br> Sprinkles, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Blend until smooth. Add more of either juice to thin out if need be. (Achiote can be quite dense, so make sure the mixture is smooth.) Place the pork fat-side up into a slow cooker. Pour the achiote marinade over the pork and spread it all over. Sprinkle salt all over the pork after applying the marinade, to ensure even seasoning! Add the pineapple chunks around the pork. Cover and cook until completely fork-tender, about 6 hours on high heat or 8 hours on low heat. Arrange an oven rack in the top two-thirds of the oven. Preheat the oven to broil on high. Place the pork, fat cap-side up on a sheet pan fitted with a wire rack. Broil until the fat and meat get bubbly and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Don\u2019t walk away! Keep your eye on that pork so it doesn&#39;t burn. Remove the pork from the sheet pan to a cutting board. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the bone. Lift the fat cap off, coarsely chop, and set aside. Using 2 forks, shred the pork. Transfer the pork and fat to a platter and pour the braising liquid over it. (And the pineapple chunks, if desired.) Top each tortilla with pork, Slaw, Salsa and cilantro. Whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, mustard, brown sugar, celery seeds, sesame oil and salt and pepper to taste in a large bowl. Add the apples, Brussels sprouts, red bell peppers and chives. Let sit for 1 hour. Adjust the seasonings. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat a large grill pan to medium-high heat. Add the tomatillos, garlic, ancho cl, poblano cl and onion. Grill the ancho cl until just slightly colored, then transfer to a small bowl. Pour enough hot water to cover. Let it sit until the cl softens, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the stem and seeds and reserve the water to adjust the consistency of your salsa, if needed. Continue to char the tomatillos, garlic, poblano and onion on all sides until blackened in parts, removing them to a cutting board as done. (Depending on their size, each vegetable will char at a different rate.) Remove the stem and seeds from the poblano and the skins from the garlic and onions. Put the tomatillos, garlic, onions, all the chiles, lime juice, cilantro and agave into a food processor and blend until mostly smooth.

Bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the sugar and salt; stir to dissolve. Turn off the heat, and then cool to room temperature (this can take an hour or so; put it in the fridge to hasten the process. Alternatively, you can boil only 4 cups of water and then add 5 cups of ice cubes). When cool, pour the brining solution into a container large enough for the pork and the solution, such as a disposable aluminum roasting pan. Cover and refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Pull the pork out of the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Warm the oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Add the pork to the pan and brown on all sides, about 15 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add 2 tablespoons butter to the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Add the apples and celeriac. Season with salt and saute until golden brown. Deglaze with vinegar and 1 cup cider, scraping up any brown bits. Stir in the brown sugar. Nestle the pork loin in the apples and celeriac and pour enough cider into the pan to keep things from burning on the bottom of the pan, about 1 cup. Transfer the pan to the oven. Roast until a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the loin reads 145 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before carving (pork will continue to cook as it rests). Meanwhile, return the pan to the stove over medium heat. Finish the sauce by adding in more cider if the pan is too dry. Stir in the remaining butter and the vanilla and black pepper. Taste for seasoning and readjust, if necessary. Slice the pork into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange on the platter with the apples and celeriac. Drizzle the sauce over the meat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 10303,&quot;Turkey Cubanos 1 Archer Farms Take &amp; Bake Ciabatta 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard ? cup cranberry sauce 12 slices Market Pantry?

Add the onion, garlic, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender and lightly golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.<br> Add 3 tablespoons of the ketchup and cook until most of the moisture has evaporated and the mixture is thick and brick red colored, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the onions cool slightly. Then add them to the beaten eggs and mix to combine.<br> Add the beef to the egg and onion mixture. Break up the meat with a fork or wooden spoon, and then mix to thoroughly combine; you don&#39;t want to see any lumps of raw beef. Add the panko and mix to combine. Stir the meat vigorously with a wooden spoon for about 7 seconds; it will become more homogenous and tackier.<br> Transfer the meat to the prepared baking sheet and shape into a 9-by-5-inch loaf. Smooth the top and evenly spread the remaining ketchup over top. Bake for 5 minutes, and then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Continue to bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf registers 150 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow the meatloaf to rest for 20 minutes before slicing.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 10318,&quot;No Cook Pop Rock Cheesecake 2 cups crushed graham crackers 5 tablespoons softened butter 1/2 cup granulated sugar, plus 2 teaspoons, divided 6 ounces pop rocks in strawberry, watermelon, or cherry, divided Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup heavy whipping cream 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup lime juice 12 ounces cream cheese, room temperature Instructions: Combine the crushed graham crackers, butter, and 2 teaspoons sugar in bowl and mix until incorporated.

When syrup reaches a boil, watch carefully, as the temperature can escalate quickly. Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, whisk the egg whites, the remaining 1 pound of sugar, and the cream of tartar to medium peaks. Once the syrup has reached 240 degrees F, start to drizzle the hot sugar syrup into the meringue while the beaters are running. Continue until all of the syrup is used and then continue to whip the meringue until it cools to room temperature. Slowly add in the softened butter; the mixture will tend to curdle. Continue to mix until all of the butter has been incorporated; the buttercream will eventually come together, becoming a smooth mixture in the end. Make sure to scrape down the bowl from time to time while mixing. Divide the mixture into 2 large sheet pans, cover securely, and refrigerate until ready to use. Make the cake: Lightly spray a size 400 hotel pan or large sheet pan with non-stick cooking spray and then line with parchment paper; set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Sieve the cake flour at least twice and set aside. Cream the eggs and sugar in a mixing bowl, beating until a pale yellow color. Gently fold in the cake flour. When this stage is almost completed, fold in the melted butter. Spread the genoise batter onto the prepared sheet pan. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool cake in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, and then remove to a rack to cool completely before frosting. While cake cools, make a simple syrup by combining 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water in a heavy saucepan over high heat; bring to a boil and then remove from the heat and let cool. Assembly: Cut the cakes into 4 equal pieces so that they will fit perfectly on top of each other. Brush the bottom cake layer with simple syrup and then brush it with framboise. Brush a thin layer of raspberry marmalade on top and then apply a layer of the buttercream-Italian meringue. Repeat 2 more times. For the fourth and final cake layer, brush it with simple syrup and then framboise, but do not apply the marmalade. Frost the top and the sides of the cake, smoothing it out until perfect. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 10342,&quot;Lemon Curd 1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons egg yolks 1 tablespoon lemon zest Instructions: Combine 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon of sugar, and the lemon juice in a medium saucepan.

Butter just the sides of a 9-inch round cake pan. For the caramel topping: Stir the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring, and gently swirl the saucepan occasionally until the mixture is the color of deep amber, 8 to 9 minutes. If needed, brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and carefully whisk in the butter (take care: the mixture can bubble up considerably). Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan, tilting the pan to cover most of the bottom (be careful: the pan will be very hot from the caramel). Arrange the bananas in a single, tight layer, then cover any gaps with the remaining slices. For the cake: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the milk and sour cream in a small bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl as needed, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low, and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk-sour cream mixture, mixing until just incorporated.

Set aside. Fill a saucepan about a third of the way with water and bring to a simmer. Put the chocolate and butter in a medium heatproof bowl and place over the simmering water, making sure that the bottom does not touch the water. Heat, stirring, until melted and smooth. Set the mixture aside. Keep the pot of water simmering but not boiling. Put the whole egg, yolks and salt in a heatproof bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light, about 1 minute. Slowly add the granulated sugar to the egg mixture while continuing to beat. Set the bowl over the simmering water and increase the heat to bring the water to a rapid simmer. Whisk the egg mixture constantly over the heat until pale yellow, very fluffy and hot to the touch, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whip until cool and thick and the mixture folds over on itself (holds a ribbon), about 3 minutes. Whisk about a quarter of the egg foam into the chocolate to lighten. With the whisk, briskly fold in the remaining foam (the mixture may get very thick). Whisk in the whipped cream, taking care to keep the mixture light. Hold in the refrigerator. For the frosting: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer). Mix on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium high and mix until smooth. Adjust the consistency with the milk as desired. Mix in enough of the red food coloring to make the frosting cotton-candy pink. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a medium plain tip. For the rice cereal treat shell: Add the marshmallows and butter to a large pot over medium-low heat and cook, stirring, until melted. Add the rice cereal and mix to combine.<br> While the cereal mixture is warm, spray the inside of a medium bowl and your hands with nonstick spray. Line the bowl with a 2-inch-thick layer of the cereal mixture. Spray the outside of a smaller bowl with nonstick spray and place it in the center of the cereal shell, pressing down to compress and even out the cereal layer. Once the cereal has set, spoon the chocolate mousse into the center of the shell. Flatten the remaining cereal mixture and lay it over the mousse, pressing the sides to seal. Refrigerate until chilled, about 15 minutes.<br> Invert onto a platter or baking sheet and form gently to look like a brain. Pipe the frosting on top of the cereal shell in a brain-like pattern. Make a 1-inch line down the center of the brain with a butter knife or offset spatula and top the frosting line with red sprinkles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 10368,&quot;Pork Carnitas with Cilantro Tomatillo Sauce 1 pound pork shoulder 2 tablespoons Mazola?

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. For the dough: Add the flour, granulated sugar and salt to a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until mealy. Combine the water and vinegar in a liquid measuring cup; slowly drizzle into the flour mixture with the food processor running until the dough begins to become homogeneous\u2014do not overmix. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and press into a disc. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. For the filling: Meanwhile, combine the berries, 1/3 cup sugar, lemon juice and salt in a medium heatproof bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to let the berries macerate, about 30 minutes. Transfer the macerated berries along with the juices to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Meanwhile, combine the Zinfandel and cornstarch in a small bowl and whisk together, breaking up any clumps. Add to the berries and cook until thickened, another 5 minutes or so. Transfer the filling to the medium heatproof bowl; add the lemon zest, butter, almond extract and remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and toss to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool in the fridge. For the assembly: Divide the dough into 10 even pieces. Roll each piece into a round 5 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Keep the dough covered with plastic wrap as you work with 1 round at a time. Whisk the egg, salt and 1 tablespoon water. Brush around the edge of a dough round and add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the filling to one side of the round, leaving 1/2 inch of the dough empty at the edge. Fold the round in half over the filling to create a half-moon shape, crimp the edges with a fork to seal then trim off any excess dough.

Cook&#39;s Note: The order of food on the grill for the Spinach Salad is - Asparagus and red bell pepper chunks go in the wok first, then the spinach. The shrimp go on the grill about 5 minutes after the asparagus and red pepper. For the salad: Spray your grill grid wok with olive oil cooking spray (away from the grill). Put the wok on the grill and once it is hot, add the chopped asparagus and red pepper. Drizzle with olive oil (maybe 1 to 2 tablespoons), season with salt and pepper and stir. Cook for about until veggies glisten, about 10 minutes. Add the spinach and toss, allowing the grill to do its thing. Once the spinach begins to turn dark, meaning it has begun to cook, which takes about 5 more minutes). Take the salad off the grill and put it in a microwave/oven safe bowl (I do this in case I need to put it in a warm oven for 1 or 2 minutes, while everything else finishes up. This salad is best when hot. Immediately squeeze the lemon juice over the top, add the feta cheese and toss. Steam should rise up from the bowl and you&#39;re ready to eat this! For the shrimp: Add shrimp and marinade to a 1 gallon resealable bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (longer is better). Skewer the shrimp onto flat metal skewers (so you can turn the shrimp without them spinning) and grill until pink), a few minutes on each side, basting with the marinade as they cook.

Add the flour in 1/2-cup increments, mixing on low speed just until the dough becomes sticky and pliable, about 2 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put somewhere warm to rise, such as inside an unlit oven, until the dough is roughly doubled in size, about 2 hours. (You can also refrigerate the covered dough overnight.) Lightly flour a large work surface. Punch down the dough with your fist to remove air, then place the dough on the work surface. Roll the dough into a 12-by-14-inch rectangle that is about 1/4 inch thick. Make 6 cuts 2 inches apart along the 12-inch side and 7 cuts 2 inches apart along the 14-inch side using a sharp knife or pizza cutter for a total of forty-two 2-inch squares.

Lay chicken breasts flat on a cutting board. Carefully slice each breast in half, horizontally. Take cut chicken and place flat in a resealable plastic bag, then close bag. Now it&#39;s time for Poundtown. Put bag back on cutting board and use a meat hammer, large pot or rolling pin and pound out chicken without breaking bag to 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick. Remove chicken from bag and place in a large deep container. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts. Add buttermilk, salt, pepper and jalapenos to a food processor or blender. Process until jalapenos are pulverized, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour buttermilk mixture from processor into the container on top of chicken and return to refrigerator. Let chicken marinate in mixture for at least 8 hours. For the disco flour: Mix flour, salt, pepper, paprika, cumin and garlic powder in a bowl until combined. Take a break and put on some disco music. Set disco flour aside until ready to dredge disco chicken. For the spicy honey butter: Add butter, honey and cayenne pepper to a large pot. Bring mixture to a simmer and whisk vigorously. Cook until all butter is melted, then remove pot from stovetop and let mixture cool completely. Pour cooled spicy honey butter into a squirt bottle. Again, take a break and ponder if disco was the best music of the 70&#39;s. Maybe so, maybe not. Do not refrigerate spicy honey butter; store at room temp! For the Cheddar biscuits: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine flour, butter, cheese, baking powder, granulated sugar, salt and brown sugar in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Turn on mixer and mix until slightly grainy, not doughy, then turn off mixer. Add buttermilk, milk and cream and mix until doughy and well-mixed, then turn off mixer and remove dough from mixer bowl. Grease a muffin tin and form 5-ounce dough balls with your hands. Add dough balls to muffin tin and press down in muffin slots. Bake until tops are golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Now dim the lights and turn on the disco ball. For the assembly: If pan-frying, add oil to a pan and heat up to 350 degrees F. If using a deep-fryer, add oil and set fryer temperature to 350 degrees F. Remove chicken breasts one at a time from disco marinade and dredge in disco flour, pressing down on chicken to ensure a good coating on both sides. Remove chicken from disco flour and place into hot oil. Fry until chicken is golden brown and a meat thermometer inserted in the center registers an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, 5 to 7 minutes. Grab a regular thermometer and place it under your tongue\u2014it should read above 98.6 because you&#39;re on fire! Grab a plate and make a design on it with the spicy honey butter. Cut a biscuit in half and put on plate. Add a little more spicy honey butter on biscuit halves. Place disco chicken on top of biscuits and cover chicken in spicy honey butter. Grab finely chopped green onions and sprinkle on top of disco chicken. Give yourself a high five! If you&#39;re not dancing, then start! With a knife (optional) and fork, cut into disco biscuit and savor the flavor(town). You have just made and now eaten a Guyutes Disco Biscuit. You are special, and don&#39;t let anyone tell you differently. (Make 7 more sandwiches in same manner.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, GSM (Grenache, Syrah, Mourvdre)]&quot; 10406,&quot;Blue Cheesy Yorkshire Pudding 12 strips bacon 2 cups 1-percent milk 3 large eggs<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup finely crumbled blue cheese<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cook the bacon using the \Mauro Method.\ Line a baking sheet with parchment, overlapping each side 1 to 2 inches. Put the bacon on the parchment and bake until crisp and brown, about 20 minutes. This way, the fat will fry the bacon to a perfect crisp, but not come in contact with the metal pan, creating a mess. Drain the bacon on paper towels and let cool. Once the fat is cooled, reserve 6 tablespoons. Microwave the milk for 45 seconds. Whisk together the milk, eggs and 2 tablespoons of the cooled (yet liquid) bacon fat in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Slowly combine the liquid ingredients with the dry ingredients and whisk until combined. Let the batter sit for at least 1 hour (at room temperature) or overnight in the fridge (ideal). Place a rimmed baking sheet on the middle oven rack. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Evenly ladle the remaining 4 tablespoons bacon fat into the cups of a 12-cup muffin tin. Heat the muffin tin in the hot oven until smoking, about 4 1/2 minutes. Quickly ladle some batter into each cup of the muffin tin, almost up to the brim. Bake, on the baking sheet (to catch any drippings) until golden brown with a dramatic rise (doubling in size), 25 to 30 minutes. Once immediately out of the oven, place some blue cheese crumbles in the center of each warm Yorkshire pudding. Grind some black pepper over them and serve right out of the muffin tin. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 10407,&quot;Salsa Stoup With Avocado Smash And Double-Decker Baked Quesadillas 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of pan, plus some for brushing tortillas 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped 1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped<br> 1 large onion, chopped 3 ribs celery, chopped with greens 3 cloves garlic, chopped Salt and pepper<br> Salt and pepper 1 (28-ounce) can stewed tomatoes 1 can crushed tomatoes 2 cups vegetable or chicken stock 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro or flat-leaf parsley 6 flour tortillas, 6 to 8 inches 1 cup shredded Cheddar, available in pouches on dairy aisle 3 scallions, chopped 4 ounce brick Pepper Jack or chipotle cheese, shredded, about 1 cup Sour cream, to pass at table Avocado Smash, recipe follows 1 avocado 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves 3 scallions, thinly sliced 1 lime, juiced 1 cup sour cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 plum tomato, finely chopped<br> Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.<br> Heat a medium soup pot over medium-high heat.

Trim the ends off of the zucchini and then thinly slice into 1/4-inch thick disks. For the breading station, arrange 3 large shallow bowls near the heating oil. Place the flour in 1and the bread crumbs in another. Crack and beat the eggs in the remaining bowl with a splash of water or milk. Add the mozzarella cubes to the flour, toss to coat, shake off excess and then transfer to the egg. Coat the mozzarella in the egg then transfer to the panko bread crumbs, coating thoroughly. Carefully drop the coated mozzarella into the hot oil and fry turning at least once until golden brown. Once brown transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain, sprinkle with salt while still piping hot. For the zucchini and basil, mix them together in a bowl. Repeat the same process as you did with the mozzarella cubes. Fry until golden all over. Drain alongside the fried mozzarella. For the olives, simply repeat the same process. Arrange all of the fried items on a platter and serve with lemon wedges &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 10421,&quot;Scooter Bars 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup whole-wheat pastry flour 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 1 pinch kosher salt 6 tablespoons cold butter, cubed 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons honey Cold water, as needed 1 (8-ounce) package marshmallows *2 egg whites 1/3 cup heavy cream 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 1 tablespoon butter, softened Instructions: Crust:<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> In the bowl of a food processor, add the flours, sugar and salt and pulse to combine.

Leave for a couple of minutes until they&#39;ve softened. Fish them out of the stock and chop them, reserving the soaking liquid.<br> In a large pan, heat a glug of olive oil and add the onion and celery. Slowly fry without coloring for at least 10 minutes, then turn the heat up and add the rice. Give it a stir. Stir in the vermouth or wine - it&#39;ll smell fantastic! Keep stirring until the liquid has cooked into the rice. Now pour the porcini soaking liquid through a sieve into the pan and add the chopped porcini, a good pinch of salt and your first ladle of hot stock. Turn the heat down to a simmer and keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and massaging the starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. This will take about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, get a dry griddle pan hot and grill the wild mushrooms until soft. If your pan isn&#39;t big enough, do this in batches. Put them into a bowl and add the chopped herbs, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice. Using your hands toss everything together - this is going to be incredible!<br> Take the risotto off the heat and check the seasoning carefully. Stir in the butter and the Parmesan. You want it to be creamy and oozy in texture, so add a bit more stock if you think it needs it. Put a lid on and leave the risotto to relax for about 3 minutes. Taste your risotto and add a little more seasoning or Parmesan if you like.

When ready to grill, preheat 1 of the burners to 350 degrees F. Make sure the chicken is clean and innards are removed; pat dry with a paper towel and set aside. In a small mixing bowl, add paprika, brown sugar, kosher salt, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic salt, chili powder and mix well. Take the chicken and separate the skin from the breast taking care not to tear or remove skin. Apply the spice rub directly to the chicken breast, under the skin. Apply rub to the entire chicken, inside and out, reserving at least 2 tablespoons. Punch 2 holes at the top of the can, with a manual hand-held can opener. In a new bowl, mix butter and remaining spice rub. Add this mixture to the half-full can of beer. Place chicken over beer can and insert into the cavity of the chicken, keeping beer can standing up. Place the wood chips in a foil smoker pouch over the active burner on the grill and set the chicken, on a pie plate, over the in-active burner. Close the lid. Rotate the chicken every 20 minutes. 5 minutes before cooking is complete, drizzle the honey over the chicken.

Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and place a 12-inch cast-iron skillet on the rack. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven and add the steaks, making sure they are spaced apart, so they don&#39;t steam. Top each steak with 1 sprig of thyme, one-half sprig of rosemary and 1 tablespoon cold butter. Return the skillet to the oven and cook until the undersides of steaks are well browned, about 4 minutes. Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and flip the steaks using tongs, then continue to cook until desired doneness, about 2 minutes more for medium-rare and 3 minutes more for medium.

With the tips of your fingers, work cold butter quickly into the flour mixture until the butter is the size of peas. Add all cheeses and toss together. Sprinkle the water in by the tablespoon while tossing the flour cheese mixture with your other hand. As soon as the dough begins to form a mixture that sticks together, gently press it out on a lightly floured board in a rectangle about 10 to 12 inches long by 5 to 6 inches wide. Roll quickly with a rolling pin, so the dough is a solid piece. It will look rough at this point, but will smooth out later. Fold 1/3 of the dough towards you from the top and 1/3 of the dough away from you towards the top. The dough will break along the folds; don&#39;t worry about it. Turn the dough block sideways so it looks like a book. Roll the dough a second time and fold again. Rest the dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Roll and fold the dough twice more. Rest it in the refrigerator for 1 hour. At this point, the dough may be frozen in one or two pieces or rolled to make cheese straws. To roll dough to make cheese straws, cut dough in half, keeping one half chilled. On a lightly floured board, roll dough about 1/8-inch thick in a rectangle about 8 to 9 inches wide. Trim the edges (but bake the trimmings for a snack). With a sharp knife, cut the straws 1/2-inch wide and lay them on a well greased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes until a light brown. They will crisp as they cool. The straws are fragile, so handle them carefully and eat them soon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 10433,&quot;Spicy Pork Roast with Rosemary Potatoes 1 tablespoon cumin seeds 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes 1/2 tablespoon whole black peppercorns 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon salt 1 (3-pound) pork roast, cut into 4 steaks, 2-inches thick 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 3 russet potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces 2 sprigs rosemary, stripped 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Salt 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 1 cup orange juice 1 tablespoon butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. To prepare the pork: Place cumin seeds, red pepper flakes and peppercorns in a spice grinder and grind into a fine powder. Place in a small bowl and mix in garlic powder and salt. Rub mixture all over pork. Let sit at room temperature, 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss potatoes with rosemary, oil and salt. In a small saucepan, bring sugar, vinegar and orange juice to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and continue cooking Sweet and Sour Sauce until it reduces by half, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, swirl in butter and keep warm before using. In a 13-inch cast iron skillet, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. When pan is smoking hot, add pork and sear on both sides. Add potatoes and place in the oven until pork is cooked through and potatoes are tender, about 40 minutes. Serve pork chops with rosemary potatoes and drizzled with the Sweet and Sour Sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 10434,&quot;Broccoli Cheddar Crescent Ring 4 cups finely chopped broccoli florets (about 13 ounces) 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 clove garlic, finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 ounces cream cheese, diced Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing the pan Two 8-ounce tubes refrigerated crescent roll dough 5 slices Cheddar, cut in half (about 5 ounces) Ranch dressing, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the broccoli, oil, crushed red pepper, garlic and 2/3 cup water to a large skillet and stir until combined. Cover and bring to a boil. Let the broccoli steam until bright green and just crisp tender, about 3 minutes. Remove the lid and let the water continue to boil until it is completely evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and transfer to a medium bowl. Let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir the cream cheese. Coat the back of a baking sheet with cooking spray. Unroll both cans of crescent dough and separate unto 16 triangles. Put a 5-inch ramekin in the center of the prepared baking sheet. Arrange the triangles in a ring around the ramekin so the short sides of the dough are touching the ramekin, overlapping slightly, and the pointed ends are facing outward (it should look like a giant sun).<br> Spoon the broccoli mixture over the short ends of the triangles closest to the ramekin. Cover the broccoli with the cheese slices and remove the ramekin. Take hold of the pointed end of one of the triangles and fold it up and over the filling, tucking the tip under the bottom edge of dough to secure (the dough will not cover the filling completely). Repeat with the remaining triangles (there will be some gaps where you can see the broccoli mixture).<br> Bake until the dough is golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 25 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Use a spatula to slide the ring off the baking sheet onto a platter.

In a small sauce pan, heat the milk and 2 tablespoons butter together. Using an electric mixer fitted with a wire whip, combine the eggs and sugar together. Beat on medium-high speed for about 8 minutes, or until the mixture is pale yellow, thick and has tripled in volume. With the machine running slowly add the heated milk. In a mixing bowl sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture and mix thoroughly so that there are no lumps and the mixture is smooth. Fold in the vanilla. Grease 2 each 9-inch round cake pans with 2 tablespoons of butter. Sprinkle each with a tablespoon of sugar. Pour the cake batter evenly into the pans and bake for about 25 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when touched. Cool for about 2 minutes. Using a thin knife, loosen the edges of the cakes, then flip onto a wire rack. When the cakes have cooled completely, slice each cake in half. To assemble, place the bottom layer on a 9-inch round cardboard and place it on a wire rack. Spread 1 1/2 cups of the pastry cream evenly on top of the layer. Top with the second layer of cake. Spread 1 1/2 cups of pastry cream on it. Repeat the same process with the third layer. Top with the fourth layer. If necessary, shave off any uneven pieces of cake with a serrated knife so that it is smooth and even on all sides. Frost the entire cake with the chocolate fondant. Place the cake in the refrigerator and chill completely. Slice the cake into 16 slices. In a saucepan, whisk the 2 cups of the milk and sugar together. Place the pan over medium heat and bring the liquid up to a simmer. Whisk the egg yolks together. Temper the hot milk into the egg yolks. Whisk the egg mixture into the hot milk mixture.

Using a 1/4-cup ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner with batter. Bake the cupcakes until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the tops are light golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes. Transfer the pans to cooling racks and cool for about 10 minutes, and then transfer the cupcakes to the racks and allow to cool completely before filling and frosting. For the quatro leches mixture: Whisk the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk and heavy cream in a mixing bowl to combine. Transfer to a squeeze bottle and refrigerate. When the cupcakes are cool, make the frosting: Combine the cream, powdered sugar and vanilla in a chilled mixing bowl. Whip until medium-stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over whip. Chill briefly if not using right away. To assemble: Use a chopstick or fat skewer to poke 4 or 5 holes halfway through each cupcake. Squeeze some of the quatro leches mixture into each hole; you can let it sink in a bit and then squeeze in some more to fill. Frost generously with the whipped cream frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 10447,&quot;Chicken Enchiladas 6 tomatillos, husks removed 2 jalapenos<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for cooking<br> 4 chicken legs<br> 4 chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat and skin<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 large Spanish onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice<br> 3 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped<br> 2 cups chicken stock<br> Zest and juice of 2 limes 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus a few more leaves for garnish<br> 8 corn tortillas<br> 2 cups grated jack cheese<br> Lime Sour Cream, recipe follows Pico de Gallo, recipe follows 1/2 cup sour cream Zest and juice of 2 limes 4 Roma tomatoes, diced Juice of 1 lime 1/2 jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped<br> 1/2 onion, chopped 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br> Salt Instructions: Preheat a grill for cooking over medium heat. Place the tomatillos and jalapenos on the grill and cook, turning occasionally, until the skins char and blister, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the tomatillos and jalapenos from the grill and let cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a large, wide straight-sided saute pan with olive oil and heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the chicken generously with salt.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and dust lightly with confectioners&#39; sugar. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder and salt in a bowl. Put the egg whites in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until frothy. Gradually add 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar and beat until stiff, shiny peaks form, about 6 minutes. In a medium bowl, beat the yolks and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar until pale and thick. Beat in the vanilla. Gently fold the yolks into the egg whites; it&#39;s okay if some streaks remain. Add the flour mixture and fold gently, but thoroughly, until well mixed. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 3/4-inch plain tip. Pipe 3-inch-long, 1-inch-wide ladyfingers about 1/2 inch apart. Dust the tops of the cookies lightly with confectioners&#39; sugar. Bake until springy to the touch, 16 to 18 minutes. Cool completely. For the decoration: Combine the chocolate and coconut oil in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted. Dip one end of each ladyfinger in the chocolate, then sprinkle with the coconut over parchment paper. Place on a serving platter. Refrigerate until set. Serve immediately or keep refrigerated until ready to serve, up to 4 hours (ladyfingers dry out quickly). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 10463,&quot;Mummy Jalapeno Poppers 4 slices bacon, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces 6 ounces plus 1 heaping tablespoon cream cheese, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups finely shredded Cheddar Jack cheese 2 scallions, thinly sliced 1 clove garlic, finely grated Kosher salt 10 medium to large jalape?os (each 3 to 4 inches long), halved lengthwise with the stem intact, seeded with a small spoon One 8-ounce tube refrigerated crescent rolls 1 large egg, beaten 4 to 5 black olives (such as canned or Kalamata), for decorating Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment. Place the bacon in a medium skillet and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Mix the cooked bacon with the 6 ounces cream cheese, the Cheddar Jack, scallions, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until well combined. Fill each jalape?o half with the cream cheese mixture, leveling the surface with the back of a spoon or a small offset spatula so it\u2019s flush with the edges of the jalape?o. Unroll the crescent rolls onto a cutting board. Separate into 4 rectangles at the perforations. Pinch together the diagonal perforations on each rectangle to seal the holes. Cut each rectangle lengthwise into 10 strips. Wrap each jalape?o half with 2 of the strips to resemble mummy bandages. Arrange the wrapped jalape?os on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops of the strips with the beaten egg. Bake until golden brown and the filling is hot, 13 to 18 minutes. Meanwhile, transfer the remaining heaping tablespoon cream cheese to a small resealable plastic bag and snip one of the corners. Slice off thin cheeks from all around the outside of each olive and lay the pieces flat. Punch out 40 tiny rounds using a small round piping tip (about 3/16 inch) \u2013 these will be the pupils of the eyes. Let the mummy poppers cool slightly for a few minutes. Pipe 2 small mounds of cream cheese on the head (wider end) of each mummy and press an olive \u201cpupil\u201d onto each mound. Serve right away. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 10464,&quot;Soft and Chewy Ginger Molasses Cookies 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup sugar, plus more for rolling 1/3 cup molasses 1 large egg Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.<br> Whisk the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.<br> Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until well combined, about 3 minutes. Add the molasses and egg and beat until lighter in color, about 3 minutes. Add the flour mixture and mix on low until well blended.<br> Using a tablespoon, form the dough into 1-inch balls and roll in sugar. Place each ball 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until golden and crackled, 12 to 15 minutes; the cookies will still be a little soft. Baking these in 3 batches one sheet at a time gets you the nice, crackly top. The second sheet of cookies can stay on the counter until ready to bake. Form the remaining dough, roll the balls in sugar and place on the now cooled first baking sheet. Allow the cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, and then remove to a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10465,&quot;Miso Soup 8 cups vegetable stock 8 ounces yellow miso 4 ounces low-fat firm tofu, diced 3 scallions Instructions: Bring stock to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer.

Add the red peppers and black beans and stir to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 10469,&quot;Baby Back Ribs with Spicy Peach BBQ Sauce 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 2 teaspoons smoked paprika<br> 2 racks pork baby back ribs (about 5 pounds total), membrane removed 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, diced<br> 1 clove garlic, chopped<br> One 3-inch piece ginger, peeled and chopped<br> One 10-ounce bag frozen peaches, thawed<br> 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon Calabrian chili paste<br> Instructions: For the ribs: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, salt and paprika. Place the ribs on 2 sheets of aluminum foil large enough to wrap around them and seal. Rub the ribs evenly on all sides with the sugar mixture. Bring the foil up and around the ribs and crimp closed. Place on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until tender but not falling apart, about 3 1/2 hours. Allow to cool slightly, about 30 minutes. For the sauce: Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the oil, onion, garlic and ginger to the pan and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the onions are soft and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add the peaches and stir to coat with the flavors. Add the vinegar, sugar, salt and Calabrian chili and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low to maintain a gentle simmer. Add any dripping that may have accumulated on the baking sheet from the pork. Simmer until the peaches are very soft, about 30 minutes. Using an immersion blender, puree the sauce until it is as smooth or as chunky as you like. Preheat the broiler to high heat. Spoon one-quarter of the sauce all over the ribs. Broil for 4 minutes. Remove and repeat the process another 2 times, until the sauce is thick, sticky and golden brown. Serve with more sauce on the side if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 10470,&quot;Profiteroles 1/2 cup water 1/2 stick butter Pinch salt 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 eggs Pinch ground cinnamon Ice cream Chocolate Sauce, recipe follows 4 ounces semisweet or dark chocolate 1/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon corn syrup 1 good pinch ground cinnamon Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In a small saucepan combine the water, butter and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and add the flour all at once and stir it vigorously with a wooden spoon. Cook until the mixture has formed a ball and has a slightly sweaty sheen to it and it has pulled away from the pan. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and let cool for 3 to 4 minutes. The mixture does not have to be cold, just cool enough not to cook the eggs when added. Using an electric mixer or lots of good old-fashioned elbow grease, beat in the eggs 1 at a time. Do not add the second egg until the first is fully incorporated. Add in the cinnamon and beat for another second to combine. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag equipped with a large straight tip and pipe 1-inch balls onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. When done dip your finger in water and smooth the top of each ball where the pastry bag released the dough. Be sure to leave at least 1-inch between each of the balls. They grow! Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through the cooking time to insure even cooking. When done, the puffs should be light, airy and dry inside. Cool on a rack. When ready to serve, cut in half horizontally and fill with ice cream of your choosing. (I prefer a really high-quality vanilla.) Top with warm Chocolate Sauce. Bring a saucepan with 1-inch of water to a boil. Put the chocolate in a metal or heatproof glass mixing bowl and place on top of the saucepan with boiling water. Pay careful attention that the mixing bowl does not touch the surface of the boiling water. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir until the chocolate has melted and everything is combined. This is a pretty quick process, once the chocolate has melted remove it from the double boiler set up. Spoon over the filled profiteroles. This is best when served warm! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 10471,&quot;Pesto Fried Eggs 1/4 cup store-bought or homemade pesto 2 large eggs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Spread the pesto in an even layer in an 8-inch nonstick skillet; bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs on top of the pesto and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper; continue to cook until the egg whites are just set and the oil has separated from the pesto, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover with a tight-fitting lid (or a heatproof plate or a baking sheet). Let sit until the whites are completely set and the yolks are still runny, 1 to 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 10472,&quot;Flaky Pastry Dough 1 pound all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 2-tablespoon pieces, at slightly cooler than room temperature 6 ounces ice-cold water 1 teaspoon lemon juice Instructions: Add the flour and salt to a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the butter and toss to combine. With your fingers, begin to \smush\ the butter into flat pieces. Continue smushing until all the butter is flattened but none of the pieces are larger than a quarter. The flour will look like coarse cornmeal. Add the water, quickly folding it in with a wooden spoon to distribute the moisture. (Do not stir vigorously--the dough should appear shaggy.) Use your hands to break up any large clumps of moisture. Then use your knuckles or a palm to smear the dough up the sides of the bowl (a technique known as fraisage). This distributes the butter over a larger surface to achieve larger flakes and compact the dough. Once you&#39;ve gone around the bowl one time, fold the dough over itself a few times to pick up any dry bits from the bottom. Gently press the dough into a disk. (Note: The dough should remain very cool to the touch throughout the process. If it approaches room temperature, refrigerate it for 5 to 10 minutes to chill.) Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll out to a 10-by-12-inch rectangle. Perform a letter fold by folding one of the short ends towards the middle and the other short end over the first, like folding a business letter. Turn the dough 90 degrees, so the long side faces you, and perform a second letter fold. Turn the dough 90 degrees again; perform a third letter fold. If the dough still feels cool, it can be used immediately. Otherwise, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. The dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10473,&quot;Gingerbread Waffles 3 cups all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 2 teaspoons ground ginger<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, eyeball it<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 4 large eggs<br> 2/3 cup packed dark brown sugar<br> 1 cup canned pumpkin puree<br> 1 1/4 cups milk<br> 1/2 cup molasses<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) melted butter, plus some to butter the iron Syrup, whipped cream or fresh fruits for topping, to pass at table<br> Instructions: Preheat waffle iron.<br> In a large bowl combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt. In a medium bowl, beat eggs and brown sugar until fluffy, then beat in pumpkin, milk, molasses and melted butter. Stir the wet into dry until just moist. Do not overstir the waffle batter.

Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds, then stir in the Swiss chard stems. Pour in a few tablespoons of water and cover the pan. Cook the stems 2 minutes. Remove the cover, the mix in the Swiss chard leaves. Cover the pan again and cook until the leaves wilt, about 3 minutes. Toss occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool, uncovered. To make the polenta preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Butter a 2 1/2quart shallow baking dish and set it nearby. Combine the milk, water, and salt in a mediumsize saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to mediumlow and slowly drizzle in the cornmeal, whisking all the while with a wire whisk. Continue to cook and whisk the polenta until it is the consistency of mashed potatoes and tears away from the sides of the pan, about 5 minutes. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese, the 1 tablespoon of butter, and the mozzarella cheese. Spread half the polenta in the baking dish. Spoon on the Swiss chard and distribute it evenly. Drop on small spoonfuls of the sour cream and spread it with the back of a spoon. Spoon on the remaining polenta and spread it out. Sprinkle on the remaining tablespoon of Parmesan cheese. (The casserole may be prepared to this point and refrigerated up to 24 hours in advance. Bring to room temperature before baking.) Bake the polenta for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden on top and sizzling. Do not overcook it because you want to retain its creamy interior. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 10475,&quot;Chocolate Chip-Apricot Cookies 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips 1/4 cup roughly chopped dried apricots Instructions: Beat the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until fluffy.

Sprinkle the yeast over the applesauce and set aside until it begins to foam, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl mix the flours, spices and salt. Make a well in the center and spoon the yeast mixture into the well. Using fingertips gradually work the flour into the yeast mixture while adding the hard cider. When the dough comes together in a ball, turn it out onto a floured board and knead it until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball. Place it in an oiled bowl, cover and let it rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Butter two 4 cup loaf pans. Punch down the dough and divide it in half. Shape each half into an oval loaf and transfer the loaves to prepared pans. Cover, and let rise again until the dough fills the pans, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Alternately chill the dough for at least 8 hours or up to 3 days. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place a roasting pan on the oven floor and fill it half full with hot water. Bake the loaves in the preheated oven until they are brown and sound hollow when rapped, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans and bake them for an additional 5 minutes. Cool completely on a rack before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 10487,&quot;Sausage, Potato and Escarole Roast 1 1/2 pounds small red potatoes, halved or quartered if large 4 plum tomatoes, halved 3 to 4 cloves garlic, smashed 3 to 4 small rosemary sprigs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/4 pound sweet Italian sausages, pricked with a fork 1 orange bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips 1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips 1 head escarole (about 9 ounces), torn into bite-size pieces Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Toss the potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper with the oil in a large baking pan. Roast for 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and scatter the sausages and bell peppers over the potatoes. Continue to roast for 20 minutes more. Remove the sausages, then add the escarole to the pan with the potatoes, scraping up the potatoes. Toss to combine. Place the sausages on top of the escarole. Move the oven rack to the highest position and roast on the top rack until the escarole is wilted, about 5 minutes. Set the oven to broil and broil until the sausages are well browned and the escarole is slightly charred, about 1 minute, watching carefully to prevent them from burning. Transfer to a platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 10488,&quot;Green Onion-Cheddar Doughnut 12 cups (3 quarts) vegetable oil 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/2 cups finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese<br> 1/2 cup roughly chopped scallions 1/4 cup sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 3/4 cup buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 1 large egg, beaten<br> Instructions: Heat the oil to 365 to 375 degrees F in a cast-iron Dutch oven over medium heat. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, cheese, scallions, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, sour cream and egg. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix to combine, making sure there are no dry bits left. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly coat with flour. Pat the dough into a 1-inch disc. Then, using a large glass dipped into flour, cut out rounds for the doughnuts. Press the dough back together to cut out another doughnut or 2. Dip your finger into the flour, then press it into the center of each doughnut while it is on the floured surface to create a hole. Move your finger around in the hole to make it larger. Turn the doughnut over and repeat on the other side to make sure the hole is clear and large. When the oil is ready, place the doughnuts into the oil carefully and fry for 3 to 4 minutes per side. The doughnuts are thick and take time to cook all the way through. You can flip them every minute to keep them from browning too much on each side. Transfer the doughnuts to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and sprinkle with a little salt. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]&quot; 10489,&quot;Lomo Saltado 12 ounces rib-eye steak Salt and freshly ground black pepper Garlic, to taste 1/8 cup vegetable oil, plus more for deep-frying Handful precooked French fries 1/4 medium red onion, thinly sliced 1/4 medium tomato, sliced 3 to 4 teaspoons vinegar 1 teaspoon soy sauce 1 to 2 ounces beer 2 to 3 pinches chopped parsley leaves Steamed white rice, for serving Instructions: Cut the steak in long pieces 1/4 by 1 1/2 to 2 inches.

In a saute pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Blanch the peas for 3 or 4 minutes in the boiling water. Drain and puree in a food processor or pass through a foodmill. Combine with the sauteed garlic. Taste for seasoning. Set aside. To prepare the stuffing: Wash the frisee, remove the stem, and discard the tough outer leaves. In a saute pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Saute the frisee until it begins to wilt, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to saute until the greens are just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. When cool enough to handle, chop coarsely. In a saute oan over medium-low heat, cook the bacon until golden brown. Drain on a paper towel. Discard the fat. Combine the bacon with the ricotta, Parmesan, herbs, and greens-garlic mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. To prepare the quail: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Season the inside of the quail with salt and pepper. Make a slit in the left leg of each quail and slip the right druntick end through the incision in the left. Fill a piping bag with the stuffing, and pipe the stuffing into the quail opposite the drumsticks, between the wing bones. (Using a piping bag makes it easier. If you don&#39;t have one, use a small plastic bag and cut off a corner. You could also spoon the stuffing into the birds.) Do not overfill. Tie the wings together. In a saute pan over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and brown the quail on both sides. Place them on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the juices run clear when the thigh is poked with a sharp knife. To serve, in a saute pan over low heat, reheat the pea puree for a few minutes. Divide among 4 plates. Remove the string from the wings of the quail, and place 2 quail on each plate, on top of the puree. Garnish with pea sprouts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 10494,&quot;BLT Biscuit Sliders 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 tablespoon sugar Kosher salt 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed 3/4 cup finely grated sharp cheddar cheese 3 scallions, finely chopped 3/4 cup cold buttermilk, plus more for brushing 16 slices bacon 1 avocado Juice of 1/2 lime 2 tablespoons chopped pickled jalapenos, plus 1 tablespoon brine 2 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced 2 heads baby lettuce, leaves torn Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Bring to a full boil over high heat, mashing the berries with a potato masher as they cook. Add the lemon juice and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring and mashing constantly. Add the sugar and return the mixture to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, until it begins to look syrupy and thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and test for doneness: a candy thermometer should register 220 degrees F and the mixture should coat the back of a spoon. Run a finger--or a clean object about the width of a finger--through the coat of jam. If the jam does not run and fill the gap, it is done. Otherwise, return the pan to the heat for another 1 to 2 minutes and test again. Be careful not to let the mixture get too thick--it will thicken as it cools. When the jam is done, transfer it to a heatproof jar and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate. The jam will keep for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 10500,&quot;Braised Paprika Chicken 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons smoked paprika 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 1/2 pounds bone-in chicken thighs (about 6 to 8) 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 medium yellow onions, quartered and thinly sliced crosswise Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 medium russet potato, small dice 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth Instructions: Combine kosher salt, paprika, and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.

In a food processor, using the plastic blade, add the roasted garlic, ricotta cheese, flour, olive oil, salt, and baking powder and pulse one or two times. Then add one half the hot saffron stock and begin to process and continue to add hot stock until a dough is formed. (Note that it may not require half the stock.) When dough is ready, follow the instructions on the cavatelli maker box for processing pasta. Once cavatellis are made, poach in salted boiling water for two to three minutes. Cool pasta in cold water and drain and coat with a little olive oil. For the marsala brown butter: In a medium saute pan add whole butter, melt and cook until butter is browned. Add in garlic and shallots. Deglaze with marsala and season with basil, parsley, lemon juice, salt and cracked black pepper. Toss the brown butter with saffron roast garlic cavatelli, place in a serving bowl.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the roast, fat cap up, in a roasting pan. Add 1 cup water to the pan and roast the brisket uncovered for 1 hour. In a medium bowl, combine the coffee, brown sugar, pepper, to taste, 3 cups hot water and cider vinegar. Remove the brisket from the oven, pour the coffee mixture over the brisket, cover with foil and braise until brisket reaches an internal temperature of 185 and is fork tender, about 3 hours. Remove to a carving board to let rest. Simmer the braising liquid in the roasting pan on the stovetop, skimming fat and allow to reduce just slightly or to desired consistency. Thinly slice beef across the grain. Dip the meat slices or the cut sides of the rolls in the reduced sauce. Make sandwiches with the meat and serve. Pour the remaining sauce into a small bowl and serve it with the sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 10511,&quot;Eton Mess 4 cups strawberries 2 teaspoons caster or vanilla sugar 2 teaspoons pomegranate juice 2 cups whipping cream 1 packet individual meringue nests Instructions: Hull and chop the strawberries and put into a bowl and add the sugar and pomegranate juice and leave to macerate while you whip the cream. Whip the cream in a large bowl until thick but still soft. Roughly crumble in 4 of the meringues nests - you will need chunks for texture as well as a little fine dust. Take out about half a cupful of the chopped strawberries, and fold the meringue cream and rest of the fruit mixture together. Arrange on 4 serving plates or glasses or in a mound, and top each with some of the remaining macerated strawberries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 10512,&quot;Seared Black Sea Bass with Bitter Greens, Fennel, Grapefruit and Feta Salad Extra-virgin olive oil Two 6-ounce black sea bass fillets Kosher salt 2 to 3 cups bitter greens (1/2 head radicchio, chiffonade and 1 endive, sliced) 1/2 cup diced fennel 1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced 1/4 ruby red grapefruit, juiced 2 tablespoons pitted gaeta or kalamata olives, slivered 1 ruby red grapefruit, supremed 1/3 cup crumbled feta cheese Instructions: Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Coat the bottom of another smaller saute pan with olive oil. Sprinkle the fish with salt on both sides. When the large saute pan is screaming hot but not quite smoking, lay the fish fillets in the pan, skin-side down. Do not crowd the pan, you may have to work in batches. After you put the fish in the pan, place the other small saute pan directly on top of the fish fillets. This applies gentle pressure to the fish and forces the skin to have contact with the pan and will create crispy skin. Cook the fish for 3 to 4 minutes, and then remove the top pan. Shake the pan a little to unstick the fish. Use a fish spatula to flip the fish fillets, and cook for 2 more minutes on the other side. Remove from the pan and serve, or keep warm until the remaining fish is cooked. In a large mixing bowl, dress the greens, fennel and red onions with olive oil and the grapefruit juice. Season with salt. Toss in the olive slivers and grapefruit supremes. Divide the salad between 2 serving plates and sprinkle with the feta. Lean a fish fillet on each salad. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 10513,&quot;Turkey Apple Panini 1 Focaccia or Ciabatta roll, sandwich-sized, sliced in half lengthwise 1 TBSP Extra virgin olive oil 4 slices Boar&#39;s Head Ovengold?

Turn the bird around and cut back down the other side of the spine, being careful not to cut into the thigh. Press down on the bird to flatten and make a shallow cut through the breastbone to further flatten the duck. Remove the neck flap and any extra pockets of fat. Turn the duck over, breast side up, and make a long slash in the skin and fat of each breast, making sure not to puncture the meat. Sprinkle both sides of the duck with the kosher salt and lay the duck, breast side up, on top of a broiler pan. Line the bottom of the pan with paper towels. Put the duck, uncovered, on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or until the skin is dry and reaches a near parchment consistency. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. If there is still salt visible, brush it off. Remove the paper towels from the bottom of the pan. Put the pan in the middle of the oven and roast for 30 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue to cook until the thigh reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 more minutes. Remove the duck from the oven and increase the heat to 450 degrees F. Once the oven has come to temperature, return the duck to the oven and roast until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove the top of the broiler pan, with the duck still on it, and put it on a sheet pan to rest. Pour off the duck fat from the bottom of the pan, measure 1/4 cup, and reserve the rest for another use. Decrease the oven heat to 350 degrees F. Put the broiler pan on the stove over medium heat and add the 1/4 cup of the fat. Add the onions, celery, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions and celery are translucent, approximately 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the cornbread, oyster crackers, thyme, sage, eggs, oysters and their liquor in a large mixing bowl and use your hands to mix well, breaking up the oysters as you go. Add the onion and celery mixture to the bowl and stir to combine. Transfer the dressing back into the broiler pan and spread evenly. Put the dressing on the middle rack of the oven and bake until golden brown and crisp around the edges, about 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer the duck to a serving platter and serve with the dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10519,&quot;Herbed Cornbread 1 cup yellow cornmeal 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried sage<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1 cup buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 1 large egg<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 3 tablespoons salted butter<br> 3 tablespoons shortening<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Use a wooden spoon to mix until a shaggy dough forms. Do not overwork. Continue to mix until the dough comes together and forms a ball, adding an additional 1/4 cup flour if needed. Lightly flour your hands and roll the mixture into quarter-sized balls; there should be 25 to 30 balls. Place the gnudi onto a lightly floured tray and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, add the oil, capers and sage leaves to a small saute pan. Place over medium heat and fry until crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. If the sage leaves become too dark, remove them before the capers. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a low boil. Add the butter and sage sprig to a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Melt the butter and continue to cook, swirling the pan in a circular motion to prevent the butter from burning, until it starts to turn golden brown and begins to smell nutty. Squeeze the juice from a lemon wedge into the pan to stop the butter from turning too dark and burning. Once the water is at a low boil, add the gnudi and cook until they float, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the gnudi directly into the browned butter. Stir to coat.

Add the clams and cook until opened, about 5 minutes. Remove clams with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Discard any clams that do not open. When cool enough to handle, remove the clams from the shell and coarsely chop. Bring the broth back to a boil, add the mussels and cook until the mussels open, discarding any that do not open. These mussels are added just to flavor the stock. After you remove them, eat them or reserve for another use (remove from the shell, store in a container with a tight fitting lid and refrigerate for up to 1 day). Strain the cooking liquid through a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth into a bowl. You should have 2 cups of liquid. For the breadcrumbs: Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat until it begins to shimmer, add the anchovies and cook until melted into the oil. Add the breadcrumbs and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly golden brown, and then season with salt and pepper. For the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the linguine to al dente according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and then drain the pasta well. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.

Serve on toasted bread or with crackers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10532,&quot;Caramel Apple Sundaes 3 tablespoons butter 4 medium-size, Granny Smith apples (about 1 1/4 pounds), peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch slices 3/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons water 1/4 cup heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 pint vanilla ice cream 1/4 cup salted cocktail peanuts, roughly chopped Instructions: In a large saute pan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add apples and saute, turning occasionally for even cooking, until slightly golden and softened but still holding its shape, about 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, add sugar and water. Stir occasionally and watch closely until color just starts to change to golden-amber, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove pan from heat and carefully add cream (mixture will bubble and release steam). Gently stir until bubbles subside slightly, and put back over very low heat. Stir in remaining tablespoon butter, vanilla, and salt, and remove from heat. Set aside to thicken slightly. Disperse apples into 4 serving bowls and spoon warm caramel sauce over to cover. Top each with a scoop of ice cream, spoon more caramel over the top, and garnish with peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10533,&quot;Roasted Chicken Jus 6 chicken wings 1 large onion, quartered 3 medium carrots, roughly chopped 2 stalks celery, roughly chopped 5 sprigs thyme 1 head garlic, cut in 1/2 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup dry white wine 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a roasting pan add chicken wings, vegetables, thyme and garlic. Season well with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Roast for 30 minutes until the wings are nice and brown. Remove from the oven and set over medium-high heat on the stove top. Add white wine to deglaze and scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Add the chicken stock and continue to simmer for 5 minutes to reduce the liquid until about 1 cup remains. Remove from heat and strain through a china cap, pushing some of the vegetable pulp through the strainer with the back of a ladle - this will help thicken the jus slightly. Add the cold butter cubes to the jus and swirl until it melts. Season again with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10534,&quot;Marinated Zucchini and Summer Squash 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound zucchini (about 3 large), trimmed and sliced diagonally about 1/4-inch thick 1 pound yellow crookneck squash (about 3 large), trimmed and sliced diagonally about 1/4-inch thick Instructions: Whisk the vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, and thyme in a large bowl to blend.

Meanwhile, in a large (12-inch) saute pan, heat the cream over medium heat until it comes to a simmer. Add the truffle butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, lower the heat to very low, and swirl the butter until it melts. Keep warm over very low heat. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 3 minutes, exactly. (If you&#39;re not using Cipriani pasta, follow the directions on the package.) When the pasta is cooked, reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain the pasta. Add the drained pasta to the saute pan and toss it with the truffle-cream mixture. As the pasta absorbs the sauce, add as much of the reserved cooking water, as necessary, to keep the pasta very creamy. Serve the pasta in shallow bowls and garnish each serving with a generous sprinkling of chives and shaved Parmesan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 10538,&quot;Spicy Chicken Pizza 3 cups (about 1 pound) skinned, boned and cubed chicken 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon peanut oil 3 1/2 tablespoons lime juice 2 teaspoons chopped jalapeno pepper Pinch chopped cilantro Salt Pizza dough, recipe follows 3 cups grated mozzarella 2 cups grated fontina 1 pound (about 6) plum tomatoes, ends removed and cut into thin slices 1/2 cup eggplant, cubed and sauteed or grilled 1/2 cup onion, sliced, grilled and chopped Chopped chives, for garnish 4 teaspoons Parmesan, grated 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 1 teaspoon honey 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees) 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus additional, for brushing Instructions: Arrange the cubed chicken in a medium bowl and toss with 1/2 cup olive oil, lime juice, jalapeno and cilantro. Season lightly with salt. Let marinate for about 1 hour, refrigerated. In a skillet large enough to hold all of the chicken in 1 layer, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Saute the chicken just to brown on all sides. Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F. Brush the rolled out pizza dough lightly with oil and top the pizza dough with the mozzarella, fontina, plum tomatoes, eggplant, onion, chives, Parmesan, and chicken. Place on the pizza stone and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until done. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball). Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. If you find this difficult to do, use a small rolling pin to roll out the dough.

Cut the tofu in half horizontally and lay between layers of paper towels. Place on a plate, top with another plate, and place a weight on top (a 14-ounce can of vegetables works well). Let stand 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, cut the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the carrots, cabbage, red pepper, scallions, ginger, cilantro, soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil, egg, salt, and pepper. Lightly stir to combine. To form the dumplings, remove 1 wonton wrapper from the package, covering the others with a damp cloth. Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water. Place 1/2 rounded teaspoon of the tofu mixture in the center of the wrapper. Shape as desired. Set on a sheet pan and cover with a damp cloth. Repeat procedure until all of the filling is gone. Using a steaming apparatus of your choice, bring 1/4 to 1/2-inch of water to a simmer over medium heat. Spray the steamer&#39;s surface lightly with the non-stick vegetable spray to prevent sticking. Place as many dumplings as will fit into a steamer, without touching each other. Cover and steam for 10 to 12 minutes over medium heat. Remove the dumplings from the steamer to a heatproof platter and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat until all dumplings are cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10540,&quot;Grilled Eggplant Teriyaki 2 medium eggplants Kosher salt Marinade, recipe follows Sesame seeds, for garnish 1/4 cup soy sauce 3 tablespoons light brown sugar 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons rice vinegar or white wine vinegar 1 teaspoon dark sesame oil 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 3 cloves garlic, minced Instructions: Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat.

Bring to a boil over moderately high heat, mashing the raspberries with a wooden spoon. Boil 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Strain the raspberry mixture through a fine strainer suspended over a bowl, pressing down on raspberries to release the juices. Discard the seeds. Stir the blueberries and the remaining 1 cup raspberries into the hot raspberry syrup. Cover and let stand until cool. Refrigerate until ready to use. Yield: 2 cups<br> For the cake, check that one rack is in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Pour the egg whites into the bowl in which you will be making the batter. If the pan has a removable bottom, do nothing to it. If it does not, lightly butter the bottom. Line the bottom with waxed paper or parchment paper cut to fit, and lightly butter the paper. Thoroughly mix the flour and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar or 1/2 cup of the confectioners&#39; sugar in a small bowl. Have all the ingredients and tools at hand. Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed for about 2 minutes, until frothy and well broken up. Add the cream of tartar and increase the speed to medium-high. Beat until the whites lose their yellow cast, greatly increase in volume, and start to turn white. With the mixer running, slowly sprinkle the remaining 3/4 cup sugar over the whites. Beat until the whites become very thick, very glossy, and white, and the beaters leave a deep trail. Depending on the mixer, this need take only about 3 minutes total. Beat in the lemon juice and vanilla, just enough to mix. Reduce the speed to the lowest possible. Quickly sprinkle the flour sugar-mixture over the whites. As soon as it is all added, but not completely mixed in, stop the machine and remove the bowl. With a rubber spatula or a large metal spoon, complete mixing in the flour by folding or gently stirring. Stop just as soon as the flour seems blended in. With a rubber spatula, scrape the batter (9 cups) into the pan and spread evenly. Inscribe a circle deep in the batter to release any large air bubbles. Bake until no moist patches remain in the surface cracks, the cake springs back when touched, and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes for a 10 by 3-inch pan, 1 hour for a tube pan. Turn the pan upside down on a wire rack. Let cool completely. Loosen the edges (and tube) with a knife. Turn out the cake, loosen and remove the pan bottom, or peel off the paper. Store airtight 1 day at room temperature before serving or freezing. When serving, top cake with sauce and confectioners&#39; sugar, if you wish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 10542,&quot;Tilapia Milanese 4 6-ounce tilapia fillets 1 1/2 cups milk 1 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 large eggs 6 slices white sandwich bread, torn into pieces 1/3 cup fresh parsley leaves Finely grated zest of 1/2 lemon, plus lemon wedges for serving 5 to 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 cups baby arugula Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Top glasses with seltzer when you are ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Amarone, Valpolicella]&quot; 10570,&quot;Bittersweet Chocolate Mint Tart 1/3 cup blanched hazelnuts 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour Pinch salt 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 4 large egg yolks 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened 1 1/2 cups milk 1 cup fresh mint leaves 10 ounces chopped 60 percent chocolate 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3 large eggs 3 large yolks 1/2 cup granulated sugar Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of an 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom; set aside. Place hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and cool. Place cooled nuts in food processor. Add 2 tablespoons of the flour and pulse until finely ground. Place the ground nuts, remaining flour, and salt into a large bowl and combine. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, brown sugar, and egg yolks. Using a wooden spoon combine the sugars and yolks until sugars dissolve. Add the softened butter and begin to add the flour and nut mixture. When it is well combined, form a ball and knead the dough. Flatten the dough into a disk and wrap it in waxed paper. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Lightly flour the top and bottom of the dough and roll out between 2 sheets of parchment paper. Turn the dough out into the tart shell and press gently to line the sides. Trim the excess from the edge. Freeze the tart shell for 10 minutes. Line the inside of the tart shell with aluminum foil. Place 3 cups of dried beans on top of the foil and place the tart shell on the baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the tart shell from the oven. Cool on a rack leaving beans inside. When cool, remove the foil and beans. Reduce temperature to 325 degrees F. Place milk in a saucepan. Boil and steep the mint and milk for 10 minutes stirring constantly. Drain and discard the fresh mint. Pour hot milk over chopped chocolate. Let stand for 20 seconds, and then whisk gently. Whisk in the vanilla extract. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, yolks, and sugar until blended. Slowly whisk in the chocolate mixture. Using a fine mesh sieve, strain the filling into the cooled pie shell. Bake for 20 minutes or until set. Remove the tart from the oven and cool on a rack. When cool, place in refrigerator until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 10571,&quot;Spatchcocked Birds 1 spatchcocked or butterflied chicken 2 tablespoons black peppercorns, lightly crushed in mortar and pestle Generous 1/3 cup olive oil (not extra-virgin) 2 cloves garlic, peeled and bruised Maldon or other sea salt Handful fresh parsley leaves, chopped 2 spatchcocked or butterflied poussins or Cornish game hens 2 limes, juiced 2 tablespoons coriander seeds Generous 1/3 cup peanut or vegetable oil Good grinding black pepper 1 bunch scallions, finely sliced Generous 1/3 cup vegetable oil Dash toasted sesame oil 3/4 -inch chunk fresh ginger, unpeeled and roughly chopped 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 1 tablespoon soy sauce Maldon or other sea salt Handful fresh parsley leaves, chopped 1 bunch fresh cilantro, leaves chopped Instructions: Set each bird in their respective marinade in a dish into which they fit snugly, cover with plastic wrap and leave in the refrigerator, preferably overnight or for 24 hours, though even a couple of hours would have an effect. When the grill is good and hot, lift the birds out of their marinade and cook until the flesh has lost all raw pinkness but is still tender within and the skin is crisp and burnished and blistered. It&#39;s hard to be precise about times, since grills differ even more than ovens do, but on my grill - a gas-fired Outdoor Chef, which I love to distraction and, since it has a lid, I use even in the winter rain - the chicken takes about 35 minutes, the Cornish hens 15 and the quail about 7. Along with sea salt, sprinkle freshly chopped parsley over the chicken and cilantro over the hens and quail, or use whatever herb seems right for the marinades you&#39;ve concocted. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 10572,&quot;Quick Tomato Salad 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 4 tablespoons olive oil 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped and lightly chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pint heirloom cherry tomatoes, halved lengthwise Instructions: In a large bowl, add the vinegar, oil, thyme, a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of black pepper. Whisk until the salt is dissolved. Taste and adjust salt, if needed. Add the tomatoes and toss until coated. Let sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 10573,&quot;Herb and Sesame Scallops with Orange and Fennel Salad 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh thyme, 6 sprigs 6 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds 1 tablespoon lemon zest 1 head fennel, thinly sliced, plus fronds 12 sea scallops, pat dry, check to make sure the foot has been removed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 navel orange, supremed 1/2 lemon, zested and juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine parsley, thyme, sesame seeds, lemon zest, and fennel fronds. Season scallops with salt and pepper. Roll the sides of the scallops in herb mix. Coat a cast iron skillet or a nonstick pan with olive oil, about 2 tablespoons. Place scallops in hot skillet and sear about 2 minutes per side until the scallops are opaque and firm. Orange and Fennel Salad: Place the orange supremes and fennel into a bowl. Zest and juice the lemon over the orange and fennel. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Toss gently and place onto serving plates. Place seared scallops on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 10574,&quot;Nacho Mama&#39;s S&#39;mores 1 (14-ounce) package graham crackers 6 milk chocolate bars (recommended: Hershey&#39;s) 1/2 (10.5-ounce) bag mini marshmallows Instructions: Break the graham crackers into pieces and place a layer in the bottom of a cast iron skillet. Break up the chocolate bars and put a layer on top of the crackers. Now add another layer of crackers and chocolate. Evenly distribute the marshmallows over it all. Place the skillet in a corner of the campfire, rotating the pan 1/4 turn every 3 minutes, until the chocolate is melted and the marshmallow are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Be sure to protect your hands from the fire at all times. Alternately, the S&#39;mores can be made in a pie pan in a preheated 250 degree F oven until the chocolate and marshmallows melt. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 10575,&quot;Vanilla Frosting 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, at room temperature 3 cups powdered sugar 1/4 cup whole milk, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: In a medium bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat the butter until light and smooth. Beat in the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla until smooth and creamy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 10576,&quot;Spanish Chorizo, Kale and Cranberry Bean Soup with Oven-Dried Tomato-Garlic Toast 8 ounces Spanish chorizo, cut into 1/4 -inch-thick slices 4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 1 large carrot, peeled and finely chopped 1 stalk celery, finely chopped 1 large Spanish onion, finely chopped 8 ounces kale, stemmed and leaves coarsely chopped 8 cups chicken stock 1 cup white wine 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 cups dried cranberry beans or pinto beans, soaked overnight Olive oil, for drizzling 3 plum tomatoes, sliced 1/8-inch thick horizontally 1/2 cup olive oil 4 cloves garlic 12 slices of French baguette, sliced into 1/3-inch thick slices on the bias Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh oregano Instructions: Heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook until lightly golden brown and the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to a paper-towel lined plate and pour out all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat. (The amount of fat will vary depending on the chorizo that is used. If your chorizo does not render at least 2 tablespoons of fat, then add olive oil.) Add the garlic, carrots, celery and onions to the fat and cook over medium heat until soft, 8 to 9 minutes. Add the kale and cook until slightly wilted, 2 minutes. Add the stock, wine and salt; cover and bring to a boil. Add the cranberry beans and cooked chorizo; lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the beans and kale are soft, about 1 hour. Ladle the soup into bowls and drizzle with olive oil. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Place sliced tomatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place tomatoes in the oven and bake in the oven for 6 to 8 hours or until the tomatoes are dried and have lost all of their moisture. Heat oil in a small saucepan over low heat. Add garlic, remove from heat and let sit for 20 minutes. Increase the heat in the oven to 350 degrees. Brush the bread on both sides with the garlic oil. Place a slice of tomato on each piece of bread, season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with some of the oregano. Bake in the oven for 5 to10 minutes, until the bread is lightly golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 10577,&quot;Italian Stuffed Zucchini 2 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise 3/4 cup ricotta cheese</p></div></div><p class="edit-link" data-v-76579f7e><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" class="vt-icon" data-v-76579f7e><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M11 5H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v11a2 2 0 002 2h11a2 2 0 002-2v-5m-1.414-9.414a2 2 0 112.828 2.828L11.828 15H9v-2.828l8.586-8.586z"></path></svg><a class="vt-link link" href="https://github.com/hyaliyun/wine/edit/main/src/guide/Meanwhile, slice the bread.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-76579f7e><!--[-->Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--><!----><!----></a></p></main><!--[--><!--]--><footer class="VPContentDocFooter" data-v-76579f7e data-v-777bdd92><!----><a class="next-link" href="/guide/introduction.html" data-v-777bdd92><span class="desc" data-v-777bdd92>Next <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="vt-link-icon" data-v-777bdd92><path d="M9,19c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4l5.3-5.3L8.3,6.7c-0.4-0.4-0.4-1,0-1.4s1-0.4,1.4,0l6,6c0.4,0.4,0.4,1,0,1.4l-6,6C9.5,18.9,9.3,19,9,19z"></path></svg></span><span class="title" data-v-777bdd92>Quick Start</span></a></footer></div></div></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
