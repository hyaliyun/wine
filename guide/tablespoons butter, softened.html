ounces cream cheese, softened 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons mini semisweet chocolate chips 2 tablespoons chopped walnuts Ganache frosting, recipe follows 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder, optional Instructions: Place rack in the middle of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 12 muffin cups with cupcake papers. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt, and set aside. Using a mixer, cream the butter and 3/4 cup sugar until pale yellow, about 1 minute. Add the egg and stir until just combined. Gently add half of the flour mixture and stir until just incorporated. Mix in the milk. Add the remaining flour mixture and stir until combined. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix together the cream cheese, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vanilla. Stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts. Fill prepared cupcake liners with enough chocolate batter to just cover the bottom. Add a dollop of the cream cheese filling to each, then top with remaining batter (cream cheese filling should not be visible). Bake for 20 minutes. Let cupcakes stand in the pan for 3 minutes and then remove and allow to cool completely on a rack. Dip each cupcake into the ganache, forming an even layer of frosting. Place in the refrigerator to set, about 15 minutes. Place a heat-proof bowl over a pot of simmering water, and whisk together the chocolate, cream, and espresso powder (if using). Continue whisking until chocolate is melted and the mixture is thick, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Yield: 1 cup Prep Time: 5 minutes Cook Time: 4 minutes Inactive Prep Time: 5 minutes &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 50590,&quot;Northwest Passage Pizza (Curry Brandade Pizza) 1 1/2 cups warm water, between 100 and 115 degrees F, as measured with a candy thermometer (any hotter will kill the yeast - an organic leavener, too cool and the yeast won&#39;t be activated) 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus some extra for the dough board 1/4 cup cornmeal, for pizza stones 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 1 clove garlic, minced 1 small onion, minced 2 pounds halibut fillets Salt and pepper 6 medium potatoes (about 2 1/2 to 3 pounds), peeled, boiled, drained well, and mashed with 6 ounces smoked Norwegian salmon, flaked 3/4 teaspoon curry powder 1 medium red onion, shaved thin with a mandoline 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives Instructions: Dissolve salt, sugar, and yeast in the warm water and allow the yeast to proof. (\Proofing\ the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop a foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn&#39;t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes. Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour in the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and divide into 6 equally sized balls. Cover with towel and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time.<br> While the dough is rising, prepare the pizza topping. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium- high heat in a large saute pan and saute garlic and onions until the onion begins to turn translucent. Season halibut fillets with salt and pepper and sear each side, leaving each side undisturbed for the first minute to allow the flavors to integrate into the surface of the fish. Cook further until the fish flakes, approximately another 6 to 8 minutes, and let rest. Flake the fish and fold into the mashed potatoes.<br> Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. On a floured surface, stretch the dough into six 6-inch by 8 inch ovals and shake cornmeal over both sides of the dough. (The crust will be par-\baked\ on both sides on the stovetop before you add the topping to be baked.) In a heavy bottomed 12 inch skillet which has a lid, heat a small amount of oil over medium heat. (Swirl the oil to coat the entire inside of the skillet.) Transfer teach dough oval to the skillet, allowing one side to lightly cook and stiffen up before flipping it over with tongs. When both sides of each oval are par-baked this way, transfer to a pizza stone. Spoon the potato/fish mixture in the center of the now toasted crust, spreading evenly over the surface. Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes until the tips of the mashed potatoes begin to turn golden.<br> Remove from oven and sprinkle with salmon, curry powder, red onions, and chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 50591,&quot;Roasted Garlic Bread 1 head garlic 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 12-inch baguette, split lengthwise 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the top third off the head of garlic, exposing the tops of the garlic cloves. Put on a piece of aluminum foil, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Wrap tightly and roast until the cloves are golden brown and very soft, about 45 minutes; cool slightly. Unwrap the garlic and pour any garlic-flavored oil from the foil into a small bowl; squeeze the roasted cloves into the same bowl, discarding the papery shells. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and mash with a fork until smooth; season with additional salt and pepper. Put the bread halves on a baking sheet and evenly spread with the roasted garlic mixture. Top with the Parmesan and a few grinds of pepper. Bake until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and cut into pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chianti]&quot; 50592,&quot;Easter Cookies 2/3 cup flour 1 roll (18 oz.) store-bought refrigerated cookie dough 1 ? cups prepared vanilla frosting Green food coloring 2/3 cup M&amp;M&#39;S? Brand Milk Chocolate Candies for Easter 2 cookie sheet pans Resealable plastic bag Small spatula or table knife Large, round platter Easter Egg or bunny-shaped cookie cutters Instructions: Preheat oven to 350°F. Line the cookie sheet pans with the parchment paper. Knead the flour into the cookie dough until smooth. Roll out the dough to a scant ¼-inch thickness. Cut out 18 cookies, re-rolling the scraps if necessary. Transfer the cookies to the prepared cookie sheet pans. Bake for 12-17 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely. Spoon the frosting into a resealable plastic bag; snip a corner. Using the photo as a guide, pipe outlines on the cookies, then fill in the outlines with a tight zigzag pattern. Spread the frosting with a small spatula or table knife on about half the cookies to make it smooth. Decorate with M&amp;M&#39;S® Brand Milk Chocolate Candies for Easter to make fun designs &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 50593,&quot;Tropical Bread Pudding with Grilled Bananas and Vanilla Rum Anglaise 2 small loaves or 1 large loaf pina colada pound cake or vanilla-flavored pound cake 2 sticks unsalted butter, softened, divided Ground cinnamon Ground nutmeg 1/2 pint vanilla ice cream, softened 4 bananas 1/2 orange, juiced 1 cup brown sugar 3 tablespoons good-quality rum 1 cup whipped cream Toasted flaked coconut, for serving Instructions: Cut cake into toast-size slices; spread 1 side with softened butter and sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg. Lightly brown the buttered sides in a large skillet while preparing other sides the same way. After cooking both sides, remove toasted cake from skillet and place on a plate with about 1/3 cup melted vanilla ice cream, allowing cake to soak up the melted ice cream from the bottom. Peel bananas and set aside. In skillet over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Add orange juice and stir in brown sugar. Stir constantly over medium-low heat until mixture completely liquefies. Add bananas to coat, cooking for about 2 minutes. Remove bananas to grill and continue to cook until tender. Remove sauce from heat, add 2 tablespoons rum, and baste bananas with sauce while grilling. When bananas are cooked to your liking, return them to the skillet with the sauce. Slice as desired; diagonally works best. Stir the remainder of the ice cream into a bowl of whipped cream and add 1 tablespoon rum. Place a piece of cake on a dessert plate, cover with sliced grilled bananas, top with brown sugar sauce, and ladle vanilla rum sauce around the cake. Sprinkle with toasted coconut and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 50594,&quot;Strawberry Shortcake 3 pints fresh strawberries 1/2 cup sugar, plus 2 tablespoons 1/3 cup shortening, plus more for greasing 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 egg, lightly beaten 2/3 cup milk 2 cups whipped heavy cream Instructions: Slice the strawberries and toss them with 1/2 cup of white sugar. Set aside. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan. In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, 2 tablespoons white sugar and the salt. With a pastry blender cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center and add the beaten egg and milk. Stir until just combined.

(on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.) Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days. For a Rocky Road Bar: Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.)

Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the half-and-half and 6 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once up to a boil, stir in the grits. Bring it back up to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture has slightly thickened (it should resemble cooked oatmeal in thickness), 10 to 15 minutes. Use a whisk to break up any lumps that have formed. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until just turning crispy, about 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and place it on a paper towel, patting it to remove any excess fat. Using the same saucepan, add the onions to the leftover bacon drippings and saute until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Then add the collard greens and the remaining 2 cups chicken stock and cook until tender, another 10 minutes. Drain the collards and onions in a colander. Once the grits are done, add the Parmesan, butter, salt, pepper and 1/2 cup of the Monterey jack. Stir until the butter has melted and all the ingredients are well combined. Then add the drained collards mixture and stir. Transfer the grits mixture to the prepared baking dish and top with the crumbled bacon and the remaining 1/2 cup Monterey jack. Bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 50602,&quot;White Chicken Stock 2 pounds chicken wings 1 plump 4 pound chicken, ideally free range organic 3 medium onions, peeled and cut into chunks 3 ribs celery, cut into chunks 3 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks 1 whole leek, split lengthwise, washed well and chopped 1 parsnip or small white turnip, chopped Contents of your stock bag (optional, explained below) 2 bay leaves 10 peppercorns Several sprigs of thyme Several sprigs of parsley 1/2 cup dry white wine Instructions: Place chicken wings in bottom of large stockpot. Tie together the legs of the chicken with a piece of kitchen twine. Place whole chicken in pot on top of wings. Scatter remaining ingredients around chicken and pour on the wine. Add cold water to cover chicken generously, by about 3 inches. Bring pot to a simmer over high heat, then skim any foam that may have accumulated on the surface with a ladle and reduce the heat to low. Cook at a bare simmer for 1 hour, skimming foam and fat frequently and regulating the heat so the stock does not boil. After 1 hour, remove the whole chicken and let it cool enough to be handled. Cut apart the chicken and remove the meat; reserve for another use. Throw out large pieces of skin and return the bones to the still simmering stockpot. Continue to barely simmer the stock 2 hours. Strain through a coarse sieve into a large metal bowl and cool 2 hours at room temperature, then refrigerate uncovered until chilled. Cover and store up to 2 days before either using or reducing and freezing. To reduce and freeze, remove any congealed fat from the cold stock then empty it into a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat then lower heat to medium and reduce stock at a lively simmer until half the original volume. Skim as necessary. When well reduced, allow to cool then pour through fine mesh strainer into small freezer containers, label and freeze. To use, add an equal quantity of water to the thawed chicken stock. Making excellent stock requires paying attention to a few simple rules. To ensure clear stock, use cold water, skim frequently, and never let the stock boil, which would incorporate fat and particles in the liquid. Keep the stock at just barely a simmer so that it smiles, bubbling gently and occasionally. In this manner your chicken meat will be tender and moistly poached as well. Use plenty of aromatic vegetables to give the stock a good flavor base, and use a large stewing hen which has more flavor than younger birds. Extra chicken wings enhance the stock. This recipe yields about 4-6 quarts of stock depending on how rich you like it, as well as a good amount of poached chicken meat. Use it for chicken salad or tacos, etc., or freeze it to use when you reconstitute the broth and turn it into an improvised soup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 50603,&quot;Fruit Chips 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 red apple, sliced 1/8 inch thick<br> 1 green apple, sliced 1/8 inch thick 1 mango, peeled, sliced 1/4 inch thick 1 pineapple, peeled, cored and sliced into 1/4-inch rings Six 4-ounce spreadable cheese cups, such as The Laughing Cow Cheese Cups Original Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.

Whisk the buttermilk, eggs, salt, vanilla and 1/3 cup granulated sugar together in a large bowl until completely combined. Whisk the flour, baking powder and baking soda together in another large bowl until completely combined. Fold the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture with a silicone spatula until just combined (it&#39;s OK if there are a few lumps). Reserve 2 tablespoons of batter in small bowl and set aside. Brush 2 tablespoons butter on a 18-by-13-inch sheet pan and pour in the batter, using a spatula to smooth out the top. Tap the tray on the counter a few times to even out and flatten the batter. Stir the warmed jam in a small bowl until pourable. Imagine the batter in the pan divided into four sections (2 across and 2 down). Dollop the jam, about 1 teaspoon at a time, over the surface of one section. (You want to see red dots of jam sitting on top of the batter.) Using a toothpick or small skewer, swirl the jam into the batter, making a marbled pattern. Top with sliced strawberries. Sprinkle chocolate chips over a second section of the batter. Arrange banana slices in a herringbone pattern over a third section of the batter and sprinkle the fruit with the remaining 1 to 2 teaspoons granulated sugar. Mix the brown sugar, cinnamon and reserved batter together in a small bowl, and dollop, about 1 teaspoon at a time, over the last section of the batter. (You want to see a lot of brown dots sitting on top of the batter.) Using another toothpick or small skewer, swirl the cinnamon mixture into the batter, making a marbled pattern. Put the sheet pan in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 400 degrees F. Bake, rotating the sheet pan halfway through baking, until golden brown and a cake tester inserted into the center of the pancake comes out clean, 18 to 23 minutes. Brush the pancake with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and let cool 15 minutes before cutting.

Add the vodka, horseradish, Worcestershire, hot sauce, and vegetable juice. Cover the glass with a shaker, shake well, then let rest in the shaker. Wet the rim of the glass and coat the entire rim with Creole seasoning. Pour the drink back into the glass and garnish with the pepper and the okra. Although at Commander&#39;s we use sugarcane for our skewers, out-side of our region you may not be able to buy it very readily, so skewer with toothpicks instead. Rinse the peppers with cold water and dry them with a paper towel. Remove the stems and chop them coarsely. Place the chopped peppers in a stainless bowl, sprinkle the salt on top, stir, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a cool, dry area for 2 days, stirring every 12 hours. All that salt is there mostly to promote ripening of the peppers. Add the vinegar, and puree with a hand blender or in a food processor. Place in a sterilized glass jar with a fresh, sterilized lid, and refrigerate. As time goes by, whenever you have an excess of ripe peppers, remove stems, chop and add to the jar. (The salting step isn&#39;t necessary for these additions.) When the jar is filled, remove the sauce, puree if you wish, place it in a clean jar, and age it until it reaches the desired flavor -- at least 2 months, or longer. Use as the hot sauce in many recipes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 50611,&quot;Lemon-Pepper Parmesan Asparagus 2 bunches medium asparagus (about 2 pounds), ends trimmed 10 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 large egg in its shell 1 small clove garlic Juice of 1 lemon 2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping 1 teaspoon dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

Allow the tomatoes to sit for 10 minutes so that the salt will leach out the juice of the tomatoes. Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to medium high-high heat. Drizzle 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball it, on a plate. Place chops on plate and turn in extra-virgin olive oil using tongs and season both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Once the grill pan or grill is screaming hot, add the chops and cook on the first side for 5 minutes. Resist the temptation to move the chops around, you want nice grill markings and a good crust on them. Before flipping the chops, reduce the heat to medium or move chops a little off to the side on an outdoor grill for more indirect heat. Flip and cook them on the second side for 7 to 8 minutes, remove the chops and let them rest covered with a tented piece of aluminum foil for about 5 minutes. Once the chops are cooked and rested, add the spinach and olives to the tomatoes and toss to coat. Serve the salad on or alongside the chops and spoon out some of the tomato balsamic juice from the bottom of the salad bowl to top each chop. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 50622,&quot;Welsh Rarebit 3 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup milk 1 pound sharp English Cheshire cheese, aged preferred, grated 1/2 tablespoon dry English mustard Freshly ground black pepper 2 eggs 1/2 cup stout or ale Toasted country bread Several apples or pears and walnut halves as accompaniment Instructions: In the top of a double boiler, heat the butter until it begins to brown.

Add the butter and process until the largest pieces of butter are pea-size. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir the vodka, vinegar and 1/4 cup ice water in a small bowl (or 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon ice water if you&#39;re not using vodka). Drizzle the wet ingredients over the dough, and then mix with a fork until shaggy pieces form. Knead the dough in the bowl with your hands a couple of times until it comes together (it will look quite dry, which is fine). Transfer the large clumps of dough to a work surface. Drizzle 1 tablespoon ice water over any remaining smaller bits of dough in the bowl and knead again to bring it together. If the remaining dough is still too dry to come together, add more ice water in 1 tablespoon increments. Add to the dough on the work surface and press together into a single mass, incorporating any dry bits. Then pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick block. Divide the block into 4 pieces with a bench scraper or knife. Stack the pieces on top of one another, tucking any unincorporated dry bits in between the layers. Flatten the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick block. Repeat this process (cutting, stacking and flattening) three more times; this creates layers of butter in the dough that produces a wonderful flaky, almost puff pastry-like crust.<br> Divide the dough in half and form into 1-inch-thick discs; wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 3 hours or preferably overnight. The dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep it refrigerated or freeze it for up to 3 months.<br> To fill and assemble: Peel, core and slice the apples into 1/2-inch wedges. Toss the apples, brown sugar, flour, butter, lemon juice, cinnamon, salt, allspice and nutmeg in a large bowl. Let the fruit sit for 30 minutes to extract the juices.<br> Meanwhile, soften one dough disc at room temperature for 5 minutes. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Lightly flour your work surface. Roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thick (about 16 inches in diameter). Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate. Soften the second disc at room temperature for 5 minutes. Then roll it out to the same thickness and diameter as the first disc.<br> Carefully transfer the second disc to a 9-inch pie dish. Lift the edges so the dough slumps down into the dish. Press the dough firmly against the sides and bottom of the dish. Trim the edges, leaving about a 1-inch overhang. Refrigerate for 5 minutes to firm up. Remove the first disc from the refrigerator and let it soften for 5 minutes.<br> Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Line another rimmed baking sheet with foil and place it on the center rack.<br> Scrape the apple filling into the pie dish, creating a mound in the center. Beat the egg with 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and brush the edges of the dough. Place the other disc over the filling. Trim the edges, leaving about a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the bottom edge up and over the top edge; press together to seal. Crimp the edge and brush the top with egg wash. Sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Cut several vents in the top evenly spaced. Freeze the pie for 10 minutes.<br> Put the pie dish on the preheated baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes, and then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F. Continue to bake for 45 minutes, and then loosely tent with foil. Continue baking until the crust is a deep golden brown and the juices are thick and vigorously bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes longer. The juices will start to bubble at around 75 minutes, but they will thicken and bubble faster in the last 15 minutes; don&#39;t be tempted to pull it out until the bubbles are really going. (If using a clear pie dish, check underneath to make sure the bottom crust is evenly browned.) Transfer the pie to a wire rack and let it cool at least 4 hours before serving. (Yes, it smells amazing, and yes, people love warm pie. But if you don&#39;t give it time to set up properly, the filling will be runny when you cut into it.)<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 50636,&quot;Almond Cookies 3/4 unsalted butter, softened 1 cup sugar 1 egg 1 tablespoon vanilla 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup coarsely chopped almonds 1/4 cup whole unpeeled almonds 1/4 cup cocoa powder 1/4 cup confectioners sugar Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar together until fluffy. Beat in the egg, vanilla, and almond extract. Sift the flour over the top, add the salt and the chopped almonds and fold to combine.

Place the sugar and 1/4 cup of water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Using a pastry brush, stir the sugar occasionally, being careful not to get any grains stuck against the sides of the saucepan, until it has all dissolved. Swirl the saucepan every minute until the sugar becomes a golden reddish-brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. Shock the bottom of the saucepan by placing the bottom in the ice water to stop the cooking, and then equally divide the caramel into 10 to 12 (3 1/2-inch) ramekins and set aside. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. Using an electric mixer, beat the softened cream cheese with the eggs on low speed to combine. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until completely incorporated. Add the condensed milk, evaporated milk, whole milk and vanilla extract and continue to beat together until everything is well incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, about 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle the custard over the caramel into the ramekins filling them up to 1/2-inch from the rim. Place a kitchen towel in a deep baking dish or roasting pan and place the ramekins in 2 rows on top of the towel. Place the baking dish in the oven and using a pitcher, pour enough hot water into the baking dish to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins, taking care not to get water in the ramekins. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the flan is just set, about 30 minutes. When you tap the edge of the ramekin the flan should still wobble in the center. Carefully remove the baking dish from the oven, remove the foil and let the ramekins cool slightly. Using tongs remove the ramekins from the water and set on a towel to cool for at least 2 hours before serving. Once cooled completely, the flan can be refrigerated for up to 3 days before un-molding and serving. To serve, run a thin knife around the inside edge of the ramekin to loosen the flan, and then invert onto a plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 50643,&quot;Spaghetti with Garlic and Olive Oil Kosher salt 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/2 pound good quality dried spaghetti 3 garlic cloves, sliced very thinly Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, more to taste (optional) Instructions: Bring a large pot of very well salted water to a boil. Heat the olive oil in a saut pan over medium heat. Start cooking the spaghetti. While it cooks, add the garlic to the pan with just enough heat so that it sizzles gently. Add the crushed red pepper flakes. When the outside edges of the garlic are just starting to brown, add 1 cup of the pasta water and a pinch of salt. Keep cooking, shaking the pan to create an emulsion, until the oil and water mixture no longer has that very harsh raw garlic flavor. When the pasta is al dente, drain it and add it to the pan, along with the chopped parsley, if using, tossing to coat. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 50644,&quot;Baked Apple Chips 1/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 3 cups apple peels (from about 10 large apples)<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Put the apple peels in a separate bowl and add a few drops of water (this will help the cinnamon sugar stick). Add the cinnamon sugar to the peels and toss to coat. Transfer the peels to the prepared baking sheets, making sure they are in a single layer. Bake until crisp, about 1 hour. Let cool before using a thin spatula to slide them off the parchment. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 50645,&quot;Chocolate-Covered Apple Slices 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips 2 tablespoons coconut oil<br> 1 Granny Smith apple<br> 1/4 cup chopped peanuts<br> 1/4 cup shredded coconut<br> Instructions: Melt the chocolate chips and coconut oil together over a double boiler. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or wax paper. Slice the apple into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Dip the apple slices one at a time into the chocolate, making sure to coat them evenly. The chocolate should go at least three-quarters of the way up each apple slice. Let the excess chocolate drip off. Press one side of each slice into the peanuts or coconut, and place the slices non-peanut/coconut-side down on the parchment. Place in the fridge or freezer until the chocolate hardens, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 50646,&quot;Grilled Filet Mignon with Chocolate Coffee BBQ Sauce 4 (6-ounce) filet mignon steaks 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 small or 1/2 large onion, small dice 4 large garlic cloves, minced 2 tablespoons chili powder 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika or regular sweet paprika 1 cup plain tomato sauce 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar 1 cup brewed coffee, dark roast 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup molasses 1 tablespoon yellow mustard Instructions: Preheat the grill to medium heat. Bring the steaks to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Rub the steaks with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside. In a medium-size saucepan, melt the butter and oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, being careful not to burn the garlic. Add chili powder, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cocoa and paprika and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce and brown sugar and cook, stirring until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in the coffee, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses and mustard. Simmer over medium-low heat until the liquid is reduced and the sauce has thickened, about 25 minutes. You may transfer to a blender and process until smooth or leave it natural. Will keep, tightly covered, in refrigerator for up to1 month. Grill the steaks over medium heat until desired doneness. Arrange on serving plates and serve with bbq sauce either on top or on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 50647,&quot;Roasted New Potatoes 2 pounds red potatoes 3 tablespoons olive oil Salt Pepper 1 tablespoon rosemary 2 cloves garlic, minced Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees F. Wash and scrub clams well to remove the exterior sand. Fill a steamer or pot with 1-inch of water, add 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and toss in the bay leaves. Heat until the water is simmering and then add the clams. Cover and steam for 5 to 10 minutes until the clams open - discard any that do not. Remove the clams from the shells, coarsely chop them up, and put in a bowl. Add the lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil, and season with salt and pepper; set aside. Coat a saute pan with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and place over medium heat. When the oil gets hazy, add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, and oregano. Cook and stir until the vegetables have cooked down and are really soft, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. Spread the ricotta evenly on the crust with a back of a spoon. Scatter the chopped clams all around and top with the sauteed red pepper mixture. Distribute the pieces of bacon on top. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp, and the cheese is bubbly. Before cutting the pizza into slices, drizzle with olive oil, grate pecorino on top, and shower with chopped parsley. In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water; stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the mixer on low and add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium; stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough by squeezing a small amount together: if it&#39;s crumbly, add more water; if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour - 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix until the dough gathers into a ball, this should take about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times; kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a round and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it over to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e. over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. This is a good time to stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees F. Once the dough is domed and spongy, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter. Roll and stretch the dough into a cylinder and divide into 3 equal pieces. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes so it will be easier to roll out. Roll or pat out a piece of dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Dust a pizza paddle with flour and slide it under the pizza dough. Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and top with your favorite flavors. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp. Repeat with the remaining dough.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until it is al dente, about 6 minutes. Strain, reserving 1 3/4 cups of the pasta water. Set aside. Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring constantly, until the mushrooms are lightly browned in spots and softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Lower the heat to medium and add the kale, garlic and 1/2 cup of water, scraping up any browned bits at the bottom of the pan with the back of a wooden spoon. Add 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and stir to combine. Cook until the kale is wilted but still crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Remove the vegetables to a bowl and set aside. Carefully wipe out the saucepan (or give it a quick rinse if it is really dirty). Add the half-and-half and cayenne and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 15 minutes. Add the cream cheese and stir until melted. Whisk in the Cheddar and Gruyere until all the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Add the macaroni and reserved pasta water to the saucepan and stir to combine. (The mixture will look very loose, but the pasta will suck up a lot of the sauce as it bakes.) Gently fold in the reserved vegetables. Season to taste with additional salt if needed. Pour into a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. Toss the bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and a large pinch of salt and pepper in a medium bowl and sprinkle evenly over the macaroni and cheese.

In large mixer bowl, cream together the granulated sugar, butter and peanut butter until light and fluffy with heavy duty mixer. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix thoroughly after each addition. Add the vanilla and mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Add half of the flour to the mixer bowl along with 1/2 cup of the half-and-half. Mix until the flour is mixed in, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the rest of the flour and the other 1/2 cup half-and-half. Mix until the batter is smooth and all of the flour lumps are gone. Fill 24 cupcake liners half full and bake for 20 minutes in the convection oven or 28 minutes in the standard oven. The tops of the cupcakes should be lightly browned. Check the cupcakes to make sure no batter sticks to a wooden toothpick when inserted into the cupcake. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the salted caramel filling: In heavy medium saucepan, cook the granulated sugar by itself over medium-high heat. As the sugar starts to melt, stir continuously until all the sugar is melted and is a dark amber color. Remove from the heat. Stir in the butter until it is completely melted; the mixture will bubble up. Then add the cream and stir until smooth. Sprinkle in the sea salt and stir slightly. Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until ready to use. For the peanut butter buttercream: In large mixer bowl, beat together the butter, peanut butter and half of the powdered sugar using heavy duty mixer. Add the half-and-half and the rest of the powdered sugar, along with the vanilla, and mix well. If the frosting is thicker than you would like, add 1 teaspoon of additional half-and-half at a time, mixing well after each addition until the frosting reaches the correct consistency. The thickness may depend on the humidity levels in your region. To assemble: When cupcakes are cooled to room temperature, make a 3/4-inch hole in the middle of each cupcake using a sharp knife. Leave a small amount of cake in the bottom of each cupcake so that your filling doesn&#39;t fall out the bottom of the cupcake. Using a small zipper bag, fill each cupcake to the top with salted caramel filling. Then frost with peanut butter buttercream. You may top cupcakes with chopped peanuts and a salted caramel drizzle as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 50714,&quot;Zesty Pork Chops 4 bone-in pork chops (about 1 1/4 pounds) All-purpose flour 1 cup Pace?

Knead dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour, as necessary, to prevent dough from sticking, until smooth about 5 to 10 minutes. Form the dough into a ball. Lightly oil the sides and bottom of a large bowl with oil, add the dough, turn to coat in the oil, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Gently punch the dough down and divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into a 10-inch circle that is 1/8-inch thick. Brush off excess flour and transfer the dough to a baking sheet, cover each circle of dough with plastic wrap and continue stacking rolled out pieces on top of each other. Wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to grill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 50726,&quot;Whipped Cream 1 pint heavy cream 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Put the cream, sugar and vanilla in a well chilled bowl or in a bowl over ice. Beat with an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 50727,&quot;Mashed Potatoes 2 pounds Idaho potatoes, peeled and quartered 2 teaspoons kosher salt 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup milk 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper Instructions: Place the potatoes in a 2-quart saucepan with 1 teaspoon of the salt and cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer, covered, until completely tender, about 30 minutes. Test the potatoes by piercing them with a paring knife -- there should be no resistance. Place in a colander and allow to drain well for several minutes. Combine the butter, heavy cream and milk in another saucepan and heat gently until the butter has melted. Keep warm. Working with the saucepan used to cook the potatoes, pass the potatoes through a food mill or a potato ricer. If you have any difficulty, add a little of the hot milk and butter to the potatoes. To serve, place the potatoes over a low fame and begin adding the warm milk mixture. Whip the potatoes with a wooden spoon or spatula while heating. When all the liquid is absorbed, season with the remaining salt and white pepper. Serve piping hot. Mashed potatoes are best served immediately, but if you are unable to do so, or need them for another recipe, keep the potatoes hot for up to 1 hour by placing them in the top of a double boiler, covered, and held over barely simmering water. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 50728,&quot;Eggplant Salad: Shlada De-al Bedenjan 4 eggplant 1 teaspoon salt, plus more as needed 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 large tomatoes, peeled and grated 1/2 onion, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon paprika 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 4 flat-leaf parsley sprigs, finely chopped 4 cilantro sprigs, finely chopped 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 2 lemons, quartered Instructions: Cut the eggplant into 2-inch cubes.

Meanwhile, drop the pasta into the boiling water and cook for a couple minutes under the recommended time. Add the tomato paste and cauliflower to the onions, then stir to combine. Continue to cook, stirring, until the cauliflower begins to caramelize and the tomato paste has cooked down, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water. Add the pasta, pasta water, pecorino and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pot with the sauce. Stir and toss until totally combined. Add the cream and season to taste. Serve topped with fresh basil and a little more pecorino. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 50730,&quot;Sweet Potato Toast with Almond Butter, Banana and Toasted Coconut Chips 2 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 pound total) 1 tablespoon coconut oil, melted Fine salt 4 tablespoons almond butter<br> 1 large banana, peeled and thinly sliced 1/4 cup toasted coconut chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Slice off the 4 long sides of each of the sweet potatoes so the potatoes are squared off and sit flat on a cutting board. Slice the potatoes lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick planks, about 5-inches-by-2-inches (you should get 3 planks per sweet potato). Combine the sweet potatoes, coconut oil and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl and toss gently to coat. Spread them out on a baking sheet and roast, flipping halfway through, until lightly browned and tender when pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes. Remove the sweet potato toasts to 2 plates.<br> Divide the almond butter among the toasts, then top each with sliced banana and sprinkle with toasted coconut. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 50731,&quot;Lizzie&#39;s Old Fashioned Cocoa Cake with Caramel Icing 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more to grease pans 2/3 cup cocoa 1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/3 sticks (2/3 cup) butter, plus more to grease pans 1 2/3 cups sugar 3 large eggs 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Cooking spray 4 cups sugar 1 cup milk 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon baking soda Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and lightly flour two 9-inch cake pans For the cake: Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt and set aside. With an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Add the flour mixture in stages with 1 1/3 cups water, beginning and ending with the flour. Divide the batter evenly between the pans and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Turn the layers out onto racks that have been sprayed with cooking spray. For the caramel icing: Mix 3 cups of the sugar and the milk in a heavy 3-quart saucepan. Bring slowly to a boil and keep it hot. Caramelize the remaining cup of sugar in an iron skillet. Do this by cooking over medium-high heat and stirring and scraping the pan with a flat-edged spatula as the sugar melts. Continue to cook until the syrup turns to medium or dark brown in color. This occurs at about 320 degrees F to 350 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Do not scorch the syrup. Stream the syrup into the boiling sugar and milk mixture and cook to the soft ball stage, about 238 degrees F. Add the butter, vanilla extract and baking soda. Pour the hot mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer and beat as it cools until the icing is creamy, 15 to 20 minutes. Watch the icing because it will go from runny to too thick very quickly. Spread on the cake layers while the icing is still warm. If it becomes too stiff, add a few drops of hot water. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 50732,&quot;Watermelon, Mint and Jalapeno Salsa 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice<br> 4 cups finely chopped seeded watermelon<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh mint<br> 2 jalapenos, stemmed, seeded and finely chopped<br> Kosher salt Tortilla chips, for serving Instructions: Combine the olive oil and lime juice in a bowl.

Gently stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved. Place the chicken pieces in a large ziptop bag inside of a bowl. Pour the brine over the chicken, close the ziptop bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Place the brined chicken on the lined baking sheet. Pat the chicken with additional paper towels until the skin is completely dry. Place a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat and add the oil. Season both sides of the chicken pieces with the Italian seasoning and some salt and pepper. Sear the chicken, flipping only once, until golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. If the skillet is not large enough to accommodate all the chicken with space in between the pieces, sear the chicken in 2 batches. Set the chicken aside. Place the potato wedges cut-side down in the hot skillet. Sear until light golden, about 6 minutes, then flip and sear the other cut side for 6 minutes more. Turn off the heat and add the chicken back to the skillet, nestling the pieces among the potato wedges. Add 3 of the garlic cloves to the skillet and transfer to the oven. Roast until the chicken and potatoes are cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer the chicken and potatoes to a serving platter and cover with aluminum foil; discard the garlic cloves. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and add the wine to deglaze. Reduce the wine, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet, about 2 minutes. Grate the remaining 3 cloves garlic into the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium low and add the lemon zest and juice. Tablespoon by tablespoon, melt in the butter until the sauce is slightly thickened and smooth. Stir in the peas and warm in the butter sauce for 30 seconds more. Pour the hot sauce over the chicken and potatoes.

Spray three 6-inch cake pans with nonstick spray, dust each with flour and line with parchment paper (if you don\u2019t have 3 pans, you can bake in batches). Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Combine the sugar, oil, vanilla and eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until combined. Alternate adding the dry mixture and buttermilk, mixing on low speed, until smooth. Divide the batter between the 3 prepared baking pans. Bake until the cakes spring back slightly when touched, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. For the frosting: Meanwhile, combine the butter, cocoa powder, vanilla and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until combined, then start adding the confectioners\u2019 sugar 1 cup at a time, alternating with additions of the milk. Increase the speed to medium high and mix until smooth. Use a serrated knife to trim off the top from two of the cake layers (if the layers domed differently, trim the smaller domes), using the edge of the cake pan as a guide. Place 1 trimmed cake on a cake board or platter and spread 1/4 cup of the chocolate frosting over the top. Place the second trimmed cake on top, spread the top with frosting, then top with the third cake so that the top is domed. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. For the decorations: Meanwhile, line a baking sheet and plate with parchment paper. Combine the semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 teaspoon of the coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave, stirring every 10 seconds, until melted and smooth, about 40 seconds. Transfer to a piping bag and snip the tip. Onto the prepared baking sheet, use the semisweet chocolate to pipe 2 antlers (each 4 inches tall and 3/4 inch wide at the base), making sure the antlers are sturdy and thick enough to stand up on top of the cake later. Refrigerate until set, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, onto the prepared plate, use the semisweet chocolate to pipe 2 arches for the pupils of the eyes (each 2/3 inch tall and 2/3 inch wide at the base), spacing them at least 2 inches apart; fill in the arches with the chocolate. Refrigerate until set, about 10 minutes. Combine the white chocolate chips and remaining 1/4 teaspoon coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave, stirring every 10 seconds, until melted and smooth, 20 to 30 seconds. Transfer to a piping bag and snip the tip. Remove the plate with the pupils from the refrigerator. Use the white chocolate to pipe 2 bigger arches for the whites of the eyes (each 1 inch tall and 1 inch wide at the base), aligning the bases for each set of pupil and white; fill in the space around each pupil with white chocolate. Refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes. Pull off a tennis ball-size mound of fondant, knead in enough brown food coloring until dark brown, then roll into a ball. Repeat the process with 3 golf ball-size mounds of fondant and tint one light brown (1 drop of brown food coloring), one black (3 drops of black food coloring) and one red (3 drops of red food coloring). Keep each piece of fondant wrapped in plastic wrap while not in use. Roll out a quarter of the dark brown fondant on a cornstarch-dusted cutting board until very thin. Use a sharp paring knife to cut out two 2 1/2- inch-tall oval ears with a pointed tip. Roll out half of the light brown fondant and cut into slightly smaller pointed ovals. Dab the light brown fondant with a small amount of water to adhere each piece to a dark brown ear, creating a lighter interior. Set aside to dry. Use the remaining dark fondant to form the legs: Divide the dough into thirds. Use two-thirds of the dough to shape the hind legs by rolling two logs, each 2 1/2 inches long and 3/4 inch in diameter; taper one end of each. Shape the front legs the same way with the remaining dough, each 1 1/2 inches long. Roll 4 tiny balls of black fondant, then flatten them slightly between two fingers. Dab with a little water to adhere the black discs to the wide end of each brown leg, to form hooves. Form the nose by rolling the red fondant into a ball. Set aside the eyes and nose. Cover the chilled cake with frosting, reserving 1/3 cup for decorations. Place the hind legs on either side of the cake, so that the hooves face forward, shaping the legs around the cake. Place the two front legs in front, near the hooves of the back legs, upright but at a slight angle towards the back. Remove the antlers from the refrigerator. Place them on top of the cake, towards the center. Set the ears just to the back and sides of the antlers, using toothpicks behind the ears to prop them up, if needed. Transfer the reserved frosting to a piping bag fitted with a fluted tip. Pipe a few swirls in front of the antlers. Top the swirls with holiday sprinkles. Press a red flashing battery-operated LED balloon light into the red fondant ball, pushing it towards the front of the nose; reform the ball around the light, leaving the power tab exposed to turn the light on. Insert a toothpick halfway in the front middle of the cake. Press the nose on it until flush against the cake but held up by the toothpick. Remove the eyes from the refrigerator and carefully peel them off the parchment to reveal pupils set in the whites of the eyes. Pipe a small dollop of frosting on the back of each eye then arrange the eyes over the nose. Remove the light from the cake before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 50746,&quot;Soft Pretzels with Chocolate-Hazelnut Dip 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for salting the pretzels, optional One .25-ounce packet dry active yeast<br> 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> Vegetable oil, for oiling the bowl and baking sheets 1/4 cup baking soda<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 1 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread, such as Nutella<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the sugar and salt with 1 cup warm water. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons of the melted butter; stir to combine. Add the flour to the bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until a dough starts to come together. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a clean, lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm, draft-free place until the dough has almost doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Lightly oil two baking sheets. Cut the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece out into a 20-inch long rope and twist into a pretzel shape. Fill a large, wide pot with about 3 inches of water. Add the baking soda and bring to a brisk simmer over medium-high heat. Boil the pretzels, two at a time, until puffed and shiny, about 2 minutes; transfer to the oiled baking sheets as you go. Brush the boiled pretzels with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and then sprinkle salt as desired. Bake until deeply browned, 12 to 15 minutes, switching the positions of the baking sheets halfway through. While the pretzels are baking, warm the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat.

Place the chuck in a large bowl. Season liberally with pepper (about 20 turns of the pepper grinder) and grey salt to taste\u2013 remember half of this will come off in the pan. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of the cumin, and 2 tablespoons of the chili powder. Mix this well and coat the meat with the masa harina (this is a ground hominy flour common to Mexican cuisine and easily found in the Mexican food sections of many grocery stores). The flour will thicken the sauce and give it a specific, Mexican taste. Preheat a cast iron Dutch oven on the stove over medium high heat. Add the olive oil and then the coated meat, spreading it evenly so it covers the bottom of the Dutch oven in 1 layer. Leave it alone, without turning it, so the meat will brown and caramelize. Meanwhile, add the lard. The meat has a lot of moisture in it, so a good amount of steam will come from the pan before it is caramelized. As it browns, slowly turn each piece with tongs. Once all sides are caramelized, remove the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a cookie sheet to cool, leaving juices in the Dutch oven to saute vegetables. Add the onions and garlic and saute for 5 minutes over medium heat until they start to caramelize and get soft. Add the jalapenos and allow to cook for 2 more minutes until soft. Add the tomato paste. Some of the same spices as were used on the meat will be used in the sauce. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of the cumin, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, the oregano, and 2 heaping tablespoons of the chili powder. Add beer. Stir to incorporate everything. Add diced tomatoes, and stir. Then add the reserved meat. Add chicken stock. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours until meat is wonderfully tender. Strain juice from the black beans, add the beans to the chili pot and bring up to simmer. Then add chunks of bittersweet chocolate. Stir until it melts. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 50754,&quot;Pulled Chicken Ragu and Rigatoni 6 chicken thighs 2 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts 2 carrots, coarsely chopped 2 ribs celery, coarsely chopped 2 onions, 1 quartered at the root end and 1 chopped 2 bay leaves Kosher salt Small handful dried porcini mushrooms 1/4 cup EVOO 1/4 pound pancetta or guanciale, cut into thin batons or chopped 4 cloves garlic, sliced 3 tablespoons fresh rosemary, finely chopped Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 1/2 cups dry white wine 1 pound rigatoni Grated pecorino cheese Flat-leaf parsley, chopped, for garnish Instructions: Place the chicken thighs and breasts in a medium pot with the carrots, celery, quartered onion and bay leaves. Sprinkle with salt and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer to cook through and flavor the stock, 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a shallow dish until cool enough to handle. Strain the stock and reserve the meat. Place the dried mushrooms in a small pot and cover with 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the stock. Bring to a simmer until the mushrooms are reconstituted, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the meat from the chicken bones, discarding the skin and bones, and pull into small pieces. You will need only the dark meat. (Reserve the white meat for another use, such as Creamy Chicken and Noodles.) Heat the EVOO over medium-high heat in the pot used to cook the chicken. Cook the pancetta to render, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the chopped onion, garlic and rosemary, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until the onions are tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, pour in the wine and cook until reduced by half. Return the pulled chicken into the pot with 2 cups of the reserved stock. (Reserve the remaining chicken stock for another recipe, such as Creamy Chicken and Noodles.) Chop the reconstituted mushrooms and add them into the sauce along with their liquid. Simmer to thicken the sauce, 20 to 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook the pasta to al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the starchy cooking liquid just before draining. Toss the pasta with the sauce and starchy water. Mix in some pecorino, and serve with more to pass at the table. Garnish with grassy flat-leaf parsley.

Cut off the very tops of the peppers. Remove and discard the ribs and seeds and set the peppers aside.<br> Drain the tomatoes in a colander set over a medium bowl. Reserve the juice and set the tomatoes aside over a plate to catch any residual juices. Stir the couscous, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper into the tomato juice and set aside while preparing the filling.<br> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, zucchini, half the garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are softened and just beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.

Stir in the spinach and cook, adjusting the heat if necessary, until the leaves are bright green and just beginning to wilt, about 30 seconds. Set the filling aside to cool slightly. To make the sauce, combine the remaining garlic and olive oil in a Dutch oven, add the cl flakes if using and stir to combine. Place the pot over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally at first then more frequently as the oil starts to sizzle to prevent the garlic from burning, until the garlic starts to stick to the edge of the spoon and is just beginning to turn a very pale straw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the reserved drained tomatoes plus any accumulated juices, 1 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture just begins to come together and thicken, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.<br> Fold the feta and basil into the couscous filling.

Heat the canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat, add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Reserve the bacon pan drippings. Add the bacon to the herb oil, season with salt and pepper, and set aside. For the hash: Heat the bacon drippings in the cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook about 30 seconds. Meanwhile, toss the sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts and turkey in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the potato mixture, stir once to incorporate the onion and garlic, and then press firmly with a spatula against the bottom of the pan. Cook, pressing occasionally, until the bottom is browned and crispy, about 4 minutes, reducing the heat if the mixture starts to get too dark. (If the mixture seems dry, add some butter around the edges.) Once the bottom is browned and crispy, flip the hash in chunks and press again to brown some of the top side. For the poached eggs: While the hash is cooking, bring about 4 inches of water to a simmer in a deep skillet. Add the vinegar. Break each egg into a separate ramekin. Slip the eggs into the water and cook until the whites are set and the yolks still runny, about 4 minutes. Right before the eggs are done, divide the hash among 4 or 6 plates. Remove each egg with a slotted spoon, blot it dry on a clean side towel, and put it on top of the hash. Drizzle each serving with some bacon-herb oil and serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 50789,&quot;Cheddar and Bacon Pinwheels 8 slices bacon 6 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 6 scallions, green part only, thinly sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 sheets frozen puff pastry (from a 17.3-ounce package), thawed All-purpose flour, for dusting 4 ounces Cheddar, grated 1 large egg Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

When water is at a full boil, salt generously and then add bay leaves, crab boil seasoning, fennel seeds, peppercorns, red pepper flakes, coriander seeds, and lemons. Return to a boil, add artichokes, and cover. Boil for 10 minutes and then add potatoes and onions; reduce heat to a simmer and return the cover to the pot. Simmer for 5 minutes and then add garlic and wine. Simmer, covered, until artichokes, onions, and potatoes are tender; as they vegetables become tender, remove them to a serving platter (the potatoes should take about 20 to 30 minutes, and then artichokes and onions, about 30 to 40 minutes).<br> After you have removed all the vegetables, add the lobsters. Cook just until they begin to turn pink, about 3 minutes. Then add the clams; after 30 seconds, add shrimp. Cook until the shrimp turn pink and begin to curl and the clams open fully, about 5 minutes.<br> Cut the onions in half. Cut the artichokes in half and scoop out and discard the chokes.<br> Serve the shrimp, potatoes, onions, and artichokes with shallow bowls of melted butter, sea salt, and the Fennel Spice Rub for dipping, and with jars of hot sauce.

Use it to make spice-encrusted pork ribs, chops, or tenderloin; veal chops; chicken breasts; duck; beef; liver; or eggplant; or add a teaspoon to lentil soup. Put the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a heavy pan over medium heat. Watch carefully, tossing frequently so the seeds toast evenly. When light brown and fragrant, pour the seeds onto a plate to cool. They must be cool before grinding, or they will gum up the blades.<br> Pour the seeds into a blender and add the salt.

Butter a 2-quart souffle dish with the butter and set aside. Bring 3 quarts of water and the honey to a boil over high heat in a large pot. Add the corn, and cook for 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Use tongs to carefully remove the corn from the water and transfer to a medium bowl. Let rest until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, milk, pepper, salt, nutmeg and cayenne. One at a time, hold the corn in 1 hand and stand it on end so that it is perpendicular to the cutting board. Hold a large chef&#39;s knife in the other hand and with a downward motion, cut the kernels from the cob. Turn the cob with every cut so that you get all of the kernels. Scrape the corn cobs with the back side of your chef&#39;s knife-this will release more of the milk from the cob. Add any accumulated juices to the cut kernels. Discard the cobs. Add the corn kernels and onions to the egg mixture, stirring well to combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish.

For the dough: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Grease 2 baking sheets with olive oil. Prepare the pizza dough according to the recipe. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. On a floured work surface, using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a circle. Place the circles onto the prepared baking sheets. For the toppings: Place 1/4 of the ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella and tomatoes on the bottom half of each of the rounds. Season the filling with salt and pepper, tear some basil leaves over the cheese and tomatoes and drizzle with a spoonful of the balsamic glaze. Fold the dough rounds in half to resemble a half-moon shape, covering the filling with the dough. Starting at one end of the half-moon, begin to fold the dough over on itself pressing down as you go. Continue to fold the dough until you reach the end and then tuck the final end under and pinch it shut. Brush the calzones with some more olive oil and, with the tip of a knife, make 2 slits in each calzone so the steam can escape. Bake the calzones until the crust is golden and crisp, about 15 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: Cutting slits in the top of the calzone will prevent the calzone from leaking and let the steam escape. You can fill this calzone with whatever you like. In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom, about 5 minutes. Once bloomed, add the olive oil. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together, switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead, adding a bit more flour if needed, so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl, 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl, remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and, with floured hands, continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you&#39;d like! Cook&#39;s Notes: This dough is wet dough, keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough. Trust your gut as a chef, if the dough is to wet, add more flour, if it is too stiff, add a little water. Sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don&#39;t need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature, it should just feel warm to the touch. Heat a medium saucepan to medium-high. Add in the olive oil. Saute the onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add in the tomatoes, garlic, sugar, red pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes on medium low.

Defrost spinach 6 minutes on high and wring the spinach dry in a kitchen towel. Crust bread in oven for 5 or 6 minutes. Remove and split bread in half from end to end as if it were a large sandwich roll. Turn broiler on. If your broiler is too small to place ciabatta breads under it, you can melt the cheese in oven as well, see below, it simply browns faster under broiler. Drizzle hot bread with extra-virgin olive oil. Mix ricotta, garlic, parsley and grated cheese. Spread the mixture evenly over the bread halves then dot with the defrosted chopped spinach. Evenly distribute the sliced artichokes, season the breads with salt and pepper and top with an even layer mozzarella cheese. Melt and brown the cheese under the broiler 3 minutes, 1 rack down from the top of the oven. If you are using the oven rather than broiler, the cheese will take 6 or 7 minutes to brown. Cut into bread into wedges and serve. If desired, serve with Dipping Sauce. Heat a small pot over medium heat. Add extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, pepper flakes and anchovy paste. Cook 2 minutes. Add parsley, tomatoes, salt and pepper. Stir sauce, bring to a bubble and simmer 5 minutes over low heat then place in small bowl and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 50810,&quot;Cilantro Lime Grilled Chicken Sandwich 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts 3/4 cup Food Network Kitchen?

Add the shortening and pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits, about 10 times. While the motor is running, drizzle in the water until a dough forms. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Divide the dough in half; press half the dough up and around the inside of the pan. Set the remaining dough aside covered with plastic wrap. Line the pan with foil and fill with dried beans. Bake the dough for 20 minutes and remove the beans and foil. Continue baking the crust until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Let the pan cool on a rack. Meanwhile, make the spinach filling: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the spinach, little by little (adding more as the previous batch wilts), and cook, stirring, until completely wilted. Season with the salt and pepper and stir in the parsley, dill, and scallions. Drain the spinach mixture in a colander in the sink and let cool. Once the spinach is cool, stir in the feta and spread the mixture into the crust. Roll the remaining dough out on a well-floured surface, into a rectangle large enough to cover the baking pan. Top the spinach with the dough and pinch around the sides to seal. Score the top of the pie in the center, brush the surface of the dough with egg wash, and bake until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven, let cool, cut into squares and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 50832,&quot;Coconut Curry Greens with Lentils 2 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee 1/2 Spanish onion, peeled and diced 1/2-inch<br> 1 carrot, diced 1/2-inch<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon minced ginger<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 tablespoons red Thai curry paste<br> One 13.5-ounce can coconut milk<br> 3 cups chicken or vegetable stock<br> 1 cup orange dal lentils (split red lentils)<br> 3 cups roughly chopped Swiss chard<br> 3 cups baby spinach<br> 2 tablespoons fish sauce<br> Cooked long grain rice, such as basmati, for serving<br> 1/4 cup almonds, toasted<br> 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves<br> 1/4 cup pomegranate seeds<br> Lime wedges, for serving<br> Instructions: In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat the butter or ghee over medium heat.

Boil the cabbage head in salted water until the leaves can be removed easily, about 4 minutes. Separate 12 of the largest leaves. Remove the thick stem in the center of each, not cutting through the entire leaf. Render the bacon in a medium saute pan over medium heat until crispy, about 6 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon to a large mixing bowl, leaving residual fat in pan. Add garlic, onion and paprika to pan and cook until garlic and onion have softened, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then transfer to bowl with bacon and let cool to room temperature. Fold in the beef, ham, pork, rice and eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Place 1/3 cup of the mixture at the tip of a cabbage leaf. Roll up, tucking in the sides to seal the filling within the cabbage leaf. Repeat with the remaining filling mixture and cabbage leaves. Combine canned tomatoes with their juice, sauerkraut, caraway seeds and tomato paste in a small bowl. Transfer half of the tomato mixture to a medium Dutch oven and spread it across the bottom. Place the stuffed cabbage on top, followed by the remaining tomato mixture. Bring to a simmer, then partially cover and transfer to the oven. Bake 1 hour. Meanwhile, whisk together the sour cream, milk, Dijon and dill. Drizzle the sour cream sauce over the cabbage.

Sprinkle the patties generously with the Brown Sugar Rub and grill to desired temperature (we recommend medium or pink in the center). Top with smoked Cheddar and melt it with your grill closed. Cut the hot links in half and split down the center. Grill on both sides until crispy. To assemble the sandwich, spread the bottom bun with the South Carolina Mayo and top with pickled chiles and Maple Bacon. Next, add the pork patty and then top with the split hot link. We serve our hand-cut fries on the side, but the sandwich is great with potato salad, chips or anything else.<br> Mix the brown sugar, chili powder, salt, granulated garlic, granulated onion, black pepper and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Cover tightly and leave out at room temperature.<br> Whisk together the mustard, vinegar, brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Let sit overnight to develop flavor (we also use this sauce as a mustard based BBQ sauce without the mayo). Whisk together the sauce and mayonnaise and set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use. Use any extra for sandwiches, dipping fried things in... really anything.<br> Combine the kosher salt, brown sugar and pink salt if smoking the bacon, and mix thoroughly. Then whisk in the maple syrup. Rub the cure over the entire pork belly and place in a zip-top bag (remove the air from the bag before sealing). Place in the refrigerator for 7 days, flipping the belly every day to balance out the cure. On the eighth day, remove the belly from the cure and rinse thoroughly. Then place in the refrigerator uncovered, preferably on a rack for better air flow. Leave overnight to dry and form a pellicle (the skin made from proteins that form on the surface to allow the smoke to penetrate the meat better). If you have a smoker, smoke the belly for 3 hours at 200 degrees F to an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. Remove from the smoker, cool and slice about 1/4-inch thick. If you do not have a smoker, put the belly on an oven rack for 3 hours at 200 degrees F and cook to an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. Then cool and slice about 1/4-inch thick. Place the bacon slices on a baking sheet and bake at 375 degrees F until brown and crispy.

Arrange half of the bread toasted-side up on top of the sauce in a single layer. Spoon 1/2 cup sauce over the top and sprinkle with half of the cheese mixture. Repeat to make a second layer with the remaining bread, sauce and cheese.<br> Make 6 deep wells in the sauce and bread (it&#39;s ok if the bread rips a little) using the back of a tablespoon. Carefully crack 1 egg into each well. Sprinkle with the crushed red pepper flakes. Bake on the middle rack until the whites are set, the yolks are still runny and the cheese is melted and turning brown in some spots, 15 to 18 minutes.

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula periodically, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, followed by the sour cream and vanilla extract; mix to combine. Turn the speed down to low and add the flour mixture and milk in 3 additions, starting and ending with the flour. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool completely on wire racks, then decorate. To decorate: To make a cow, frost the cupcakes with white icing. Place 2 candy eyes in the center of the icing, then place a round gummy peach below the eyes. Use soft black licorice sticks to make ears and 2 jelly beans to make horns at the top of the head. To make a pig, frost the cupcakes with pink icing. Place 2 candy eyes in the center of the icing, then place a round gummy peach below the eyes. Cut a gummy peach into triangles and use 2 pink pieces for the ears. To make a sheep, frost the cupcakes with white icing. Place 2 eyes in the center of the icing. Cut a gummy peach into triangles and use 2 orange pieces for the ears. Place 1 jelly bean in the center of the cupcake below the eyes to make a nose.

If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. For the berry fillings: Place the blueberries in a pan with a pinch of salt and shake out into an even layer. Place on the direct-heat side of the grill, cover with a lid and roast until the berries are bursting, 4 to 6 minutes. Mash with a fork or potato masher to smooth out. Place the strawberries in another pan with a pinch of salt and shake out into an even layer. Place on the direct-heat side of the grill, cover with a lid and roast until the berries are bursting, 4 to 6 minutes. Mash with a fork or potato masher to smooth out. To a blender or food processor, add the cream cheese and coconut cream. Blend until smooth, then divide into 2 mixing bowls. Add the roasted blueberry puree to one bowl and mix to combine. Add the roasted strawberry puree to the second bowl and mix to combine. Chill until thickened into a spreadable consistency, about 30 minutes. For the lemon filling: Add the cream cheese and butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Cream until smooth, then scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and add the lemon zest and juice, vanilla paste and confectioners&#39; sugar and mix until smooth. Chill until thickened into a spreadable consistency, about 30 minutes. For the crepe batter: To a blender, add the milk, warm water, eggs, melted butter, flour, granulated sugar and salt. Blend until completely smooth, then set aside. Heat a nonstick crepe pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, glaze it with butter to just barely coat. Using a 2-ounce ladle or 1/4-cup dry measure, scoop the crepe batter and pour into the center of the pan. Immediately swirl the batter evenly around the pan and slightly up the sides into an even thin layer. Place on the direct heat side of the grill and allow to cook until set and you start to see browning around the edges, about 1 minute. (You do not need to cook the other side.) Loosen the edges with a rubber spatula, then remove to a plate. (If you want to cook the other side to give your crepes a little more structure, flip, remove the pan from the heat and cook until the other side is just set, about 30 seconds.) Repeat with the remaining batter until you have 30 to 34 crepes. (You will only need to butter the pan every 3 to 4 crepes.) Cool the crepes completely before beginning to assemble. To assemble, lay out 1 crepe and spread evenly with the blueberry filling all the way to the edges. Repeat until you have 10 to 12 layers and have used all of the filling. Next layer 10 to 12 crepes with lemon filling. Finish by layering 10 to 12 crepes with strawberry filling. Gently press down, then cover and refrigerate overnight to allow the layers to set. Dust the cake with confectioners&#39; sugar, and serve with fresh berries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 50845,&quot;Citrus-Marinated Broccoli and Chickpea Salad Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound broccoli crowns 1 medium zucchini, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces 1 pint cherry tomatoes, sliced One 15-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 2 medium cobs sweet corn, shucked and kernels shaved off (about 2 cups) 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves 1 cup fresh parsley leaves 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon chopped Hatch peppers 1 tablespoon honey 2 cloves garlic 1 medium navel orange, juiced (about 1/4 cup) Instructions: For the broccoli and chickpea salad: Prepare a large pot of boiling salted water and fill a large bowl with ice water.

(If the water is too hot, the yeast will die; if it&#39;s too cold, the yeast won&#39;t activate). Add the yeast and sugar, stir to combine and let sit for 15 minutes. The water will bubble at the surface and smell very yeasty; this is what you want. Combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and add the olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Using a fork, gradually stir the flour into the yeast/water. Once most of the flour is combined, turn the dough out onto a smooth, clean, flour-dusted work surface and knead until smooth. Lightly coat the mixing bowl with oil and return the dough to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour. For the braised chicken thighs: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to an oven-safe, high-sided saucepan over medium heat. When the oil is just starting to shimmer, place the chicken thighs skin-side down in the pan, being careful to not overcrowd. Cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 3 minutes. Flip the thighs and cook until golden on the reverse side, another 3 minutes. (The chicken should not be cooked through at this point, just browned.) Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. If necessary, add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Then add the onions and cook, stirring, until just translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic. When the onions and garlic are translucent, add the tomatoes and jalapeno and stir gently to combine. Cook until the tomatoes start to release their juices, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Return the chicken to the pan, skin-side up, and transfer to the oven. Bake until the chicken comes apart easily, another 20 to 30 minutes. Shred the chicken. For the pizza: When the dough is ready, portion it into 6 golf ball-size pieces. (If you&#39;re not using it right away, wrap each ball individually in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.) Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like; I like irregular shapes). Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Dust a pizza peel with cornmeal. Top each pizza with some braised chicken, about 1 cup of the braising sauce and 1 cup of the Cheddar. Bake until the crust is golden brown and cooked through and the cheese has melted, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and garnish with cilantro.

For the fruit: Using a mortar and pestle, mini food processor or a sealed plastic bag and a mallet or rolling pin, crush the freeze-dried raspberries and strawberries together to a powder; some little pebbles are ok. Set aside 2 tablespoons for the icing and garnish. For the dough: Spray the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking dish or 8- or 9-inch round pie pan with cooking spray. Unroll the crescent dough out on a sheet of parchment paper. If using dough with perforations, gently pinch the seams to keep them together. Leaving about a 1-inch border on one of the short sides, sprinkle with the remaining fruit mixture, followed by a layer of the granulated sugar and then the brown sugar. Use a box grater or rasp and grate the butter evenly over the top. Starting with the short edge with the filling on it, roll, tucking as you go, towards the short edge with the empty border. Cut into 8 equal rounds and place in the prepared dish. Bake until the tops are golden, 13 to 14 minutes. For the icing: While the danishes are baking, in a small bowl, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 tablespoon of the reserved fruit mixture, a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon of preferred liquid.

Pour the water into a 4- to 8-cup French coffee press to warm it while you grind your beans. Refill the kettle with 2 cups water and return to a boil. Grind the beans in a coffee grinder on the coarse setting; the ground coffee should resemble coarse sugar or sand. Coffee that is too finely ground will make your final product murky and give it an oily sheen and bitter flavor.<br> Once the kettle comes to a boil, remove from the heat and let sit 30 seconds to reach the optimal temperature for French press. If it&#39;s too hot, it can cause the brew to taste burnt. Pour the hot water out of the French press. Put the measures coffee in the bottom. And 1 cup of the hot water, put on the top (but don&#39;t press) and let sit 1 minute. After 1 minute, gently stir with the handle of a wooden spoon to break up the layer of coffee on top. Pour in the remaining 1 cup hot water. Put the top on (but don&#39;t press) and let sit for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, depending on how strong you like your coffee. Taste is subjective, so experiment to find your own target time.<br> Slowly push the plunger down to press the coffee grounds to the bottom of the pot. As a rule of thumb, if it is very difficult to press, your coffee is probably ground too fine. If it glides right down with no resistance, your grind is probably too coarse. There is a sweet spot of resistance somewhere in the middle.<br> Serve right away with milk and sweetener if using. If you aren&#39;t sharing the pot and want to wait to have a second cup, it&#39;s best to transfer the coffee to a thermos or carafe. If you leave it in the press, it will continue to brew and can become too strong or bitter.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 50862,&quot;Summer Squash 1 cup dill, chopped Olive oil, to taste 5 summer squash, cut in 1/2 Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan.

In another medium bowl, briskly whisk the eggs, sugar and melted butter together until smooth and evenly combined. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the egg mixture. Gradually whisk the liquid into the flour to make a thick batter. When the pizzelle batter starts to clump up in the whisk, switch to a rubber spatula to finish mixing it together. (If you have a large pastry bag, put a big round tip in it, and fill with the pizzelle batter.) Preheat a pizzelle iron until a drop of water sizzles on the hot surface, about 10 minutes. Lightly spray the hot surface with nonstick cooking spray. Pipe or spoon about a tablespoon of the batter into the center of each cookie imprint. Close the iron and cook until whiffs of steam comes from the iron, about 30 to 45 seconds. Open and remove cookie from the iron, cool on a rack. Repeat with remaining batter. Put the chocolate and butter in a microwave safe bowl. Cover and microwave on medium power until soft and melted, about 3 minutes depending on the power of your oven; stir until smooth. Alternatively, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with 1-inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl on the pan (without touching the water). Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Stir in mint extract. To serve pipe a tablespoon of the mint filling into the center of half the cookies. Top with another cookie and press to sandwich them together. Serve now or keep tightly covered for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 50872,&quot;Classic Tuna Melts 3 tablespoons butter, softened 3 large (sandwich-size) English muffins, halved<br> Two 12-ounce cans solid white tuna, drained<br> One 12-ounce jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped<br> 1 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, chopped<br> 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill<br> Several dashes hot sauce<br> 3 stalks celery, finely chopped<br> 2 scallions, finely chopped<br> Zest of 1/2 lemon<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 slices Swiss cheese<br> 1 Roma tomato, sliced<br> 2 teaspoons chopped chives Instructions: Preheat the broiler to high.

Insert the cut-end of the biscuit sticks into the marshmallows, making sure the sticks go almost to the top of the marshmallows. Arrange the marshmallows on to a baking sheet lined with parchment. Put the white candy melts in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 15 second intervals, stirring, until completely melted, about 1 minute. Spread a small amount on the flat bottom of a kiss-shaped chocolate candy and attach to the top of a marshmallow. Hold for 10 seconds to help adhere. Repeat with the remaining marshmallows and kiss-shaped chocolate candies. Reserve the remaining melted white candy melts for later.<br> Cover the marshmallows loosely with plastic wrap and freeze for 1 hour. After 1 hour, put the blue candy melts into a second small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 15 second intervals, stirring, until completely melted, about 1 minute. Remove the marshmallows from the freezer. Working over a large baking sheet (this will make clean up easier) use the biscuit stick as a handle and carefully dip a marshmallow into the blue candy melt mixture until completely coated, lightly shaking away any excess coating. Sprinkle the outside with a generous amount of sanding sugar. Place the coated marshmallow back onto the baking sheet and repeat with the remaining marshmallows. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes so that the coating completely sets.<br> Once the marshmallows are completely set, re-melt the white candy melts in the microwave then spoon into a small resealable plastic bag.

Prepare a breading station with flour, whisked eggs and milk, and panko crumbs. Season all with salt and pepper. Coat the breasts in flour, egg then panko. Lay the coated breasts out on a flat tray and refrigerate to let the crust dry out (about 10 minutes) this will ensure there is less moisture and less chance your coating will break when frying. Shallow fry the paillard in hot oil for approximately 2 to 3 minutes per side depending on how thick the breasts are. Drain well, season with salt and set aside when done. For the dressing: Put the anchovies, egg yolks, garlic, lemon juice, and water into a blender and process for 30 seconds until the mixture is smooth. With the blender running, pour the olive oil in slowly for the dressing to emulsify. Stir in the Parmesan, season with salt and a couple of grinds of black pepper; set aside. (Refrigerate the dressing if you will not be using it right away.) Prepare the salad by splitting the grape tomatoes in half through the middle lengthwise, mixing all ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add the dressing and toss the salad well. To serve lay the warm, crispy chicken paillard on the base of the plate and top with the salad. Garnish with shaved parmesan cheese, a wedge of lemon and a drizzle of olive oil. *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs Due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.

(This is most easily done on a mandolin.) You will need 16 slices total. Lay them out in pairs on paper towels or a clean tea towel and season lightly with salt and pepper. Arrange the prosciutto slices on half the zucchini slices so none hangs over the edges. Place 2 sage leaves on top. Place the cheese slices on top, taking the same precautions you did with the prosciutto. Finally, lay the remaining zucchini slices on top of each stack. Cover with paper towels or another clean tea towel, and press down firmly to extract moisture and firm the zucchini. Pour the eggs into a deep plate. Season the flour with salt and pepper and put it on another plate. Pick up each zucchini stack by both ends and hold it securely closed as you dip it first in the egg and then dredge in the flour until evenly coated. In a skillet large enough to hold at least 3 zucchini stacks at a time, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot. Cook the zucchini, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove to a plate and keep warm until all are cooked. Add more oil by tablespoonfuls, if needed. Add the remaining sage leaves to the hot pan and cook briefly until crisp. Arrange several crisped leaves on top of each saltimbocca.

In a small bowl, make the rub for the beef by combining Smokey Rotisserie Seasoning and Garlic Pepper. Rub the seasonings into all surfaces of the beef, cover with a sheet of plastic wrap and set aside for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours at room temperature. (The seasonings will actually begin to \cure\ the meat.) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In an oven proof skillet heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over high heat, add onion and garlic and cook until they begin to soften. Add beef and sear it on all sides. Cover pan (with lid or foil) and transfer to oven to finish beef, bringing to an internal temperature of 115 degrees F for medium rare (about 30 minutes). Remove from oven, transfer to a utility platter, and let rest for 10 minutes. (Make the sauce as directed below while the beef is resting.) While the beef is in the oven, make the onion rings. Combine flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. In another smaller bowl, whisk together oil, milk, egg and black pepper.

Separate out a handful of the parsley leaves and leave them whole. Chop the remaining and take half of the chopped parsley and place it in the bowl with the chicken. Add 3 cloves of the chopped garlic, a little less than half the total amount. Next, add 2 teaspoons or a palm full of paprika, about 2 teaspoon hot sauce and the zest of 1 lemon. Measure out a palm full then half again of the grill seasoning and add that to the chicken. Pour a healthy drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil around the inside of the bowl using a spatula. Mix the chicken and form 4 patties. Wash up and add the patties to the grill. Cook 5 minutes on each side. Place the chorizo above or alongside burgers. Try to weight the chorizo down to keep it from curling up by topping a plate or small skillet on the sausage and adding something heavy from your pantry like canned goods to weight it down. Cook sausage just 2 or 3 minutes on each side. It is already fully cooked, you&#39;re just crisping the edges and heating it through. Place the pimiento peppers and mayonnaise in a food processor and add the whole parsley leaves, the chopped onion, the zest of a lemon, 2 teaspoons hot sauce and a few pinches of salt. Turn the processor on and grind until the dressing is smooth and even. Squeeze a little lemon juice over the shrimp or prawns, about 1 tablespoon then season them with a little coarse salt and drizzle them with EVOO. Grill the butterflied shrimp or prawns alongside the burgers, 2 minutes on each side, weighting them as you did the chorizo. Remove the patties and shrimp and add to the chorizo ? loosely tenting to keep warm. Drizzle rolls with extra-virgin olive oil and place cut side down on grill. Weight the rolls down and press to toast and char them on both sides. Melt butter together with remaining 4 cloves chopped garlic and 2 teaspoons sweet paprika over low heat until garlic sizzles in butter. Remove the fries from the oven and place in a large bowl. Add the chopped parsley to the bowl and pour the melted garlic butter over the fries then season with salt to your taste. Add chopped lettuce to roll bottoms then top with chorizo, chicken patty and shrimp. Slather the bun top with pimiento mayonnaise and set in place. Serve extra mayonnaise with fries for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 50915,&quot;Apple Rice Pilaf with Toasted Almonds 1 tablespoon butter 1/4 onion, finely chopped 1/4 Golden Delicious apple, finely chopped 2 cups apple juice 2 cups enriched long-grain instant rice 1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted Instructions: In a medium saucepan, melt butter and saute onion and apples over medium heat until soft.

The water should turn a light beige color. Add 1 cup of flour and the salt. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Add the second cup of flour and repeat. The dough should start coming away from the sides of the bowl, forming a soft, sticky mass. Take the last cup of flour and sprinkle over a clean, dry work surface and flour your hands well. Take the dough from the bowl and begin to work in the additional flour a little at a time. Use the heel of your hand to knead the dough and push across the work surface, clenching the dough with your fist and twisting it over. Use a dough scraper to help gather any wet dough that sticks to the surface while you are kneading. Also only add as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds. If the dough comes up clean, it&#39;s ready. If it sticks you will have to knead it a bit more. Lightly oil a 2 quart bowl with vegetable oil, and roll the ball of dough around the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil, then tightly seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Keep in a warm place, and let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes. When dough doubles in size, remove from bowl and punch it down with your fist to deflate, then knead it again for about a minute. Dough is now ready to stretch into a round, or press into a pizza pan. Note: If you have a food processor with a dough hook attachment, you can make the dough much faster. Start by adding the yeast and water first and mixing well. Then add all the flour and salt and mix into a ball. Then rise the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 50927,&quot;Fish Tacos with Roasted Tomatillo Salsa 12 to 16 corn tortillas 1 large egg 1/4 cup milk 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons Southwestern Essence, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 2 pounds firm white fish, cut into 4 by 1 by 1/4-inch strips 4 cups vegetable oil, for frying 4 cups very thinly shaved mixed white and red cabbage 2 tablespoons sour cream 1/2 lime, juiced, plus more for serving 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1 recipe Roasted Tomatillo Salsa, recipe follows 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish 1 pound tomatillos, husked and rinsed 6 cloves garlic, unpeeled 1 small onion, cut into quarters 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded, and minced 1 lemon, juiced 1 lime, juiced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cut in the shortening and butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the vinegar and 2 tablespoons water, until the mixture forms a ball, adding more water if necessary. Pat into a ball, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roll the dough out to an 11-inch circle to fit a 9 1/2-inch glass pie plate. Place the crust in pie plate and trim and crimp edges. Place the dish on a baking sheet for easier handling. Prick the bottom and sides of the crust well with a fork. Line the inside of the crust with a piece of foil or parchment, allowing edges to extend several inches beyond the perimeter. Place 2 cups of dried beans in the crust to weight it down during baking and prevent shrinkage. Bake for 15 minutes or until the crust is no longer raw on the bottom. Remove the foil and beans by carefully lifting the foil out by the overhang. Bake for another 10 to 15 minutes or until light golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool completely.<br> For the filling: Place 1/2 cup cold milk in a medium-size mixing bowl (preferably with a pouring spout) and sprinkle the gelatin over top. Set aside to soften, about 5 minutes.<br> Bring the remaining milk and coconut milk to nearly a boil in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat.<br> When the gelatin is soft, add the sugar, cornstarch, egg yolks, and egg and whisk until very well blended. Gradually whisk about a 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture into the gelatin mixture; repeat this process once or twice using about 3/4 cup of the hot milk mixture. Pour the warmed gelatin mixture into the saucepan with the hot milk and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook for about 3 more minutes or until the mixture is very thick.<br> Strain the pastry cream through a fine wire strainer into a large clean bowl; whisk in the butter, coconut extract, and cream of coconut until smooth. Stir in 2 cups shredded coconut.<br> Pour into the cooled pie shell and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.<br> For the topping: Beat the heavy cream in a large bowl on high speed until foamy. Add the powdered sugar, and vanilla, and beat until soft to medium stiff peaks form. Spread over the pie. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup coconut. Keep refrigerated.<br> Chilling the crust for 4 hours makes all the difference in terms of the flakiness. Straining the custard is important for a really smooth texture. And lastly, chilling the pie for a good 8 hours is the key for perfect slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 50948,&quot;One Recipe, Two Meals: Southwest-Style Chili 1 pound ground beef 1 tablespoon ground cumin 3 teaspoons chili powder Salt and pepper 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 medium white onion, diced 1 green bell pepper, diced One 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes One 8-ounce can tomato sauce 1 cup stout beer, such as Guinness 1 cup beef stock 1 tablespoon minced jalapeno 1 tablespoon brown sugar Lime juice, optional Garnishes: shredded Cheddar, sour cream, sliced jalapeno, sour cream, torn cilantro sprigs Serving suggestion: cornbread Instructions: Let&#39;s make the kids&#39; version first.

If using hardwood or other charcoal, move over to 1 side of grill; if using gas, leave 1 section off. Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper, and drizzle well with canola oil. Place on the grill skin side down over direct heat, cooking until golden brown and slightly charred. Open and close the grill, as necessary, to maintain the heat without letting the skin burn. When skin is nicely charred and blistered, flip over and move to indirect heat, close lid and continue cooking until just cooked through, about 17 minutes longer, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken registers 155 degrees F. Remove from the grill and let rest 10 minutes before cutting. While the chicken is cooking, brush tomatoes, lemons and onion slices with oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill lemons cut side down until golden brown, and tomatoes cut side down until slightly charred. Grill onion slices, flipping once, until softened and slightly charred. Make the vinaigrette by whisking the vinegar and mustard until smooth. Slowly whisk in the olive oil, then whisk in the oregano and season with salt and pepper. To serve, carve the chicken into 6 to 8 serving pieces and arrange in a large shallow serving bowl. Arrange the tomatoes and onions, all but 1 of the lemon halves, and the cucumbers over and around the chicken. Scatter the olives and feta cheese over, then drizzle with vinaigrette.

Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick and cloves, and let cool. In a large bowl, combine the walnuts, almonds, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, ground cinnamon, and ground cloves and set aside. Unroll the filo dough on a flat surface and keep it covered with waxed paper and a damp towel so it doesn&#39;t dry out and become brittle. Remove 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and refrigerate for the top layer. Using a pastry brush, brush a 15 1/2 by 11 1/2 by 3 inch baking pan with some of the melted butter. Lay a filo sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush with butter, and repeat using a total of 8 sheets. Sprinkle a handful of the nut mixture over the top filo sheet. Layer 3 more filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle again with a handful of the nut mixture. Continue until all the filo sheets and nuts are used, being sure to brush each sheet with butter. Use the reserved 8 sheets of filo for the last, top layer. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Using a long, very sharp knife, cut the baklava into small diamonds: First make 6 evenly spaced lengthwise cuts. Cut straight down until the tip of the knife touches the bottom of the pan, and keeping the knife straight, cut in a straight line all the way. Next, cut diagonally across the lengthwise cuts to form diamonds, starting in one corner and making cuts until you reach the opposite corner. Heat the remaining butter until it bubbles and pour it over the top of the pastry. Bake for 1 1/4 hours or until evenly golden and flaky. Remove to a rack and spoon the cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in the pan, then serve pieces individually, placing them in decorative paper cups if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 50954,&quot;Homemade Berry Granola Parfaits 2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats 1 1/2 cups whole almonds<br> 3/4 cup shredded coconut 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 1/2 cup honey<br> Salt 1/2 cup dried cherries<br> 1/2 cup dried cranberries<br> 1/2 cup dried pineapple chunks<br> 1/2 cup maple syrup<br> 4 cups plain yogurt 4 cups mixed berries (raspberries, blueberries and strawberries), quartered<br> Instructions: For the granola: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Next roast the peppers and peel. Think about using a blow torch, if available, to burn the skin off as it does it quickly helps maintain the texture of the pepper. Once the peppers are peeled cut them into a small dice. Add the peppers to a clean mixing bowl and start with the rest of the ingredients. After rising the capers well, chop them finely and add them to the bowl. Chop the olives and do the same. Finely dice the fennel, blanch it in acidulated water, shock it in ice water, and add it to the bowl. Finely chop the garlic and the anchovy and add them to the bowl as well. Season the mixture with ground pepper; add the juice of the remaining lemon and zest as well. Add a few drops of the sherry vinegar, if desired, and add the olive oil. At this point taste the mixture and if it needs salt use the finest sea salt you can find. Set the mixture aside in a warm place while you cook the fish. Place the frying oil in a tall straight-sided pan and heat to 300 degrees. At this point add a few leaves of the green basil and fry until crisp. Season the leaves with salt and set aside for service. To begin cooking the fish add a bit of cooking oil to a saute pan and bring the oil to the smoke point. When the pan reaches the correct temperature, add the fillets of fish and begin to cook. As the fish begins to color you will see the sides begin to opaque, this is a sign that it is nearly cooked. At this point turn the fish over for about 30 seconds, remove the fish from the pan and place on absorbent paper to remove any excess oil. Before plating tear a few of the basil leaves roughly and add them to the olive mixture. Taste one final time before plating, adjust seasoning if necessary. To begin plating, place a bit of the olive mixture in the center of the warmed dinner plates, be sure to have enough olive oil on each plate so that a bit of the oil surrounds the salad. Place a fillet of halibut on top and place the fried basil leaves, opal basil on top of the fish for garnish, and sprinkle with dried fennel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</li></ol><p>&quot; 50968,&quot;Spaghetti With Quick Turkey Chili Kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 scallions, sliced, white and green parts separated<br> 2 large cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 tablespoons tomato paste 2 tablespoons chili powder 1 pound ground turkey 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 14-ounce can pinto beans, drained and rinsed 3 tablespoons ketchup Hot sauce, to taste 8 ounces spaghetti<br> Shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream, for topping (optional) Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Add the sun-dried tomatoes and saute a few minutes more. Add olives and chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the box of couscous, turn off heat and let stand covered for 5 minutes. Fluff with fork, and season with salt and pepper. Spread 2 cups on large plate, add in 1/2 pound feta, and let cool. Keep the remaining hot to serve with chicken. (Put in covered casserole and reheat in oven last 10 minutes with chicken.) For the chicken: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Trim chicken with a boning knife, if needed. Start at top of breast and carefully make a lengthwise cut from top to bottom and making a pocket about 2 inches, making sure not to pierce the other side of the breast. When couscous is cool enough to handle, carefully spoon couscous mixture into pocket. Even out the stuffing by gently moving it around with your hands. Wipe off any excess couscous from outside of breasts and season with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil and butter in saute pan and brown off both sides of chicken. Place chicken on baking sheet and place in oven for 20 minutes. While chicken is baking, make the sauce. For the sauce: In saute pan that you cooked chicken breasts in, heat and add garlic. Deglaze with white wine and add lemon juice. Reduce by one third. Add in sun-dried tomatoes, let reduce for 2 to 3 minutes, add the olives, turn off heat, add the butter and stir to combine. To serve, place couscous from oven on plate, cut chicken breast in half, top with sauce, crumble remaining feta cheese over. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 50977,&quot;Endive, Radicchio and Walnut Salad 2 Belgian endives (10 ounces), washed 1 small head radicchio (5 ounces), washed 2 carrots (6 ounces), peeled and shredded (1 1/2 cups) 1/2 cup walnut pieces 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 3 tablespoons virgin olive oil Instructions: Cut 1 1/2 inches from the root end of the 2 endives and the radicchio head, and cut these root end pieces into 1/2-inch chunks.

Crack the eggs on top and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook until the cream starts to caramelize around the edges and the egg whites are just set, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and cover with a tight-fitting lid until the yolks are slightly firm but still a bit runny, about 1 minute. Use a spatula to remove the eggs to a plate; discard the thyme sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 50979,&quot;Curry Chicken Pot Pies 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter<br> 1 stalk celery, diced<br> 1/2 large yellow onion, diced<br> 1 teaspoon curry powder, preferably Madras curry powder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 1 cup frozen peas and carrots, thawed<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for the pie crust 1 1/2 cups chicken broth<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 2 1/2 cups diced cooked chicken 1 refrigerated pie crust 1 egg, lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon water<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the oil and 6 tablespoons of the butter in large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the celery, onions, curry powder and a large pinch of salt and cook until the vegetables are soft and the onions turn translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute, then stir in the peas and carrots. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes. Slowly add the chicken broth and milk, whisking to remove any flour lumps. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken and stir to combine. Pour the curry chicken into four 10-ounce ramekins or gratin-style bowls. Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour. Roll the pie crust large enough to cut 4 circles to fit over the ramekins. Lightly brush the edges of the ramekins with the egg wash. Place the pie crust over the top of the curry chicken, pressing to seal along the edges. Using a sharp paring knife, create a few slits in the top of the pies. Brush the top of the crust with the egg wash. Bake until the crust is a deep golden brown and the pot pies are bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving. Top with pats of the remaining 2 tablespoons butter right before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 50980,&quot;Slow Cooker Filipino-Style Chicken Adobo 1/2 cup cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar 1/3 cup soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon brown sugar<br> 2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns<br> 10 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed<br> 4 bay leaves<br> 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)<br> Steamed white rice, for serving<br> Pickled cherry peppers, for garnish<br> 2 scallions, thinly sliced Instructions: In a slow cooker, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, peppercorns, garlic and bay leaves and stir to combine.

With your hands, coat the chicken entirely with Sunny&#39;s 1-2-3 Spice Rub. Place in a plastic bag, press out the air, seal and refrigerate for at least 6 and up to 24 hours. Remove the chicken from the bag, place in one layer on a baking sheet or tray and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours. Rest the chicken at room temperature for 2 hours. This is an important step, so you begin cooking the chicken when it is at room temperature. This allows the chicken to cook evenly throughout. Preheat a grill or oven to 350 degrees F. Place the chicken over the indirect heat of the grill and close the lid. If using the oven, put the chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment or nonstick aluminum foil and place on the center oven rack. Cook for 30 minutes. For the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together the juice, honey and chili flakes if using. Open the grill or remove the chicken from the oven and brush each piece liberally with the glaze. Quickly close the grill lid or return the chicken to the oven and cook until done and the chicken juices run clear, about 15 more minutes. Allow the chicken to rest, tented with aluminum foil, until the internal temperature registers 165 degrees F. In a bowl, mix together the cumin, paprika, pepper, chili powder and salt. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 50982,&quot;V&#39;s Slow-Braised Korean Short Ribs with Caramelized Kimchi Rice and Korean Cabbage Slaw 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons canola oil 1/3 cup rice wine vinegar<br> 1/3 cup soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon chili-garlic paste<br> 2 cups Bulgogi Marinade, recipe follows 1/3 cup sesame oil<br> 1 tablespoon salt, plus more to taste<br> 12 bone-in flanken short ribs<br> 1/2 head kimchi, optional, recipe follows 1/4 cup butter<br> 4 cups cooked white rice<br> 8 ounces green cabbage, shredded<br> 3 ounces red cabbage, shredded<br> Sesame seeds, optional 1/2 cup soy sauce 3 tablespoons packed brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sesame oil<br> 3 to 4 cloves garlic, peeled<br> 1 1/4-inch ginger, peeled<br> 2 1/2 green onions, roughly chopped<br> 1/2 sweet onion, outer layer removed<br> 1/2 pear, cored<br> 1/2 apple, cored<br> 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon mirin<br> 3 heads Napa cabbage 2 cups water<br> 2 tablespoons glutinous rice flour (or all-purpose flour if you don&#39;t have rice flour)<br> 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 1 cup kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons oyster sauce<br> 4 cloves garlic, peeled<br> 1/2-inch piece ginger, peeled and roughly chopped<br> 1/2 to 1 1/2 cups gochujaro (depending on how spicy you want your kimchi)<br> 1 1/2 cups julienned daikon radish<br> 1 cup julienned green onions<br> Instructions: For the ribs: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a medium bowl, whisk together 3/4 cup canola oil, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce and chili-garlic paste to make a vinaigrette. Measure out 1/3 cup of the mixture and set aside, reserving for later. Add Bulgogi Marinade, sesame oil, and salt to the bowl; whisk to combine. Place ribs in a 9-by-13-inch pan, in two even layers. Pour sauce over ribs, shuffling the ribs around to ensure the sauce coats every side of every rib. Cover the pan securely with foil. Bake the ribs until the meat is tender and almost falling off the bone, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. To check ribs for doneness, lift corner of the foil and plastic wrap and use a fork to try to pick up a rib. If the meat is not yet done, replace plastic wrap and foil and place ribs back in oven for an additional 15 minutes. Remove ribs from oven. For the sides: Chop the kimchi into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat; add the remaining 2 tablespoons canola oil. Add the butter and kimchi to the pan. Stir until the kimchi is caramelized and turns golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir well to combine. Cook until the rice fully absorbs the liquid from the kimchi and the flavors are incorporated, about 5 to 8 minutes. Add salt to taste. Remove from heat. Place the green and red cabbage in a medium bowl. Pour the reserved 1/3 cup vinaigrette over the cabbage and toss to coat. Divide the kimchi rice equally among four plates, placing it in a pile on one side of each plate. Do the same with the cabbage slaw, placing it next to the kimchi rice on each plate. Using a large spatula, gently remove ribs from the pan and place 3 ribs on top of the rice and slaw. Sprinkle with sesame seeds if using. Place soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, green onions, onion, pear, apple, and mirin in a blender and blend until pulpy but not liquified. Refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to use. Use a knife to slit the bottom of each cabbage an inch into the base. Set knife aside. With your hands, rip each cabbage in half lengthwise. Submerge the cabbage halves in water for 15 minutes. While cabbage soaks, put the 2 cups water and flour into a pan on the stove on high heat; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. When water reaches a boil, reduce heat to medium and simmer until the liquid coats the spoon, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in brown sugar. Set aside to cool. Remove cabbage from water, and shake off any excess water; place cabbage in a large bowl. Sprinkle and massage salt into each individual cabbage leaf. Let sit for 1 hour, turning cabbage every 15 minutes. Pour the cooled flour mixture into a blender. Add the oyster sauce, garlic cloves and ginger; blend until smooth. Pour into a bowl and stir in the gochujaro, daikon radish, and green onions. Rinse the cabbage in the sink to remove salt, and squeeze or shake out any excess water. Rinse bowl and return cabbage to the bowl. Using gloves (repeat: using gloves), massage paste in between each cabbage leaf. After working paste into each half of cabbage, place cabbage into a prepared kimchi vessel and press it down to the bottom as far as it will go. When all the cabbage is in the vessel, add any remaining paste to top of the cabbage. Make sure there is a weight to keep the cabbage below the level of the liquid. Replace lid or close bag, whichever is needed for the type of vessel being used; be sure there is ability for air to escape. Place a baking sheet underneath kimchi vessel before storing it to catch any liquid that may overflow during the fermentation process. Store kimchi container in a dark, out-of-the-way place at room temperature for 24 hours. Check after 12 hours to make sure cabbage is submerged in the liquid; if not, press cabbage down into the liquid. After 24 hours, place kimchi container in the refrigerator. Let kimchi sit for a minimum of 7 days before eating, checking and pressing down every 3 days. The longer the kimchi is allowed to sit and ferment, the stronger the flavor; the sweet spot is around 20 days. Note: There are a variety of vessels you can use to make kimchi. You can use a traditional earthenware jar, food-safe bucket, or even a large bowl or food storage container. Make sure your vessel is large enough to have room at the top for the fermentation process to happen. I suggest a clean black garbage bag as a liner to any container you use so it creates a dark environment, and it\u2019s easy to check because you can unwrap and retie it easily. For your weight, use anything heavy that fits inside the top of the container; I use a brick wrapped in foil. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo]&quot; 50983,&quot;Philly Cheesesteaks with Melted Fontina and Sauteed Red Onions 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more as needed 4 medium red onions, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds Salt and pepper 2 pounds top round, semi-frozen 1/2-pound fontina cheese, cut into small cubes 4 sub rolls Instructions: Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat. Saute the onion slices until wilted and just starting to take on some color, stirring all the while, about 7 minutes. Sprinkle onions with salt while cooking. Slice the top round into very thin slices. Partially freezing the meat enables you to slice it very thinly. Remove the onions from the skillet. Salt and pepper the steak slices and then saute them in the same skillet, in batches until cooked through, about 45 seconds per side. Repeat process for the remaining steak slices, replenishing oil as needed. Meanwhile, melt the cheese cubes in a microwave-safe bowl on low power for a couple minutes or until completely melted. Cut each roll down the middle lengthwise. Fill each roll with a good helping of steak slices and top with the melted cheese and sauteed onions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 50984,&quot;Croque Madame 12 slices white sandwich bread Dijon mustard, for spreading Sliced ham, as needed, depending on how thick your ham is (if using thinly sliced deli ham, use about 3 slices per sandwich, or 18 slices total) 4 cups grated Gruyere cheese 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups whole milk Pinch grated nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 over-easy fried eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Assemble the sandwiches on a baking sheet by spreading 6 slices of bread with a scant amount of Dijon mustard. (If you like more Dijon flavor, add more; I like it to be subtle.) Top with the desired amount of ham and sprinkle with about a tablespoon of cheese. Top with the remaining bread slices. In a medium saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat until melted. Stir in the flour, creating a roux, and cook for about 4 minutes. Whisk in the milk and stir until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add the nutmeg and 1 cup of Gruyere, and season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture over the sandwiches. Top the sandwiches with equal amounts of the remaining cheese. Bake for 8 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil until the sandwiches are golden brown and the cheese is bubbly, about 2 minutes (watch closely!).

Set an extra-large skillet, or a large heavy saucepan, over medium-low heat and cook the bacon until crispy and the fat renders out, 10 to 12 minutes. Set the bacon aside, reserving the fat to build your sauce. At this point you should have about 1/4 cup of reserved fat. If needed, add some olive oil or butter to make sure you have a 1/4 cup of fat in the pan. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until the paste bubbles a bit, about 2 minutes (make sure it doesn&#39;t brown). Continuing to whisk, add 3 cups of the hot milk and cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Stir in the dry mustard, and then gradually add the Cheddar and Muenster cheeses, stirring constantly until all of the cheese has melted into the sauce. Stir in the hot sauce and the remaining 1 cup milk. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and stir to coat. Stir in the crispy bacon and season with salt and pepper. You&#39;ll need 2 cups of mac and cheese for the sandwiches. For the grilled cheese: Top all 8 slices of bread with a slice of American cheese. This will act as your glue. Spoon 1/2 cup of the mac and cheese onto four of the slices, sprinkle with some basil, and then add a dollop of the spicy peppers. Top with 1 or 2 tomato slices, and cover with a second slice of bread. In a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat, spread 1/3 cup of the grated Parmesan in an even circle roughly the same size as your bread. Let the Parmesan begin to melt and brown, 2 to 3 minutes. As soon as it gets golden brown, set a sandwich on top of the Parmesan. Cook for 2 minutes more. The Parmesan will adhere to the bread and create a nice crispy crust. Remove the sandwich from the skillet and repeat the same process for the other side of the sandwich. Depending on the size of your pan, you may be able to do two sandwiches at a time. If needed, keep finished sandwiches warm in a 200 degree F oven while the others are cooking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 51002,&quot;Paprika Roast Leg of Lamb with Mint Sauce 1 cup fresh parsley 1 clove garlic 1 teaspoon dijon mustard 1 teaspoon capers Juice of 1/2 lemon 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes Kosher salt 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil For the lamb: 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Juice of 2 lemons 10 cloves garlic, grated 3 tablespoons smoked paprika 3 tablespoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 6-to-8-pound bone-in leg of lamb, hip bone removed For the mint sauce: 1 cup fresh mint Instructions: Marinate the lamb: Combine the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, paprika, cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes, 2 teaspoons salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl; whisk until smooth.

In a small saute pan, melt the butter and sweat the onions until translucent. In a small bowl, mix the onions and crumbled bacon together. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk, and season with salt and pepper. In a large, non-stick, 6-cup muffin tin, place one crepe into each cup. Make sure that the edges of the crepes are slightly pleated and overlap the edge of the tin slightly. Spoon the bacon and onion mixture into each cup. Distribute the cheese evenly into the cups. Pour the egg mixture into each cup so that all of the quiches are the same size. Place into a preheated oven for 15 minutes or until the egg mixture is completely set. In a blender, combine all of the ingredients (excepting the butter for coating the pan) and pulse for 10 seconds. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours. Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board.

Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 10 minutes.<br> Ladle the chili into bowls and serve with the garnishes of your choice. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 51056,&quot;The Mauro Family Sunday Gravy 1 cup milk 4 slices white bread, torn into little pieces<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese 1 cup fresh parsley leaves, chopped<br> 3 large eggs<br> 2 pounds ground chuck<br> 1 pound ground pork<br> 1 pound ground veal (if you don&#39;t like veal, just use more beef)<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 pound hot Italian sausage links<br> 1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)<br> 2 teaspoons dry Italian seasoning<br> 4 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)<br> 1/3 cup dry red wine, such as Chianti or merlot<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Three 28-ounce cans crushed tomatoes<br> 2 pounds pork neck bones<br> 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil<br> Instructions: For the meatballs: In a large mixing bowl, mix together the milk, bread, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper to make a panade. Whisk in the cheese, parsley and eggs until uniform. Add in the chuck, pork and veal and, using your hands, mix together until combined. Do not overwork! Do a tiny test meatball to gauge seasoning. Once the mixture is properly seasoned, roll it into twelve 3-inch meatballs. For the sauce: Heat the olive oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the sausage and brown on each side until golden, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Next, brown all sides of the meatballs until dark brown, about 5 minutes a side. Set aside. Drain out all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden around the edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the Italian seasoning and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up any bits. Season with salt and pepper. Add the tomatoes and increase the heat to medium high. Add the sausage, meatballs and neck bones and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook with the lid on until the meatballs are no longer pink in the middle and are about 170 degrees F, about 1 hour. Remove the sausage and meatballs from the sauce (leave in the neck bones) and refrigerate. Simmer the sauce, uncovered, until the neck bone meat is falling-off-the bone tender, skimming the fat off the top and stirring frequently, another 3 hours. (After about 2 1/2 hours, remove the sausage and meatballs from the refrigerator to come back to room temperature.) Add the sausage and meatballs back to the sauce and bring to a simmer again for 10 minutes to heat the meat up. Add salt and pepper to taste, then add the fresh basil just before serving. Serve on top of a mound of mostaccioli or rigatoni, with a side of hot giardiniera. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Brunello di Montalcino, Valpolicella]&quot; 51057,&quot;Apple Crostata 10 tablespoons butter, cut up 2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup plus 4 tablespoons sugar 1 egg yolk 1/2 cup creme fraiche 4 to 5 Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored and sliced into eighths 1 teaspoon cinnamon 2 tablespoons cream Instructions: In a mixer with the paddle attachment, mix 8 tablespoons of the butter, flour, salt, and 2 tablespoons of the sugar until sandy. In a separate bowl, blend the egg yolk and the creme fraiche. Add the blended egg yolk and creme fraiche to the flour mixture and mix until barely combined. Form into a disk and chill. Meanwhile toss the sliced apples with 1/2 cup of the sugar and cinnamon. Roll out the dough to a 1/8-inch thickness on a floured surface and cut out 8-inch disks or 1 large round disk and place on a parchment lined sheet pan. Place the apples in the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch flap of dough around the edge. Fold over the flap onto the apples, forming a rustic, uneven rim around the crostada. (The apples should NOT be completely covered with the dough.) Dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Brush the edge with the cream and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. Bake in a preheated oven 350 for 25 to 35 minutes, until light golden brown and apples are tender. Let cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51058,&quot;Shaved Asparagus Salad 1 orange 1 bunch thick green asparagus (1 pound), trimmed and thinly sliced on the bias<br> 4 ounces Pecorino Romano cheese, diced 2 tablespoons chopped chives 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons toasted hazelnuts, whole or coarsely chopped Instructions: Remove and chop the zest from the orange and add it to a large nonreactive bowl.

Marinate for 10 minutes at room temperature. On medium-high heat, pan-sear the steak for 4 minutes on its first side, then 3 minutes on its second side; you should hear a hot sizzle all the way. Transfer to the bottom rack of an oven for 3-5 minutes depending on the thickness of your steak and desired doneness. This last step is the most important: let your meat rest for at least 5 minutes so the juices can redistribute. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 51060,&quot;Grilled Kansas City Smothered BBQ Chicken 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded to 1/2-inch thickness 2 cups Kansas City BBQ sauce, divided (see below for recipe) 1/3 cup white mushrooms, sliced 1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced 8 slices provolone cheese Fresh cilantro or parsley (optional) Reynolds Wrap?

Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Reserve 1/2 cup of sauce and pour remaining sauce in a large sealable bag. Add chicken breasts to bag. Seal and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat grill to medium heat and arrange four 12x12-inch pieces of Reynolds Wrap? Non-Stick Foil on the grill. Use tongs to transfer one chicken breast to each foil square. Discard marinade. Brush each chicken breast with some of the remaining BBQ sauce. Top with sliced mushrooms and onions. Fold foil around each chicken breast to enclose the chicken and veggies. Allow to cook over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes or until chicken is tender and juices run clear or meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F. Unwrap foil packets and place two slices of provolone cheese over the top of each chicken breast so that the cheese is lying on top of the mushrooms and onions. Allow to cook uncovered 2 to 3 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Tempranillo]&quot; 51061,&quot;Chocolate-Hazelnut Dipped Fruit 1/4 pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into 16 1/2-inch chunks 2 medium bananas, peeled and cut into 16 1/2-inch slices 16 (1/2 cup) seedless red grapes 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 cups (12 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1 cup chopped hazelnuts, toasted* see Cook&#39;s Note Instructions: Special equipment: 16 (4-inch) skewers or toothpicks Line a baking sheet with waxed paper or parchment paper. Set aside. Using paper towels, pat the pineapple pieces dry. Thread the skewers starting with a piece of pineapple, then a banana slice and then a grape. Repeat with the remaining fruit and skewers. In a small bowl, combine the cream, chocolate chips, and oil. Set the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes. Put the hazelnuts in another small bowl. Dip 1 side of the skewered fruit into the chocolate mixture. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off and then dip the skewer into the chopped nuts. Place the skewers, chocolate side up, on the prepared pan. Refrigerate until the chocolate has set, about 30 to 40 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51062,&quot;Tri-Tip Steak with Tomato Romesco 1 tri-tip steak, about 2 to 2 1/2-pounds, or other 2-inch-thick steak Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup cherry tomatoes 2 tablespoons almonds, shelled 3 cloves garlic, lightly crushed 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped, optional 1 to 2 tablespoons sherry or red wine vinegar 1/3 cup olive oil 1/2 teaspoon pimenton or other chili powder, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Generously season both sides of steak with salt and pepper. Put a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. When it is very hot, add the steak to one side of the pan and tomatoes, almonds, garlic, and jalapenos, if using to the other. Sear the steak for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring the tomato mixture once or twice. Once a nice crust has formed on one side of steak, turn it over, carefully transfer the now-charred tomato mixture to a food processor, and put pan in oven. If tomatoes are not a bit blackened, leave them in pan and check again after a minute or two in the oven. Cook until steak is rare to medium-rare, about 6 to 12 minutes longer depending on its thickness (an instant-read thermometer will register 125 degrees F when steak is medium-rare). Transfer the steak to a plate and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. While the steak is cooking or resting, add the vinegar and olive oil to the tomato mixture in a food processor, and season with salt, pepper and pimenton or chili powder, if using. Process the mixture, adding more olive oil or vinegar as you like, until the mixture reaches the desired consistency. Sauce should still be a little crunchy from almonds. Slice steak thinly, against the grain. Serve with sauce.

Line with a single sheet of parchment paper. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of a saucepan. Add the sugar, corn syrup and 1/4 cup water to the pan and bring to boil, stirring until the sugar has just dissolved. Continue to cook until the syrup reaches 255 to 260 degrees F on the candy thermometer. Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. When the syrup reaches temperature, slowly (and carefully) drizzle it into the egg whites with the mixer on high. Once the syrup is fully added, pour in the vanilla and continue to beat until the mixture is no longer glossy and holds its shape, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and, moving quickly, fold 1 cup of the gummy candies into the mixing bowl using a wooden spoon. Transfer the mix to the prepared pan and do your best to spread into an even layer--it will be very sticky. Sprinkle the remaining candies over the top, lightly pressing them in to ensure they stay. Allow the divinity to cool completely, about 1 hour. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares and store in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51065,&quot;Grilled Scallops with Orange-Scented Quinoa 1 1/2 cups quinoa Zest of 1 large orange Kosher salt Vegetable-oil cooking spray Eighteen 1 1/2-to-2-inch scallops (about 1 1/2 pounds), tough muscle removed 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup fresh orange juice (about 1 large orange) 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper One 15-ounce can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed 1/3 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: For the quinoa: In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups water, the quinoa, orange zest and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the pan and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. Fluff with a fork, cover the pan and let the quinoa sit for 10 to 12 more minutes. For the scallops: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Spray with cooking spray. Thread 3 scallops onto a skewer. Thread another skewer (alongside the first) through the scallops about 1/2-inch apart to make flipping the skewers easier. Repeat with the remaining scallops and skewers to make 6 skewers in total. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Grill until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. For the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, orange juice, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper until smooth. Place the quinoa in a large serving bowl. Add the dressing, beans and parsley. Toss until coated. Season with salt and pepper.

Add the cognac and scrape up the browned bits. Cook, stirring, until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups water and the reserved mushroom soaking liquid. Crush the tomatoes with your hands over the pot and add with their juices. Simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 2 hours, 30 minutes. Cool completely. Meanwhile, make the bechamel: Melt the butter in a wide saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour, nutmeg, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; cook, whisking, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk and cook, whisking, until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking, 10 more minutes. Assemble the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bring a few inches of salted water to a boil in a wide saucepan. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Line a baking sheet with a damp kitchen towel. Working in batches, boil the pasta until partially cooked, about 4 minutes, then remove with a skimmer and transfer to the ice water to cool. Remove the pasta sheets, shake off the excess water and arrange in a single layer on the towel. Cover the pasta with another damp towel. Brush the bottom and sides of a deep 11-by-13-inch baking dish with the butter. Spread 1/2 cup ragu in the pan. Cover with a layer of pasta, then sprinkle with 1/3 cup parmesan and 2/3 cup mozzarella. Spread 1 1/2 cups ragu over the cheese and top with 1 cup bechamel. Repeat with 3 more layers each of pasta, parmesan, mozzarella, ragu and bechamel. Top with a layer of pasta, then cover with the remaining bechamel. Sprinkle with the remaining parmesan and mozzarella. Tuck the edges of the pasta into the baking dish with a knife.

The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small ball of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Cover with a damp towel until ready to use. Heat the oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Ad the garlic, jalapeno, cumin, salt and pepper and saute 1 minute longer to release the aromas. Add the tomato, potatoes and corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid from the tomatoes is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the parsley and cheese and correct the seasoning. Set aside to cool. Divide the dough into 24 golfball size pieces, moistening your hands with water to prevent sticking if necessary. Flatten balls to 3 inch disks. Place a heaping teaspoon of stuffing on the empanada and close by pressing the edges together with your fingers. Shape into a half moon. Repeat until all the half moons are formed. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the empanaditas on top. Brush with the glaze and prick with a fork to make steam holes.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Roll the puff pastry out on a floured work surface to a rectangle about 12-by-10 1/2 -inches. Transfer the pastry to the prepared baking sheet. With the tines of a fork, dock a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the sheet and dock the center of the sheet a few times as well; this will prevent the dough from rising as it cooks. Spread the fig jam evenly over the pastry, leaving a small border around the edge of the pastry. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the border is puffed, 20 to 25 minutes.<br> In the meantime, cook the bacon in a saute pan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.<br> In a mixing bowl, add the olive oil then whisk in the vinegar and mustard. Add the arugula to the bowl and toss to fully coat.

Rub into the meat all over and let sit uncovered in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight. Remove the rib and let it come to room temperature. Prepare grill for cooking over indirect heat. For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium or off, to maintain the grill at about 250 degrees F. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Lightly oil the grill grates. Place the rib on the grill over the cooler burners, and cook indirectly, meat-side up, for 5 hours. Wrap the rib in foil and cook for another 45 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for an additional 45 minutes to create a nice bark. Remove the rib and let it rest.

Transfer the mashed potatoes to a bowl and top with chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51075,&quot;Seared Scallops over Micro Greens with Orange Tarragon Vinaigrette with Butter Poached Lobster 1 cup fresh orange juice 1 big sprig fresh tarragon 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic 1/2 cup grapeseed oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar Salt 1/2 fresh mango 2 tablespoons white vinegar 2 lobster tails 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter 1 clove garlic, minced 1 shallot, minced Salt 1 clove garlic 8 slices baguette, sliced diagonally about 1/4-inch thick 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon herbes de Provence Salt 4 large scallops Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Grapeseed oil 1 1/2 cups microgreens 8 whole fresh chives Instructions: For the vinaigrette: In a small pot, add the orange juice and tarragon sprig. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and reduce the juice by half. When reduced, remove the tarragon sprig, and chill the juice in the refrigerator. When cooled, add the white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Whisk together. Slowly drizzle the grapeseed oil while whisking until you get an equal balance of oil to juice. Taste, then adjust the seasoning if necessary. Put aside.<br> For the gastrique: In a small pot, add the sugar, apple cider vinegar and some salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Add the mango, and simmer for 15 minutes. Use an immersion blender, blender or even a hand mixer to blend well. Then strain through a fine mesh sieve. (If you don&#39;t have a fine sieve, you can use a regular strainer lined with cheese cloth or a clean dish towel.) You want to remove any little bits of mango that the blender missed. Put in the refrigerator to cool. For the lobster: Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the white vinegar. Drop in the lobster tails and simmer them until they just begin to turn bright orange/red. Let cool and remove the lobster meat from the shell. Chop the meat into pieces, just smaller than bite size.<br> Heat a medium skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the garlic and shallots. Saute until translucent. Add the remaining butter and melt. Add a good pinch of salt. Add the lobster and stir to coat with the butter. Simmer for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.<br> For the crostini: Preheat the oven broiler. Cut a clove of garlic in half, and rub both sides of the bread with the cut sides of the garlic. Brush one side of the bread with olive oil, and sprinkle very lightly with herbes de Provence and salt. (If you don&#39;t have HDP, you can use a mixture of dried thyme, basil, rosemary, marjoram, sage, savory and fennel seeds, or any one of those herbs you happen to have.) Lay the bread on a cookie sheet and reserve.<br> To assemble: Start with the scallops. Pat your scallops dry with paper towels. They MUST be dry in order to get a nice sear and crust on the outside. (If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll have a scallop just steeping in its own liquid, getting mushy, with no color, sear or flavor.)<br> With a paring knife, score the top of the scallops with a crisscross. You want to just score the outer layer, 1/16-inch deep. Sprinkle the scallops with salt and pepper. In a scorching hot pan with grapeseed oil, put your scallops in scored-side down. Grapeseed oil has a very high smoke point, which allows you to cook at higher temperatures for longer before it starts to smoke and burn.<br> The scallops will tell you when it&#39;s ok to lift them and take a peek at your sear. When you&#39;re able to pick the scallops up with no resistance at all, you can then take a peek to see if you&#39;re ready to flip it. You want a nice rich golden brown color on your scallop. Once you&#39;ve achieved the proper color, flip your scallops and remove the pan from the heat.<br> Put your crostini in the oven to toast.<br> Add the vinaigrette to your greens a little at a time. You want to just cover the greens with the vinaigrette, we don&#39;t want to drown it. Think light.<br> Now on each serving plate, place a silver-dollar-size portion of the dressed micro greens in the center of the plate. Take a teaspoon of the mango gastrique, and put it on the plate in front of the greens. Then with the back side of the spoon, run it through the middle of the sauce. Take 3 or 4 pieces of the lobster, blot them on a paper towel, then place them in the center of your gastrique schmear. Place your scallop on top of your micro greens. Place 2 crostinis off to the side of the scallop. Then cross 2 whole chives over each plate and you&#39;re done. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 51076,&quot;Marinated Salumi Sandwich 1/2 cup raw almonds 1 small clove garlic 1 1/2 cups fresh basil leaves<br> 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 teaspoon lemon zest (1 lemon) 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 large loaf ciabatta bread, halved horizonally 4 ounces thinly sliced hot coppa or other spicy salumi<br> 4 ounces thinly sliced finocchiona One 12-ounce ball lightly salted fresh mozzarella, sliced or torn<br> 2 cups baby arugula<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice (1/2 lemon) 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 small bulb fennel, thinly sliced Instructions: For the pesto: Place the almonds and garlic in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to coarsely chop. Add the basil, cheese and lemon zest, and pulse to combine. Add the olive oil and salt and puree until a smooth paste forms. For the sandwich: Open the loaf of bread and pull out some of the excess bread from the inside, leaving a slightly hollowed out loaf of bread. Spread the pesto evenly over the inside of both sides of the bread. Layer the coppa, finocchiona and mozzarella on the bottom half of the bread. In a small bowl, toss together the arugula, lemon juice, oil and fennel. Top the meats and cheese with the salad. Top with the remaining half of the bread and press together.

Rub beef with garlic, oregano, black pepper and fennel. Sprinkle with salt. Put beef in a deep pan and add the stock to the bottom of the pan along with the bay leaves. Place in the oven and roast for 2 hours, or until the center of the beef reaches 135 to 140 degrees F. Remove from the oven; let sit at room temperature 30 minutes. Refrigerate the beef in the pan for 3 hours, or until the center of beef is cold. Remove the pan from the refrigerator. Slice the beef paper thin. Reheat the pan juices and strain them. Add the sliced beef to the hot \au jus\ (pan sauce). Dip each roll in the au jus, open them slightly and fill with beef and peppers. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 51079,&quot;Pan-Fried Potato Cake with Onions and Bacon: Potatoes Lyonnaise 4 tablespoons clarified unsalted butter 1 medium onion, thinly sliced 4 strips smoked bacon, cooked until crisp and then crumbled or diced 2 1/2 pounds red-skinned potatoes, peeled 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Meanwhile, put 1 tablespoon of clarified butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and saute until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the crumbled bacon. Set aside. With the julienne blade of a mandoline or the large holes of a shredder/grater, shred the potatoes. By handfuls, squeeze any excess liquid from the shreds and transfer them to a mixing bowl. Add the remaining butter and the salt and pepper and mix well. Heat a 10-inch nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil. Squeezing away any liquid that has accumulated in the bowl, arrange half of the potatoes in an even layer. Spread the sauteed onion over the potatoes, and then top with the remaining potatoes in an even layer. Saute over medium heat until the underside of the potatoes are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. To flip the cake, slide it out of the skillet browned side down onto a large plate, then invert the skillet over the plate and flip both together to return the cake to the skillet browned side up. Put the skillet in the oven and bake until the cake is cooked through, about 10 minutes more. The potatoes should feel tender when the cake is pierced with a skewer or a sharp knife tip. With a spatula, lift 1 side of the cake slightly to check if the underside is well browned. If not, put the skillet on top of the stove over medium-high heat and cook briefly to brown the underside. Slide the potato cake onto a serving platter. Garnish with parsley and, with a sharp knife, cut it into 6 wedges. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 51080,&quot;Fire Broiled Trout 1 (8 to 10-inch) whole trout 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 teaspoons seasoned salt 2 teaspoons lemon pepper 4 tablespoons butter 1 onion, sliced Parsley, thyme or spinach, for garnish Instructions: Start fire in pit, make sure fire is hot, and let burn down to glowing coals. Place cooking grid or grate 6 inches above heat. Wash trout thoroughly with cold water. Remove head from trout and burn in fire pit. Tear off a large piece of aluminum foil and place on work surface. Pour olive oil to cover mid-section of foil. Place fish on top of oil. Sprinkle seasoned salt and lemon pepper on the top and inside of the trout cavity. Insert butter and sliced onions into the trout cavity. Tightly wrap foil around the trout so that no area is exposed. Place foil-wrapped trout onto cooking grid. Cook on each side for 10 minutes or until internal temperature is 120 degrees F. Remove from cooking grid and garnish with parsley, thyme or spinach. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51081,&quot;Turnip Gratin 2 pounds turnips 3 cups heavy cream<br> 2 thyme sprigs<br> 1 head garlic, cut in half along the equator<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> Salt and pepper to taste<br> 1 1/2 cups shredded white Cheddar cheese<br> Parsley leaves, for garnish<br> Instructions: Thinly slice the turnips using a mandoline. Set aside. For the custard: In a medium saucepan over medium low heat, combine cream, thyme, garlic, nutmeg, and salt and pepper. Bring to just below a simmer and cook until thickened slightly, 6 to 8 minutes. To assemble: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a 2-quart baking dish, add a thin layer of custard to cover the bottom. Then add a layer of turnips followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat the process of layering until all of the ingredients are used up, making 3 to 4 layers. Cover with foil and bake 45 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until turnips are fork-tender with a golden crispy crust forms, about 15 minutes longer. Garnish with parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Chenin Blanc, Sparkling wine]&quot; 51082,&quot;Spinach Salad with Bacon Dressing 3 strips bacon 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped capers<br> 1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard<br> 1 hard-boiled egg, finely chopped<br> 1 tablespoon finely minced fresh chives<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley<br> 5 ounces baby spinach leaves (about 8 cups)<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning once, until very crisp, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Spoon up 1 tablespoon of the remaining drippings and add them to a small measuring cup along with the olive oil. Whisk together the vinegar, capers, mustard, egg and oil mixture in a large salad bowl. Stir in the chives and parsley. Add the spinach to the bowl and toss to coat. Finely chop the reserved bacon and sprinkle over the top of the salad. Season to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 51083,&quot;Mexican Lasagne 1 tablespoon garlic flavoured oil 1 onion, peeled and chopped 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped<br> 2 green chiles, chopped, with seeds 1 teaspoon kosher salt or 1/2 teaspoon table salt 2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro stalks 2 (14-ounce) cans diced tomatoes, plus 1 2/3 cups water to rinse out empty cans 1 tablespoon ketchup 2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed 3 1/4 cups drained canned corn, from about 1 1/2 (15-ounce cans) 2 1/2 cups grated mature goats Cheddar, or cheese of your choice 8 soft flour tortillas (approximately 10-inch diameter) Avocado Salsa, for serving, recipe follows 2 avocados 1 scallion, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons chopped green jalepenos from a jar or can Salt 1 tablespoon lime juice 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F, slipping in a cookie sheet at the same time. For the sauce: Heat the oil in a saucepan on the stove and fry the onion, bell pepper and chiles. Add the salt and cook gently for 15 minutes, and once soft, add the chopped cilantro stalks. Add the canned tomatoes then rinse the cans out with water and add this too. Spoon in the ketchup and let things come to a simmer, leaving the sauce (or salsa in keeping with the Mexican mojo) to cook while you get on with preparing the filling- about 10 minutes. For the filling: Mix the drained beans and canned corn in a bowl. Add most of the grated cheese, reserving some to sprinkle on the top at the end, and mix together. Start to assemble the lasagne by spooning about a third of the salsa into the bottom of your ovenproof dish and smear it about, then layer on 2 tortillas so that they cover the sauce overlapping slightly, like a Venn diagram. Add a third of the beans and cheese mixture covering the tortillas, and then about a quarter of the remaining salsa and another 2 tortillas. Repeat with another third of beans and cheese, and more salsa before layering on another 2 tortillas. Finally, add the last layer of beans and cheese, nearly all of the remaining salsa and cover with the last 2 tortillas. Spread the very last bit of salsa over the tortillas and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 30 minutes, and let it rest for a good 10 to 15 minutes before slicing like a pizza, and eat with the avocado salsa. Halve the avocados, remove the pits, and then, using the tip of a sharp knife, cut lines down the flesh of each half, about a 1/4-inch apart and then the same across. Turn the avocado halves inside out, or otherwise release the pale green cubes into a bowl, then tumble in the scallion, chopped jalepenos, salt to taste, lime juice and most of the cilantro and toss gently to mix. Taste to see if any more salt is needed before scattering with the remaining cilantro and taking to the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 51084,&quot;Seared Yellowtail with Horseradish Crema 3 tablespoons fennel seeds, ground 2 tablespoons coriander seeds, ground<br> 2 tablespoons sesame seeds<br> 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 teaspoons salt<br> 1 pound yellowtail fillet, skin removed<br> 3 tablespoons canola oil<br> 1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish<br> 1 teaspoon lemon zest<br> One 3 1/2-ounce package rice crackers<br> 2 sheets nori or dried seaweed snakes, for garnish<br> Instructions: In a medium bowl combine the fennel, coriander, sesame seeds, pepper and salt. Slice the yellowtail into two pieces, each roughly 1 1/2-by-1 1/2-by-6-inches. Generously rub the seasoning on all sides. Heat the canola oil in a large nonstick saute pan set over high heat. Once the oil starts to smoke a bit, carefully add the yellowtail. Sear each piece on all four sides until browned, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. The center of the fish should still be rare. Place the cooked yellowtail on a plate to cool, then refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. The fish will be easier to slice if it&#39;s cold. In a medium bowl combine the creme fraiche, horseradish and lemon zest. Using a sharp knife, gently slice the yellowtail in 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Spread a spoonful of the horseradish crema on top of the rice crackers. Place the sliced yellowtail on top of the crema. Break off small pieces of the nori and place on top of the yellowtail to garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 51085,&quot;Mango Caramel Sauce 1 ripe mango, peeled, pitted and coarsely chopped 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: Place the mango in a food processor and process until smooth.

Separate eggs while the lime concentrate thaws in the microwave. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Lightly butter a 1-quart gratin dish or 8-inch round cake pan and set it in a roasting pan. Beat the 2 tablespoons butter with 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl until creamy, using a handheld electric mixer. Beat in the flour, then the egg yolks, limeade concentrate, coconut milk, and salt. (For the airiest egg whites, clean the beaters thoroughly so none of this mixture is left on them.) In another medium bowl whip the egg whites until they form soft peaks. While whipping, slowly pour in the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar and continue beating until the whites hold stiff, glossy peaks. Fold a quarter of the whites into the coconut-lime mixture, then fold in the remaining whites. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and add enough boiling water to the roasting pan to come halfway up the side of the dish. Bake about 35 minutes or until the top of the pudding cake is slightly puffed and golden. Remove from the water bath and cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes; serve warm. Garnish each serving with toasted coconut, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 51087,&quot;Tahitian Vanilla Creme Brulee 1 quart heavy cream 2 Tahitian or Madagascan vanilla beans, split and seeds scraped 1 cup sugar (1/2 cup and 1/2 cup measured separately) 6 egg yolks 1 tablespoon butter Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Pour the cream into a saucepan and add the vanilla beans, including the pods. Over medium-low heat slowly bring to a boil, then remove from heat, cover pan and set aside for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and gradually add 1/2 cup of the sugar, whipping until you see a change in color. After 15 minutes remove the vanilla pods from the cream mixture. Then slowly incorporate the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture a little at a time, whisking constantly as you go. Lightly grease 6 to 8 (4 or 6-ounce) ramekins and fill them each 3/4 full with the mixture. Prepare a bain marie by adding 2 quarts hot water to a roasting pan and immersing the ramekins so that the water level is halfway up the side of the ramekins. Be careful to avoid splashing any water into the ramekins. Bake in the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, allow to cool and then refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. (You can do this way in advance if you wish.) Just before serving remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm up a little. Then divide the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar among the ramekins sprinkling some on the surface of each cup of custard. Using a blow torch, melt the sugar to form a crispy sugar \crust\ on the top of each. This custard could be served with fruits of the season. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 51088,&quot;BBQ Baby Back Ribs 3 racks loin back or baby back ribs (#2 and down) 2 tablespoons liquid smoke 1/4 cup BBQ seasoning, divided 1 tablespoon mesquite butter 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Skin ribs by peeling the skin of the back side.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, and brush with oil. Place the salmon fillets, evenly spaced, in the middle of the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle the tops with 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Bake until the outside is opaque and slightly firm to the touch and the inside flakes easily (insert a small paring knife between layers to check; the color will vary from bright pink (rare) to pale pink to orange (well-done)), 8 to 12 minutes, depending on the desired doneness. Remove the fillets from the oven, top each with a piece of butter and let melt over the top and down the sides. Sprinkle with herbs, lemon juice and salt to taste. Transfer the salmon to serving plates with a spatula.

In a large ovenproof pot, combine the rice, sausages, chestnuts, sugar, soy sauce, dried scallops, gingko nuts, ham, dates, wine, and dried shrimp. Add a scant 3 cups of water, put in a steam oven, and cook until cooked through and soft, 30 to 45 minutes. Fold in the edamame. Taste and adjust the sugar, soy sauce, and salt. Let cool and then fold in the scallions. Stuff about 1/2 cup of the rice mixture into each quail. To make the scallion oil: Put the scallions in a bowl, cover with the oil, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Puree in a blender and strain through a very fine-mesh sieve, gently pressing to extract the pulp. Add the ginger, to taste. To make the garlic chives: In a small skillet heat the oil over medium heat. Saute the garlic chives, seasoning with salt, until slightly caramelized. You can add a bit of water to help cook the chives through before burning, if needed. To serve: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Heat a large skillet with a little oil. Sear the birds breast side down and then put in the oven until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Then turn the birds and repeat the process on the other side, cooking until the birds are cooked and the rice is heated through.

Leave the blender running and through the feed opening add the curry paste and sriracha chili sauce and blend together for a few seconds, then continue by adding the liquids 1 at a time: Chardonnay, soy sauce, orange juice, and coconut milk. Reserve half of this mixture in a small bowl to make into a sauce. Arrange the salmon in a shallow bowl and pour the other half of the mixture over the fish. Cover and let marinate refrigerated for at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Transfer the reserved sauce mixture to a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until it begins to bubble and thicken. Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe skillet and sear each side of the salmon (skin side down first) without disturbing for the first 3 to 4 minutes of sear time on each side. (This allows the surface to caramelize, so the fish won&#39;t tear apart when you flip it.) Transfer the pan to the oven to finish the fish - a further 5 to 7 minutes, depending upon the thickness of the fillets. Do not overcook the fish. It is done when it springs back upon being lightly prodded. Use an oven mitt to remove the pan from the oven (that handle will be hot). Transfer salmon to a platter and let rest.

Pulse the graham crackers in the work bowl of a food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds; you should have about 1 1/2 cups of crumbs. Add the sugar and salt and pulse to combine. Add the melted butter and pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand. Press the crumbs evenly into the bottom and up the sides of an 8-inch pie plate. Bake until the crust is lightly browned, 15 to 18 minutes. Allow to cool completely. For the filling: Pour the water into a small bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin into the water. Let stand until the gelatin softens, about 15 minutes. Set a small pot of water to boil. In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar. Add the grapefruit juice, grapefruit zest and salt. Place the bowl on the pot of boiling water to create a double boiler. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly and registers 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the gelatin mixture, whisking until the gelatin dissolves and the mixture is smooth, about 1 minute. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl; discard the solids remaining in the strainer. Set aside to cool, 30 to 40 minutes. Once the filling has cooled, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until frothy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the sugar, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat the egg whites until glossy and stiff peaks form, about 8 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the cooled egg yolk mixture in batches until fully blended and no streaks remain. Pour the filling into the cooled crust, allowing the chiffon to mound slightly in the center. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 2 days before serving. Let stand at room temperature 20 minutes before serving. Before serving, toss the strips of grapefruit zest in the sugar and arrange in the center of the pie. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 51095,&quot;Tropical Tequila Cocktail 1 large pineapple 1 cup frozen mango 1 cup frozen strawberries 2 tablespoons cream of coconut 6 ounces tequila 2 limes, one juiced and one sliced into rings Fresh fruit for garnish, such as strawberries, pineapple and cherries Instructions: Trim the top off the pineapple, then halve the pineapple crosswise.

Remove the plastic, take the fillet and lay it on top of the rice. Place the plastic wrap over top and hand press the mackerel fillet over the rice to form a rough box shape. You can use the kombu sheet or a bamboo mat at this point to assist in evenly shaping the rice. Wet the tip of your knife to prevent sticking and slice the roll into 8 to 10 slices, then remove the plastic wrap. Serve with soy sauce. Combine the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small saucepan. Heat over high heat, stirring, until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Set aside to cool. Rinse the rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. Add the rice and 810 milliliters water (see Cook\u2019s Note) to a rice cooker and cook according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. When done, remove it from the cooker and spread it out in a pre-soaked wooden mixing tub (sushi oke) or on a sheet pan or tray. Immediately sprinkle it with the vinegar mixture and fold it in. Use a kitchen towel to very gently separate the rice grins and remove excess moisture and starch, being careful not to squeeze too hard or overwork the rice. Cool the rice before using, at least 15 to 20 minutes. Store the rice before use in a damp towel-lined sushi oke with a lid or in a covered bowl. Refrigerate any leftovers immediately. Fillet the mackerel, leaving the rib bones in. Sprinkle the flesh side of each fillet with the salt. Cover with plastic wrap. Leave to cure at room temperature until the salt begins to pull moisture from the fish, 20 to 30 minutes or more, depending on the fat content of the fish (fatty mackerels will take a little longer than lean ones). Rinse the salt off the fish after curing. Pat the fillets dry, then place them in a baking dish and cover with the vinegar. Place the kelp sheet over top. Refrigerate 25 to 40 minutes, depending on the fat content of the fish (fatty mackerels will take a little longer than lean ones). Remove the fish fillets from the vinegar. Remove the rib and pin bones from the fillets. Carefully remove the skin by peeling it off with your fingers, making sure not to disturb the fatty, patterned layer underneath the skin. Pat dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Makes 2 fillets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 51100,&quot;Coffee-and-Doughnuts Float 2 tablespoons store-bought chocolate sauce 1/4 teaspoon instant espresso powder 1 cup coffee ice cream (about 3 large scoops) 3/4 cup coffee soda, such as Manhattan Special, or cream soda Sweetened whipped cream, for topping 2 mini doughnuts Instructions: Whisk the chocolate sauce and instant espresso powder together in a small bowl until combined.

Cover with 8 cups cold water and add the salt; the water should taste a little salty. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer and cook until they feel tender when poked with a fork or knife. Drain and then mash, adding the milk and butter. Transfer to a bowl and let cool for at least an hour. For the filling: Meanwhile, add the olive oil to a deep skillet over high heat. Add the onions, garlic, cumin, oregano, paprika, salt, pepper and bay leaf. Turn the heat down to medium-high and cook for 5 to 10 minutes. Add the beef and tomato paste, cover and turn the heat down to medium. Cook for about 25 minutes. Remove the lid and stir; the consistency should look like thick chili. Transfer to a pan and spread the mixture out so it cools quickly. To assemble: Start by portioning the cooled potato mixture, about 8 ounces or enough to look like an orange when rolled into a ball. Next, take a ball and flatten with your palms while at the same time maintaining a cup shape in one hand. Then, with an ice cream scooper, fill the potato with the meat filling. Close and seal it with both hands. Repeat with all the potato balls. Set up 3 shallow pans, one with the egg wash and the others with the panko. Take a potato ball and put in the egg, then in the fine panko, back into the egg and then in the coarse panko. Once you have breaded them, put them in the refrigerator to firm up, about 30 minutes. Fill a deep pot about halfway with oil and heat to about 350 degrees F. Carefully drop the potato balls in the oil and fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve with Salsa Ranchera. Start by heating a skillet with 5 tablespoons of the olive oil and adding the chiles and whole garlic cloves to toast for a few minutes. Then add the onions, bell peppers, oregano, cumin, salt, pepper and bay leaf. Then add the fresh tomatoes, tomato puree and stock, and reduce by a third at a low simmer; this takes about 15 minutes. Let cool for 20 minutes. Then place in a blender and puree. Heat the remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil in another pan. Strain the sauce through a fine mesh strainer and add to the pan. Fry the sauce in the hot pan and reduce until thick, 15 to 20 minutes.

In a large mixing bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Set aside. In a medium, heavy-based saucepan, heat the brown sugar, milk, and cream over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Scald the mixture (do not boil it) and remove it from heat. While the cream mixture is heating, dissolve the sugar and water over low heat in a large, heavy-based saucepan increase the heat to high and boil the sugar until it=s amber in color. If the sugar starts to sputter, use a pastry brush dipped in water to wash down the sides of the pan. As soon as the sugar turns dark amber (like a old penny), carefully and slowly pour the hot cream into it, stirring the mixture. (The caramel will bubble as you add the cream, so use a long wooden spoon or whisk to combine them.) Gently and slowly whisk the cream mixture into the egg yolks. Stir in the salt and vanilla. Strain the pudding and cool it in an ice bath or refrigerate until cool. Skim of any air bubbles from the pudding mixture and divide the cool pudding mixture among 6 (6-ounce) ramekins. Set the ramekins in a shallow roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the pan with foil. Bake the pudding until just set.

Remove from the heat and add the mussels and 1/4 cup of the vermouth. Return the skillet to the stove and cook for 1 minute. Add about 3/4 cup water. The mussels shouldn&#39;t take long to cook, about 2 minutes. Take care to stir the mussels from time to time so they cook as evenly as possible. Use tongs to pluck the mussels from the pan as they open. When all of the mussels are open, remove them and strain the liquid, reserving it for the sauce. Remove the mussels from their shells. Discard the shells. Cook the mushrooms: Rinse the skillet and return it to high heat until it smokes lightly. Remove the pan from the heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, and swirl the pan until the butter turns a light brown color. Return the skillet to the heat and immediately add the shallots and mushrooms. Season lightly with salt and the red pepper flakes. Cook the mushrooms until they start to give up liquid and brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup vermouth and cook for 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Toast the hazelnuts: Meanwhile, in a small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat and add the hazelnuts. Season them lightly with salt and toast them over low heat until they turn light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the hazelnuts and transfer them to a cutting board. Roughly chop the hazelnuts. Make the sauce: Transfer the mushrooms to a plate using a slotted spoon. If there is any cooking liquid from the mushrooms, combine it with the mussel cooking liquid in a small saucepan. Simmer over low heat for 1 minute. The sauce may need a pinch of salt. The flavor should be an initial taste of sweet mussel followed by an undertone of earthiness from the mushroom. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the butter and a touch of lemon juice. Keep warm. Assemble the dish: Heat a large skillet over high heat until hot, 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. When it turns light brown, return the skillet to the burner and add the mussels and mushrooms in a single layer. Cook for 1 minute without stirring them. They should be browned on their first side before you stir them slightly, with a wooden spoon, and leave them to brown for an additional minute. Stir in the sauce. Taste for seasoning. Toss in the hazelnuts.

Meanwhile, tear the bread into small pieces, and put in a small bowl. Add the vinegar, toss and let sit until the bread is very soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a food processor. Add the parsley, olive oil, capers, whole cornichons, anchovy, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, and process until a coarse paste. (The salsa verde can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.) Fill a small pot with about 2 inches of vegetable oil. Clip a deep-fry thermometer onto the side, and bring the oil to 350 degrees F over medium-low heat. Line a plate with paper towels. Meanwhile, beat the egg in a small bowl. Put the breadcrumbs in another small bowl. Bread and fry the Brie in two batches: Dip the wedges in the egg, then roll in the breadcrumbs to cover. Repeat for a double breading (make sure there are no bare spots where the cheese peeks through). Being careful of the hot oil, add half the breaded Brie and fry, turning as needed, until a deep golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, and allow to drain on the paper towels. Repeat with the remaining Brie. Spoon some of the salsa verde onto 6 small plates. Top each with a wedge of fried Brie, and garnish each with a cornichon half and parsley.

Cover the bowl with a lid or plate and let stand until the flour absorbs the water, 30 to 45 minutes. Add the sourdough starter, salt and remaining 3 tablespoons water to the dough. Squeeze and twist with your hands until a sticky dough forms (it will be soupy at first, but continue mixing). Knead the dough in the bowl by scooping under the dough, stretching it up and twisting it while you rotate the bowl a quarter turn; slap down the dough and repeat. Continue kneading until the dough smooths out and pulls away from the bowl, 5 to 7 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and cover with a lid. Let rest in a warm place, 30 minutes. Uncover the dough. Gently reach under the dough with a wet hand, stretch it up as far as it will go without tearing, then fold the dough over itself. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat three times; this is a set of turns. Do another set of turns, then re-cover the bowl and return to a warm place to rest, 30 minutes. Do two sets of turns every 30 minutes until the dough has increased in size by one-third and has large bubbles in spots, 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 more hours, covering the bowl after each time. After the last set of turns, cover the bowl and let the dough rest another 30 minutes. Turn out the dough onto a generously floured work surface. Slide a bench scraper or large spatula underneath and fold the dough in half. Cup floured hands around the dough and gently roll it in a circular motion into a taut ball. Let rest, uncovered, 20 minutes (the dough will flatten a little). Line a medium bowl with a clean lint-free towel and dust generously with flour. Lightly dust the top of the dough with flour, then slide a bench scraper or large spatula underneath and flip it over. Working gently to not deflate the dough, pull each of the four \u201csides\u201d of the dough up and into the center, folding the last side to cover the whole top of the dough. Roll the dough over so the seams are on the bottom. Slide a bench scraper or large spatula underneath and gently invert the dough into the towel-lined bowl with the seam up. Cover loosely with the overhanging towel. Let rest in the refrigerator, at least 8 hours and up to 18 hours. About 30 minutes before baking, place a 10- to 11-inch Dutch oven with a lid in the middle of the oven and place a baking stone or large cast-iron skillet on the bottom rack to absorb the heat; preheat to 450? F. Carefully remove the Dutch oven from the oven and uncover. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, uncover and lay a large round of parchment on top. Invert the dough onto the parchment. Carefully lower the dough (on the parchment) into the hot Dutch oven. Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife, make a few 1/4- to 1/2-inch-deep cuts in the top so that the dough can expand. Transfer the pot to the oven; cover with the lid. Bake until the bread has risen and the crust is pale, about 20 minutes. Uncover and bake until the crust is browned and crisp and a thermometer inserted into the center registers 210? F, 25 to 35 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pot, then transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51194,&quot;Rick Bayless&#39;s Yucatecanstyle Fresh Coconut Pie 1 cup slivered almonds 3 tablespoon sugar 4 ounces (about 5 slices) firm white bread, torn into pieces 3 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 medium size coconut with lots of liquid inside 1 cup heavy cream 2/3 cup sugar 3 large egg yolks 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/2 cup sour cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Refrigerate several minutes to set.<br> Twist a corkscrew (or dive an ice pick or screwdriver) into 2 of the coconut&#39;s \eyes\ (the dark indentations on one end), then drain the trapped liquid into a cup (strain if it contains any bits of coconut shell). Place the coconut on a baking sheet and put into the oven for about 15 minutes to help loosen the flesh from the shell. With a hammer crack the coconut into several pieces, then use a small knife or screwdriver to pry the flesh from the shell. Use a paring knife or a vegetable peeler to peel away the dark brown skin.<br> In a food processor (or, with determination and stamina, using a four-sided grater) grate the coconut into medium fine shreds. Measure out 2 1/2 cups for the pie; reserve the remainder for the garnish. Raise the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. In a small (1 to 1 1/2 quart) saucepan, combine the coconut water, cream and sugar. Simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until reduced to 1 cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour into a large bowl, then stir in the 2 1/2 cups of coconut, the reserved 1/2 cup almonds, the egg yolks and vanilla. Set the prepared crust onto a baking sheet, scoop in the coconut filling and bake in the middle of the oven until set and lightly browned on top, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.<br> While the pie is baking, toast the reserved coconut on a baking sheet in the oven, stirring occasionally, until nicely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
