Grate the potato and onion into the same bowl. Transfer the mixture to a cheesecloth or clean kitchen towel and squeeze out all of the liquid. Really squeeze hard! The more moisture you can get out now, the crispier the latkes will be. In a medium bowl, mix together the squeezed-out mixture with the eggs, flour, kosher salt, and pepper until thoroughly combined. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat. Divide the latke mixture into equal portions. Place 3 latkes in the skillet at a time. Keep them spaced out and don&#39;t overcrowd. I like to press down a little with the spatula to flatten the latke a bit after flipping to get it a little thinner, so that it&#39;s extra crispy. Fry until golden and crispy around the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip the latkes and fry the second side until crisp, pressing down with a spatula as it cooks, another 2 to 3 minutes. When the latkes are done and dark golden all over, place on a paper towel lined plate and season with sea salt. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil and latke mixture. Transfer to a serving plate. Serve with either Chive Sour Cream, Roasted Lemons, applesauce, or all three, and mint. In a medium bowl, combine the sour cream, chives, mint, and a generous pinch of salt. Mix thoroughly and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the lemon slices in a single layer on the baking sheet, drizzle with the olive oil, and season with the salt. Roast until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 43089,&quot;Blueberry Pie 1 stick unsalted butter, chilled and cubed, plus 1 tablespoon for pan 5 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling dough 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 cup shortening, chilled and cubed 1/2 to 2/3 cup, plus 2 tablespoons ice water<br> 5 cups blueberries, discard any small or overly soft berries 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, sifted 1/2 stick unsalted butter, cut into small cubes 1 cup granulated sugar 1 pinch kosher salt 1 lemon, zested and juiced 12 to 14 ounces good quality blueberry jam 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup water 1 orange, juiced Vanilla ice cream, for serving Instructions: Coat the pie tin with 1 tablespoon of butter.

Add the oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Add the beef and brown for 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and let drain in a colander. While it&#39;s draining, lightly rinse the inside of the skillet with warm water, wipe with paper towel, then put back on the stove. Make sure skillet is dry on inside so the oil doesn&#39;t pop. Coat the skillet with oil and add the rock candy. Let it melt for 1 minute or until halfway melted on medium heat. Add the browned beef and stir until caramelized. Remove the skillet from the heat, add moutai and ignite with a long kitchen match. Let it flame for 10 to 15 seconds then return the skillet to the heat. Add the rice wine, garlic, onion, horseradish, 4 ounces of soy sauce, and the fermented rice sauce. Let simmer for 2 minutes and then add 2 cups of the water. Let simmer for 5 minutes, then skim the foam off the top. Add the cherry cola and let boil, uncovered, on high heat for 10 minutes. Stir in the remaining cup of water and cover. Cook until tender, usually another 50 minutes. About 20 minutes before serving, set up a bamboo steamer. Put the dried lotus leaves in steamer and put the 8 buns on top. Steam until soft, but still firm, usually 3 to 5 minutes. Roughly chop the beef. You don&#39;t want to chop it fine, you just want nice bite-sized pieces like chopped brisket. Stuff each bun with the beef and some onions from the pot. Transfer the lotus leaves to a serving platter and arrange the buns on top. The large leaves give off a nice aroma and looks cool.

Slice each potato into 6 wedges. Add the potato wedges to a pot of cold salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until the potatoes are barely tender, but a knife can be pushed through with just a slight resistance, about 6 minutes. Drain potatoes and add to a large mixing bowl. Drizzle potatoes with olive oil and toss with BBQ seasoning, salt, and pepper. Carefully remove the hot sheet tray from the oven and quickly add the seasoned potatoes to them. You want the pan to stay as hot as possible. This will help to crisp up the potatoes while they roast. Place the sheet pan back into the oven and roast until golden and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes, flipping 1/2 way through the cooking time. Remove from the oven and toss with fresh herbs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43108,&quot;Barbecued Ribs 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 small red onion, diced (1 cup) 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 teaspoon lime zest 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger 1/3 cup cider vinegar 1/2 cup tomato paste 1/2 cup honey 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1/3 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 4 racks country ribs (8 to 10 pounds) Instructions: Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, and saute the onions and garlic for 5 to 7 minutes, until the onions are translucent but not browned.

Let the mixture sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in a bowl. With the motor running, slowly add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture. Keep mixing until a smooth, elastic dough forms, about 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Divide the dough into four 12-ounce pieces and shape into balls. Transfer the balls to a lightly greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish and brush with oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. For the sauce: Remove each tomato from the can and reserve 3 cups of the puree. Cut the tomatoes in half and, using your fingers, remove and discard the seeds (don&#39;t rinse). Place the tomatoes in a food processor and pulse until just crushed but not pureed. (Alternatively, crush the tomatoes by hand or pass them through a food mill.) Transfer the tomato sauce to a bowl and stir in the reserved 3 cups of puree and some salt. For the pizza: Place a pizza stone under the oven broiler. Preheat the broiler for 30 minutes. Working in four batches, dust a ball of dough heavily with semolina. Using your fingertips, press the dough from the center out, into a 10-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick, leaving a 1-inch thick crust around the edges. Hold the dough straight up, and with your fingertips circling the crust, let the dough naturally fall. Slide your fingers around crust in a circular motion (like you would turn a steering wheel) until the dough in the center is stretched to about 1/8-inch thick. Repeat for the remaining dough balls. Transfer the dough to a semolina-dusted pizza peel. Spread each pizza with about 1/2 cup sauce evenly over center of the dough, distribute a quarter each of the cheese and basil leaves, and drizzle with oil. Slide a pizza onto the stone and broil until the cheese melts and the crust is puffed and charred in spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat for the remaining pizzas. Serve hot.

Use your fingers to work the butter into the dough until it forms pea-like balls. Alternatively, sift the dry ingredients into the food processor and pulse the butter into the mixture until it is blended and relatively smooth. Work the water in with your fingers (or in the mixer). Turn the dough out onto a flat surface and roll it into a ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap and press it down. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. In a medium saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer. Whisk in the semolina flour and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. If it forms lumps as it cooks, whisk until smooth. Transfer the milk and flour mixture to a bowl to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in the ricotta, the egg, sugar. Add the candied orange and lemon bits and sift a dusting of cinnamon over the surface. Stir to blend. Taste for seasoning and refrigerate until ready to use. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide in half. Flour a flat surface and roll 1 of the halves into a rectangle about 14 inches by 24 inches. The shorter end of the rectangle should be close to you. The dough should feel very thin. The thinner the better! Brush the entire rectangle with a layer of the shortening. Sprinkle it with an even dusting of confectioners sugar. Gently and evenly roll it up into itself like a jelly sponge roll. Roll carefully, taking care that it rolls up very tightly. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Use a sharp knife to cut the roll into 1 to 1 1/2-inch thick pieces. Repeat the same process with the other half of the dough. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put 1 of the dough rounds in your hand and, with the other hand, press your thumb into the middle of your other hand (and, therefore, into the dough) and start to stretch the dough. You don t want to push so much that you make a cavity just yet. First, concentrate on making the dough round bigger and flatter. When it is about the size of a large clam shell, start to smooth and push down in the middle so it forms a cavity a lot like a large clam shell. You want to finish with a cone with an opening of about 3 inches and the smaller, tapered end about 1-inch. Brush a little shortening on the dough and turn it inside out, cupping the dough cone between the length of your index finger and thumb. Carefully spoon 2 large spoonfuls of the filling into the cone. The cone should be fairly filled and go to the edges of the opening with a thin layer of the filling. Close the mouth by carefully folding the cone opening over itself. The same as if you had 2 halves of a clam shell and were closing it up. Gently press the edges of the opening, together. Arrange on a nonstick baking sheet. Repeat with all of the dough, until both of the baking sheets are filled. Brush each with the egg wash. Put the trays in the center of the oven and bake until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow them to rest a few minutes on the baking sheet. After the Sfogliatella have rested for a few minutes, sprinkle them with another dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar and put each baking sheet squarely under the broiler. Do not walk away! Stay there and watch as the sugar slowly browns the top. If the layer of sugar was light and you want to make it a little browner, repeat with another dusting of sugar and another minute under the broiler. Allow them to rest a few minutes, then transfer them to a serving platter, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43152,&quot;Brownie Rubble 2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the pan 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 2 cups sugar 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 4 large eggs, cold 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup mini marshmallows 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips 3/4 cup unsalted roasted peanuts Instructions: Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with foil, pressing it into the corners and up the sides; leave an overhang on 2 sides. Butter the foil and dust with flour. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 400 degrees F. Bring 1 inch water to a gentle simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Put the chocolate and 2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons butter in a heatproof bowl; set the bowl over the saucepan (do not let the bowl touch the water). Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove the bowl from the saucepan. Add the sugar, cocoa and salt to the bowl and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition, until the batter is thick and shiny. Add the vanilla, then add 1 cup flour and mix until combined. Spread in the prepared pan. Bake the brownies until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few crumbs, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and scatter the marshmallows, chocolate chips and peanuts on top.

In a large stockpot, combine the turkey wings, onions, carrots, garlic, rutabaga, celery, bay leaves, and 1 gallon cold water (or enough to cover by at least 3 inches). Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes, skimming when you feel like it to remove any impurities that float to the top. Remove from the heat and strain into a large pot or bowl, pressing on the vegetables and meat to extract as much flavor as possible. Discard the vegetables, turkey, and herbs. Cool the broth to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator, or chill it down over ice first. When chilled, skim the surface again for any additional impurities. This can be done up to 3 days in advance. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Toss the pumpkin in a large mixing bowl with the 1/4 cup olive oil, nutmeg, minced sage, salt, and lots of pepper. Dump the pumpkin onto a cookie sheet, spread it out to a single layer, and roast for 45 minutes or until very tender. Now that you&#39;ve got the elements, you can put the soup together. Put a large stockpot over medium-low heat. Heat the 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, add the whole sage leaves, and saute for 1 minute. Add the pancetta and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to render out some of that delicious fat. Toss in the minced garlic and onion and cook for 2 minutes or until the onion is translucent. Add the cabbage and cook, stirring, for 3 to 5 minutes or until the cabbage is wilted. Pour the strained, cooled broth into the pot and bring to a gentle simmer. Taste the soup and then season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with several pieces of pumpkin and a drizzle of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43155,&quot;Fresh Salmon Latkes 3/4 pound salmon fillet, cut into 6 pieces 1/2 lemon, thinly sliced 1 egg 1/2 cup milk 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper 6 tablespoons butter or vegetable oil Lemon wedges Optional garnish: Cucumber and Red Onion Salad (recipe follows Instructions: Place the salmon pieces in a deep, medium-sized skillet or shallow saucepan. Pour in enough boiling water to almost cover fish. Add lemon slices. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 10 minutes, or until salmon is opaque in center when flaked. Remove salmon with a slotted spatula. Remove the skin and bones and flake fish into a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg and milk. Add flour, baking powder, salt and pepper. Whisk just until blended. Pour batter over cooked salmon. Stir gently to mix. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour batter, 1/4 cup for each latke, into the hot butter. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook latkes until nicely browned and crisp on bottom, about 4 minutes. Turn over and cook until second side is crisp and browned, about 2 minutes longer. Repeat in 1 or 2 more batches to use remaining batter, adding more butter as needed. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm, with lemon wedges. Garnish with Cucumber and Red Onion Salad, if desired &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43156,&quot;Poached Garlic Soup 2 cups garlic cloves 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup diced onion (1/4-inch dice) 1 cup finely chopped leek, white part only 1/2 cup diced celery (1/4-inch dice) 1 bay leaf 1 tablespoon grey salt 1 cup diced, peeled, russet potatoes Freshly ground pepper 4 to 5 cups chicken stock or canned low salt chicken broth 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh oregano leaves 4 cups roughly chopped spinach leaves 1 cup heavy cream Instructions: Peel the garlic cloves, cut in half lengthwise, and remove the central greenish core. Put in a small pan of salted water and bring to a boil. Drain and repeat twice to remove the garlic&#39;s heat and leave only the sweetness behind. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat until hot. Add the onion, leek, celery, bay leaf, and a little salt to draw the water out of the onion. Cover and cook until the vegetables are soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Add the potatoes. Add the blanched garlic and stock. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook until the vegetables are very tender, about 15 minutes. Remove soup from the heat and cool to room temperature. Place cooled pot with soup in refrigerator to chill. Day of party re-heat soup over medium heat. Add the oregano, spinach, and cream and cook 1 minute to wilt the spinach. Transfer to blender and carefully blend until smooth *see note below. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 43157,&quot;Baked Spinach Ricotta Tart 30 ounces whole milk ricotta cheese (4 cups) 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) butter, cut into l/2inch pieces and chilled 5 tablespoons ice water 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound spinach, stemmed and cleaned 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup peeled and diced onion 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh marjoram, minced 1/4 pound prosciutto, diced (1 cup) 3 large eggs 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Instructions: Place the ricotta in a strainer lined with cheesecloth and allow to drain over a bowl, covered and refrigerated, for 2 hours. To prepare the tart dough, combine the flour and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt in a bowl. Add the chilled butter and, using your fingertips or two knives, blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Work in the ice water until the dough holds together. Form the dough into a smooth, flat disk, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Lightly flour a clean work surface and roll the dough into a 16inch disk. Place the rolled out dough into a 10- by 2 1/2-inch deep cake pan or springform mold. Pressing with your fingertips, flute the top edges of the dough. Place in the freezer and chill thoroughly, about 30 minutes. In a medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over high heat and saute the spinach, stirring constantly until wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and half the pepper. Place the cooked spinach in a colander and drain. Chop fine and reserve. In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon olive oil and cook the onion 3 to 5 minutes over medium heat until translucent. Add the marjoram and prosciutto. Stir and cook an additional 2 minutes. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and add the drained ricotta, spinach, onion, and prosciutto. Season with the nutmeg and remaining salt and pepper. Set aside. Line the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill with dried beans or pastry weights. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the dough is set. Remove the foil and beans and cook an additional 10 minutes, or until the dough is light brown. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees. Spread the ricotta and spinach mixture evenly in the tart, place on the middle rack of&#39; the oven, and bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, until the filling is set and the top golden brown. Let rest for 15 to 20 minutes, slice into wedges, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 43158,&quot;Gumdrop and Pistachio Nougat Nonstick cooking spray 1 1 /2 cups small lemon, orange and strawberry gumdrops 3 large egg whites 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 3 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 3/4 cup honey 1/4 cup light corn syrup 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Zest of 1 naval orange (about 1/2 tablespoon) 1 cup roasted salted pistachios, chopped Instructions: Line an 8-by-11-inch baking pan with plastic wrap and spray the wrap liberally with cooking spray.

Grind to a powder, then pour into a large non-reactive bowl (stainless steel is best because turmeric can stain ceramics). Add the garlic and the ginger to the mortar. Sprinkle with a little kosher salt and pound away until a relatively smooth paste forms. (If you don&#39;t have a pestle and mortar then finely mince the ginger.) Scrape the ginger-garlic paste into the large bowl with the caraway seeds. Add the yogurt, 1 teaspoon of salt, turmeric, cayenne pepper and garam masala and whisk all together. Add the lamb and toss until all the pieces are well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, place it in the refrigerator and let it marinate up to overnight. When you&#39;re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pull out the lamb and let it come to room temperature. Meanwhile, get going on the onions. Warm the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the onions and stir so they&#39;re thoroughly coated with oil. Let them sit about 5 minutes or so, until the onions around the perimeter begin to brown. Stir, redistribute, and allow to sit another 5 minutes or so. Repeat this process until the onions are evenly browned, about 20 minutes in total. Reduce the heat to low and cook another 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are a deep chestnut brown (not burnt!) and slightly crispy. Using a slotted spoon, remove the onions to a paper towel-lined plate and drain. (You can strain the oil and use it to cook your next batch of vegetables!). Add the onions to the lamb along with the milk and the dried apricot halves. Stir to combine evenly, then pour into a medium baking dish that holds the lamb in a single, even layer (an 8-inch square or an 8-inch by 10 1/2-inch dish works well as does an oval dish). Cover firmly with foil, and pop into the oven for 1 1/2 hours, rotating the dish halfway through the cooking time, uncover for another 30 minutes of cook time. Sprinkle with almonds and serve with crusty bread or naan. Combine the cinnamon sticks, cloves, green cardamom seeds, black cardamom seeds, if using, in a spice grinder or coffee grinder and grind until fine. Store the spice mix in an airtight container away from direct sunlight.<br> In a large glass, dissolve the dry yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar with 3/4 cup warm water (about 100 degrees F). Let it sit on your counter until it&#39;s frothy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, sift the flour, salt, remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar and baking powder into a large, deep bowl. Once the yeast is frothy, add the yogurt and the olive oil into the glass, and stir to combine. Pour the yogurt mixture into the dry ingredients and add the kalonji and fennel seeds, if using, and gently mix the ingredients together with a fork. When the dough is about to come together, use your hands to mix. It will feel like there isn&#39;t enough flour at first, but keep going until it transforms into a soft, slightly sticky and pliable dough. As soon as it comes together, stop kneading. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let it sit in a warm, draft-free place for 2 to 4 hours. When you&#39;re ready to roll, make sure you have two bowls on your counter: one with extra flour in it, and one with water. The dough will be extremely soft and sticky-this is good! Separate the dough into 6 equal portions and lightly roll each one in the bowl of extra flour to keep them from sticking to each other. Shape the naan. Using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a teardrop shape, narrower at the top than at the bottom. It should be 8 to 9-inches long, 4-inches wide at its widest point and about 1/4-inch thick. Once you&#39;ve formed the general shape, you can also pick it up by one end and wiggle it; the dough&#39;s own weight will stretch it out a little. Repeat this method with the rest of the dough. (If you&#39;re making the gluten-free version, you&#39;ll have better luck pressing the dough out with your fingertips, than rolling.) Warm a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until it&#39;s nearly smoking. Make sure you have a lid large enough to fit the skillet and have a bowl of melted butter at the ready. Dampen your hands in the bowl of water and pick up one of your naans, flip-flopping it from one hand to the other to lightly dampen it. Gently lay it in the skillet, and set your timer for 1 minute. The dough should start to bubble. After about 1 minute, flip the naan. It should be blistered and somewhat blackened, don&#39;t worry - that&#39;s typical of traditional naan! Cover the skillet with the lid and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute more. Remove the naan from the skillet, brush with a bit of butter and sprinkle with a little coarse sea salt. Place the naan in a tea towel-lined dish. Repeat with the rest of the naans and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo]&quot; 43164,&quot;Bay Scallop Ceviche 3/4 pound bay scallops (or sea scallops, cut in quarters), muscles removed 3/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, divided (5 limes) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup (1/2 to 3/4-inch diced) hothouse cucumber, unpeeled and seeded 1/2 cup halved and thinly sliced shallots (2 shallots) 3 tablespoons diagonally sliced scallions, white and green parts 1/2 Hass avocado, 3/4-inch diced 1/2 cup Holland red bell pepper, 1/2 to 3/4-inch diced 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley 1 1/2 tablespoons minced jalapeno pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic (2 cloves) Good olive oil 1/4 teaspoon Sriracha Bibb lettuce leaves, for serving Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the scallops, 1/2 cup of the lime juice, and 1 teaspoon salt and set aside at room temperature for exactly 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

When the oil begins to swirl, add the ground pork, salt and ginger. Break the pork up with a spoon and stir while browning. When the pork is cooked through and golden, add the garlic, scallions, bean sprouts and peas. Stir and cook for a minute or so more, then push it to the side and add a bit more oil, if needed. Add the rice and quickly stir to heat and toast the rice. Once a crust has formed on some of the rice, add the soy sauce and chili sauce. Season with more salt, if needed. Incorporate the rice with the rest of the ingredients in the pan. Once combined, push to the sides and add the eggs to the center, allowing the eggs to curdle lightly. Rapidly stir the rice in to coat while the eggs are cooking. The eggs act as glue instead of being left as big curds separated from the rice. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately. Rinse the rice 3 times to remove the starch. Put the rice in a medium saucepan. Fill the saucepan with enough water to cover the rice by 1/2-inch.

Combine the blue gelatin with the boiling water in a small bowl and mix until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Pour 1/4 cup of the gelatin into a second bowl and mix in the black food coloring. Set the remaining blue gelatin aside. Pour the black gelatin into the prepared bowl. Place in the refrigerator to set, about 30 minutes. Use a 2 1/4-inch round cutter to cut the gelatin into a circle and carefully remove the excess gelatin from around the outside of the cutter to leave a \\pupil\\ in the bottom of the bowl. Discard the excess gelatin. Pour 1/4 cup blue gelatin into the bowl over the black pupil (if the blue gelatin has set before pouring, pop it in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds to loosen it). You will have some excess blue gelatin. Place the bowl back in the refrigerator to set another 30 minutes. For the eyeball and crust: Combine the cheesecake mixes and milk in a large bowl. Blend with an electric mixer until thick but still pourable, about 2 minutes. Pour the batter into the bowl over the pupil and iris. Gently drop the bowl on your counter a few times to release any air bubbles. Place in the refrigerator and let set for 1 hour. Meanwhile, mix together the melted butter and red gel food coloring and whisk to ensure that the food coloring is completely blended into the butter. Combine the sugar, red melted butter and 2 bags of the crushed graham crackers that came with the no-bake cheesecake mix in a bowl and mix with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until the graham cracker crumbs are colored red, about 2 minutes. Remove the eyeball from the refrigerator and press the crust on top. Place the entire eyeball cake back in the refrigerator to let the crust harden, about 1 hour. To plate and garnish: Place a large round plate or platter over the bowl with the eyeball cake. Flip the bowl over so the bowl is on top of the plate. Gently tap the bowl and plate on the counter to help release the eyeball. Gently remove the bowl to reveal the eyeball cake (if the cake does not release from the bowl, dip the bowl in warm water to help it loosen). Use the red writing gel to make branching lines around the eye to resemble the veins of a bloodshot eye. Spoon the cherry pie filling around the entire base of the eyeball (you may not use the whole can). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43174,&quot;Bowl Smoked Shrimp 2 quarts wood chips 1/2 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup sugar 2 cups water 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 quart ice 2 pounds jumbo whole shrimp (21-25 count), rinsed thoroughly and drained 2 quarts all-natural chunk charcoal Spicy Brown Mustard Dipping Sauce, recipe follows 1/4 cup brown mustard seed 1/4 cup dry mustard powder 2 tablespoons water 1/3 cup cider vinegar 1/3 cup white wine vinegar 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon brown sugar 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 cup olive oil Instructions: Place the wood chips into a bowl and cover with cool water. Set aside and allow to soak for 1 hour. In the meantime, place the salt, sugar, water and red pepper flakes into an electric kettle and heat just until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Turn the kettle off and add the ice. Stir until the brine has cooled. Place the shrimp into a 1-gallon ziptop bag and pour over the brine. Place in a container and set in the refrigerator until the wood chips are done soaking, approximately 45 more minutes. While the shrimp are brining, heat about 2 quarts of charcoal in a chimney starter until the coals are covered with a white ash. After the chips are done soaking, drain them and set aside. Drain the shrimp in a colander and thread on 4 to 6 rounded skewers. Carefully transfer the charcoal to a large, 18-inch round, stainless steel bowl. Cover the charcoal with the wood chips. Lay the skewered shrimp directly atop the chips making sure that the shrimp do not come in direct contact with the charcoal and that the shrimp are in 1 layer. Turn another, smaller (13 to 14-inch) metal bowl upside down on top of the shrimp. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through. Serve warm or chilled. In a small bowl whisk together the mustard seed, dry mustard and water. Place the mustard and water mixture into a small saucepan and add the remaining ingredients. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Do not allow to boil. Remove from the heat and puree with a handheld blender for 5 to 10 seconds while drizzling with oil, leaving some of the seeds intact if desired. Pour into a glass jar or container, allow to cool, cover and allow to sit in refrigerator overnight before using. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. While oven is preheating, use a chef&#39;s knife to chip chocolate off the block, or crush pistoles into small pieces. This is a fun step that creates a lot of chocolate shavings that can be fun for guests to help clean up by eating. The irregular shapes are good too because they create depth of flavor in the final product due to varying masses of chocolate tucked away in the burrito&#39;s rolls. Zest the lemon and set aside. Mincing is not necessary. Crush the walnuts between your palms or gently break with a rolling pin in a towel. Set aside. Put granulated sugar in a bowl for sprinkling onto the burrito. Spread 1 phyllo sheet on a baking sheet and brush with melted butter. Top with another phyllo sheet and brush it with butter. Top with a last sheet, but don&#39;t butter it on top. I just use 3 sheets but if you like thicker burritos, sprinkle on sugar and add 3 more sheets after brushing on the butter. Sprinkle on chocolate, zest, and nuts, to taste. Be sure to allow room for rolling without bursting the roll. Sugar isn&#39;t really necessary inside the roll but a little can be nice. Roll up the dessert just like a burrito: tuck in sides toward the front then roll up. Also, a straight roll like sushi is fine. Sprinkle phyllo with sugar, put on a baking sheet (no greasing or parchment necessary), and bake for 5 to 8 minutes until just barely browned. Remove, wait 5 minutes, then cut into bite size pieces with a sharp knife.

Drain and squeeze the noodles to get rid of the excess water. Bring a pot filled with water to a boil over high heat. Place the rice vermicelli in a sieve and lower it into the boiling water for 5 seconds. Remove the vermicelli and transfer to a bowl. When cool enough to handle, divide the vermicelli into 12 equal portions. In the same boiling water, cook the shrimp until they turn opaque, about 1 minute. When cool enough to handle, cut in half lengthwise and de-vein. Pour lukewarm water, about 1 inch deep, into a square or rectangular dish. Separate and soak 4 wrappers at a time until pliable, about 5 minutes. Place a clean kitchen towel on your work surface, then place each rice paper on the towel. With another kitchen towel, gently blot each wrapper until it is no longer wet but remain sticky. Leaving 1 inch uncovered on the side closest to you and the adjacent sides, place a lettuce leaf, vermicelli portion on top, 3 shrimp halves (overlapped), 2 avocado and 2 mango slices (overlapped), 2 mint leaves, and some cilantro sprigs. Fold wrapper once over the filling, then fold in the sides, and continue rolling tightly to the end. Repeat this process with the remaining ingredients to make 12 rolls. Wrap in a damp towel or with plastic wrap until ready to eat. Serve with cl-Mint Dipping Sauce. Combine all ingredients when syrup is cold.

For the topping: In a pan, melt the butter and add the pecans, corn syrup and vanilla. Let the mixture bubble up for a minute, then remove from the heat. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the mixture into each cup of three 24-hole mini-muffin tins. For the rolls: Roll out each piece of dough into a 6-by-24-inch rectangle (should roll out very thin!). Pour a third of the melted butter on each piece, then sprinkle a third of the sugar and a third of the cinnamon evenly over each surface. Starting at the far end of one piece, roll the dough into a long log, rolling toward you. You&#39;ll end up with a 24-inch log. With a sharp knife, cut into very thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Lay the sliced rolls into the muffin tins on top of the pecan mixture, tucking the tails under and patting them firmly on top of the topping. Bake until golden brown, 12 to 13 minutes. Turn out the rolls from the pans immediately. Invert carefully, so that the rolls turn out and the pecans stay stuck to the bottoms (which are now the tops!). If a little of the pecans stick in the tins, just dig them out with a spoon and reapply them to the rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 43180,&quot;Chocolate Truffles 1/2 pound semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 to 2 tablespoons dark rum, Grand Marnier, Bourbon, or other liquor 1/4 to 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa, confectioners&#39; sugar, sweetened ground chocolate, or finely chopped nuts Instructions: Put the chocolate in a bowl. In a small saucepan or microwave, heat the cream to a boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate and shake the bowl gently to settle the cream. Cover with a plate or lid and set aside until the chocolate melts, about 5 minutes. Whisk the mixture until smooth and shiny. Stir in the rum or other flavoring. Cover the surface of the chocolate with plastic wrap. Set aside in a cool place until the chocolate firms up, about 2 hours. (To speed this up set the bowl of chocolate over another bowl of ice and stir until the desired consistency.) Line a baking sheet with waxed or parchment paper. Use 2 spoons to drop small mounds/balls of chocolate, about 1/2 to 1-inch high on the paper (depending on the size you want). Then chill your hands under a faucet of running cold water or by using an ice bath. Roll each chocolate mound between your open palms to make smooth round balls.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Heat the olive oil in an 11-by-15-inch flame-proof roasting pan over medium-high heat until shimmering, swirling to coat the pan. Add the brisket, fat-side down, and sear until browned and some fat is rendered, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and sear on the other side for about 4 minutes longer. Remove the brisket from the pan, add the apples and onions and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until the apples are slightly browned and the onions just begin to soften, about 4 minutes.<br> Turn off the heat. Add the garlic and bay leaf to the pan and toss to combine. Clear a spot in the center and return the brisket fat-side up to the pan. Add the pomegranate juice; it will reach about three-quarters up the sides of the brisket. Cover the pan with a layer of parchment and then cover tightly with aluminum foil (see Cook&#39;s Note). Bake for 90 minutes.<br> Remove the pan from the oven. Carefully peel back the foil and parchment at the far end of the pan (not the side closest to you) to avoid being scalded by steam escaping from the pan. Flip the brisket over, fat-side down, and sprinkle the dried cherries evenly around the brisket. Cover tightly again and braise until the brisket is very tender but holds together when sliced, about 90 minutes more.<br> Carefully remove the brisket and let it rest on a cutting board. Transfer as much of the fruits and vegetables from the pan to a large bowl with a slotted spoon. Strain the braising liquid into a large saucepan and bring to a rapid boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by one-third, about 10 minutes. You should have about 3 cups. Pour it into a large glass measuring cup and let sit until the fat rises to the surface.<br> Meanwhile, for the sweet-and-spicy zhug: Place the cl peppers in a food processor followed by the cilantro, parsley, olive oil, pomegranate molasses, cumin, coriander, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt. Pulse until combined, 4 to 5 times, then scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and process until smooth and fully combined, about 2 minutes. The sauce should be the consistency of pesto. Taste and add more salt if needed. Makes about 1 and 1/2 cups.<br> Slice the brisket across the grain and shingle it onto a serving platter, tucking the apples, onions and dried cherries around the meat. Skim off and discard the fat from the braising liquid and pour about 1 1/2 cups over the brisket. Sprinkle all over with the pomegranate seeds.

Cut a piece of foil 9- by 23-inches. Butter the corners and sides of a 9- by 9-inch baking pan. Line the pan with the foil, leaving an overhang on two sides. Fold the overhanging foil to make them doubly thick. (This will make it easier to lift the bar out of the pan.) For the topping: Whisk the coconut cream with the egg white and vanilla in a medium bowl. Toss the shredded coconut with the flour in another medium bowl. Stir the shredded coconut mixture into the coconut cream mixture. Set aside. For the base: Whisk the flour with the cocoa powder and salt in a small bowl. Put the cookie dough on a clean work surface and dump the flour mixture on top. Knead the flour mixture and dough together until it is dark and homogenous. Sprinkle a little extra flour on the work surface, and use a rolling pin to gently press and roll the dough into a 7- or 8-inch square; don&#39;t worry if it cracks a bit. Put the dough in the prepared pan, using your fingers to press it evenly into the sides and corners. Scatter the coconut topping evenly over the base, making sure you cover the edges well and being sure not to press down so that the coconut mixture lies on top of the dough. Scatter the chocolate on top and press it lightly into the coconut. Bake until the coconut is a toasted golden brown, the topping seems dry and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool completely on a rack before gently lifting out of the pan by the overhanging foil, about 20 minutes. Slice into 16 square bars. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 43188,&quot;Moist and Savory Stuffing 2? cups Swanson?

Heat oil in a fryer or heavy-bottomed Dutch oven to 356 degrees F. Fry the potatoes in batches until golden and crispy, about 3 minutes. Drain well, transfer to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes in 8-ounce portions on 2 sheet trays (3 portions will fit on each tray). Top each portion with 2 to 3 ounces of the cl Braised Beef and 2 to 3 ounces of the shredded cheese. Bake until the cheese is melted and lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. Using a spatula, transfer the potatoes to a serving dish. Garnish each portion with parsley, bacon and 4 or 5 cloves of the simmered garlic. Serve with the gravy on the side. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat a large roasting pan over high heat, then add the oil. Season all sides of the beef liberally with salt and pepper. Sear the roast well on all sides. Transfer to a plate. Add the garlic, celery, carrots and onions to the pan. Season with salt and pepper while stirring. When vegetables color slightly, add the tomatoes and stir for 1 to 2 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine and reduce. Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add the oregano, thyme, red pepper flakes and bay leaves. Turn off the heat and place the roast in the liquid. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and foil. Place the pan in the oven and braise until it is fall-apart tender, 4 to 4 1/2 hours. (Check it at 4 hours.) Your kitchen will smell fantastic. Transfer the roast to a large bowl, then strain the braising liquid into a 4-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat and reduce until it becomes thick and syrupy, about 30 minutes. Keep a close eye on the reduction near the end to prevent it from burning. Meanwhile, shred the beef, removing any fat and connective tissue. Add the finished reduction to the shredded beef and mix well. Heat a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat, then add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the onions, oregano and thyme and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium and stir until the onions are light brown. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and deglaze with the wine. Pour in the chicken stock, increase the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Whisk in the beef base, balsamic vinegar and tamari, then simmer for 10 minutes. Strain out the solids, return the liquid to the pot and bring back to simmer. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/2 cup oil into the flour to make a roux. Add the roux to the simmering liquid while whisking vigorously. Simmer over medium-low heat for 10 to 20 minutes, skimming off any surface foam that develops.

Lift the chocolate-covered paper by its corners and move it to a clean space on your work surface. Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate will be firm enough to cut but it will not be hard. Using the tip of a sharp paring knife or an X-acto knife, cut a square. This will be the base of your game board, so determine how large you would like it to be before you begin cutting. For the Squares: Place a sheet of acetate or parchment on your work surface with the long side facing you. Using an offset spatula, spread a 1/4-inch layer of bittersweet chocolate onto the acetate and wait until it begins to set. Using a rolling cutter or a hot, sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut the sheet of chocolate into squares. The quantity and size of the squares depends upon how large you have cut your base and how many squares you would like to have on your game board. When the chocolate has set, carefully peel away the acetate. It should release from the chocolate quite easily. Repeat this process using the white chocolate. For the Frame: Start by drizzling both white and milk chocolate onto parchment paper. Dip your clean, dry fingers into the bowl of bittersweet chocolate and spread it over the drizzles, creating a marbled effect. When you initially drizzle the milk and white chocolate, make sure you are working with enough chocolate so that the result will be at least 1/4-inch thick/high. (Despite the fact that the size of the game board is your creative decision, the thickness must be at least 1/4-inch, as it will break easily if it is any thinner.) Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate will be firm enough to cut but it will not be hard. Using the tip of a sharp paring knife or an X-acto knife, cut four pieces. The length should be the same as the four sides of your base and the width should be as determined by you. Using a mitre box if you have one or a knife if not, angle each corner so they fit together when assembling. For the Feet: Place a sheet of parchment on your work surface with the long side facing you. Using an offset spatula, spread a 1/4-inch layer of milk chocolate onto the acetate sheet. Wait until the chocolate begins to set. Using a hot sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut 8 squares appropriately sized to your game board. When the chocolate has set, carefully peel away the sheet. It should release from the chocolate quite easily. Use more chocolate to glue two squares together, making a 1/2-inch-thick foot. Repeat with the other squares. Glue them into place on each corner of the base of the game board. To assemble, glue down the chocolate squares on top of the footed base, alternating white and dark. Place the frame along the outer edge of the base and glue on with chocolate. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 43218,&quot;Cheese and Ham Board Soft cheese, such as fresh goat cheese Good olive oil Fresh basil, cut Hard cheese Blue cheese Grapes Fig jam Fig ball, sliced in half 6 thick slices smoked ham English honey mustard English water crackers Crisps Baguette, sliced Instructions: Place the fresh goat cheese in a small canning jar, drizzle olive oil over the top and sprinkle with basil.

Make a well in the center of the flour and add the tomatoes, egg, and salt. Combine together and knead until the mixture becomes an even dough. If the mixture becomes too wet, add more flour, if it becomes too dry, add more tomato juice. Sprinkle the work surface with a little flour. Cut a quarter of the dough and roll the dough flat. Cut the dough into strips 1/2-inch wide and then each strip about 2 to 3-inches long. Using your thumb and index finger, gently pinch the width of the dough strip, and then roll out. Repeat the above process until all the dough is used up. Cover up any excess dough with a cloth to prevent it from drying, if you are not using it immediately. Put the dough-strips on a lightly floured board and then add to a pot of boiling salted water. Stir to prevent the pasta from sticking together and drain when the pasta floats to the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup pasta water. To make the sauce: Add the olive oil, chopped rosemary, and Parmigiano cheese to a cold saucepan. Add the cooked strozzapreti to the saucepan with a 1/4 cup pasta water and mix well. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Aglianico]&quot; 43222,&quot;Lemon Chicken Soup and Salad 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 5 scallions, chopped (white and green parts separated) 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1/2 cup white rice 1 bunch baby carrots (about 4 ounces), cut into chunks 1 bunch baby turnips (about 4 ounces), quartered lengthwise Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 2 large eggs 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken, skin removed 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (optional) 8 cups salad greens Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.

Whisk to combine. Using a sharp knife, score several diagonal lines along the length of fish, down to spine, on either side. Place fish in pan and marinate 2 - 4 hours at room temperature. After marination, preheat grill or broiler. Blanch greens in a large pot of boiling, salted water, just until the water returns to a boil. Refresh in ice water and drain. On a large baking sheet, arrange greens, overlapping, to form a rectangle as long as the fish and twice as wide as the fish. Place fish in middle and wrap the greens over so only the head and tail are exposed. Seal with a piece of butchers string or dental floss. Place fish on grill. Cook 7 - 12 minutes per side, until greens, head and tail blacken. It will take 2 spatulas, one at the head and one at the tail, to turn fish, don&#39;t be concerned about greens sticking. To test for doneness, try pulling out a dorsal fin from the top of the fish. If it slides out easily, it&#39;s done. To serve, place the whole fish on a serving platter. Using a dull knife and soup spoon, scrape of any remaining skin and remove fins. Spoon half reserved marinade over top. Cut along spine first and serve the top fillet. Lift tail, insert knife between bones and flesh, and run it along the length. All, or most, of the bones should easily lift out. Spoon on remaining marinade and serve second fillet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 43228,&quot;Grilled Skirt Steak with Sticky Barbecue Onions 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 yellow onions, thinly sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 ounces ketchup 2 ounces apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 teaspoon cayenne 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 2 pounds skirt steak, cleaned Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the cutting board 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves, finely chopped 1 teaspoon sweet paprika Instructions: Prepare a grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. For the sticky barbecue onions: Heat a cast-iron skillet over direct heat. Melt the butter. Add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook until they begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the ketchup, vinegar, mustard, sugar, cayenne, cumin and paprika in a small bowl (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add the sauce to the onions. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid reduces and begins to get sticky, 8 to 10 minutes. Move over indirect heat to keep warm while you cook your steak. For the steak: Sprinkle the steak with salt and pepper on both sides and bring to room temperature. Drizzle the steak with the oil and sprinkle with the oregano and paprika on both sides. Place the steak over direct heat and cook until it gets a nice char, 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Add a splash of oil, a pinch of salt and some pepper to a cutting board. Place the steak on the seasoned oil on the cutting board, flip and rest 5 minutes. Slice the steak against the grain and serve topped with the onions. (Alternatively, you can cook the onions over medium-high heat on a stovetop, and the steak in a grill pan or cast-iron skillet over high heat on a stovetop.) &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 43229,&quot;Full Irish Breakfast One 13-ounce can English-style baked beans, such as Heinz beans with tomato sauce 2 tablespoons Irish butter, plus more softened, for serving 1 1/2 cups quartered white button mushrooms Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large ripe plum tomato, cut crosswise into 4 slices 2 slices Irish bacon (back bacon), Canadian bacon or American-style bacon (about 3 ounces) 2 white pudding sausages (about 4 ounces), pricked with a fork in several places 2 black pudding/blood sausage patties (about 2 ounces) 4 slices whole grain or black bread 4 large eggs Bitter orange marmalade, for serving Brewed Irish breakfast tea, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Pour this mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer. Finishing the dough: With the stand mixer running on low, add the olive oil, then the egg. Slowly, pour in the water. Here&#39;s the important part: gluten-free pizza dough will not look the same as gluten dough. It will be far wetter, even a little like pancake batter. As you pour the water, look for the dough to come together around the paddle. However, when your turn off the mixer, the dough should slump off the paddle immediately. Letting the dough rise: Scrape the pizza dough into a large greased bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and set the bowl in a warm place. Gluten-free dough does not rise as much as gluten dough. Instead, you are looking for the dough to hydrate fully and increase in size by about one-third. When the dough has risen a bit and has the texture of traditional dough, about 1 1/2 hours, you&#39;re ready to bake. Preparing to bake: Heat the oven to 500 degrees F. If you have a pizza stone - and we recommend you do - put it in the oven now. If you own a pizza peel, lay down a piece of parchment paper on it now. If you don&#39;t own one, put the parchment paper on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Put the dough down on the parchment paper then top it with another one the same size. Using your hands or a rolling pin, flatten the dough slowly and evenly. You want a pizza dough about 12 inches in diameter. Take the top piece of parchment paper off the pizza dough. Sprinkle some olive oil over the top of the dough. Bake the dough in the oven until the edges are starting to brown and crisp and the top of the pizza is a little firm to the touch, 5 to 8 minutes. Pull out the pizza dough and top with whatever toppings you desire. Pour all the flours into a large container. (Restaurant supply stores sell large plastic containers that fit this purpose well. You could also use a large glass jar.) Shake and shake and shake harder until all the flours have become one color. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 43234,&quot;Salt-and-Vinegar Fish Sticks 1 10-ounce bag salt-and-vinegar potato chips (about 10 cups), finely crushed 1/3 cup all-purpose flour<br> Kosher salt Large pinch of cayenne pepper 2 large eggs 2 tablespoons tartar sauce 2 pounds haddock or pollock fillets, pin bones removed, cut into 1-inch-wide strips Vegetable oil, for frying Lemon wedges and/or malt vinegar, for serving Instructions: Combine the crushed chips with the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the cayenne pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk the eggs, tartar sauce and 3 tablespoons water in another shallow bowl. One at a time, dredge each fish strip in the potato chip mixture, turning to coat, then dip in the egg mixture and dredge again in the potato chip mixture. Place on a baking sheet until ready to fry. Fill a large skillet about halfway with vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the fish, turning, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. (Let the oil return to 350 degrees F between batches.) Drain on paper towels and season with salt.

Mix in the vinegar, and then blend in the olive oil. Transfer the mixture to a large shallow earthenware dish, and place the lamb in the marinade, turning to evenly coat all the chunks. Marinate at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours. Remove the lamb from the marinade with a slotted spoon, reserving 1/2 cup of the marinade. In a large heavy casserole, heat the 3 tablespoons olive oil over high heat. Brown the lamb, turning with tongs to sear all sides evenly. This will take about 20 minutes (if the lamb does not fit all in one layer, brown in 2 batches, otherwise the meat will steam rather than sear). Transfer the lamb to a plate with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the jalapenos, onions, and salt. Saute, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, or until the onions are golden. Add the beer and lower the heat so that the liquid is simmering. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until all of the beer has evaporated. Return the browned lamb, along with the accumulated juices from the plate, to the pan. Add the stock and stir to mix. Bring up to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the dish, covered, for about I hour and 20 minutes, or until the meat is tender. Add the potatoes, cover the pan again and cook for about 20 minutes more, or until the potatoes are tender (you may need to add a little more stock or water to keep them from scorching). Add the reserved 1/2 cup of the marinade and the cilantro, stir to mix, and cook for 1 minute more.

Add in the milk and mix well. There&#39;s empty crust leftover, which you can discard or just pop in your mouth. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and boil some water. Spray 2 ramekins with cooking spray to prevent sticking. This preparation needs to happen first, because the next part is a little time sensitive. Put the sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. This will begin the caramelization process as it melts down to syrupy consistency-about 10 minutes. Stir it frequently until it becomes brownish in color, and then immediately pour a layer of it in each ramekin before it starts solidifying as it cools. Then top each ramekin with the pumpkin mixture. Place the ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet, and then pour about a 1/2-inch layer of boiling water into the sheet to ensure even baking. Bake for 20 minutes. After baking, let the ramekins cool, and then refrigerate them for a couple of hours until they&#39;re cold. Place a plate over each ramekin and then flip the two upside down so you can slowly lift the ramekin to reveal the flan inside.

Add the salt and stir well. Trim the eggplants, slicing off the very top and bottom, and then peel them. Cut them, crosswise, into about 5 slices each. Each slice should be about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches thick. Put the slices into the salty water as you cut them. The slices will float. Upturn a plate on top of the slices and balance a weight (such as a clean glass jar filled with water) on top of the plate. Set aside for 3 to 10 hours. Remove the slices from the water and pat them dry. Pour about enough oil into a large pan to come to a depth of 3/4 inches, and set over medium heat. Allow time for the oil to get very hot, then put in as many eggplant slices as the pan will hold in a single layer and fry for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until reddish-gold. Remove to a large plate or tray lined with a double thickness of paper towels. Fry all the eggplant slices this way, adding more oil, if needed, and using as many plates or trays as you see fit. I like to change the paper towels at least once. I also pat the tops of the slices with more paper towel. The eggplants may now be set aside for 3 to 4 hours, if desired. To make the Tomato-chickpea sauce: Either use 3 tablespoons from the frying oil or, if you prefer, fresh oil, and pour it into a large, lidded pan. Set the pan over medium-high heat, and, when the oil is very hot, put in the chiles and mustard seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop, a matter of seconds, add the garlic. Stir quickly once, then put in the tomatoes, curry leaves, chickpeas, salt, cumin, coriander, and turmeric. Stir and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently for 20 minutes. Remove the chiles before serving. To make the yogurt sauce: Put the yogurt in a small bowl and beat lightly with a fork or small whisk until smooth. Stir in the salt and cumin. Cover and refrigerate, if not using within 2 hours. To make the tamarind chutney: Combine the tamarind paste, sugar, salt, and cumin in a small cup. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate, if not using within 2 hours. To prepare the dish: When ready to serve, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spread out the eggplant slices in a single layer on a baking tray and dust very lightly with salt and black pepper. Place in the oven and heat through, about 15 minutes. If oil accumulates at the bottom of the tray, pour it out. Heat the tomato-chickpea sauce. Arrange the eggplant slices on a very large platter in a single layer. Pour a small ladleful of the tomato-chickpea sauce on top of each slice. Center 2 tablespoons of the yogurt sauce on top of the tomato-chickpea sauce and then put a generous dot of the tamarind chutney on top of the yogurt. Garnish with mint leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo]&quot; 43248,&quot;Lemony Chicken 1 quart buttermilk 1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 1 lemon) 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, tenders removed, cut in strips 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup cornstarch Vegetable oil, for frying 1 (11-ounce) jar lemon curd 1/4 cup chicken broth 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce Instructions: Add enough oil to cover the bottom of a large frying pan by 1/4 to 1/2-inch depth. Heat oil to 365 degrees F. Meanwhile, whisk buttermilk and zest together in a medium bowl. Add chicken and set aside. Sift together flour and cornstarch into a shallow dish. Remove chicken from buttermilk mixture and dredge in flour mixture. Fry chicken strips until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip chicken and continue cooking another 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. While chicken is frying, make the sauce. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt lemon curd, stirring constantly. Add remaining ingredients and heat through. Drizzle sauce over chicken and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43249,&quot;Name This Dish Cheese Ball 4 slices bacon 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup shredded smoked cheddar cheese (about 4 ounces) 2 scallions (white and light green parts), thinly sliced 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce Kosher salt 4 ounces Monterey jack cheese 2 dried currants 1 baby carrot, trimmed 2 sprigs rosemary 1 pretzel crisp, plus more for serving 1 pitted jumbo black olive Instructions: Cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just starting to crisp but still pliable, about 5 minutes. Remove 1 slice to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue cooking the remaining bacon until browned and crisp, 2 to 3 more minutes; remove to the plate. Halve the slice of less-cooked bacon lengthwise. Finely chop the remaining bacon. Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the cheddar, scallions, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, a pinch of salt and the chopped bacon; beat until combined. Refrigerate until slightly firm, about 30 minutes. Form the cheese mixture into 3 balls (about 2 inches, 2 1/2 inches and 3 inches). Refrigerate until firm, at least 30 more minutes. Meanwhile, freeze the Monterey jack cheese 1 hour (this will make it less clumpy when grated). Grate the cheese on the small holes of a box grater. Gently press all over the cheese balls to coat completely. Put the 3-inch cheese ball on a small serving plate; insert a 4-inch wooden skewer into the middle. Stack the 2 1/2-inch and 2-inch balls on top, securing on the skewer. Press the currants into the top cheese ball for eyes; add a carrot nose. Use the halved bacon to make a scarf and add rosemary sprigs for arms. Place the pretzel crisp on top for a hat brim. Cut off about one-third of the olive so that it sits flat; place on top of the pretzel crisp for the hat. Serve with more pretzel crisps. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 43250,&quot;Jalapeno Pork Poppers 1 pound medium jalapenos, cut in half lengthwise, seeded, and deveined 1 pound cream cheese, softened 1 pound ground sausage 1 medium white onion, finely chopped 1 tsp salt pepper to taste Instructions: Preheat oven 400 degrees F.

Butter three 8-inch round cake pans, line with parchment and butter the parchment; set aside. Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk the buttermilk, food coloring and vanilla in a spouted measuring cup; set aside. Beat the granulated sugar and butter in a stand mixer (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) on medium speed until very light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. With the mixer still running, slowly add the eggs and beat until fully incorporated. Reduce the mixer speed to the lowest speed; with it running, add 1/3 of the flour mixture, then 1/2 of the buttermilk mixture, then 1/2 of the remaining flour mixture, then the remaining buttermilk mixture, then the remaining flour mixture. Scrape down the sides and beat until well mixed. Divide the batter evenly among the three prepared pans. Bake until slightly puffed and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes in the pan, then turn out to cool completely. For the frosting: Put the flour in a small saucepan. Vigorously whisk in about 1/2 cup of the milk, making sure to get the whisk into the edges of the pan, until you have a smooth, thick paste. (This step keeps the flour from clumping.) Slowly whisk in the remaining milk until fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Cook over medium heat, whisking continuously, until the mixture is very thick, about 5 minutes. (Toward the end of the process, the mixture will become a thick paste; it may seem to be forming lumps, but whisk vigorously and the lumps will disappear.) Scrape the frosting into a bowl, press plastic wrap onto the surface and refrigerate until cool, about 45 minutes. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a hand mixer), beat the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the cooled flour mixture a tablespoon at a time and beat until smooth. Switch to the whisk attachment (or continue with the hand mixer), add the vanilla, salt and 3 to 5 drops food coloring if using and whip until very light and fluffy, like thick whipped cream, up to 10 minutes with a stand mixer or 12 minutes with a hand mixer. To assemble: Place one layer on a cake plate, spread frosting on top and repeat with the 2 remaining layers. Frost the sides and decorate with candies and sanding sugar if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43254,&quot;Apple Muffins 1/2 cup, packed, brown sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 1/2 cups flour 1 egg, lightly beaten 1/4 cup melted butter 1/2 cup buttermilk 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored and cut into 1/4inch dice (about 1 1/2 cups) 4 ounces (1 cup) pecans, chopped 1 to 2 tablespoons regular sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Add the olive oil to the mustard mixture to loosen it. Paint this mixture generously all over the chicken and let sit for up to 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. If you have any of the mustard mixture left over, save it for repainting while the chicken is cooking. Preheat the grill to medium (you want the chicken to cook on the grill as long as possible without burning to develop lovely crispy, tasty skin). Brush off any crud on the grill with a wire grill brush and run an oiled towel over the grill to pick up any bits of loosened crud. Season the chicken lightly with salt and arrange gently on the grill, skin-side down, and cook until the skin has started to brown and crisp, 5 to 6 minutes. If the chicken flares up, move it to a cooler part of the grill; you don&#39;t want sooty film on the chicken (it won&#39;t taste good). Once the chicken has started to brown and crisp, it&#39;s a good idea to close the grill to allow the heat to cook the chicken from all directions. You want to cook the chicken skin-side down for a total of 10 to 12 minutes, then turn it over and cook it until an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F, another 10 to 12 minutes. If you&#39;re using a grill pan, you can transfer the chicken to a 375 degree F oven when it&#39;s ready to flip so it can finish cooking. If there is leftover mustard mixture, use it to paint the skin of the chicken, up to 5 minutes before the end of cooking. When the chicken is nearly done, place the lemon halves on the grill cut-side down and leave them alone until brown and caramelized, 5 to 6 minutes. (These will smell great while they&#39;re grilling!) Remove the chicken from the heat. Serve with the grilled lemon for extra lemony goodness and the Grilled Corn Salad. Heat a grill or grill pan to medium-high. Grill the corn on all sides until grill marks appear, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool until manageable. Slice the kernels off the cob and add to a medium bowl. Add the tomatoes, cucumber, cotija and red onion. Stir gently until just combined. Add the cilantro, olive oil, red wine vinegar and lime juice. Stir to combine. Taste and season with salt as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 43260,&quot;Herb Butter Served on Steaks 6 sprigs fresh rosemary 1 pound rib-eye of beef, off the bone Oil 2 cloves garlic Small bunch (20 grams) summer savory leaves Pinch sea salt 8 3/4 ounces (250 grams-2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature Potatoes, peeled, cut in to 1 inch dice and cooked for 10 to 15 minutes Fresh rosemary leaves 1 bulb garlic Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Pre-heat the oven to 200C degrees/400 degrees F/ Gas Mark 6. Remove some of the rosemary leaves from the stalks by running your thumb and forefinger down the length of the stalk. Sharpen the ends of the rosemary skewer to make them into little arrows, then pierce them through the beef to flavor it. Chop up the rosemary leaves and press onto the beef on both sides. Cover and allow to stand for 1/2 hour until room temperature. (Beef tastes better if cooked at room temperature.) Make the butter by bashing the garlic, summer savory and a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar, then combine with the softened butter, mixing to flavor all of it. Put into buttered paper, roll into a sausage shape, and chill. Cook the potatoes in boiling, salted water for about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain, then toss in the colander to chuff up.

Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil. Make the ketchup: Wrap peppercorns, cardamom and coriander in cheesecloth or place in a tea infuser and add to tomatoes. Bring tomato puree, syrup, bourbon and salt to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid scorching, until it darkens, thickens and is reduced by about a third. Add vinegar and fish sauce, and stir to combine. Remove the spice sachet, and remove sauce from heat. Fill and close the jars: Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the ketchup in the saucepan. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the ketchup into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight. Seal the jars: Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1\\ water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 10 minutes. Remove and cool: Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately. Label and store: Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43268,&quot;Osso Buco 6 osso buco, tied equatorially with string Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 1 large onion, coarsely chopped 2 celery ribs, coarsely chopped 1 fennel bulb, coarsely chopped 3 cloves garlic, smashed Pinch crushed red pepper 3/4 cup tomato paste 2 cups dry white wine 3 bay leaves 1 fresh thyme bundle Gremolata, recipe follows 1 orange, zested 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 small clove garlic, minced 2 tablespoons freshly grated horseradish Instructions: Season the osso buco generously with salt. Coat a wide, flat pan generously with olive oil. Bring the pan to a high heat and add the osso buco to the pan and brown them very well on all sides.

Ditch the excess oil from the pan and add a little new oil and bring to a high heat. Add the veggies to the pan with a pinch of crushed red pepper, season with salt, and brown them very well. Do not skimp on this step - it will take awhile, and that&#39;s ok. Add the tomato paste and cook until it starts to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the wine and reduce by half. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Return the osso buco to the pan. Add water so the liquid becomes even with top of the meat. Taste the liquid and season with salt if needed. Add in the bay leaves and thyme bundle. Bring the liquid to a boil, cover, and put the whole pan in the oven. Cook the osso buco for 1 hour. Pull the pan out of the oven and check the liquid level and the seasoning. Add more liquid, if needed, return the pan to the oven, and cook for another hour. Remove the lid and cook for 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, remove the osso buco, and hold on a serving platter. Skim the fat off the surface of the sauce, if needed. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning.

Spread the sesame seeds in a medium skillet over medium heat, and toast until golden brown, shaking the pan occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add the corn to the boiling water, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the corn to a colander, reserving the boiling water for later use, and run the corn under cold water to cool. Cut the kernels from the cobs; set aside. Transfer the sesame seeds to a blender and grind for 15 seconds. Add the oil, and puree until smooth and emulsified, about 15 seconds. Add the lemon juice, soy sauce, sugar, cl-garlic sauce and ginger, and blend for another 15 seconds. Add the soba to the boiling water, and cook until the noodles no longer have a hard, chalky bite but are still springy, 3 to 4 minutes. Strain the noodles in a colander, and run them under cold water to stop the cooking quickly. When the noodles are completely cool, shake the colander vigorously to remove as much water as possible (if the noodles are too wet, they will dilute the dressing). Divide the noodles among four bowls. Drizzle the dressing over the noodles (use all of the dressing, as the noodles will soak it up). Top with the corn, watercress, tomatoes, avocados and cucumbers.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Sprinkle the red and butterscotch candies into a 7-by-10-inch rectangle, alternating colors as shown. Bake the candies until completely melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Immediately run a knife through the yellow candy to swirl it into the red (be careful-the candy will be very hot). Let cool completely on the baking sheet. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Wipe out the food processor (no need to wash it). Add the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar, melted chocolate, cocoa powder, milk and vanilla and pulse until smooth. Trim the long top and bottom edges of the pound cakes with a paring knife to make them rounded. Spread the frosting over the pound cakes, making sure to cover the rounded undersides (leave the ends exposed to resemble cut logs). Sprinkle the coarse cookie crumbs on a platter. Place 1 cake on the crumbs, then run a fork through the frosting to create the texture of bark. Rest the second cake at an angle on top; repeat with the fork. Sift the fine cookie crumb mixture over the logs to look like ash.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Using a sharp knife or kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the backbone and discard it. Flatten the chicken and cut it in half through the breast so you have two halves-each with a leg and breast. Rub all over with some of the smoked olive oil, ensuring it gets in all the crevices. Season all over with salt and pepper. Set the chicken in a large roasting pan over two burners and heat over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the chicken halves skin-side down and sear for 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over, add the potatoes to the pan, and drizzle with more smoked olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the joint between the thigh and drumstick reads 160 degrees to 165 degrees F. The potatoes should be golden on the outside and tender in the middle. Remove from the oven and allow the chicken to rest for 5 minutes. Make the citrus salsa. Use a sharp knife to cut away the rind and pith from each of the citrus fruits. Holding the fruit over a bowl, carefully cut between the membranes to free the segments. Let the juices and segments fall into the bowl. Add about cup extra-virgin olive oil to the bowl and season with salt and pepper. Cut the radishes into very fine matchsticks on a mandoline or with a sharp knife. Fold them into the citrus salsa, and add the chives.

Fill the bowl with scoops of the sorbet, vanilla ice cream and half of the chocolate ice cream, alternating small and large scoops to create a mosaic of colors and shapes. Place a piece of plastic wrap on top of the ice cream; press down to close the gaps between scoops and even out the surface. Remove the plastic wrap, sprinkle the ice cream with the wafer crumbs and re-cover with the plastic wrap, pressing gently. Freeze until set, about 30 minutes.<br> Remove the wrap and spread the remaining chocolate ice cream in an even layer on top of the crumbs. Cut the pound cake into 1/2-inch-thick slices; completely cover the ice cream with the slices, trimming as needed (you&#39;ll use about two-thirds of the cake). Cover with fresh plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.<br> Make the meringue: Whip the egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until foamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the sugar on high speed until the whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks.<br> Remove the top layer of plastic wrap, then invert the cake onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. (If necessary, let the cake stand overturned until it slips out.) Remove the rest of the plastic wrap and cover the ice cream completely with the meringue, making the dome-shaped top slightly thicker than the sides. Form swirly peaks in the meringue using the back of a spoon. Freeze for at least 3 more hours.<br> Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Bake the cake until the meringue peaks are golden, about 4 minutes, or brown the meringue with a blowtorch. Let the cake soften at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.

Repeat with the Colby Jack (save both types of cheese scraps for another use). Use a 3 3/4-by-4-inch starfish cookie cutter to cut each slice of provolone into a starfish (save the provolone scraps for the Brie shark). Make 2 stacks each of the Cheddar and Colby Jack fish and space them out in the middle of a large, rectangular cheese or charcuterie board (about 20 inches by 14 inches). Stack the starfish in 1 stack and reserve for the next step. For the cucumber seaweed: Trim off one end of each cucumber, then halve lengthwise. Using one tip of the starfish cookie cutter, cut out ridges along both long sides of each cucumber to resemble seaweed. Lay the cucumbers cut-side down along the bottom of the board with the trimmed ends at the bottom. Place the stack of provolone starfish on top of the cucumber seaweed. For the Gournay life preserver: Fill a 5-ounce ramekin with the Gournay cheese. Use a 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter to remove the center of the Gournay, then re-fill the center with about 1/4 cup of the blueberries. Quarter the pepper; cut four 1-inch-long matchsticks from one of the quarters (save the rest for another use). Arrange the pepper pieces on top of the Gournay to resemble a life preserver. Place the Gournay life preserver in the upper right corner of the board. For the salami coral: Fold each slice of salami in half, then in half again. Tuck the corners of each folded salami into the fold of another to create a 2-inch-long chain. Repeat until you have at least 4 chains. Place the salami chains among the cucumbers to resemble coral. For the Brie shark: Cut the chilled Brie into a rounded triangle, then slice it in half horizontally. Remove the top half of the Brie and cut off a 1-inch border from it. Cut an eye-shaped opening near the bottom edge to make a shark&#39;s open mouth. Spread strawberry jam on the bottom half of the Brie. Place the top half on the bottom half. Cut the remaining provolone into 1/2-inch triangles and place them inside the opening to resemble shark teeth. Slice 12 blueberries in half and line the exposed border of the bottom brie shark with the halved blueberries, cut-side down, adding 2 blueberry halves cut-side up across from each other near the top to resemble shark eyes. Place the Brie shark in the upper left corner of the board. For serving: Fill in the rest of the board with blueberries to resemble water.

In a large mixing bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and mix until combined. Gradually add the sifted dry ingredients, one spoonful at a time, until thoroughly combined. Add the vanilla. Chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out half of the dough at a time, keeping the remainder of the dough in the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a 1/4-inch thickness and cut into desired shapes with a cookie cutter. (For medium cookies, use a 3-inch cookie cutter.) Place the cutout cookies 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet and put the cookie sheet in the refrigerator for a few minutes before baking. This will help the cookies to retain their shape. (You can roll out the scraps to make a few more cookies.) Bake until just before the edges of the cookies start to brown, 8 to 10 minutes (if baking two sheets at a time, rotate halfway through baking). Cool the cookies for 1 to 2 minutes on the cookie sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely. For the icing: In a medium bowl, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and warm water with a wire whisk. Stir until the icing is smooth. Adjust the consistency of the icing by adding more confectioners&#39; sugar or more water, as needed. Add food coloring, if desired, to the icing. Spread the icing on the cooled cookies and then top with assorted sprinkles and candies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43313,&quot;Corned Beef Hash 10 pounds fresh whole beef brisket, cut into equal pieces 2 bay leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 medium white onions, diced 3 teaspoons chopped garlic 1/2 cup chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 teaspoons Worcestershire 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, (recommended: Tabasco) 1/2 cup white wine 3 large chef potatoes peeled and diced Yellow mustard (1 teaspoon per pound) 1 tablespoon Worcestershire 1/2 tablespoon teaspoon hot pepper sauce, (recommended: Tabasco) Instructions: Add the brisket to a large pot and cover it with water.

F. Season the short ribs generously all over with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the short ribs in 2 batches and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes per batch. Remove the short ribs to a plate; pour off all but 1/4 cup of the drippings. Add the carrot, onion, fennel and pancetta to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Stir in the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are coated and the paste is brick red, about 2 minutes. Add the wine to the pot, bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by about two-thirds, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and chicken broth and return to a simmer. Meanwhile, wrap the rosemary, sage, bay leaves and whole peppercorns in an 8-inch square of cheesecloth; tie closed. Add the bundle to the pot. When the mixture comes to a simmer, scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Return the short ribs to the pot. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven and braise until the meat is very tender and the sauce has thickened slightly, 2 1/2 hours to 2 3/4 hours. Carefully put the pot back on the stove and remove the lid. Discard the cheesecloth bundle. Remove the short ribs to a baking sheet using tongs and discard the bones. Break up the meat into large chunks. Return the meat to the pot along with any liquid from the baking sheet and stir to combine; season with salt and pepper. Spoon off any fat that pools on top. To serve, top the short ribs on the tagliatelle with parsley, Parmesan and pepper. Pulse the flour and a big pinch of salt in a food processor to combine. Whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks and olive oil in a bowl. Slowly add the egg mixture to the food processor with the machine running to form a rough, sticky dough. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead several times, sprinkling with flour if sticky, until the dough is smooth. Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside to rest 30 minutes. Set up your pasta maker. Unwrap the dough and cut into 6 pieces; press each into a rectangle. Cover 5 pieces and set aside. Lightly flour the remaining piece of dough and run it through the widest setting of the pasta maker. Fold in half and feed it through the same setting. Move to the next setting and feed the dough through this setting twice, lightly flouring as needed (do not fold). Repeat until you\\u2019ve reached the third-to-last setting. The dough should be about 1/8 inch thick but not transparent. If it\\u2019s too long to manage, cut it in half crosswise. Lightly flour the dough and set aside. Repeat with the remaining 5 pieces of dough. Attach the tagliatelle or fettuccine cutter to your pasta maker. Feed each dough sheet through the cutter, gathering the strands on the other side. Lightly sprinkle the strands with flour and form into loose nests. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 3 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl and toss with the butter and reserved cooking water. Stir in the Parmesan and a generous amount of coarse pepper; season with salt. Serve with more Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 43318,&quot;Shirred Eggs with Jalapeno Oil 8 large eggs 2 cups heavy cream Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Shredded Parmesan 1/2 jalapeno 1/2 cup olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Crack 1 egg into each ramekin. Divide the cream over each egg, until the egg is covered. Add salt and pepper, to taste and sprinkle with the Parmesan. Arrange the ramekins on a sheet tray and put into the oven. Bake for about 10 minutes. While the eggs are baking, add the jalapeno and the olive oil to a blender, and blend on high until the olive oil is a vibrant green, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the mixture from the blender, and if possible, pour the oil through a strainer, into a bowl, to purify. The last minute of baking the eggs, set the oven to broil, and allow the heat to blast the top of the eggs, adding a little brown to the surface. Remove the eggs from the oven, and let sit for about 5 to 8 minutes. Before serving, drizzle a small amount of the jalapeno oil on the top of each egg. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 43319,&quot;Grilled Pizza for a Crowd 6 cups bread flour, plus more for the work surface 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling 2 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F) 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing the bowl, brushing the dough and oiling the grill grates 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing the bowl, brushing the dough and oiling the grill grates<br> 2 teaspoons sugar One 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast Cornmeal, for dusting Red Sauce, recipe follows Arugula-Pistachio Pesto, recipe follows Ricotta Spread, recipe follows 6 cups cheese mix, made of 2 cups each shredded mozzarella, fontina and asiago 1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, sliced Toppings (choose 5 or 6): 3/4 pound thinly sliced meats, such as prosciutto, salami and ham 3/4 pound thinly sliced meats, such as prosciutto, salami and ham<br> 1 small bunch Tuscan kale, cut into bite-sized pieces and tossed with olive oil 1 small bunch Tuscan kale, cut into bite-sized pieces and tossed with olive oil<br> 2 thinly sliced bell peppers 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced 2 small red onions, thinly sliced 1 pint fresh figs, sliced 3 grilled ears corn, kernels removed 1 cup pitted olives 1/2 cup pistachios 1 bulb fennel, thinly sliced 1 medium summer squash or zucchini, thinly sliced<br> 1 head radicchio, cut into bite-sized pieces and tossed with olive oil Olive oil, aged balsamic vinegar, Calabrese chili sauce, honey, grated Parmesan, flaky sea salt, toasted fennel seeds, baby greens, fresh basil, lemon wedges 1 handful fresh basil leaves 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced Kosher salt 3 cups baby arugula 3/4 cup fresh basil leaves 3/4 cup fresh parsley leaves 1/3 cup shelled pistachios 1/3 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon capers, drained Kosher salt 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cups ricotta 1 garlic clove, minced Kosher salt Instructions: Make the pizza dough: Whisk together the bread flour and salt in a large bowl. Combine the water, oil and sugar in a second large bowl; add the yeast, and let sit until it begins to foam, about 5 minutes. Add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture, and use your hands to combine until it comes together into a rough, shaggy ball. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and set aside for 15 minutes. Sprinkle a work surface with flour and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Clean the bowl and lightly coat it with oil. Return the kneaded dough to the bowl, brush with oil, cover and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Transfer the dough to the work surface, and punch it down. Quarter the dough, and cut each quarter into 4 for a total of 16 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Evenly space the dough balls on the work surface, cover and let sit until they poof slightly, about 30 minutes. (To make ahead, after cutting the dough, wrap each piece tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, then let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before rolling.) Prepare a grill for medium-high heat and brush the grill grates with oil. Roll out the dough: Line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment, and sprinkle with cornmeal to keep the dough from sticking. Roll out each ball of dough into an 8-inch circle on the work surface (keep the other balls covered as you work). Arrange 2 to 3 rounds without overlapping on the parchment. Repeat with layers of parchment, cornmeal and dough rounds. Par-grill the dough: Working in batches, brush the top of each dough round with oil and sprinkle with salt. Grill, oiled-side down, until grill marks just form and the dough starts to bubble up, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Turn the dough over and repeat. Transfer to a cooling rack or another baking sheet to cool. The dough shells will be underbaked and flimsy (they finish cooking when guests top and grill them). Stack the shells, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and set aside until ready to use. (The shells can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Or tightly wrap each one in plastic and foil, then freeze for up to 3 months; thaw at room temperature for a few minutes before topping and grilling.) Set up the pizza bar: Prepare a grill for medium-high heat and brush the grill grates with oil. Set out a large cutting board with a knife or pizza cutter nearby. Set out a stack of the pizza shells and any combination of the suggested sauces, cheeses and toppings. Grill the pizzas: Let your guests add their desired toppings to the dough shells. Transfer the pizzas to the grill, cover and cook until the bottom of each is slightly charred, the cheese has melted and the toppings are cooked through. Remove the pizzas from the grill, slice them and encourage your guests to top them with some of the finishings.

Add the remaining water, zucchini and green beans, cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are somewhat tender. Add the pasta, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until the pasta is tender. (At this point check the level of liquid; if the soup seems somewhat thick, just add more water to bring the level of the liquid back up to where it was at the beginning of cooking time.) Add the peas and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes to heat through. Season carefully with salt and pepper. Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the fresh herbs. Serve with 1 or 2 of the garnishes, according to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 43321,&quot;Ju-Lito (hoolito) 4 ounces freshly squeezed lemon juice 4 ounces simple syrup (equal amounts sugar and water, heated until sugar dissolves; cooled) 4 to 5 fresh mint leaves, coarsely chopped 6 ounces whiskey (recommended: Jack Daniels Black) Crushed ice Sparkling water Instructions: In a cocktail shaker combine the lemon juice, simple syrup, mint and crushed ice, and shake vigorously.

A jelly jar lid works very well as a quick discard for the center. Using a pancake griddle or a large teflon pan, heat one ounce of clarified butter over medium heat. Toast each slice of bread on one side for three minutes. As you flip each slice of bread, carefully crack an egg through the hole and saute the egg inside. When the egg sets on one side, but the yolk is still soft, turn the toast over, careful not to crack the yolk. Saute for an additional two minutes. While the eggs are cooking, in a mixing bowl season tomato slices and shaved onions with olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt and pepper. For the presentation, stack tomatoes and onions in one corner of the plate. Lean the frog in the hole against the tomatoes and garnish with a rosette of three slices of smoked salmon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 43323,&quot;Georgia&#39;s Peachy Cocktail 1 ounce amaretto 1 ounce peach puree 1 ounce peach schnapps 1/2 ounce bourbon Dash bitters Ice Instructions: Add the amaretto, peach puree, peach schnapps, bourbon and bitters to a cocktail shaker filled with ice, and shake vigorously to blend.

Combine the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the egg and vanilla and almond extracts until just incorporated. Gradually add the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Remove two-thirds of the dough, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Add the food coloring to the dough in the mixer and mix on low speed until no streaks remain. Wrap in plastic wrap and flatten into a disc about 1/2 inch thick; freeze for 20 minutes. Barely roll out the blue dough on a lightly floured surface just until even. Dip a 1 3/4-inch dreidel cookie cutter in flour and stamp out as many cookies as possible, rerolling the scraps, until no blue dough remains (if the dough gets too soft, return it to the freezer). Brush the tops of the dreidels with water and stack them on top of each other, pressing lightly to adhere and lining them up perfectly. Make 3 or 4 stacks so that they don\\u2019t fall over. Transfer the stacks to a plate and freeze for 10 minutes. Remove the stacks from the freezer and lay them on their sides. Brush the adjoining ends of each stack with water and press them together, creating one long dreidel-shaped stack for the center of the cookies. Roll one-quarter of the uncolored dough into a log the length of the dreidel stack, with a 1-inch diameter, then cut it in half lengthwise. Brush each half with water and press into the space on either side along the dreidel handle. Roll out a skinnier log of uncolored dough the length of the dreidel stack, brush with water and place it along the top of the dreidel handle, pressing to connect it to the first two strips of uncolored dough. Press the remaining uncolored dough around the sides, rolling the log a bit to round out the shape, brushing with water if needed to adhere. Return to the freezer for 10 minutes. Pour the sprinkles into a shallow bowl or plate long enough to hold the log of dough. Remove the dough from the freezer, brush with water, then roll in the sprinkles, pressing to adhere if necessary. Freeze for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment. Transfer the frozen dough log to a cutting board and use a sharp knife to slice it into 1/4-inch-thick cookies. Place the cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets and bake, rotating halfway through, until just starting to brown on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Microwave the white chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl at 70% power, stirring every 10 seconds, until melted, about 30 seconds total. Transfer to a piping bag and cut off the very tip to pipe a thin line of white chocolate. Pipe one of the following letters from the Hebrew alphabet on the dreidels: ?\\u200e\\u202f(nun),\\u202f?\\u200e\\u202f(gimel),\\u202f?\\u200e\\u202f(hei) and\\u202f?\\u200e\\u202f(shin). Let sit at room temperature until the chocolate sets, 20 to 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43326,&quot;Duck Fat Fries 4 medium russet potatoes 8 cups canola oil 2 cups duck fat Sea salt or truffle salt Instructions: Peel the sides of the potatoes but leave some skin on the ends. As you peel, place the potatoes in a bowl filled with cool water. Cut the potatoes into matchsticks (1/8-inch square) and place back into the bowl of clean cool water. Allow the potatoes to sit for 1 hour, changing the water as it becomes cloudy to remove the starch. Heat the canola oil in a large, heavy Dutch oven or deep skillet to 325 degrees F. Drain the potatoes and dry well with paper towels. Carefully add the potatoes to the oil, in batches if necessary, and cook until they just lose their opaque look and are starting to firm up, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain well on paper towels. Heat the duck fat in a heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F; ideally you want the duck fat 3 to 4 inches deep. Carefully add the fries to the duck fat and cook until crispy and evenly golden, about 8 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and season with the sea salt or truffle salt. Cook&#39;s Note: Strain the duck fat through a fine mesh strainer and transfer to a glass container.

Stir the pesto, mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan together in a medium bowl. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. On a floured work surface, form the pieces into balls. Roll one ball into a 10-inch circle (about the size of a dinner plate) and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Spread with 1/3 of the filling, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Add 2 more layers of rolled dough circles and filling, ending with the fourth dough circle on top. Mark the center of the dough by placing a small drinking glass (about 2 inches in diameter) in the middle. With a very sharp knife, make 4 cuts through the dough at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o&#39;clock to make 4 quarters, leaving it intact at the center where the glass is. Cut through each quarter to make 8 equal-sized wedges, then cut through each wedge one more time to make 16 equal-sized wedges that are attached in the center. Lift a pair of 2 wedges and twist them away from each other, two turns in opposing directions. After twisting, place each pair back on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pairs of wedges. Cover the dough with oiled plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.<br> Beat the egg and milk in a small bowl. Brush the egg wash all over the risen dough and sprinkle lightly with grated Parmesan and flaky sea salt if using. Bake until the bread is puffed and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Toss the onions, celery, carrots and garlic with 1 teaspoon each oil and salt on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until the vegetables are charred in some places, 25 to 30 minutes. Bring the roasted vegetables, 1 cup water, mushrooms, thyme, sun-dried tomatoes, soy sauce, bay leaf and 1 teaspoon salt to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is gone, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 6 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and bring back to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and gently simmer until reduced by about one third, about 45 minutes. Strain the stock through a strainer into a large liquid measuring cup; use the back of a ladle to squeeze all the liquid out of the solids (there should be about 4 cups of stock). If not making gravy right away, let the stock cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 1 month. To make the gravy, warm the stock slightly in a medium saucepan if it has been refrigerated. Heat the remaining 4 tablespoons oil in another medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sage leaves, and cook until fried and crispy, about 2 minutes; remove and set aside. Add the flour to the saucepan, and stir until smooth and lightly golden, about 2 minutes.

Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the egg yolk mixture and pulse just until the dough can be gathered into a ball. Flatten into a 6-inch disc, wrap in plastic, and chill several hours or overnight. Let the dough soften slightly at room temperature before rolling. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch round. Fit the dough into a 10 1/2-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Trim the dough flush with the rim and freeze the tart shell until firm. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line the shell with foil or parchment, and fill with pie weights, rice or dried beans. Bake for 20 minutes until set. Remove the foil and weights and bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly golden. Remove the shell from the oven and immediately brush the hot pastry with the egg white. When the pastry is almost done baking, assemble the filling. Whisk together the eggs, sugar, orange juice, lemon juice, lemon zest, orange zest and cream until smooth. Transfer the tart shell to a preheated 350 degree oven. Place the filling in a pitcher and slowly pour into the shell as high as possible without overfilling. There might be a bit of filling left over. Bake the tart for approximately 25 minutes, until the filling is barely set. Check the tart after 20 minutes and keep checking it every few minutes after that. It is crucial to not overbake this filling.

Split the vanilla bean in 2 pieces, scrape out the vanilla and add them to the saucepan. Set the saucepan over low heat and cook, stirring regularly with a wooden spoon, until the butter has melted and the milk starts bubbling around the edges (it shouldn&#39;t boil at all). Place the flour, sugar, egg and yolk in a large bowl and mix together, stirring thoroughly before adding each ingredient. Pour in the hot milk mixture slowly, gently stirring with a large silicone spatula. Let the dough cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Spray the interior of each canele mold with butter spray, then set the molds in the freezer for 5 minutes to harden the butter. If you choose to flavor your caneles, add some lemon, orange or lime zest to the dough at this time. Fill the canele molds 3/4 of the way, leaving a 1/5-inch space at the top of each cavity. Bake the caneles for 4 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 360 degrees F and bake until golden brown, about 56 minutes more.

Garnish with peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 43370,&quot;S&#39;more Brownies 20 graham crackers 1/2 cup granulated sugar 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 3 large eggs, beaten 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips 1/2 cup 60 percent cacao bittersweet chips, optional 1 bag marshmallows Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the graham crackers in a large plastic bag. Using a rolling pin or skillet, crush the crackers into fine crumbs. In a bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of lightly greased (8- by 8-inch) baking dish. Bake the crust until slightly darkened and firm to touch, approximately 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F, while preparing the brownie batter. Melt the butter and semisweet chocolate together in a double boiler over simmering water. Allow to cool slightly (but not harden), then add the eggs, vanilla, and sugar. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt, and add to the chocolate mixture. Add additional chocolate chips, if desired, at the last minute, folding them in to combine. Pour the brownie batter over the graham cracker crust and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, taking care not to overbake. A tester stuck into the brownies will not come out clean when done cooking. The idea is to create a center with a texture close to fudge. Remove the brownies from the oven and allow to cool before topping with marshmallows. To serve, top the brownies with marshmallows and broil until the marshmallows are melted, golden and bubbling. Serve immediately and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 43371,&quot;Caramel Topped Cream Puffs 1 cup water 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 eggs 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/3 cup water Ice cream of your choice, or lightly sweetened whipped cream Instructions: Make the Cream Puffs: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the water, butter, salt, and sugar in a large saucepan and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once and stir hard until the flour is incorporated, about 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, 2 minutes to evaporate some of the moisture. Scrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer or mix by hand.) Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running, add 3 of the eggs, 1 at a time, stopping after each to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add another egg and mix until completely incorporated. Using a pastry bag, pipe the dough in bite-size \\kisses\\ (about 1 1/2 inches across) onto 1 of the cookie sheets. Dip your finger in flour and push down the points to smooth out any bumps. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 25 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. Make the Caramel: Pour the sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the sugar, trying not to splash any sugar onto the sides of the pan. Do not stir; gently draw your finger through the center of the sugar to moisten it. Over high heat, bring to a full boil and cook without stirring, swirling the pot occasionally to even out the color, until amber-caramel in color, 10 to 20 minutes. When the mixture is done, remove the pot from the heat and rest the bottom in the ice bath for 15 seconds to stop the cooking. Dip the top of each cream puff in the caramel and place it caramel-side down, with the base sticking straight up, on the other greased cookie sheet. The caramel will pool slightly around the puff and will harden and develop a foot. (When you turn the puffs over later, this will be a smooth flat \\lid\\ for each profiterole.) Let cool until set, at least 10 minutes. When ready to serve, carefully turn the puffs over and cut each 1 horizontally in 1/2 using a long serrated knife. Fill each with a small scoop of ice cream or sweetened, flavored whipped cream. Place the lid on top and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43372,&quot;Beet and Goat Cheese Arugula Salad 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 3 tablespoons shallots, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon honey 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 medium beets, cooked and quartered 6 cups fresh arugula 1/2 cup walnuts, toasted, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup dried cranberries or dried cherries 1/2 avocado, peeled, pitted, and cubed 3 ounces soft fresh goat cheese, coarsely crumbled Instructions: Line a baking sheet with foil. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Whisk the vinegar, shallots, and honey in a medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in the oil. Season the vinaigrette, to taste, with salt and pepper. Toss the beets in a small bowl with enough dressing to coat. Place the beets on the prepared baking sheet and roast until the beets are slightly caramelized, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Set aside and cool. Toss the arugula, walnuts, and cranberries in a large bowl with enough vinaigrette to coat. Season the salad, to taste, with salt and pepper. Mound the salad atop 4 plates. Arrange the beets around the salad. Sprinkle with the avocado and goat cheese, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43373,&quot;Mexican Hot Chocolate Layer Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting Softened unsalted butter, for the pans 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans<br> 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar<br> 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br> 1 3/4 teaspoons chipotle powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup vegetable oil<br> 3/4 cup whole milk<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 large eggs<br> 24 ounces cream cheese, softened 3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) unsalted butter, softened<br> 6 cups confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> Cocoa powder, for dusting<br> Instructions: For the chocolate cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. Mix the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa, chipotle powder, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl until blended. Add the oil, milk, vanilla and eggs and beat with an electric mixer until thoroughly blended, about 2 minutes. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake until a wooden pick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Cool on a rack 10 minutes, then invert the pans to remove the cakes and cool completely. For the cream cheese frosting: Beat the cream cheese and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until thoroughly combined and smooth. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla and continue to beat until the frosting is very smooth, about 2 minutes. Spoon 2 cups of the frosting onto the top of one cake layer and smooth evenly with an offset spatula. Top with the second layer. Spoon just enough frosting on top to make a thin but even coating of frosting on top and all along the sides of the cake; it is okay if this frosting gets messy and full of crumbs. Freeze the cake until the frosting is firm, about 10 minutes. Spoon the remaining frosting onto the cake and smooth evenly over the entire cake with the offset spatula. Dust lightly with cocoa powder and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Tempranillo]&quot; 43374,&quot;Cranberry-Ginger Five-Spice Chutney 2 tablespoons coconut oil or olive oil 2 tablespoons panch phoron (Bengali five-spice blend) 1 pound cranberries, thawed if frozen 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar 2 tablespoons grated peeled fresh ginger 1/2 teaspoon chili powder Kosher salt Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the spice blend; when the seeds start to crackle and toast, add the cranberries. Stir in the brown sugar, vinegar, ginger and chili powder. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the cranberries have softened and the liquid is reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Season the chutney with salt. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.

Put the bacon in a large cold skillet then cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crispy, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon. Discard all but about 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings. Increase the heat to medium high, add the kale and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Whisk the half-and-half, Parmesan and eggs together in a bowl with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Layer half of the bread cubes in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 cups of the cheese, followed by the bacon, kale and sundried tomatoes. Cover with the remaining bread cubes and pour the custard evenly over top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. (This can also be assembled the day of; just let soak at room temperature 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking.) On the day of baking, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Let the strata sit at room temperature while the oven preheats. Remove the plastic and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese. Bake until slightly puffed and just no longer jiggly in the center, 40 to 50 minutes.

Carefully and gracefully pound each piece with a meat mallet on each side until 1/8-inch thick. Dice the capocollo, Prosciutto, soppressata, provolone, parsley and basil and place in an 8-inch bowl. Mix together. Beat eggs together in a small bowl, then add 1 tablespoon egg to the bowl with the meat mixture and mix in. Carefully divide stuffing into 3 portions and roll each up in a scallopini very tightly. Heat oil in an 8-inch saute pan until lightly smoking. Roll each rollatini in flour, then shake off excess and roll in remaining egg wash until covered. Place rollatinis in hot oil, seam-side down. Allow to brown, lowering heat as needed. Gracefully turn, cooking scallopini until they have golden-brown crusts, approximately 3 minutes on each side. Remove excess oil from pan, then place back on medium heat and add mushrooms. Allow to cook for 2 minutes, then season with salt, pepper and parsley. Add Marsala wine to deglaze pan, then carefully add stock, butter and demi-glace. Allow heat to remain on medium until the liquid reduces by half, then by half again. When you see the pan sauce is the consistency of heavy cream, you have achieved nirvana. Gracefully place rollatinis on a plate, then cover with remaining sauce and mushrooms. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]</p><p>&quot; 43377,&quot;Beef Stroganoff 1 tablespoon canola oil<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 1/2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into thin strips about 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide 2 cups button mushrooms, sliced<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 medium Spanish onion, sliced<br> 2 cups beef stock<br> 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 2 tablespoons grainy mustard<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 4 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 12 ounces extra-wide egg noodles 1 cup sour cream<br> 3 ounces cream cheese, cut into cubes and softened<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup fresh parsley, roughly chopped<br> Instructions: In a Dutch oven or large, heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter.

Cut out 12 squares of parchment paper measuring about 5 1/2 x 5 1/2in (14 x 14cm). Oil the muffin pan and push the squares down into each hole so the paper sticks up just like the muffins you can buy in the coffee shop. The squares have a habit of popping up out of the holes, which is okay for now because once the muffin mix is spooned inside the squares will stay down. Alternatively, use ready-made paper muffin cases.<br> In a large bowl, sift the flours, baking powder, and baking soda, then stir in the salt and rosemary. If there is any whole wheat left in the sifter from the whole wheat flour, keep this for the topping.<br> In a medium bowl, put the rest of the ingredients, apart from a third of the pumpkin, and stir well so all the liquid is well combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and, using a large spoon and no more than 8 turns, mix all the ingredients together. It does not take much to over-mix muffins at this stage and although the end result will still taste sublime the texture will not be as tender. Let the mixture stand for 5 minutes, then spoon the mixture into the paper cases.<br> Sprinkle the whole wheat, reserved pumpkin, and the pumpkin seeds over the muffins. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the muffins are well risen and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.<br> Good for breakfast, good for lunch, and good for just about any time of the day for a snack.

One 16-ounce container cream cheese or vanilla frosting Green food coloring Holiday-themed sprinkles 5 yellow candy-coated chocolates, such as M&amp;M\\u2019s, or small yellow gumdrops Instructions: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Lightly spray a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Remove the cinnamon rolls from the tube and place on a large cutting board or a clean work surface; reserve the icing for later. Unravel 1 roll into a long strip of dough. Fold the strip in an accordion fashion, making each fold slightly wider than the last, to create a Christmas-tree shape. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 4 rolls and space the Christmas trees apart on the baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and puffed up, 15 to 17 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the green food coloring directly into the container of frosting with a rubber spatula until the desired shade is achieved (we added about 30 drops). When the trees are ready, let them cool on a wire rack. Meanwhile, transfer the reserved cinnamon roll icing to a small resealable plastic bag and refrigerate until slightly chilled. When the trees are cool enough to touch, spread desired amount of green frosting onto each and spread evenly. Garnish with holiday-themed sprinkles. Snip a tiny corner from the bag of icing and pipe a garland onto each tree. Add a yellow candy to the tip of each tree to resemble a star. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 43393,&quot;Peppermint Swirl Chocolate Lava Cakes Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting 3/4 cup white chocolate chips 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract Red gel food coloring 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 8 ounces 70% dark chocolate, chopped 8 ounces unsalted butter, diced 3 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks 1/3 cup granulated sugar Confectioners\\u2019 sugar, for dusting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease and dust four 8-ounce ovenproof ramekins with unsweetened cocoa powder and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Line a plate with parchment paper. Combine the white chocolate chips and heavy cream in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave, stirring every 15 seconds, until melted, about 1 minute. Stir in the peppermint extract. Divide the white ganache into 2 small bowls. Add 3 drops of red food coloring to one bowl to tint it red and 3 drops of white food coloring to the other bowl to brighten the white ganache. Refrigerate, covered, until mostly set, about 15 minutes. Transfer the red and white ganache to individual piping bags and snip each tip to make a 1/2-inch opening. On the prepared plate, pipe two 1-inch-high dollops of each ganache side by side, alternating the color, to form a rough checkerboard cube of 2 red dollops and 2 white dollops. (If the ganache is too stiff to pipe, microwave for 10 seconds). Repeat 3 more times for a total of 4 checkerboard cubes. Freeze until solid, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the flour and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. Combine the dark chocolate and butter in another medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, stirring every 15 seconds, until completely melted, about 1 minute 15 seconds. Whisk until smooth. Combine the eggs, yolks and granulated sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Mix in the melted chocolate mixture. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and fold in the flour mixture with a rubber spatula. Fill the prepared ramekins halfway with the batter. Place a frozen ganache cube in the center of each, then cover with the remaining batter. Bake until the cakes bounce back slightly when gently pressed and the centers are slightly sunk from the ganache, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool in the ramekins for 10 minutes, then invert and unmold each onto an individual dessert plate. Place a paper snowflake cutout or doily over each cake and dust with confectioners\\u2019 sugar.

Spray two 9-by-1-1/2-inch round cake pans with nonstick spray. Add the granulated sugar and butter to the bowl of a stand mixer outfitted with the paddle attachment. Beat until creamy, just 2 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time to the mixture and beat until mixed together. Whisk together the cake flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. In a measuring cup, mix the milk and vanilla extract together. Turn the mixer back to medium speed and add the flour mixture and milk mixture alternately to create a smooth batter. Evenly divide the cake batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes start pulling away from the edges of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes for 10 minutes in their pans, then turn them out on a wire rack to cool completely before frosting. Frost the cake by tucking parchment underneath the first cake layer and the cake plate. Spread the Chocolate Frosting evenly over the first layer, then place the second cake on top. Frost the top of the cake, then work your way over the sides. Remove the parchment and serve. Add the chopped chocolate to a heatproof bowl and set over a lightly simmering pot of water (make sure the bottom of the pot is not touching the water). Stir until the chocolate is completely smooth and melted. Remove from the heat and cool until room temperature, about 15 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar to a medium bowl and whisk out the lumps. Beat the butter in a stand mixer outfitted with the paddle attachment until creamy. Add the cooled melted chocolate. Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar in 3 batches and beat until combined. Add the milk, vanilla and salt, and beat until the mixture is creamy, well mixed and spreadable. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 43395,&quot;Watercress Salad with Roasted Tomato Dressing 1 pint cherry tomatoes 1 clove garlic, smashed Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling, plus 1/4 cup for the dressing Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar Handful fresh parsley leaves 1/4 French baguette, thinly sliced croutons 8 ounces (1/2 log) creamy goat cheese, room temperature 2 bunches hydroponic watercress (feathery variety) Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Take a roasting dish and lay the tomatoes out with the garlic. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place in the oven and roast for 15 to 20 minutes until the tomatoes have burst and juices are slightly caramelized.<br> Remove from the oven and place in a blender with all the pan juices. Add the red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, sugar, parsley, and salt and pepper. Pulse until well combined. Set aside to cool in the refrigerator while you prepare the croutons. Take a sheet tray and lay out thin slices of the baguette. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place in the hot oven and bake until golden brown and crispy. The croutons will take 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven and while still warm, smear each piece with some goat cheese. Set aside. Take a platter and layer with goat cheese croutons. Top with mounds of feathery watercress and drizzle over the roasted tomato dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 43396,&quot;Jacques Torres&#39;s Crepes with Caramelized Pears 3 large eggs 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped (pod saved for later use) 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 orange, zest grated 1/2 lemon, zest grated 2/3 cup whole milk 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, for cooking Caramelized Pears, recipe follows 3 pears 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 tablespoons dark rum Instructions: Place the eggs and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Using a whisk attachment, mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Using a paring knife, slice the vanilla bean in half. Add the vanilla seeds, flour, citrus zests, and half of the milk and mix on medium speed until well incorporated. Add remaining milk and cream, continue to mix until the crepe batter is smooth and homogenous. If the batter is lumpy, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve. Grease an 8-inch nonstick crerpe pan (a nonstick frying pan will also work) with about 1 teaspoon of the butter and place over medium-high heat. Once it is hot, wipe away any excess butter with a paper towel. Then pour a small amount of crepe batter, about 2 tablespoons, into the pan and tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly. The batter should barely cover the bottom of the pan. Cook until it browns around the edges, about 30 seconds. Use a large spatula or pancake turner to gently flip the crepe and cook for another 30 seconds. Adjust the level of heat as needed. The crepe should be thin, light, and unevenly browned. Slide the crepe onto a plate and continue to make crepes until all of the batter is used. If the crepes begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, butter the pan again. Crepes may be stacked directly on top of each other and stored in the refrigerator up to 2 days, well-wrapped. Cold crepes may stick together; warm the crepes slightly in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds on high power, or in a moderate oven to separate easily. To assemble the crepes, use a sharp paring knife to slice reserved vanilla pod halves into 3 strips lengthwise. If your vanilla bean halves are not wide enough to cut into 3 strips, just cut them in half lengthwise. These pieces will be used to tie the crepe bundles together. It is easiest to tie the bundles together if you have long, thin vanilla strips. Place 1 crepe on a clean work surface. Fill the center of the crepe with about 2 tablespoons of the caramelized pears. Fold the crepe in half so that it looks like a fan. Bring the ends of the fan towards the center and tie the bundle with a vanilla bean strip. Make 11 more crepe bundles. If you don&#39;t have enough vanilla bean strips you can just fold the crepes closed. Stand the crepe bundles upright in the center of the plates and serve. Peel, core and cut the pears into 1/2-inch-thick slices and then cut in half crosswise. Heat a large heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is warm, sprinkle the sugar into the pan in an even layer so it will caramelize at the same time. As soon as you see the sugar begin to melt, start moving the pan over the burner to keep the sugar from burning. Tilt the pan from side to side so that the melted sugar runs over the unmelted sugar. Cook until all of the sugar is a light golden grown. Add butter and cook until melted. Add pears and spread evenly in the pan. Pour in rum. Let cook over medium-high heat until most of the liquid has evaporated and the pears are soft but not mushy. They should hold their shape but the tip of a paring knife should easily pierce them. If the pears are still hard when most of the liquid has evaporated, add a few tablespoons of water and continue cooling until the pears are done. Pour the caramelized pears onto a plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43397,&quot;Shrimp Remoulade Sliders 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2 tablespoons capers 2 tablespoons chopped cornichons 2 tablespoons tarragon 1 pound chopped cooked shrimp 2 1/2 cups grated celery root (about 8 ounces) 8 toasted mini brioche buns 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, for the buns Bibb lettuce, for serving Instructions: Combine the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, capers, cornichons and tarragon in a large bowl.

Sprinkle the yeast and 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar over the top and stir to dissolve. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the bread flour, milk powder, salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment until combined. Whisk the melted butter and egg yolks into the yeast mixture, then pour into the stand mixer over the flour mixture. Beat on medium speed until a shaggy dough ball forms. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to knead until a smooth but slightly sticky ball forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir together the cocoa powder and 5 teaspoons of hot water in another small bowl until a thick paste forms; set aside. Split the dough in half and place one half in a medium bowl greased with butter, turning to coat; cover tightly with plastic wrap. Return the other half of dough to the stand mixer and add the cocoa powder mixture. Beat on medium speed until the cocoa is thoroughly mixed into the dough. Transfer the chocolate dough to another buttered medium bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br> For filling and finishing: Mix the granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and flour in a small bowl until evenly combined; set aside. Punch down both the plain and chocolate proofed doughs, then cut each into 6 equal portions (12 total pieces). Dust a clean work surface lightly with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll 1 piece of plain dough and 1 piece of chocolate dough into two long rectangles, about 4 inches wide and 8 inches long. Place the chocolate dough directly on top of the plain dough. Using a bench scraper or chef\\u2019s knife, cut thin strips (about 1/8-inch wide) lengthwise along half of the dough (leave the other half uncut). Spread 1/2 tablespoon of softened butter on the un-cut side of dough, then sprinkle evenly with a heaping 2 teaspoons of the cinnamon sugar mixture. Fold about 1/4 inch of the dough inward on both sides to help hold the cinnamon mixture in, then roll the dough tightly from the uncut end to the sliced-end, making sure to finish with the seam-side down. The result should look like a roll of wool; set aside. Continue with the remaining dough pieces, butter and filling, so there are a total of 6 rolls.<br> Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Place the dough rolls around the perimeter of the pan (they will fit snuggly and should be touching). Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Uncover the proofed bread and brush with the beaten egg. Bake until puffed, golden brown and the bread reaches an internal temperature of 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes in the pan, then run an offset spatula around the edge. Unlock the springform pan and unmold the bread. The bread can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature. For the cream cheese icing: Beat the cream cheese and butter with a mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla and beat until combined.

Add the nuts to the meat mixture along with the lemon juice, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg and combine well. For the dough: Dissolve the yeast, salt and sugar in 1 cup of the warm water. Stir to dissolve the yeast. Add the flour to a large mixing bowl, stir in the yeast mixture and combine well. Add additional water, as needed, to make a medium-sized, stiff dough ball. Knead thoroughly. Cut into 2 equal sized dough balls, cover and let stand for 15 minutes. Lightly flour a large work surface and roll out each dough ball until approximately 1/8-inch thick. Cut the dough into circles with a 5-inch round cutter. Cover and let stand a second time for 15 minutes. Try to get as many round dough pieces as you can. Any excess dough can be rolled up and saved for more meat pies. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat 2 sheet pans with nonstick cooking spray. Working quickly, place 5 of the rounds, at a time, on a separate work surface. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the meat filling into the center of each round. Grabbing the opposite sides of the circle, pinch together in the middle. Then, pinch the rest of the dough closed, forming a triangular pie. Place on the prepared sheet pans. When all the pies have been formed, place the pans in the preheated oven and bake until the edges and bottoms of each pie begin to brown. Rotate the pans from bottom to top during baking. Bake until the pies are golden brown. Remove to a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43449,&quot;Cranberry Relish 2 cups fresh cranberries 1 cup orange juice 1/2 cup water 1/3 cup honey Zest of one orange Instructions: In a saucepan, combine all ingredients and stir to mix.

Put the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and beat slowly until it is smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and salt and cream at moderate speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the eggs and egg whites together a little at a time, beating after each addition until the eggs are absorbed before adding more. Mix until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl to insure even mixing, about 5 minutes. Sift together the cake flour and baking powder in a medium bowl and set aside. Mix the milk and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Add one-quarter of the flour mixture to the butter and egg mixture and beat just until blended in. Add one-third of the milk mixture and beat just until blended in. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, alternating the flour with the milk, until all the ingredients are used. Scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally for even mixing. Add 2 ounces of the frozen raspberries and continue mixing until the batter is a light pink color. Scoop some batter into each liner and crumble some of the remaining 3 ounces of raspberries on top of each. Sprinkle with the chocolate cookie crumbs and chocolate chips. Bake until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool completely before frosting. For the raspberry sauce: Put the raspberries, granulated sugar, lemon juice and 1/4 cup water in a pot and bring to a boil, stirring. Simmer until reduced, 10 to 15 minutes. For the cream cheese frosting: Cream together the cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy using an electric mixer. Slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix until well combined. Mix in the vanilla. To assemble, core out the center of each cupcake and fill with some raspberry sauce. Frost with the cream cheese frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 43460,&quot;Chocolate Sprinkled Creme Brulee 2 1/3 cups heavy cream 1/3 cup half-and-half 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 8 egg yolks 1/2 cup granulated sugar 4 teaspoons shaved bitter or semisweet chocolate 1/2 cup coarse, raw, or demerara sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. In a medium saucepan, heat the cream, half-and-half and vanilla bean over medium heat just until it comes to a boil. Immediately turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar just until combined. Whisking constantly, gradually pour in the hot cream mixture. Strain the mixture into a pitcher to smooth it and to remove the vanilla bean. Pour the mixture into 4 to 6 ovenproof ramekins and arrange in a hot water bath. Sprinkle the custards with the chocolate shavings. Bake in the center of the oven until almost set but still jiggly in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. (The custard will finish cooking as it cools.) Remove from the water bath and let cool 15 minutes. Tightly cover each ramekin with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic does not touch the surface of the custard. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. When ready to serve, preheat a broiler to very hot (or fire up your kitchen torch). Uncover the ramekins. To make the sugar coating, pour as much sugar as you can fit onto the top of 1 of the custards. Pour off the remaining sugar onto the next custard. Repeat until all the custards are coated. Discard any remaining sugar. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and broil until the sugar is melted and well browned, about 2 minutes.

Add the malt syrup and 1 cup of the flour and stir until you have a smooth batter. Sprinkle on the salt, add the butter, and stir well to incorporate. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour and stir and turn the dough to incorporate it. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, incorporating more flour as necessary. Place the dough in a clean bowl, cover with plastic and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until smooth, softened, about doubled in volume. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and place a baking stone or unglazed quarry tiles, if you have them, (or a baking sheet) on it. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Turn the dough out onto a very lightly floured work surface. Cut into 4 equal pieces and cut each piece in half. Place a parchment paper-lined baking sheet next to your work surface. Work with 2 pieces of dough at a time, keeping the remaining pieces covered with a cotton cloth. Roll each piece of dough out under your palms to a long skinny rope, 24 to 30 inches long, slightly fatter in the middle and very thing at the ends. Press down lightly and push outward toward the ends with both hands as you roll, encouraging the dough to lengthen and stretch. You will find the dough very elastic, and that it springs back and shortens after you let it go, so switch back and forth between the 2 pieces. This will give the gluten strands in the dough an opportunity to relax a little. Once you have a long rope, pick up 1 end with each hand and twist 1 around the other once or twice about 2 inches from the ends, then lay the dough down in a curve on the baking sheet and lay the ends onto the fatter center of the curve to make the classic pretzel shape. Cover lightly while you shape the remaining pretzels. Let the pretzels rise for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 cup of water in a large saucepan until almost boiling. Add the baking soda and stir well to dissolve. Keep the water simmering until just before ready to use. Have a flour-dusted peel (or back of a baking sheet) near your work surface, and a razor blade or sharp knife for slashing the dough. Lift up 1 pretzel with a wide spatula and place it briefly in the hot soda-water bath, leaving it on the spatula. Remove it after 20 seconds and let the water drain off the spatula. Brush the pretzel top with the egg wash, sprinkle with salt, and place the pretzel on the peel. Make a deep 1 to 2-inch slash in the top of the fattest part of the pretzel, then immediately slide it off the peel (or sheet) onto the hot stone or tiles (or baking sheet). Repeat with the remaining pretzels. (If your stone or oven is small, you may have to bake them 4 at a time.) Bake the pretzels for 10 to 12 minutes, until a deep golden brown on top. Place on a rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43463,&quot;Pumpkin Cream Pie 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 3 large eggs 1 (9-inch) frozen pie crust shell, removed from foil tin and placed in glass pie pan 1 cup heavy whipping cream 3 tablespoons brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven. In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, pumpkin puree, cream, brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Using electric hand mixer, add the eggs, 1 at a time incorporating completely between each addition. Pour the filling into the pie shell and bake on a sheet tray until the filling is mostly set and the crust has browned, about 50 to 60 minutes. The center will still look slightly loose. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature. For Whipped Cream: In a chilled bowl, beat the heavy cream with a hand mixer until beginning to thicken. Add the brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice and continue to beat until soft peaks form.

Add the cauliflower, garlic and 1/4 cup of olive oil to a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Roast until the cauliflower is fork tender and lightly charred in places, about 25 minutes. In the meantime, heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, potatoes, celery, onion and thyme. Sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables have slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add the white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any brown bits that have developed at the bottom of the pan. Add the chicken broth, Parmesan rind and roasted cauliflower and garlic. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and cover. Simmer for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the cheese rind from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Remove the cheese rind and discard. In batches, carefully transfer the mixture to a high powered blender. Blend until completely smooth (see Cook&#39;s Note). Once all the soup is blended, add it back into the Dutch oven.

The ingredients should all dissolve into the liquid and when that happens, you can take it off the heat. Let it cool down to room temperature and add the raw chicken breasts. Let this sit in the fridge overnight, or for 24 hours. For the chicken: Combine the all-purpose flour, corn flour, basil, dill, thyme, salt and pepper until thoroughly mixed. Take your brined chicken breasts and, with a meat mallet, tenderize the breast. Take the tenderized breasts and coat them in the dredge. Let sit for 5 minutes. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour in the oil and heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. (If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) Place the coated breasts in your oil. Cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Use tongs to remove the breasts from the oil and place on a resting rack. To plate: First put mashed potatoes on one side of the plate, then rest your toasted bread against the potatoes so it is kind of at an angle. Place the arugula on the bread and the cheese on top of the arugula. Place the freshly fried chicken breast on top of the cheese and ladle the piccata sauce on top of the chicken. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and sweet drop peppers. In a small pot, combine the butter and cream and heat until the butter is melted. Set this off to the side. Place the potatoes, garlic and onions in a large pot and cover with water. Boil until the potatoes are tender. When potatoes are done, strain the water out. Put the cooked potatoes, garlic and onions in a bowl, add your melted butter/cream and salt and white pepper. Mash to desired consistency (we suggest that you keep it a bit chunky to add some texture). First, take the garlic and shallot and half of the olive oil. You\\u2019re going to saut them together until soft, but not brown. Add the remaining oil and sauce ingredients into the pan and bring up to a simmer. Once it is at a simmer, whisk your cornstarch and water together to make a slurry. Add this slurry to your simmering liquid to thicken. Once it has been simmering for 3 minutes, take it off the heat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 43467,&quot;Cinnamon-Spiced Hot Chocolate Cookies 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened Mexican cocoa powder (or substitute by adding 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon to unsweetened cocoa powder) 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 3 tablespoons sweet butter, at room temperature 3 tablespoons margarine 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Generous pinch ground black pepper Generous pinch cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 egg white 1/2 cup dulce de leche, optional 1/4 cup almonds, finely chopped, optional Instructions: Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Mix thoroughly with a whisk and set aside. Combine the sugars in a small bowl and mix well with your fingers pressing out any lumps. (Combine in a food processor if lumps are stubborn.) In a medium mixing bowl, using a hand mixer, beat the butter and margarine until creamy. Add sugar mixture, cinnamon, peppers, and vanilla. Beat on high speed for about 1 minute. Beat in the egg white and until the mixture is smooth. Stop the mixer. Add the flour mixture, beating on the lowest speed, just until incorporated. Gather the dough together with your hands and form it into a neat log, 9 to 10 inches long by 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap. Fold or twist ends of the paper without pinching or flatting the log. Refrigerate at least 45 minutes, or until needed. Put the oven racks in the upper and lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Use a sharp knife to slice rounds of chilled dough, a scant 1/4-inch thick. Arrange the cookies, 1-inch apart, on the prepared baking sheets. Bake 12 to 14 minutes. Rotate the baking sheets from top to bottom and front to back about halfway through. Cookies will puff and crackle on top, and then begin to settle down slightly when done. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and use a metal spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool. Allow the cookies to cool completely before storing or stacking. Store in an airtight container up to 2 weeks, or freeze up to 2 months. To spice things up, after the cookies are baked, let them cool on a wire rack, drizzle with dulce de leche and sprinkle chopped almonds on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43468,&quot;Custard-Style Vanilla Ice Cream 3 cups heavy cream 1 cup whole milk 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped out 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 6 large egg yolks 3/4 cup granulated sugar Pinch of salt Instructions: Combine the heavy cream, milk, vanilla bean and seeds, and vanilla extract in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the mixture almost reaches a gentle simmer, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Meanwhile, set a fine-mesh sieve in a medium bowl (preferably metal), then set the bowl in a large bowl of ice water; set aside. Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and salt in a separate medium bowl. Ladle one-quarter of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture and whisk well. Whisk in another one-quarter of the cream mixture, then pour the cream-egg mixture into the saucepan with the remaining hot cream. Return the saucepan to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon in a figure-eight, until slightly thickened (a thermometer should register 180? F), 6 to 8 minutes. If at any point the mixture starts to simmer, remove from the heat, continue stirring, reduce the heat to medium low, then return to the heat (you do not want the custard to thicken too quickly or the eggs to scramble). Immediately strain the custard through the sieve into the bowl set over the ice water. Return the vanilla bean to the custard and let the custard cool, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate until very cold, at least 1 hour or overnight. Remove the vanilla bean, then transfer the custard to an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer\\u2019s directions until the consistency of soft serve. Transfer to a freezer-safe container, cover and freeze until firm, at least 3 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 43469,&quot;Mango, Coconut and Chia Smoothie 1 teaspoon chia seeds 1/2 cup light coconut milk 1/2 cup chopped peeled ripe mango (about 1/4 mango) 1 tablespoon honey, optional 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice 3/4 cup ice cubes Instructions: Stir the chia seeds and coconut milk together in a small bowl.

Add the sugar and vanilla. Whip to soft, fluffy peaks, about 2 minutes. FOR THE CAKE: Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Line a 12-slot muffin tin with large paper or foil cupcakes liners. Into a large mixing bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 cup of the sugar together--three times. Form a well in the center and add the oil, egg yolks, sherry, and apple juice concentrate. On low speed, mix together, just until blended. In a clean, dry mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites with the pinches of salt and cream of tartar until creamy, foamy, and barely able to hold peaks, about 2 minutes. While sprinkling in the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, whisk until the egg whites have the consistency of shaving cream. Fold 1/3 of the egg whites into the yolk mixture. Fold in the remainder of the whites. Fill the cups of the muffin tin no more than 2/3 full with the batter. Bake for 16 minutes, or until the center springs back when lightly pressed and a cake tester comes out clean. Cool the cupcakes on a rack. Cut 12 (2 1/4-inch) circles and 12 (2 by 8 1/2-inch) bands out of glossy card stock. Wrap the bands around the circles to form cups and secure with tape or decorative ribbon. Do not tape any part of the circle. It must remain free to move. FOR THE FILLING: Mix the preserves and apple juice until smooth. Split the cakes into 2 layers. Spread 1 teaspoon of the preserves in between layers. Place the cakes in the paper holders so that the cake top is even with the paper rim. Fill a pastry bag, fitted with a star tip, with whipped cream. Pipe it to rise 1-inch above the paper rims. Top each with a strawberry. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43473,&quot;Healthy Breakfast Smoothie 1 cup oat milk, plus more as needed (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 cups fresh baby spinach 1 cup frozen banana slices 1 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt 1/2 cup frozen blueberries 1/2 cup frozen raspberries 1/4 cup old-fashioned rolled oats 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal 3 pitted Medjool dates Instructions: Combine the oat milk, spinach, banana, yogurt, blueberries, raspberries, oats, flaxseed and dates in a blender.

Rotate the meat and cut into small bite-size pieces. If you see any more large chunks of fat, gristle or long silvery membrane, cut them off.<br> Sprinkle generously with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Toss the meat around a bit to thoroughly coat with the seasonings.<br> Next, turn on your ventilation fan-you&#39;ll need it! Heat the skillet over medium-high to high heat. As the pan heats, add about 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet. Allow the butter to melt, and then get very brown, before you add the meat.<br> Place some of the meat in the pan in a single layer. It should sizzle loudly when it hits the pan - if it doesn&#39;t, the pan isn&#39;t hot enough. Don&#39;t stir or disrupt the meat for 30 to 45 seconds. You want it to sizzle and brown on one side. Scoop as many steak bites as you can with your spatula and flip them over. Repeat until all the meat is turned. Cook for an additional 30 to 45 seconds-just long enough to sear the outside of the meat but NOT cook the inside.<br> Remove the meat to a clean plate. Add a little more butter to the pan and repeat the cooking process with the next batch just as before. Lastly, when all the meat is nicely browned and removed to the plate, pour all that browned/blackened butter all over the meat.

Trim half of the skin from the eggplant. Leaving a little skin on will add color and texture to the dish. The small, firm eggplants are not too bitter and when they are firm, they will not soak up as much oil, so they do not need to be salted and pressed. However, if you leave all the skin, especially when you use baby eggplant, the skin overpowers the flavor of the flesh and the texture is too tough overall. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cut the eggplant into 1-inch-by-1/2 inch bite size pieces. Add 2 turns of extra-virgin olive oil to the pan, the garlic and the eggplant. Turn and toss the eggplant and season it with salt and pepper. Let it brown lightly at edges, about 5 minutes, then reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook. Add salt and ravioli to the pasta water and simmer to package directions, about 5 or 6 minutes, until just tender. While the pasta cooks, dice tomatoes and add them to the cooking eggplant. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Drain cooked pasta and plate individually or on a platter. Top with eggplant and tomatoes and all of the basil and cheese. If you plate individually, use 1/4 of the basil and 2 ounces of cheese, crumbled, per portion. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 43481,&quot;Artichoke Spinach Dip with Roasted Red Bell Peppers 14 ounces canned (or frozen, thawed) artichoke hearts, drained, diced (not marinated) 9 ounces frozen creamed spinach, thawed 1/2 cup finely diced red onion 1/2 cup diced roasted red bell pepper 1/3 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons jarred pesto sauce 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 package tortilla chips 1 package pita chips Instructions: Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to 350 degrees F.

In a medium saucepan, heat the Guajillo Salsa over medium heat until warm. In a separate medium saute pan over medium-high heat, pour enough vegetable oil to come 1-inch up the sides of the pan. Fry the tortillas until slightly golden but still pliable. Then transfer to the pan with the salsa, turning the tortillas in the salsa until fully coated. Transfer the salsa-coated tortillas to a baking sheet (it&#39;s kind of messy so doing it on a baking sheet keeps it clean). Add a couple tablespoons of sauteed shrimp and a sprinkle of Oaxaca cheese. Roll up like a cigar and place in an 11-by-7-inch glass baking dish. Repeat with 7 or 8 tortillas, fitting snuggly into the dish.<br> Pour the remaining sauce over the prepared enchiladas (There should be some sauce left in the saucepan to top the enchiladas.

Butterfly the chicken: Place on a cutting board, breast-side down with the neck toward you. Using a pair of sharp kitchen shears (and your biceps), cut through the bones on either side of the backbone; the spine should come away in a narrow strip, which you can discard or save for stock. Flip the bird over, breasts facing up and closest to you. Using the heel of your palm and your body weight, push down on the breastbone; you should hear it crack. The chicken should lie flat now. Rotate the drumsticks toward the center line of the body so she looks a little knock-kneed. There you go. You just butterflied a chicken! Slide your fingers between the flesh and the skin over the breasts, thighs and drumsticks. Use a teaspoon to deposit a little of the flavored butter into each pocket and smooth it out over each part of the chicken, making sure the butter is evenly spread, then pat the skin dry. Toss the potato slices with the sunflower oil, season with salt and pepper and let them sit in a bowl at room temperature alongside the chicken for 30 minutes. Give your oven a quick wipe down before preheating it to 500 degrees F. (The high temps will cause any leftover drips to smoke you out of your kitchen! If your oven still smokes, then turn it down to 450 degrees F after the first 10 minutes.) Drain off the water that&#39;s been drawn from the potatoes and pour the potatoes into an even layer in a large cast-iron skillet. Place the chicken on top of the potatoes and tuck the wings under her shoulders. Pop the whole kit &#39;n&#39; kaboodle into the oven. Cook for 20 minutes. Rotate the skillet and cook for 20 more minutes, until the skin is crispy, the juices run clear and the thickest part of the breast registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the chicken from the oven and set aside to rest for 10 minutes on a cutting board, loosely tented with foil. Using a fish spatula or slotted spoon, gently turn the potatoes. If you&#39;d like them crispier, pop them under your broiler for 3 to 5 minutes. Scoop out the potatoes onto a platter, leaving behind the pan grease. Cut the chicken into pieces, place them on top of the potatoes and serve with boldness and courage!

Make small slashes, using the point of a very sharp knife, between the ribs without cutting all the way through. Reserve the ribs. Combine the onion, chiles, and seasonings in a deep stockpot and add water to fill 1/2 full. Bring to a boil over medium heat and add the ribs when the water first reaches the boil. Lower the heat and cook at a simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, depending upon the rib size, or until the ribs are soft and cooked half way through. Prepare the grill to medium high temperature and prepare the wood chips according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Introduce the wood chips to the fire prior to the ribs entering the grill. While the grill is the best method to use for preparing the ribs, the oven may also be used to bake the ribs, however, the applewood chips should not be used in the oven! Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F, place the ribs in an oven proof baking pan, and place them in the center of the oven, liberally basting with the Red cl Glaze. Bake for a total of 25 to 30 minutes, turning the ribs over half way through the baking process and basting with additional sauce. Place the ribs on the grill and liberally baste with the Red cl Glaze, prepared ahead of time. Continue to cook of the grill for 8 to 10 minutes per side or until the ribs are very soft and flexible. Remove from the heat and serve accompanied by the glaze, red beans, and the vegetable of your choice. Combine cornstarch and juice and mix until smooth. Place into a saucepan with the remaining ingredients and cook over medium high heat until mixture thickens. Add seeds from the chiles, and if it gets too thick, add water water.

I saw these little bundles of green beans tied around the middle with Parma ham in an Italian delicatessen and went straight back home and made my own. Top and tail some green beans and cook them in boiling salted water. Remember that the beans need decent cooking, not mere dunking in hot water. Drain them, wait for them to cool, dip them in balsamic vinegar, then cut raggedy thin slices of Parma ham in strips and tie them round the bean-bundles. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 43494,&quot;Sunny Morning Muffins 1 cup strawberries, chopped 1 cup sugar, plus 2 tablespoons 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour Pinch ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon salt 1 ripe banana, mashed 2 large eggs 1/4 cup canola oil 1 lemon, zested 1/2 pint blueberries 1 cup chopped walnuts Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix together strawberries and 2 tablespoons sugar. Let sit 15 minutes until strawberries give off juices. In a small bowl, mix together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together the mashed banana, eggs, oil, 1 cup sugar, strawberries, and lemon zest. Mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until combined. Do not over mix. Fold in blueberries and walnuts. Scoop batter evenly into muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted in center of muffin comes out with a few crumbs but not wet, about 30 minutes. Cool on a rack to room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 43495,&quot;Loaf of Meat 1 egg 1/2 pound ground beef 1/2 pound pork 1/2 pound veal 3/4 cup barbecue sauce 3/4 cup plain bread crumbs 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon seasoned salt 1 teaspoon MSG, optional 1 teaspoon white table sugar 4 tablespoons sweet paprika 4 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoons seasoned salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spread a large sheet of aluminum foil on your counter. Crack egg into center of foil and put all meat on top of egg. Work the egg into the meat and the meats together using your hands until well blended. Flatten out meat. Cover mixture with all remaining ingredients. Work all the ingredients together with your hands until well blended, do not rush. Flatten out resulting mixture into what resembles a very large hamburger patty, making sure that it is fairly uniform, 1 1/2 inches thick at most. Separate coating ingredients into 2 equal parts. First sprinkle garlic powder, salt, paprika, and sugar over the top of the meat patty/loaf. Flip the loaf over and repeat coating on the other side. Place the loaf on a baker&#39;s rack over the top of a casserole dish so the extra fat can drip away from the loaf as it cooks. Put the loaf in the center of the rack and cook for 1 hour. Check by cutting the loaf in half to make sure the center is fully cooked, 1 hour usually does it, but if not then cut out two thick pieces from the center and just put those 2 back into the oven for 10 or 15 more minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 43496,&quot;Churrisimos 1/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 sheet defrosted puff pastry dough Dulce de leche, for dipping Instructions: Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.

Strain into a shallow pan. Freeze several hours until hard. Break the frozen mixture up with a fork and place the chunks in the bowl of a food processor. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of water and process until no lumps remain and the mixture is thick and slushy and lightened in color. Serve at once in goblets to be eaten with a spoon, or refreeze overnight and scoop like sherbet to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 43518,&quot;Basic Pasta Dough 1 1/2 cups unbleached flour 3 eggs Instructions: On a clean dry work surface, make a mound of the flour and, using your fingers, make a well in the center of the mound. Using a fork, break the shell of the eggs one by one and drop the eggs into the center of the well you made of the flour. With the fork, beat the eggs together. Again using the fork, slowly begin to fold the flour in towards the center of the well to incorporate the flour into the beaten eggs. As you mix the flour with the beaten eggs, it will begin to form a doughy mass. Work this mass using your fingers until it begins to lose its moist and sticky character. When the mass begins to feel uniformly dry, begin to work the dough using both hands: kneading with the palms of both hands, pushing from the center of the ball of dough outwards and folding the near edge inwards to begin the kneading cycle again. The kneading stage should take about 10 minutes by hand. After the dough has been fully kneaded, it is time to thin the dough into sheets suitable for cutting. A manual pasta machine works wonders at this stage. Cut the ball of dough into three equal pieces. Form these pieces, by hand, into equal rectangular shape to be passed through the rollers of the pasta machine. Set the cylindrical rollers at their widest opening, put a piece of dough in the space between rollers and crank the handle to pass the dough through. As the sheet of pasta comes out the bottom of the rollers it should be set on a dry cotton towel to rest while you begin on the next piece. Repeat the thinning process with the remaining pieces of pasta, thinning and then setting aside, consecutively so that each piece of pasta is equally rolled out. When all the pasta has passed through the first rolling stage, set the machine to the next setting to begin rolling the pasta thinner. Start the rolling process again, beginning with the first piece of dough and continue with the remaining pieces. As each is rolled thinner set it aside and continue onto the next. As you return to the first piece of dough, set the cylinders one setting closer. Continue in this fashion until the pasta dough has been rolled out as thinly as possible. As the sheets of dough rest, keep them on a cotton towel, to prevent sticking to the work surface. When they are all rolled out you are ready to cut the pasta into the desired shape. They can be cut using the cutting wheels of the rolling machine or by hand using a knife. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 43519,&quot;Pound Cake 8 ounces unsalted butter, at room temperature (2 sticks), plus more for greasing 3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup vegetable shortening<br> 3 cups granulated sugar<br> 5 large eggs<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon table salt<br> 1 cup milk, at room temperature<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a tube pan. Cream the butter and shortening together in a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, starting at the slowest setting and increasing to a medium speed after 3 or 4 minutes. Cream on this setting until done. Add the sugar a little at a time. Add the eggs, 1 egg at a time, mixing after each addition, until well incorporated. In a mixing bowl combine the flour, baking powder and salt, and mix with a wire whisk until thoroughly combined. Reduce the stand mixer setting to the lowest speed. Start adding a little of the dry ingredient mix followed by some milk. Alternate the dry ingredients and the milk ending with dry ingredients. Then add the vanilla extract. Pour the batter into the prepared tube pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the pound cake comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove the pound cake from the oven and let it cool down for 3 to 5 minutes. Gently flip tube pan over to remove the cake, and cool the pound cake on a wire rack. If the pound cake cools too long while still in the tube pan, it might break or not come out. Cool the cake for 30 minutes before dusting with confectioners&#39; sugar. Serve the same day or lightly toasted the following day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43520,&quot;Hot Chocolate Tart 3 cups flour 3/4 cup cocoa powder Scant 1 cup sugar 11 ounces butter 2 yolks 1 tablespoon cream 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 5 ounces bitter sweet chocolate 5 1/2 ounces unsalted butter 3 yolks 3 eggs 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar 1/2 cup flour Serving suggestions: powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and ice cream or whipped cream Instructions: For the Chocolate Sable: This sable crust recipe will provide you with more than enough dough than you need for the Hot Chocolate Tart. You can either cut the recipe in half or make the full amount and freeze the remaining dough for up to two months.<br> In a mixer with the paddle attachment on low, mix together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and butter, blending until sandy.<br> In a separate bowl whisk together the yolks, cream, and vanilla extract.

Line a small baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside. Toast the bread until light golden brown on both sides. Trim the toast using a 4-inch round cookie cutter and using a pastry brush, lightly coat 1 side of each toast with 1/2 teaspoon of the melted butter. Set aside on a wire rack to crisp. Reserve trimmed crusts and crumble into coarse bread crumbs to be used as garnish. In a large nonstick skillet or saute pan sear the ham slices until lightly golden, about 1 minute. Set aside. Season each chicken breast with 1/4 teaspoon of the Essence and season lightly with salt and pepper. In the already hot large skillet or saute pan, heat the oil over high heat. Add the chicken and sear until lightly colored, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to the prepared baking sheet and cook until cooked through, 12 to 14 minutes. While the chicken breasts are finishing in the oven, make the pan sauce: Return the skillet to medium-high heat and melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the fat and juices remaining in the pan. When the butter is foamy, add the shallots, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, until the shallots are soft, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and herbes de Provence and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste, wine, and tomatoes; bring to a boil, and cook, stirring, until the wine is reduced, about 1 minute. Add the stock, return to the boil, and cook until the mixture is reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Add the heavy cream, stir, and place the chicken breasts in the pan. Top each chicken breast with a piece of ham and baste with the sauce; continue to cook until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and swirl in the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, a piece or 2 at a time. Remove from the heat, adjust the seasoning to taste, and cover to keep warm until ready to serve. To serve, place 1 toast round in the center of 4 large plates and place 1 ham-topped chicken breast on top. Drizzle each portion with the sauce, garnish with chopped fresh parsley and the reserved bread crumbs and serve immediately. Combine all ingredients thoroughly.

Line a 10 by 15-inch jellyroll pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang at each short end. Mix the ground nuts with the cocoa, espresso, spices, salt and pepper in a small bowl. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar to combine. Rest the bowl in a hot water bath (hot to the touch, about 120 degrees) and whisk until slightly above body temperature (100 degrees F). Remove bowl from the water bath and using a heavy-duty mixer, whip mixture, preferably with a whisk attachment at medium speed until it is light ivory in color and very fluffy, about 6 minutes. Add the vanilla extract in the final minutes of whipping. Fold in half of the ground pecan mixture until incorporated and then fold in remaining pecan mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Bake 8 to 11 minutes or until the cake is set on top and springs back when lightly pressed in the center. Remove pan from the oven, run a knife around the edges to loosen the cake from the sides of the pan. Lift the cake by the foil overhang to remove from pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Cover the cake with a sheet of aluminum foil, folding the foil in a tent-like fashion so that it does not stick to the cake but keeps the moisture in while the cake cools. Cool for 30 to 60 minutes. Lift the cake in its foil off the wire rack to the work surface. Roll the cake until it forms the shape of a log. Wrap securely in aluminum foil and freeze. About 30 minutes before serving, remove cake from freezer to a serving plate; discard foil. Sprinkle top of roll with powdered sugar. Using a serrated knife, cut slices, diagonally.

Spread extra-wide aluminum foil a little longer than the length of the fish on the work surface and top with an equally long layer of plastic wrap. Lay 1 half of the salmon, skin-side down, on the plastic wrap. Sprinkle the rub onto the flesh of the salmon. Place the second half of the salmon, flesh-side down, on top the first half. Fold the plastic over to cover, and then close the foil edges together and crimp tightly around the fish. Place the wrapped fish onto a sheet pan and top with another sheet pan. Weigh down with a brick or 2 and refrigerate for 12 hours. Flip the fish over and refrigerate another 12 hours. Some juice will leak out during the process so make sure there&#39;s a place for the runoff to gather. Unwrap the fish and rinse off the cure mixture with cold water. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels and place in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator) until the surface of the fish is dry and matte-like, 1 to 3 hours depending on humidity. A fan may be used to speed the process. Prepare a smoker with alderwood chips. Smoke the salmon over the smoldering chips, keeping the temperature inside the smoker at about 200 degrees F, until the thickest part of the fish registers 150 degrees F, about 1 hour. Serve immediately or cool to room temperature, wrap tightly and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Place the salmon on a platter. Drizzle with some of the reserved Apple Cider Vinaigrette, and top with the Salad of Apple, Dried Cherries, Hazelnuts and Greens. Serve. Whisk together the vinegar, honey, mustard and salt and pepper, to taste, in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. Reserve some to drizzle over the fish. Add the greens, apples, cherries and hazelnuts to the remaining vinaigrette and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43592,&quot;Savory Asparagus Spring Rolls 6 stalks thick asparagus, peeled and trimmed 12 small spring roll wrappers 1/4 cup oyster sauce 1 tablespoon cornstarch blended with 1 tablespoon warm water 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, toasted 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds, toasted Honey, for brushing Instructions: Bring a medium pan of water to a boil. Blanch the asparagus until crisp-tender, 1 to 3 minutes depending on the thickness of the asparagus. Plunge the asparagus into ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and pat dry. Cut each asparagus in half so that you have 2 pieces about 3 inches each. For the stalk halves of the asparagus: Place a spring roll wrapper on a flat surface with the corner pointed toward you. Lightly brush the center of the wrapper with oyster sauce. Lay a piece of the stalk-half of asparagus across the wrapper from corner to corner. Fold in the side corners of the wrapper toward the middle, fold up the bottom corner and then roll up. Seal the top of the wrapper by brushing some of the cornstarch mixture along the edges of the wrapper to help seal. Put the rolls onto a plate seam-side down while making the remaining rolls. For the spear end of the asparagus: Place a spring roll wrapper on a flat surface with square to you. Lightly brush the middle of the wrapper with oyster sauce. Lay a piece of asparagus with the tip overhanging the edge away from you. Fold up the bottom toward the center. Fold in one side of the wrapper toward the middle and then roll up. Use cornstarch mixture along the edge of the wrapper as a paste to help seal. Put onto a plate seam-side down while preparing the remaining rolls. Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat and add some of the vegetable oil. Add the rolls a few at a time and shallow fry, turning as they become golden brown; do not fry too many at one time and overcrowd the skillet. Once golden, remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels. On a small plate, mix together the black and white sesame seeds. Brush the cooked rolls with a little honey, and then roll them in the sesame seeds and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 43593,&quot;Chicken Marsala 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1/4 cup thinly sliced prosciutto<br> 1/2 cup stemmed and halved porcini mushrooms<br> 1/4 cup marsala wine<br> 3/4 cup chicken stock<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish Instructions: Thinly pound the chicken, then sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl until evenly combined; set aside. Beat the butter, sugar and nutmeg in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the whole egg plus yolk and vanilla extract; mix until completely incorporated. Reduce the speed to low and mix in the dry ingredients until just combined. Using a 1 1/2-tablespoon cookie scoop, drop level scoops of dough about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets (about 12 cookies per sheet). Gently roll each scoop of dough into a ball and flatten it into a round about 1/3 inch thick. Bake the cookies one sheet at a time until lightly golden brown on the bottom, 10 to 11 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let cool completely. Let the oven to come back up to temperature before baking the second sheet of cookies. For the frosting: Meanwhile, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter, vanilla and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld mixer). Beat on low speed to mix the ingredients together, then increase the speed to medium high and beat until light, fluffy and smooth, about 3 minutes. Mix in as much milk as needed if the frosting is too stiff to spread easily. Spread about 2 teaspoons of frosting on top of each cookie. Top each with a corn snack off-center, with the pointy end facing out; add the chips and sprinkles so they appear to be spilling out of the cornucopia. Any leftover cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 43616,&quot;Steamed Mussels with Leeks, Garlic, Thyme, White Wine, and Butter 3 pounds mussels Extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons butter 2 leeks, white parts only, finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced 1/4 bunch fresh thyme 1 cup white wine 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Rinse the mussels under cold running water while scrubbing with a vegetable brush. Remove the stringy mussel beards with your thumb and index finger as you wash them. Discard any mussels with broken shells. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the leeks, garlic, and thyme and cook until the vegetables cook down to a pulp, about 5 minutes. Add the mussels and give everything a good toss. Add the white wine. Cover and steam over medium-high heat for 10 minutes, until the mussels open.

Remove 1 1/2 cups soup from the pot and transfer to a blender; puree until smooth. Return to the pot and stir to combine. Add more gochujang if desired, 1/2 teaspoon at a time. Divide the soup among bowls. Top with sliced scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43618,&quot;Scallop Ceviche with Melon, Chili, and Mint 2 pounds fresh bay or sea scallops, preferably with shells Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Juice of 3 oranges Juice of 3 lemons Juice of 3 limes Zest of 1 orange, finely grated Zest of 1 lemon, finely grated Zest of 1 lime, finely grated 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 small ripe cantaloupe, halved, seeded, peeled, and cut into small cubes 1/2 bunch fresh mint, hand-torn, plus more for garnish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 fresh red chili, cut in paper-thin circles Instructions: Start by assessing the scallops at the fish store. I usually inspect every one just to make sure that they&#39;re all in perfect shape, i.e. not torn, and fresh with a sweet ocean smell. The next step is to remove the side mussel that connects the scallop to its shell; it&#39;s not hard to miss; just pull it off with your fingers. Keep the shells to serve the ceviche in. Using a sharp knife, slice the scallops in half lengthwise into discs; the thinner they are, the faster they&#39;ll \\cook. Put the scallops in a glass bowl and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper. Put the citrus juices, zest, and sugar in a blender and give it a whirl to combine. Add the olive oil and blend again to emulsify. Pour the marinade over the scallops; there should be enough juice to allow the scallops to float freely. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours, until the scallops are opaque, i.e. cooked from the acid in the fruit. In a separate bowl, combine the cantaloupe, mint, and chili; season with salt and pepper and toss gently to combine. To serve: Spoon the scallop ceviche into the shells with a little bit of the citrus juice, and top with a spoonful of the cantaloupe salad. Garnish each serving with some fresh mint. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 43619,&quot;Fondue for Two 1/2 cup very hot coffee 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup unsweetened, Dutch processed cocoa 1/2 cup light corn syrup 4 ounces semi sweet chocolate, chopped 1 ounce unsalted butter 6 ounces white chocolate 1/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 2 teaspoons dark rum and 1 teaspoon framboise 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter Chocolate covered banana bites Fresh fruit Chocolate pound cake, cubed Toasted coconut Instructions: In a medium bowl, whisk together the coffee, sugar and cocoa.

Use a ladle to fill the plastic mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the egg should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the plastic mold clean on the side of the bowl or with a knife and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean again with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. If the chocolate is properly tempered, it will easily release from the mold. To unmold, gently push down on one side of the molded chocolate and the opposite side will lift from the mold. Use melted chocolate to glue together the two halves. In a professional kitchen, a chef often heats a baking sheet and gently presses each half against the warm metal to melt the edges a little bit. Then we press them together and set aside until the chocolate sets. Cut a circle from heavy cardboard that is large enough to serve as a base for your watering can. Use a pastry brush to cover one side with chocolate. Set aside until the chocolate is set. Use this as the base for your watering can. Apply more melted chocolate to the bottom of the egg and glue it to the base. Allow it to set. Use a hot serrated knife to cut the top third off of the egg. Be gentle and let the heat of the knife do the work. If you press too hard, the egg will break. If that happens, you may be able to use tempered chocolate to glue it back together. This cut creates the opening to the top of the watering can. You can adjust the size of the opening to accommodate the size of bunnies you are making. To make the spout: Roll a piece of acetate paper into a cone shape that is the correct proportion for the size of the body. Fill the cone with tempered chocolate. Set aside until it sets. When it is set, unwrap the acetate. Use a warm serrated knife to cut off the tip until it is an appropriate size for the size of your watering can. To make the handle, first draw the shape with a pencil onto a piece of parchment paper. Make one handle then make the mirror image of it. Put some melted chocolate into a bowl. Stir in about 2 teaspoons of water so the chocolate will seize. Place this chocolate in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip. Use the chocolate to trace over your handles. Set aside until the chocolate sets. When set, use a little melted chocolate to glue together the flat sides of the 2 handles. To attach the spout and handle: Use melted chocolate to attach the spout and handle to the watering can. You can prop the spout against something while the chocolate sets. Place the spout on one side and the handle on the opposite side. If you want to make the watering can appearance to be rusty or as if it is made of velvet, use the chocolate paint sprayer technique explained in the Easter bonnet recipe. Don&#39;t forget to place the watering can in the freezer first. Use the same molding technique used for the body of the watering can to make the bodies and heads of the bunnies. I used egg shapes for the bodies and round molds for the heads. You can also use the smallest dome on the round molds to make little cheeks. I made one bunny a little larger than the other. I made additional molds from the smallest dome and cut them in half to create eyelids for the smaller bunny. To hide all of the seams on the bunnies, you can use the paint sprayer to spray the bunnies before you attach the eyes, nose and tongue. Do not put the bunny in the refrigerator like you do with the watering can. That way, you&#39;ll get a different texture. To make the ears, nose and tongue: I made the ears by cutting out the ear shapes from parchment paper. Use a pastry brush to paint the tempered chocolate onto the parchment paper. When the chocolate sets, peel off the parchment paper. If you want to bend one ear, do that before the chocolate sets. To attach the ears, use the tip of a paring knife to create a small hole at the top of the head for each ear. It will help if you use a hot knife. Dip the end of the ears in melted chocolate and then slide them gently into the holes you made. Allow them to set. You can make the nose and tongue out of modeling chocolate (if you have it from the previous project) or marzipan. Make any shape that strikes your fancy. Adhere the pieces to the face using chocolate to \\glue\\ them in place. To make the eyes, use the smallest circle of the mold (or anything you can find at home). Make three cornets. Fill one with tempered dark chocolate, one with tempered milk chocolate and one with tempered white chocolate. Use the white chocolate to place a small drop in the center of the mold to create the pupil. Use the milk chocolate to make the pupil by piping a slightly larger amount on top of the pupil. Finish with a larger drop of white chocolate directly on top of the other two to create the white of the eye. If you&#39;ve used a mold with a rounded bottom, the eyes will have a 3-dimensional quality. Affix the eyes by \\gluing\\ them with a little dark chocolate. To make the butterflies: It is easy to reproduce any line drawing in chocolate. Place the drawing under a sheet of acetate. The chocolate against the acetate will take on a nice shine. For this reason, I like to make that side the front of the drawing. Make 2 cornets and fill one with tempered dark chocolate and the other with tempered white chocolate. Use the dark chocolate to trace the outline of the drawing onto the acetate. Use both white and dark chocolate to shade the drawing as appropriate. Be sure to completely fill the inside of the drawing so you end up with a solid re-creation of the drawing. It will also be easier to unmold and handle if there are no gaps in the drawing. Place the acetate in the refrigerator to help the drawing to set. To unmold, simply peel the acetate from the front of the chocolate drawing. Final assembly: Fill the bottom half of your watering can with crumpled plastic wrap or paper. This will create a seat for the bunnies. Set the bunnies inside the can so they rest on top of the filling. Use a little melted chocolate to attach the butterflies to the watering can. If you want to write \\Happy Easter\\ on the front of the watering can, do it with melted chocolate that you&#39;ve placed in a cornet. You can practice on an acetate sheet before you move to the final project. Enjoy! Tip: Never coat a mold with fat when you use chocolate. It does not help the chocolate to unmold. Chocolate is like plaster - it retracts when it cools. Chocolate cannot be molded onto any porous surface, like wood or a sponge. In order of preference, the best types of molds are plastic, stainless steel, and glass. Be careful with glass because it retains temperature, whether it is hot or cold. If the glass mold is slightly warm or cold, it will untemper the chocolate before it has time to set. When molding chocolate, always remember that the chocolate takes on the temperature of the mold.

After blending these ingredients estimate adding a large tablespoon for each leaf. Lay the de-stemmed and rinsed grape leaf shiny side down, place portion of rice mixture in the center near the stem end and roll keeping stuffing close to end of leaf. Start folding in the sides and continue to roll keeping ends closed and stuffing secure inside. Lay \\stem\\ down (the end of the roll) in a flat pan and continue doing so until each one is side by side close together, keeping them from opening when cooking. You can often place at least 2 layers if making large amounts, but more layering is not recommended. Pour over leaves enough water to reach top layer only and bring to a boil and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes. Add more water only if necessary, so as not to burn the leaves. Water should all be evaporated in this period of time if not, drain remaining water. Remove from burner and let cool for about 1/2 hour. Then transfer in single layers into flat pans and pour over a mixture of lemon and olive oil and place in refrigerator cool and marinate overnight or at least several hours before serving.

Start the mixer on slow for a minute, and then switch to high for another couple of minutes until the dough pulls away from the bowl. Then slow the mixer down to medium speed and slowly add the remaining 1 cup warm water. Once the water is absorbed, return the mixer to high and let the dough beat for 10 minutes.<br> Remove from the bowl. Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Form into balls, spray with nonstick spray, wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in a warmer area for 20 minutes.<br> Spray the counter or large cutting board with the nonstick spray and begin to roll the dough with a rolling pin. Roll until a consistent thickness of 1/4-inch. Then spray with nonstick spray. (If it gets too thin, that&#39;s ok as you can re-ball and roll out again.) Use about a 3-inch circle cutter and press down hard and give a slight twist to completely separate from the rest of the dough, continue this throughout the entire piece.<br> Remove the scraps and in-betweens, save, re-ball and re-roll. Then flip the circle cut-outs; they are ready to be stuffed.<br> For the mashed potato filling: Boil the red potatoes, leaving the skin on, in a stock pot with 2 tablespoons kosher salt. Once the potatoes are soft, drain off the water and place in the mixer bowl with the dough hook or paddle attachment. Add the butter right away so it will start to melt. Then add the cream cheese, sour cream, granulated garlic, onion powder and black and white peppers into the bowl and mix on a medium speed. Mix until smooth and free of all lumps. Now add the farmer&#39;s cheese and mix on high for a couple minutes until a little fluffy. Season with kosher salt. Loosen with milk if necessary. Let cool.<br> Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with nonstick spray (so the delicate dough doesn&#39;t stick. Place about 1 teaspoon of the potato and cheese filling in the center of all the cut-outs. (I like to use a bamboo skewer or large toothpick to remove the filling from the spoon to keep your hands clean.) Then pick up the dough with two hands and fold over the filling. Slightly pull out both sides at the base of the fold, then continue to pull, then pinch, and form and seal as you continue around the half moon. Double check for any areas that aren&#39;t smooth or completely sealed. Repeat. Place on the prepared baking sheet.<br> In a large saucepan bring three-quarters of a gallon of water and 1 tablespoon kosher salt to a rapid boil. One by one, drop in the pierogis.

Once the oil is hot, saute the pierogis; they should sizzle once they hit the oil. After a minute or so, flip them, looking for a golden brown color. Plate with the sauteed onions and a side of sour cream for dipping. Drizzle with the butter and sprinkle with the parsley.

Set up the grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium. If using a charcoal grill, place a large drip pan in the center. If using a gas grill, place all the wood chips in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and preheat the grill to high until you see smoke, then reduce the heat to medium. Remove the packet of giblets from the body cavity of the chicken and set aside for another use. Remove and discard the fat just inside the body and neck cavities. Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water, drain, and blot dry inside and out with paper towels. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the rub inside the body and neck cavities of the chicken. Rub the bird all over on the outside with 2 teaspoons of the rub. If you have the patience, you can put some of the rub under the skin being careful not to tear it. Spoon the remaining 2 teaspoons of rub through the holes into the beer in the can. Don&#39;t worry if it foams up, this is normal. Insert the beer can into the body cavity of the chicken and spread out the legs to form a sort of tripod. Tuck the wing tips behind the chicken&#39;s back. When ready to cook, if using a charcoal grill, toss all the wood chips on the coals. Stand the chicken up in the center of the hot grate, over the drip pan and away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until the skin is a dark golden brown and very crisp and the meat is cooked to an internal temperature of 180 degrees, about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. If using a charcoal grill, you&#39;ll need to add 12 fresh coals per side after 1 hour. Using tongs, carefully transfer the chicken in its upright position on the beer can to a platter and present it to your guests. Let rest 5 minutes, and then carefully remove the chicken from the beer can. Take care not to spill the hot beer or otherwise burn yourself. Quarter or carve the chicken and serve with the Cola Barbecue Sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir to blend together. Store the rub in an airtight jar away from heat or light. It will keep for at least 6 months. Combine all the ingredients in a heavy non-reactive saucepan and gradually bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat slightly to obtain a gentle simmer. Simmer the sauce until reduced by 1/4, about 6 to 8 minutes. Use right away or transfer to a large jar, cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate. The sauce will keep for several months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43656,&quot;Moroccan Spiced Red Lentil Soup 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 medium yellow onions, chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced or pureed 4 stalks of celery, washed and sliced crosswise 1/2-inch thick 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 generous pinch saffron 1 bay leaf 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 large or 2 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced 1 pound red lentils 2 quarts water 1 cup cooked wheat berries 6 Italian Roma tomatoes, cored and diced 1/2 bunch cilantro, washed, leaves sliced thin crosswise 1 loaf long skinny bread, sliced on the diagonal 3/4-inch thick 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil or softened butter Instructions: Heat olive oil in Dutch oven over medium heat.

Add the cream cheese and pulse until fine crumbs form. Add the butter and pulse to pea-size coarse crumbs. Add the ice water and vodka, then pulse until combined. The dough will be light and fluffy but will not come together in a ball. There is no need to rest the dough or chill it before rolling. Lightly sprinkle some rice flour on your work surface and empty out the pie dough. Using your hands, form the dough into a round disk. Sprinkle a little more rice flour on top of the dough. Roll out the dough a little, then fold the dough in half. Repeat 2 more times. Roll out the dough into a circle a little bigger than a 9-inch pie pan. Transfer the dough to the pie pan. Crimp the dough edges and place in the freezer while the oven heats. Place a cookie sheet in the bottom third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line the pie crust with parchment paper or nonstick foil and weight it down with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the pie weights and parchment. Dock or prick the bottom of the crust with a fork. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Return the pie crust to the oven and bake an additional 15 minutes or until golden brown on the bottom and sides. Cool completely on a wire rack before filling. Meanwhile, make the lemon filling. For the lemon filling: Place 2 tablespoons water in a ramekin or small bowl. Sprinkle the gelatin over the top. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes to bloom. Place the sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, and pinch of salt in a medium saucepan. Stir together. Add 1/2 cup water and stir until combined. Heat over medium-high heat, whisking often until it reaches a boil and thickens. Whisk in the lemon juice and cook for 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat. Whisk 1/4 of the hot liquid into the egg yolks, a little at a time. Return the tempered egg yolks to the saucepan. Cook, whisking, until the mixture comes to a simmer and thickens slightly, the mixture will be pretty loose at this point. Strain the lemon filling into a bowl. Whisk in the butter, one piece at a time, until incorporated. Add the gelatin. Stir until smooth, and then stir in the cream. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool at least 20 minutes. Pour the warm, but not hot filling into the cooled pie crust. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight until set. For the meringue: Place 2-inches water in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Fit a bowl over the pan of simmering water, creating a double boiler. The bottom of the pan should not touch the water. Place the sugar, 1/2 cup egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt into the bowl. Whisk to combine. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sugar is dissolved and the eggs are foamy and warm, but not hot to the touch, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Whip the egg white mixture to stiff peaks using a mixer. Mound the egg whites over the pie and spread using the back of a spoon to create peaks. Brown the meringue using a kitchen blow torch, if desired or place the pie under a broiler to brown the peaks. Cream cheese and vodka help make an easy to roll and tender pie crust. A little rice flour decreases the gluten and adds a nice texture. There is no need to chill or rest the dough before rolling. Also, it is a breeze to roll out. Cornstarch prevents the egg yolks from curdling. Knowing when to add the lemon juice prevents a runny filling. A little unflavored gelatin makes the perfect filling... it is easy to slice without being too thick or gelled. Heating the egg whites and sugar together before whipping makes a more stable meringue and one that does not weep, bead or shrink! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43665,&quot;Marinated Coleslaw 1 large head of cabbage, shredded 1 onion, chopped fine 1 large green bell pepper, chopped fine 1 stalk celery, chopped fine 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 cup cider vinegar 3/4 cup cottonseed oil or vegetable oil 1 tablespoon salt Instructions: Combine cabbage, onion, pepper, celery, and sugar.

Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 43666,&quot;Eggplant Bread 1 large eggplant (about 1 pound 9 ounces) Nonstick cooking spray, for greasing the pan 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/4 cups shelled, salted pistachios, roughly chopped 1/2 cup confectioners\\u2019 sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons honey 1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt Instructions: Prepare a grill for high heat. Pierce the eggplant a few times with a fork or knife. Place on the grill, cover, and cook the eggplant, turning every 8 to 10 minutes, until completely charred on all sides and the flesh is soft when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and cool slightly for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray an 8 1/2-inch-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Remove the eggplant to a cutting board and squeeze gently to crack the skin so the flesh is exposed. Use a spoon to remove the flesh into a colander set over a bowl (you should have about 1 1/3 cups of flesh). Let it sit for 10 minutes to remove some of the moisture. Transfer the flesh to a large bowl. Add the vegetable oil, vanilla and eggs to the bowl and whisk until well combined. Whisk the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and kosher salt in a medium bowl. Add the flour mixture to the eggplant mixture and fold with a rubber spatula until everything is combined. Fold in 1 cup of the pistachios. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with just a few crumbs sticking to it, 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Flip the pan over to remove the bread and let cool completely on a wire rack, 40 to 50 minutes. Whisk the confectioners\\u2019 sugar, butter, honey and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl until smooth and thick. Spread the frosting on top of the bread, then sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup pistachios and the flakey sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 43667,&quot;Thai Chicken Spring Rolls 1 cup leftover vegetables from \\Thai Chicken Wraps\\ recipe 1/4 cup leftover chicken from \\Thai Chicken Wraps\\ recipe 8 spring roll wrappers 1 to 2 cups canola oil 1/4 cup leftover peanut dressing from \\Thai Chicken Wraps\\ recipe Instructions: In a medium bowl, toss together the leftover chicken and vegetables. Put a wrapper onto a clean work surface with the corners of the wrapper facing North, South, East and West. Spoon about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the filling on the bottom third of the wrapper. Dampen the edges of the wrapper with some water to help it seal. Fold the bottom edge of the wrapper up over the filling and roll up half way. Fold the 2 side corners in toward the middle and continue to roll, pulling back slightly as you roll, to ensure a tightly wrapped spring roll. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Cover with a damp towel to keep them from drying out. Heat the canola oil in a high-sided skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Add the spring rolls, 3 or 4 at a time, to the hot oil. Fry on all sides until crispy and golden brown in color, about 2 to 3 minutes per s side. Transfer the rolls to a serving platter and serve with the peanut dressing, for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 43668,&quot;Baker, Baker 3/4 cup oats 3/4 cup flour 2/3 cup light brown sugar, packed 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger Pinch kosher salt 1 stick cold unsalted butter, diced 4 Braeburn apples (Fuji will substitute) 4 teaspoons honey Instructions: In a bowl combine all the dry ingredients and diced butter. Rub mixture briskly between finger tips until it forms small moist clumps in a loose sandy mixture. Refrigerate while preparing the apples. Cut a small layer off the bottom of each apple to create a flat, stable bottom surface. With a small paring knife, cut a cylindrical cone out of the top of the apple, moving about 1-inch outside of the core, similar to removing the top of a pumpkin when carving a Jack O&#39;Lantern. Remove the top and discard. With a melon baller or a teaspoon, remove the remaining core and seeds taking care not to puncture the base of the apple. Place apples on a baking sheet or pie dish and fill each center with a teaspoon of honey. Spoon in mixture, packing lightly until heaped and overflowing over sides of the apples. Bake in oven at 350 degrees on the top or middle rack for 40 minutes or until filling is golden brown and the tip of a paring knife can be inserted into the side of the apple with little or no resistance. Let apples stand for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 43669,&quot;Creamy Cole Slaw One 3-pound head green cabbage, trimmed, shredded, and chopped 1 medium carrot, grated 1/3 cup minced red onion, soaked in cold water for 5 minutes and drained 1 tablespoon minced flat leaf parsley leaves 1/2 cup prepared mayonnaise 1/2 cup sour cream 3 tablespoons unsweetened pineapple juice 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon celery seed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, carrot, onion, and parsley.

I prefer to eat a massive amount of this, and nothing else (I can eat the whole lot myself) rather than have it more meanly as a starter unless, in a life outside of this chapter&#39;s parameters, I&#39;m expecting company, in which case it would happily stretch to 4 people, ready to dunk each crisp piece of squid into the garlic mayonnaise over pre-dinner drinks. I feel the ghost of Elizabeth David spitting at my calling this &#39;crispy&#39; squid, but that&#39;s what I habitually call it at home, and I beg forgiveness of the pedants, with whom I have some sympathy. Heat the oil in a smallish saucepan and while it&#39;s left to heat up cut the thawed squid into 1/2-inch rings. Put the cornstarch, semolina and seasoning into a plastic freezer bag. Add the squid rings and tentacles and then toss to coat. When the oil is hot enough, which is when it sizzles up fiercely when you drop in a small cube of bread, fry the squid in batches to get the most golden crunchiness. A couple of minutes per batch is all you should need Mince the garlic into the mayonnaise to serve alongside the fried squid. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 43677,&quot;Salmon Tempura with Daikon Salad 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups cold club soda 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup cornstarch 2 teaspoons salt 12 asparagus spears, trimmed and bottom 2 inches peeled 3 (8 by 8-inch) sheets nori 3 (4 by 8-inch) sheets fresh salmon, about 3/8-inch thick, **see cook&#39;s note 1 tablespoon black sesame seeds Salt and freshly ground black pepper 9 shiso leaves Vegetable oil, for deep-frying Daikon, Carrot, and Cucumber Salad, recipe follows Daikon radish sprouts, for garnish Special equipment: a bamboo sushi mat and bamboo skewers 1/4 pound trimmed daikon radish, julienned 2 carrots, julienned 1/4 pound English cucumber, julienned 1/3 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup honey mustard dressing, homemade or prepared Instructions: For the tempura batter, place 1 1/4 cups of the club soda in a medium mixing bowl and sift the flour and cornstarch over it. Add the salt and whisk until evenly blended. The batter should be the consistency of thin pancake batter. If necessary, add additional soda water 1 tablespoon at a time to reach correct consistency. Cover and refrigerate for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add the asparagus, blanch for 6 minutes, then shock in ice water and drain. Place a bamboo sushi mat on a work surface with the slats crosswise. Center 1 sheet of nori on the sushi mat. Place a sheet of salmon on top of the nori, leaving a 1-inch border of nori uncovered along the top. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of black sesame seeds evenly over the salmon and season with salt and black pepper. Place 3 shiso leaves side by side, then add 4 asparagus spears side by side horizontally about 1-inch above the bottom edge. Grasping the bamboo mat, the nori, and the edge of the salmon on the bottom, tightly roll up, enclosing the asparagus. Firmly press the 1-inch border at the top to create a seal. (The moisture from the salmon will be enough to make the 2 pieces of nori adhere to each other.) The roll should be about 1 3/4 inches in diameter. Carefully remove the bamboo mat, transfer the salmon roll to a plate, and refrigerate. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, making 2 more salmon rolls. The rolls can be refrigerated for up to 2 hours at this point. With a serrated knife, cut each of the 3 salmon rolls in half crosswise so that you have 6 (4-inch) rolls. In a large heavy saucepan, heat 4 inches of vegetable oil to 375 degrees F. Insert 1 long bamboo skewer crosswise through 1 end of a salmon roll, then insert another skewer through the other end. Using the ends of the skewers as handles, dip the roll into the tempura batter so that it is completely coated, letting the excess batter drip back into the bowl. Carefully immerse the roll in the hot oil, and after 10 seconds, gently push it off the skewers to float free in the oil. Fry until batter is crisp, about 1 to 2 minutes more. With a skimmer, transfer the first roll to a paper towel-lined plate and keep warm in a very low oven. With the skimmer, remove any leftover bits of batter from the oil so that they don&#39;t burn and smoke. Repeat with the remaining 5 rolls. With a serrated knife, quickly trim off the ends of the rolls and cut each into 5 (3/4-inch-long) rounds. Make a tall mound of the salad in the center of each of 6 serving plates. Lean 5 pieces of roll against the salad around the base. Dot the remaining 1/2 cup of honey mustard dressing (from the salad recipe) around the outer edge of the plates. Garnish the salad on each plate with a pinch of daikon sprouts. In a medium mixing bowl, toss the julienned vegetables with the salt, pepper, and 1/2 cup of the dressing. Reserve remaining dressing for garnish. **Chef&#39;s Note for preparing salmon slices: Either ask your fishmonger to cut the salmon sheets for you, or buy a fillet of salmon cut from the tail section (where it is the thinnest) and proceed as follows. Make a guide for your knife by placing large wooden chopsticks about 6 inches apart on a cutting board. Place the salmon fillet between them lengthwise and rest the chopsticks against the long edges of the fish. Holding a very long, sharp filleting knife so that 1 flat side of the blade is parallel to the cutting board, slice the salmon horizontally while steadying the top of the salmon with your other hand. When you have cut one sheet, lift it off the fillet and repeat the process a second and a third time, until you have 3 sheets (the blade may end up resting against the guides). Trim the salmon slices to 4 by 8 inches and reserve the trimmings for another use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 43678,&quot;Ham and Camembert Quiche 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more, for dusting 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, diced and kept very cold 4 teaspoons cider or white vinegar 1/3 cup ice water, plus more, if needed 1/4 cup thinly sliced chives 1 cup sliced Camembert cheese 3/4 cup chopped ham 1 1/4 cups half-and-half 3 large eggs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon Arugula salad, for serving, optional Instructions: Put the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor fitted with a metal blade and pulse to combine. Add about a third of the chilled butter cubes and process until the butter is absorbed. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the butter is the size of peas, 5 or 6 pulses. Add the vinegar. Then, while pulsing quickly a few times, add the ice water through the tube. Squeeze some dough between your fingers; it should just hold its shape without feeling wet. If it is crumbly, add more ice water a tablespoon at a time. Pulse quickly; do not overwork the dough or the crust will be tough. Wrap the dough loosely in a large piece of plastic wrap, then firmly press and flatten it into a thin round. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Lightly dust a work surface with flour, then roll the dough into an 11- to 12-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Center the dough in a 9-inch pie plate, with an even overhang all around. Fold the edges and flute or crimp. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Press a piece of foil over the chilled crust, then fill with pie weights, raw beans or rice. Bake to set the crust, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and bake until the crust is light brown, 5 to 10 minutes more. Let cool slightly before adding the filling. Sprinkle the chives evenly into the crust, then top evenly with the Camembert and ham. Whisk together the half-and-half, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Stir in the tarragon. Pour the custard over the filling. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until set, 35 to 50 minutes. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving warm or at room temperature. Place slices on serving plates with arugula salad if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 43679,&quot;Instant Pot Hummus 1 cup dried chickpeas (about 6 1/2 ounces), rinsed and drained 3 cloves garlic<br> 1 dried bay leaf<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 1 large lemon)<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br> 1/3 cup tahini, well stirred<br> Sweet or smoked paprika, for sprinkling<br> Sliced fresh vegetables and pita chips, for serving Instructions: Add the dried chickpeas, garlic, bay leaf, 2 teaspoons salt and 6 cups water to a 6- or 8- quart Instant Pot? multi-cooker.

Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, then add the egg and vanilla and beat until combined, about 2 minutes. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed just until the dough comes together in a smooth mass, 1 to 2 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and flatten into a disk. Refrigerate until firm but still malleable, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment.<br> Cut the dough in half. Roll one half on a lightly floured surface to between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick. Use a 2 1/2-inch cutter to cut as many rounds as you can. Transfer to the baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart. Repeat with the other piece of dough. Gather the scraps together and roll once more to get additional rounds, if desired. You should get about 30 to 34 cookies. (If the dough softens too much while rolling or rerolling, chill it for 15 minutes before proceeding.) Bake 2 pans of the cookies, rotating the sheets halfway through, until golden on the bottoms and edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the sheets to wire racks and let the cookies cool completely. (They will crisp as they cool.). Repeat with the last pan of cookies.<br> While the cookies cool, make the shark fins. Cut the chocolate-peppermint candies in half with a paring knife. Use a small round cutter to cut a wedge from the right side of each candy to make the inner curve of a shark fin (see Cook&#39;s Note). Set aside.<br> For the icing: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar, egg whites, milk, vanilla and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until thick and glossy, about 2 minutes, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons more milk as needed until the icing thickly coats a spoon and drops down in large drizzles.<br> Transfer a little of the icing to each of 3 small bowls (3 to 4 tablespoons per bowl). Tint the remaining icing with 3 or 4 drops of blue food coloring. Leave one small bowl white, tint the second bowl teal and the final one green. Spread the blue icing about 1/2 inch thick on a rimmed baking sheet. Working quickly so the icing doesn\\u2019t harden, drizzle a little more than half of the icing from each of the small bowls over the top. Place as many cookies as will fit (about half) face down into the icing. Give the cookies a quarter turn before removing to facilitate swirling. Let the excess icing drip back onto the sheet. Place the cookies icing-side up on racks as you finish them. Drizzle the remaining small bowls of icing over the blue again and repeat with remaining plain cookies. Sprinkle the cookies while the icing is still wet with blue sanding sugar and pearl sugar, then stick a shark fin in the middle of each.
