It's not a fruit-driven wine, rather it has the earthy, composty complexity of a Cayuse Syrah, though less concentrated. Definitely a wine worth chasing.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"Produced from the best selection of vines at Blingard, aged for 18 months in wood.

Give it a good, long decant, or hold for up to six years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This Cab is drinking very dry, tannic and austere in its youth.

The palate is more expressive, with sprightly lemon, aloe vera and the soothing notion of ripe green and yellow pears.

A ros with some meat on its bones, it's way more than an aperitif and will stand strongly aside a full range of summer foods.","designation":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Very sweet and lush on the nose, and teetering on overripe due to prune and raisin aromas.

Montes has been a leader in cl's movement toward coastal SB, and this one is blasting with grapefruit, green apple, passion fruit and minerality.

Can't imagine a better match for ceviche or tuna tartare.","designation":"Leyda Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"Dark as night, with aromas of brick dust, kirsch and black fruit. Don't expect anything like French Cab Franc from this Chilean monster. It's huge and fully directed toward blackberry and cassis.

But if you like yours big and burly, with crusty dark fruit, then this is your ticket.","designation":"Maule Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"The best Don Max in quite some time. After too many herbal-green vintages, the 2005 is ripe, rich and well woven. The bouquet shows hickory, roasted plum, chocolate, vanilla and peanut.

This is 100% varietal. Light and elegant, it's nicely detailed with a peppery, floral character and a welcome persistence. Take the best qualities of Beresan's Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah and mix them into a single, more delicate varietal, and you have this lovely Malbec, which glides along to a finish with chocolaty, satiny tannins.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"Made in collaboration with Beringer's Ed Sbragia, this super Tuscan blend of Merlot (75%), Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon is loaded with smoky tones of oak, leather, spice and chocolate fudge.

Easy to find, with 20,000 cases.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A bit awkward now, tightly wound and brittle, with very ripe cherry and currant flavors as well as complex Asian spices. Bone dry and marked by acidity, it could be a sleeper.

However it does also offer some richness, flavors of pears and ripe red apples, softened with melon. It is balanced, vibrant, a full wine that also shows structure.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"Here is another great value from the Milbrandt brothers, based upon their impeccable vineyard sources (they own 1600 acres, mostly in the Wahluke Slope AVA). Dense and dark, ripe and compact, this Cab/Merlot/Petit Verdot blend brings plenty of macho and muscle, layers of black fruits, black smoke, black tea and black olives. Get the idea? It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"This is an organically farmed blend of Sangiovese (80%) and Syrah (20%) with elegant mineral tones at the back of red berry, smoke and campfire. Elegance and harmony stand out here and the flavors are smoky and ashy.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"fr","description":"Firm and tight, a wine that reveals more structure than fruit initially, leaving the citrus and grapefruit flavors to emerge later. Then it closes up again, keeping some of the mineral austerity. Keep this wine for a year.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"it","description":"Dark density sets the tone and so do thick aromas of vanilla bean, toasted oak and coffee.

From first impressions, which include aromas of toast, coffee, prune and devilish berry, you know it's a good one.

A complete wine with length, mint and lavish tannins.","designation":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows its cool-climate origins with a certain austerity that accompanies the exotic wild cherry, currant, Mandarin orange and root beer flavors, accented with sweet smoky oak. A rush of acids and tannins takes over the palate, strongly suggesting modest ageability.

It even has some dusty tannins that make for grip and structure. The finish is absolutely dry.","designation":"California"},{"country":"hu","description":"Though this dessert wine is already excellent, it's quite exciting to imagine how good it will be as its delicate flavors mingle over time. Made by the Szepsy family, whose roots go centuries (perhaps 1,000 years) deep in hu, the wine starts with a dense, slightly musky but floral nose. On the tongue, apricot, honey and spice mingle in a rich, opulent union, buoyed by a sparkling acidity that keeps the wine light and pretty.","designation":"Tokaj"},{"country":"it","description":"The best word to describe this impressive Sangiovese-Merlot blend from Umbria is healthy. It has a vibrant, ruby red color and delivers absolutely immaculate aromas of succulent cherry, violet, balsamic notes, earth and root beer. It imparts soft, silky tannins, bright acidity and ends only after having carefully caressed each taste bud.","designation":"Central it"},{"country":"it","description":"This wine brings the Trebbiano grape to a whole new level of sophistication. You'll get stone fruit, melon and apricot, but you'll also be rewarded with radically unique aromas of melted butter, brown sugar and crunchy crme caramel. The texture is smooth and firm and the wine's persistency can be counted in minutes.","designation":"Central it"},{"country":"US","description":"This has rich tannins, dense fruit and overall deep flavors. This is a dark wine, just this side of brooding, with ripe blueberry and cherry fruit, softly chalky tannins, whiffs of smoke and splashes of pepper. The dark fruit flavors are bold and seamless, melded with smoke and chocolate, dotted with ground espresso, and finished with a nice lift. This probably needs another five years to really show all of its complexity.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"Cesari hits all the right marks with this single-vineyard wine and presents a gorgeous, proudly modern wine with soft plush notes of chocolate, vanilla coffee, smoked ham and natural rubber. It is chewy and firm in the mouth but ends on a fresh note, leaving the palate glossed and clean.","designation":"Veneto"},{"country":"fr","description":"This recently released 2002 is still showing its youth, with a firm, mineral edge to it.

Wait 3C4 years.","designation":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"They kept this Cab back all this time, presumably at some cost to the company, but consumers are the beneficiaries. Everything has mellowed. The wine, with 1% Petit Verdot, is like hands of cassis, dark chocolate and oak massaging the palate. The grapes were sourced from top vineyards in the Dry Creek, Sonoma and Alexander Valleys. Drink nowC2010.","designation":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"An exciting achievement, this select cru throbs with powerful intensity and complexity awarding a long list of adjectives to describe its aromatic qualities: black cherry and cherry liquor, leather, cola, milk chocolate and almond. Berry and bramble flavors make the mouthfeel lively and sophisticated and are a delicate segue into chewy-tart tannins and a spice driven finale.","designation":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"A dark and spicy wine, with streaks of mineral and herb buried within very tart, acidic black fruit. This is complex, quite youthful and tightly woven. I think it will require some years to pull itself together, but the balance is here, in a medium-bodied style, showing some herb, some citrus and plenty of muscle. Tasted over many hours after being decanted, it showed itself to be a wonderful wine that developed multiple layers of flavor.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"Gorgeous color and concentration with brilliant ruby highlights make this a beautiful wine to contemplate in the glass. The aromas are broad and far-reaching with a high mineral component, small berry fruit, spice and a distinct soapy-lavender element.

Only 60 cases made.","designation":"Veneto"},{"country":"it","description":"Beautiful density and color characterize this wine as do its layered notes of exotic spice, cardamom, curry and roasted nut. Plush, full red fruit and cherry build in intensity, especially on the palate, creating a rich wine with a firm backbone, smooth texture and dusty notes on the finish.","designation":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a very lush Cab, made in the modern style. All the elements of cult Cab are there: the soft voluptuousness, the finely ground, sweet tannins, the immensely ripe currant, blackberry and cocoa flavors, the coating of fine, smoky oak. I don't think it's an ager because of the softness and ripeness.","designation":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Solid, luscious and silky smooth, this white wine from the northern Friuli region is one of the most beautiful expressions of the Pinot Bianco grape you'll find. Stone fruit and nutty tones are rich and penetrating and backed by more fruit and white flowers. Half the wine sees four months of oak to shape its creamy consistency and heightened complexity.","designation":"Northeastern it"},{"country":"US","description":"This is classic Washington Chardonnay, from the winery that first put it on the national map. It's beautifully built upon ripe apple, pineapple and kiwi fruit, with proportionate acid and lovely, lightly toasty oak. The alcohol is 14.3%, and the wine strikes a perfect note of weight and density, without being fat or fatiguing.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is just about perfect Smillon the gorgeous fruit has more flesh and breadth with flavors suggesting ripe fig, melon and citrus. The use of oak is judicious and thoughtful; it adds grace notes without dominating. You can't help but wonder why this grape remains such a novelty (except, ironically, at Novelty Hill!). It's seductive, delicious and unique.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the first Pinot from the Napa house of Pahlmeyer, the result of many years of effort in his vineyard in the Fort Ross area of the true Sonoma Coast. The result is rich in cherry pie, raspberry liqueur, cotton candy, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon flavors that captivate from sip one, but there's a certain young vine simple directness that limits the score. As the vines age, the wine is one to watch.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark and dense, yet somehow soft and approachable, this 100% is once again loaded with rich black fruits. Everything is in balance, with a captivating tension strung between the fruit, acid and tannins. This is a wine you can't keep your lips off.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is pure Cabernet from older vines, and has a meaty, herbal power to it. Streaks of tar and some lively cinnamon spice add life to the fruit, which is solid and earthy. I pick up black licorice, vanilla cream, and still more interesting flavors wrapped into the tannins, which seem dusty and smoky and a bit grainy. This has some real substance to it, and shows some of the herbal side of the grape. The best so far from SYZYGY.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"The Sartori family is behind this wonderful vineyard select wine with deep concentration and intense aromatic of savory plum, cherry, natural rubber, almond nut and mineral shadings.

The finish is clean and a little sugary.","designation":"Idaho"},{"country":"US","description":"Green-streaked barnyard aromas couple with black cherries and tobacco in this varietally true offering. Medium-weight on the palate, maybe even a bit low in acidity. Decent, but doesnt truly sing.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"The interesting mix of aromas, ranging from fresh manure to cinnamon and cherries, gives way on the palate to the surprisingly unripe flavor of tart cranberries. The acidity is biting, making for a sinewy mouthful.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Unfortunately this wine just hangs on the cusp of quality. The nose is somewhat muddy and grassy. Plummy fruit with tangy acids carry the unrefined palate. Cola nut is noticeable on the dry finish. The effort seems to be there, but the result is not stellar.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Very light in color, so much so that its almost transparent. Potent aromas of mushroom, bramble and buttery oak. Some strawberry and cream flavors are driven by snappy acids.

From the hotter reaches of southern Oregon.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Ripe, briary aromas of wild berries, plums and earth veer into dark chocolate.

The acidity is okay, and its well made. Doesnt have much in common with Champagne but some will like it. From Barefoot Cellars.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This isnt a ros; its much too dark for that, as deeply colored as Pinot Noir. Oddly, theres not much fruit in either the aroma or the flavor; its more of an earthy, watery quality. If you try, you can imagine strawberries, but its a stretch. This odd wine is very dry and has some decent acidity.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"If you are allergic to sulfites or insist on certified organic wines, this one fits the bill.

Dark, thick and jammy, with dense layers of fruit, spice and oak. Scents of sandalwood, coffee, mint, pepper and more, much more.

Big, rich, long and deep, it's nonetheless best enjoyed right now, not cellared.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"A blend of mainly Syrah, with Grenache, Mourvdre and Viognier.

The ultralong finish is sweet and satisfying.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"75% Syrah and 25% Cinsault from the oldest continually cultivated vinifera vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley. The spicy, intensely aromatic nose mixes black cherry, concentrated cassis, coffee, bacon, leather and roasted nuts. It unfolds in layer upon layer of rich fruit, tannin, leather and smoke. Dense, deep and Rh?ne-like, it finishes with a montage of meaty, peppery, bacon-smoke flavors.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"The nose leaps out of the glass: fat, meaty and jammy, laden with ripe, seductive fruit. The palate impression is still young, firm and tight, with tart loganberry fruit that has a nice tang to it.

In the mouth, there's more wood than fruit, leaving heat, vanilla and spice to overshadow mild strawberry/raspberry flavors. What's best about the wine is the mouthfeel; it's round and creamy, with length.

It has a sharpness through the finish that suggests a bit of unripeness or stemminess.","designation":"California"},{"country":"ar","description":"Expensive for what you're getting. The wine starts with a reddish-green set of aromas, which are backed by generic red-fruit flavors that are medium to narrow in scope and just don't taste much like Cabernet. Time allows it to show a bit more, but always it seems basic and shy.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"it","description":"This is a meaty and mature Negroamaro with ripe notes of black olive, earth and leather.

Given that opening, a palate of black plum and cassis isn't surprising. Feelwise, it's a touch rough and tannic, which is probably to be expected. Turns more herbal the more you sniff and swirl.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"ar","description":"Creamy and rooty at first, and then smokier and darker as it settles. For young Malbec it displays both a jammy fruit side and an acidic center. So there's both ripeness and heft but also a piercing sizzle. Perfectly good for parties and less-serious imbibing.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"it","description":"This hearty Primitivo is ripe and  jammy with tones of black cherry preserves and blackberry pie.

This is a wine for those who love the California style of Chardonnay.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"There's a nice, juicy, lip-smacking tang to this Sauv Blanc, like biting into a not quite ripe peach or a lemon drop.

A small amount of Smillon in the blend adds weight to the midpalate.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"The Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest is consistently the most broadly fruity, round and oaky wine in the lineup (outside of the much pricier reserve).

Sure to be a popular style, this is one of the best vintages in the past five years.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"ar","description":"Smoky and big on the nose, with crusty black-fruit flavors backing that up. The wine is less deep and more hard and scratchy than some Mendoza Malbecs, but it's solid and sure-footed even if the mouthfeel is stark. Probably better with food than others due to its leaner, less opulent style.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"More like Zin than Merlot, a peppery, full-bodied wine with some ripe to overripe blackberry, cassis and raisin flavors.

Best to age for a few years, or at least give it long decanting.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"There's 5% Malbec in the blend, but the austere, scrapey tannins of the Franc still dominate the finish. The fruit is pretty, with blueberry character to burn.

At less than three years, it's jammy, almost candied in raspberry and cherry fruit, sprinkled with freshly ground pepper and with a trace of beef jerky.

Try after 2014.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Dryness and tannins mark this Cabernet, giving it some austerity and astringency.
