The palate is immediately rich and dense but remains light on its feet due to the wine's inherent vineyard-driven minerality. A deep pure core of fresh black fruit dominates with secondary flavors of graphite and dark chocolate.

The currants, crushed stone and subtle herbs carry the finish."},{"name":"Larkmead Cabernet Sauvignon 2013","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon is an extremely versatile and vibrant wine comprised of mostly young vines averaging 10 years of age.   A classic mix of red and black bramble fruit aromas dominate the perfume that is accentuated with hints of bittersweet chocolate. With time in the glass and exposure to oxygen, the aromas become more focused, high-toned and expressive. On the palate a similar evolution occurs; at first the wine maintains its dark forest-floor fruit character, showing more blue tones before the crushed gravel and earthy finish leave the palate fresh and wanting a second sip."},{"name":"Larkmead Cabernet Sauvignon 2014","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Petit Verdot, even in the small quantities present in this wine, exudes its signature textural density and floral nose of purple and blue flowers that complement Cabernets macerated red and blue fruit so well.

Aromatically, the wine is vigorous, with layers of bramble fruit, and cola giving way to scents of forest floor, wet pine, graphite, and macerated blackberries.The wine enters the palate effortlessly. At its core are juicy red and black cherry fruits as well as that typical Larkmead trace of bittersweet chocolate. The tannins are sweet and dusty, and coat the mouth on all sides. This is an incredible wine for the vintage; while many 2015s are fruit-forward and simple, the Larkmead Cabernet Sauvignon offers bright, fresh flavors, medium weight, and a long, savory finish that demands a second sip."},{"name":"Larkmead Cabernet Sauvignon 2016","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon leads with an alluring amount of spice and red fruit that sits atop a black soy note and an earthy and loamy base. The aromas are warm and inviting: a bit of leather and bittersweet chocolate wrap around notes of purple flowers and the flesh of ripe plums, graphite, and tobacco.Bramble, earth, dried herb, red cherry and blackberries are all interwoven on the palate. There is a succulent amount of red and black fruit painted with a chocolate coating. This is a timeless Cabernet Sauvignon that engages your palate, finishing with a dry, dusty tannin that feels like it is not born in the Napa Valley. The drying tannins leave you desirous of a second sip."},{"name":"Larkmead Dr. Olmo Cabernet Sauvignon 2013","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The highly anticipated release of the newest wine in our portfolio, \\"Dr. Olmo\\" pays homage to Dr. Harold P. Olmo, a UC Davis professor who conducted clonal trials on Larkmead's property in the 1940's and 50's. Dr. Olmo took a selection of Cabernet from those Larkmead trails and propagated them at the Oakville station; the \\"Oakville Clones\\" as they have become to be known built the Napa wine industry in the 1960's. Heady aromas of violets, blue fruit and graphite coupled with dusty, crushed rock and red cherry sweetness give this wine an ethereal bouquet. On entry into the mouth, the palate follows the nose but almost immediately the flavors draw back down to earth and are blended into a lean, but muscular, compact core. With time in the glass, the flavors darken as blueberries become blackberries and red cherry becomes black cherry. In the mouth, the tannins escape the core and dust the outer rim of the palate with sour, Morello cherry notes."},{"name":"Larkmead Dr. Olmo Cabernet Sauvignon 2014","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Shy and restrained upon opening, the 2014 Dr. Olmo has a compact core of black licorice, black cherry and forest floor. After an hour in the glass, however, the aromas become more secondary and poetic, displaying hints of candied orange rind and crushed, dried flowers. There is a lack of juiciness to the this wine; fruitfulness is not part of its perfume, a characteristic that is echoed in the flavors and the texture of the first sip.The build of this wine is one of its most alluring parts; while The Lark is sumptuous and round, and Solari is broad and deep, Dr. Olmos texture feels almost weightless and ethereal. The wine dances on your palate, lightly coating each corner with its essence of dried rose, bramble, coffee beans and cigar tobacco. This is the most complex and nuanced, if understated, Cabernet in the Fall lineup."},{"name":"Larkmead Dr. Olmo Cabernet Sauvignon 2015","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The aromas on this wine are captivating! The warmer vintage leads with warmer tones on the nose - Black rose, a bit of Earl Grey, mahogany with a hint of dried herb and a Winter potpourri. Black licorice and Morello cherry come at you from the secondary aromas coupled with a piney, forest floor undertone.The palate continues the assault of aromas and flavors - graphite, crushed rock, bittersweet chocolate frame a core of macerated blue and black berries. When the blue and black fruit dissipate on the palate the structure on this wine is crunchy and gravelly, reflective of the soils in which the vines are planted."},{"name":"Larkmead Dr. Olmo Cabernet Sauvignon 2016","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"There is a deep, rich sweetness to the aromas of the 2016 Dr. Olmo that are grounded by savory forest floor and earthen notes. Wild blackberries, black cherries, redwood and graphite lift out of the glass and are followed by a potpourri of blueberry compote, macerated strawberries, purple flowers, bittersweet chocolate and espresso bean. There is a hint of menthol lifting through the center of the wine that fades when the wine spends more time in the glass. This is an intensely aromatic wine! As the wine opens up, it becomes more savory, with notes of black tea, black pepper, and pomegranate. The gravely, dusty cranberry finish is the signature of this bottling. For a heavyweight Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is incredibly nimble and ethereal."},{"name":"Larkmead Firebelle 2006","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Good deep ruby red color. Combines a cool season Bordeaux-like nose of tar, damp-earth and game with Californian wild berry fruit aromas and complex rosehip and black tea nuances. The palate opens with cola and smoked meat flavors and is initially tight, dry and structured. With aeration, cassis, black cherry and tobacco notes emerge leading to a sweet mid-palate that is broad, textured and charming. Tannins are bold and mouth-coating and provide length and shape to the wine. Our most age-worthy Firebelle bottling yet, the 2006 will develop positively in bottle for between 5 and 8 years.

These aromas are bright but tightly woven into themselves; however, with time in the glass, there is a pleasant hint of loam soil on the nose that brings the wine back to earth. In the mouth youll find the characteristic expansiveness of the vintage - a broad, mouth coating textural component that is dusty with a hint of cherry and bittersweet chocolate. The tannins wrap gently around a blueberry core that has subtle tones of sassafras."},{"name":"Larkmead Firebelle 2015","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Lighter color, restrained fruit, and a savory finish are the hallmarks of this years Firebelle. Some of the characteristics of the warm vintage are apparent in this Merlot-dominant wine, such as the aromas of roasted meats and the flavors of ripe black and blue plums. But even so, we feel the wine is still reflective of the loam and clay soils in which its grapes were grown. Scents of plum skin greet the nose and are met again on the palate. The same is true of the cocoa and coffee that linger on the finish. These aromas are present, certainly, but remain somewhat compact; they need both air and time to unravel and truly come alive. This particular Firebelle is a complex wine that may appear reticent at first, but with time in the glass becomes supple and expressive. In the finish, youthful tannins blanket the mouth, crying out for food."},{"name":"Larkmead Firebelle 2014","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Of all our newly released wines, the Firebelle has by far the most inviting aromatic profile. Burnt matchstick gives way to plum skin and accents the wines ripe, red, fleshy core.

The aromas of thick, ripe plum skin and blackcurrants never tip the scale towards hedonism; instead, the wine begins to reveal an almost Syrah like wisp of violets and a Pinot Noir like hint of rose petals."},{"name":"Larkmead LMV Salon (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2006","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Deep ruby red/purple color.

Maintains great mineral freshness despite its natural concentration and power. Firm tannic backbone provides great aging potential."},{"name":"Larkmead LMV Salon 2012","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The aromas of this wine exude the synergy of Cabernet Sauvignon and its parent, Cabernet Franc. The vineyard at Larkmead produces Cabernet that shows more red, forest floor fruit and herbal tones than most due to its high percentage of cobble and gravel in its soil. This aroma profile blends beautifully into Cabernet Francs classic spicy, red licorice, cola and bay leaf notes that in the 2012 vintage are hidden beneath an opulent cloak of dense, sweet fruit and wet tobacco on the nose."},{"name":"Larkmead LMV Salon 2013","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Only a quarter of the wine is blended to Cabernet Franc, but the Cabernet Franc's aroma characteristics are the most present in the glass. There is a hint of red licorice under a bay leaf note that complements the Cabernet Sauvignon's kirsch qualities that build the signature of the aroma profile. Crushed rock and a winter spice box rounds out the perfume. On the palate, the wine comes at you in layers; the top blankets the mouth with the viscosity of Amarena cherry syrup, the middle maintains Cabernet Franc's dried herb character and the finish evaporates with a hint of scorched earth, tar, crushed gravel and graphite. Over the course of time in the glass we see the wine evolve from an incredible juiciness to being extremely nimble as the tannins start to dry out witha dusty, red fruit sweetness similar to what you would find in the remnants of a tin candy box."},{"name":"Larkmead LMV Salon 2014","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"At first the aromas of the 2014 LMV Salon are brooding and reticent. It is difficult to penetrate the wines outer skin, but careful study reveals scents of blue and black fruit, dark chocolate and coffee bean. With air, however, the nose opens dramatically, displaying an evolving bouquet of bright red fruit and spice, along with a subtle herbal tone that speaks to the Cabernet Franc at the core of the blend. Similarly, the first sip of this wine reveals a tightly muscular palate. As it relaxes, however, the flavors begin to unfold from the texture C revealing notes of charred wood, wet loam, spice, red clay, and dried earth. The fruit flavors are precise on the tongue, and travel from the warmth of black cherry to the brightness of red cherry."},{"name":"Larkmead LMV Salon 2015","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Cabernet Franc has historically played a supporting role in the LMV Salon blend. It is a noble variety, but one with an uneven history in Napa Valley, both qualitatively and stylistically. Here at Larkmead, there is success in planting Cabernet Franc in heavier, richer soils. Moving forward, the goal is to allow this wine to differentiate itself by including a higher percentage of Cabernet Franc (up to 70%); this will elevate the varietys complimentary characteristics (spice, herb) to Cabernet Sauvignon and produce a blend that best communicates the complexity of the estate.Mother nature had the most dramatic impact on ourCabernet and Cabernet Franc parcels in 2015 as our yieldswere down by 25%. This resulted in a concentrated wine,which is almost opaque in hue. Even the nose is powerful,with dark, brooding, black fruits complimented by lifted scents of rose and licorice. A longer linger over the glass reveals notes of chocolate covered espresso bean, which is echoed in the finish.Though the aromas are dense, the palate of this wine is transparent and pure. Its core of raspberry and red licorice evolves into bay leaf, cured meats, and winter spices.This is a classically structured wine, with a freshness on the palate that seem to belong to a cooler vintage C a remarkable accomplishment in such a hot year.
