Give this until mid-2008, and it should be terrific for the next four years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The 2005 has been co-released with the 2006. The '05 is a better wine, probably due in part to the extra year of age, which has allowed the parts to come together harmoniously. It continues a multiyear streak of being one of the top Chenin Blancs in California. The main feature is dry acidity. It frames apple, citrus, peach and flower flavors, with a nutty, slightly bitter finish. Try as an interesting alternative to Sauv Blanc.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"A fine example of a Barolo, and a marvel considering the problems of the 2002 harvest. The fruit is dark and juicy with plenty of concentration, with the added complexity of roses and pencil shavings. Nicely textured, with a medium to long finish. Imported by Global E. Selections, LLC.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"US","description":"Made primarily from Pinot Noir with a little Chardonnay, this has a subtle color of the first blush on a peach, and is fragrant and delicious. The fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries have a lime tinge, and the finish is dry and impressively long. Really easy to like, just filled with charm and finesse.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"A beautiful, complex wine, it begins with dense aromas of dark jammy fruit, anise, wax polish and leather. The palate is well balanced and the flavors are intense and have evolved well. The finish is medium long.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"fr","description":"The fact that this wine comes from the chalkiest of soils and is bone dry gives it considerable austerity. It is definitely mineral in taste and texture, with a touch of salt and grapefruit flavors;  very structured and tight. It needs to age.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"A deliciously vibrant wine, with oak-inspired citrus peel, peach, fig and creamy honey-vanilla flavors. However, as succulent as it is, from such a great winery, it could be far better.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"Despite its high alcohol, this wine manages to preserve its balance. That's because the Grner acidity creeps through the weight. With his top wine, Ehmoser goes for a tropical fruit profile here, with mangos on top of vanilla and spice. There's structure too, which suggests this powerful wine could age for 2C3 years.","province":"Wagram-Donauland"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Well made, this is a sappy, snappy take on Syrah, with vivid wild berry fruit and lively acids. It snaps into focus right away, then slowly softens as it weaves through the palate, with mixed berries, rhubarb, plum and hints of citrus. The finish lasts a full minute, adding notes of black pepper as it fades. This is beautifully rendered and not overblown in any way, with the alcohol at just 13.5%.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"fr","description":"Ripe grapefruit, green plums and other green stone fruits all show that this wine has some weight, allied with a steely interior. Still young, it fills the mouth with yeast and some toast, but more of an intense freshness.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"nz","description":"The Saint Clair style usually features prominent herbaceous notes, but this special block bottling tones down that influence, instead relying more on melon, fig and mineral notes for impact. It's full-bodied, broad and mouthfilling in the context of Sauvignon Blanc, with a long, white grapefruit finish. Drink through the end of 2008.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"US","description":"This bubbly charms with cherry and raspberry flavors and a touch of limes and vanilla.

The smoky red fruit is combined with clove, anise and rose petals. Well balanced and with a medium finish, over the next five years, this will drink beautifully.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"US","description":"Many winemakers use Milbrandt fruit for their Syrahs, so it's no surprise that the brothers' own winery has a Syrah that stands at the top of the product line. There is precision and power here, with deep cherry and boysenberry fruit, tart acids that hint at lemon rind, a sharp peppery streak and a finish that somehow suggests chocolate and pineapple candy. Complex, muscular and delicious.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Just delicious, a blend of Syrah, Mourvedre and Grenache that shows how well Paso Robles can make these Rh?ne reds. The wine is soft and voluptuous, with complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, milk chocolate, licorice and cinnamon spice. Finishes long and rewardingly dry.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"So forward and appealing right now, it's hard to resist, but this could gain a little traction with a two or three years of age. It's polished in cherry jam and blackberry-pie filling, with earthy tones of coffee, figs, sage and cedar. The intricate tannins play nicely against the acidity, which gives it an upscale feeling.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"The epitome of aristocratic, full-bodied Riesling. This wine has all the rosehip and white flower aromas, followed by structured, fresh, crisp green pear and white currant fruits. There is a great purity of line here, directed by the acidity and the cutting crispness of the aftertaste. Screwcap.","province":"Wagram-Donauland"},{"country":"US","description":"This Pinot is pretty extracted, but the flavors are addictively good, offering a cornucopia of raspberries, cherries, blackberries, tangerines and cola, with complex nuances of sassafras, orange Pekoe tea, cola and dusty spices. It's a little soft, but silky and rich in tannins, a classic Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"From the pretty pale, amber color to the long, distinguished finish, this is a great ros sparkler. To begin with, it's dry, a point in its favor, while the flavors are subtle and complex. They suggest pink grapefruits, tangerine zest, a squeeze of white peach, vanilla, and the smoke and dough of oak and lees. With its low alcohol and very low pH, it's a balanced wine of great structural integrity.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"A wonderfully pure, fresh and natural wine, limpid with minerality, green fruits, concentrated pepper and spice. This is a powerful expression of Grner Veltliner, a rich, but freshly green wine. Glass stopper.","province":"Kremstal"},{"country":"US","description":"This Cab-based Bordeaux blend has sizable amounts of Merlot and Cab Franc. It's quite a distinguished wine, classic in the modern Napa sense of softness and ripeness to the point of decadent drinkability. There's a sweet olive-tapenade edge to the blackberry, cassis and cherry flavors. The finish, believe it or not, suggests blueberry pie, fresh from the oven.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"Soft and finely perfumed, this is full-bodied Riesling, adding just a touch of sweetness to the pear and white currant fruit flavors. This is a great vintage of this wine, probably the best since 2002.","province":"Kamptal"},{"country":"ar","description":"Is there a better, more consistent Malbec on the market today than Punto Final? The 2005 is typically rich and dense, with saturated berry aromas and a strong but balanced oak element. The palate is a potpourri of berries, chocolate and vanilla, while the mouthfeel is juicy and stacked. Quite delicious; this is the type of wine that gives Argentine Malbec its good name.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"it","description":"Who says southern Italian wines won't age gracefully? Here is an eight-year-old specimen that delivers generous expressions of dried currants, tar, leather, licorice and refined toasted notes without seeming tired or old. It has firm tannins and a long finish but probably won't last too much longer. Drink now.","province":"Southern it"},{"country":"US","description":"I like the elegance, but it seems like it was rushed to market. It will certainly benefit from cellaring, as it's young and rude in acids right now, and not showing well. But there's something here in the vast heart of  cherries and pomegranates and overall balance. Should improve by the end of 2007, and hold for another five years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is an expensive wine, by Lodi or any standards, but it's also a really good one. Blended with Petite Sirah, it has a soft texture and decadent mouthfeel, and the flavors are of creme de cassis, caramel cream, melted milk chocolate, tangerine zest and cinnamon-spiced gingerbread. It's certainly not an ager, so drink up.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Michel Rolland consults on this exceptional Merlot. The blend is 77% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. Though not quite as supremely dark, dense and concentrated as the immense '03, this silky wine is more elegant, with grace notes of licorice, citrus, coffee and plenty of tart strawberry and raspberry fruit.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"Incredibly powerful, with bold lime sherbet aromas that are nearly overwhelming in their intensity. Flavors are strident and linear at this young stage, underscored by vibrant acidity and fantastic length. You can enjoy it now for its brute force, but will be better rewarded by cellaring it for 5C10 years.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Similar to the winery's '05 Russian River bottling in the ripeness of the fruit and tannins, but somehow fresher, although it's still a big, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Maybe it's the acidity that makes the framboise and cherry flavors come alive. Deeper notes of Portobello mushrooms and balsamic suggest moderate aging possibilities. Drink now through 2009.","province":"California"},{"country":"ar","description":"Purple as can be, with a loaded bouquet of black fruit and oak. This is your classic heavyweight, and while 2004 was not a great vintage in Mendoza, this wine still shows excellent depth, weight and balance. Firm on the finish, with big tannins and grab. Production was only 175 cases; drink nowC2009. Imported by Southern Wine Group.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"Made with 82% Cabernet, this interesting wine is showing all kinds of possibilities. It's a good red now, sturdily dry and tannic, with red cherry, pomegranate, sweet tobacco and allspice flavors. But it's a little juvenile. I would decant it as long as possible, and it should enjoy a cellar life of up to 10 years.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit. Huge blackberry and black cherry flavors are potent as they ride on a wave of jolting tannins. An affordable shining star for a rising region.","province":"Levante"},{"country":"US","description":"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine. Their estate grapes are so good, the wine doesn't even need all that wood. It's elaborately tailored in pineapple, mango, ripe white peach and spicebox flavors. The vanilla and smoke, which have got to come from the grapes, add extra deliciousness.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas. The palate comes in waves, with the first delivering plum and berry and the second offering chocolate, herbs and lavender. Quite pretty and very tannic. Hold until 2008, if possible.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"US","description":"Despite its youth, this is a complete and satisfying wine. Woodward Canyon reds virtually always develop well in bottle, and so you can assume that this will continue to improve. At the moment it is tightly wound, firmly built, a complex weave of purple fruit and tobacco leaf, leading into white chocolaty tannins.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Long Shadows Pirouette is made by Agustin Huneeus and Philippe Melka; it's 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 11% Syrah and 13% Petit Verdot.

This rich and luscious wine could easily pass for a much pricier Napa Valley blend.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"This impeccably made wine boasts a rich, almost unctuous mouthfeel that beautifully complements its flavors of blackberries, dried spices, toast and vanilla.

Another fine effort from this young winery. Here is classic styling from a great vineyard source, with beautiful definition, and gorgeous, refined and sculpted fruit framed in concise, molded, firm tannins.

The penetration and elegance of this wine are what stand out; it's young and compact and suggests a long life ahead.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"An interesting wine, in that it doesn't fit the current rage for blockbuster Shiraz. As winemaker Charles Whish says, It doesn't have to be huge and rich and jammyit needs to have finesse and length.

Flavors range from cassis and black cherry through dark chocolate and dill. Drinkable now with rich foods, but will gain in sweetness and complexity with a few years of cellaring.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A real find. French in style, dry, rich and elegant. Hints of cherry and cassis are wrapped in thick, fine tannins, and the mouthfeel is sensual and velvety. Delicious now, but should hold through the decade. Grapes from Yorkville Highlands. The winemaker is the well-known Kerry Damsky.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"A big, rich, Port-like Brunello that found controversy with our panel.

From the cooler west side of the appellation, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah offers a little something from each variety. The overall effect is a concerto, vibrant and complex. Huge oak, but the expressive fruit wears it well. Beautiful tannins coat the palate like a mink coat.","province":"California"},{"country":"pt","description":"This lushly fruity Port folds in enough intriguing floral aromas to be more than a simple fruit bomb. Briary notes add another element to the creamy boysenberry flavors that are incredibly rich but not cloying or syrupy. Likely to mature early but hold well, thanks to masses of supple tannins. Great quality for the price.","province":"Douro"},{"country":"US","description":"Pours inky black, and smells young and backward.

The bouquet is lovely; it delivers dense plum fruit, chili-like spice and mounds of wet earth. The palate is pure blackberry and dark plum, and it finishes smooth as silk, with just enough coarseness to add texture and grit. Firm but not hard. A definite winner from Abruzzo. Drink by the end of 2004.","province":"Central it"},{"country":"US","description":"When this wine was first produced it was a blend of three Bordeaux varietals, but longtime winemaker Ken Deis has since expanded his palate.

There's lots of zest and spunk to this racy yet round Chianti. The palate is full of blackberry and the feel is supple.

Age through 2010.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"There must have been severe vineyard selection for this wine, for it rises above the vintage to achieve real intensity and concentration.

More robust fruit fills out the palate, while it finishes long and chocolaty, with notes of coffee. Quite sturdy and eminently satisfying.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"pt","description":"Luis Pato's Bairradas used to be the standouts of the D.O. In a sense they still are, although he has chosen to label them with the regional denomination of Beiras in protest over restrictive practices. In this example, Pato has harnessed the rough tannins and brash acidity of Baga into a rich creamy wine filled with blackberries and anise.

Long at the end.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"From vineyards quite high up in the eastern mountains, this wine is from stressed, low-yielding grapes. The blackberry and cassis flavors are concentrated and dense, and the tannins are tough and firm. Oak plays a supporting role.

The attractive nose features ripe yellow stone fruit with strong mineral overtones, while the palate reveals enough crisp, refreshing acidity to balance the sweetness. There's a smooth, rich texture, showing ample flavors of ripe stone fruit, floral notes and honey. Concentrated, with a moderately long, fresh finish.","province":"Mosel"},{"country":"fr","description":"A smooth wine, the tannins suspended within a velvet texture, resulting in an opulent, rich feel. This is very intense, with medicinal and dark plum skin flavors. Powerful, solid, for aging.","province":"Southwest fr"},{"country":"US","description":"The LaurneCDrouhin Family Estate Reserve brings a bit more earthiness to the table than the regular DDO bottling. In the mouth, the fruita delicate jumble of raspberry, pomegranate, cranberry and sour cherrymingles with streaks of caramel, herb and leaf. A wine that will reward both cellaring (at least a decade) and studying.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"From a vineyard at one of the highest points in the Cahors vineyard (nearly 1,000 feet), this is a smoothly perfumed, wood-aged wine that shows light elegance, acidity as well as dark currant fruits and a touch of mint.","province":"Southwest fr"},{"country":"US","description":"From a producer to watch in underrated Lodi, this intense, black cherry, bacon-fat and white peppery Syrah has an almost peat-like, whisky aroma at first, very inviting, which then leads into more bacon and pepper that carries through on the palate, balanced by extremely smooth tannins and an unexpected elegance. A really cool Syrah to try on its own that'll go very nicely with meaty, wintery foods.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"This Negroamaro-Aglianico blend opens slowly, then suddenly releases a rush of red cherry, toast, prune, leather and red earth. The tannins are velvety (the wine sees 14 months of oak) and you'll get lavender, blueberry and dill-like flavors on the finish.","province":"Southern it"},{"country":"ar","description":"If you don't mind a little overt wood on your Malbec, then this will certainly do the trick and more. The nose offers some maple and mature berry aromas, while the palate pumps oak-infused black cherry fruit. Lengthy on the finish, with mocha and vanilla. Like we said, it's a bit toasty and woody, but overall it works like a charm.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"The chardonnay is the largest production wine made at Barnard Griffin. It is a stellar wine, about half barrel fermented, the other half stainless; a beautiful blend of crisp, fresh, creamy, leesy, textural white peach and light citrus fruit. Consistent in style with the winery's Fum the Chardonnay has plenty of clean acid, great fruit, and a nice butterscotch finish in the back of the throat.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a smooth blend of Red Mountain and Horse Heaven Hills Merlot, with a generous (18%) supplement of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's consistent with previous efforts and reminiscent of Reiningersatiny smooth, glossy and somewhat impenetrable. The tightly wound fruits taste of ripe raspberry, and the bright acidity adds intensity to the toasty, coffee-inflected finish. The wine is dense, supple and extracted, with hints of spice, herb, lemon thyme and citrusy high tones.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry, tannic and concentrated, a fierce, almost feral wine, but it's classic in the way of California mountain Zins. Floods the mouth with blackberry essence, wrapped into strong tannins and finishing with a crisp burst of acidity. Compelling and complex, it cries out for a rustic beef or pork dish, long simmered and well-seasoned.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"A rare find in at, this shows the potential of Viognier. Flavors of apricot liqueur, summer flower aromas, and concentration come together to make a rich, powerful wine. Because Viognier is not approved as a varietal in at, this is sold as a non-vintage table wine, but in fact this wine is from the 2004 vintage.","province":"at"},{"country":"US","description":"The fruit comes from Weinbau, DuBrul and Destiny Ridge. The Weinbau is old vine, and is the main component. This is a solid, meaty, deep purple and blue, with hints of smoked meat in the nose. Fruit flavors are tight, tart and run to the black cherry and blackberry flavors. Clearly varietal, with stiff tannins, a bit  chalky, but plenty of varietal character and a long finish with streaks of coffee and light herb. This is winemaker Ron Coleman's favorite red, and he gives it plenty of TLC that shines through in the bottle.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits. At the same time, acidity is crisp and citrusy, and there's a pleasant yeasty character, like Champagne, or a nice fino Sherry. The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is certainly a better Chard than the winery's '04. It's richer and more succulent, overall more rewarding in varietal fruit, including peaches and cream, pineapples, guavas and papayas, with a cinnamon spice finish. The wine also is characterized by crisp, crunchy acidity that makes it racy.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Here is a dense and intense Primitivo with exotic spice, clove, ground cinnamon and nutmeg backed by plump red fruit and toasted notes. A very nice ensemble with roundness and harmony and a rock-solid build. Cellar the wine for at least two more years.","province":"Southern it"},{"country":"at","description":"The Kollmitz's Joching vineyard is at the heart of Erich Machherndl's wines, producing both Riesling and Grner Veltliner. This Grner is impressively rich in a smooth, creamy style, with fresh green apples and white currant flavors. It should age well, its richness giving it the right structure.","province":"Wachau"},{"country":"US","description":"Lots to like in this Cab Franc. Shows ripe, attractive cherry compote, black raspberry pure, cola, cocoa, coffee and spice flavors, with a rich, earthy edge of balsamic, sauted mushroom and oaky vanilla. Then there are the tannins. They kick in and give the wine a youthful, lively structure. Very nice wine, but be sure to decant it for a few hours.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Concentrated and showing a whiff of volatility, this is a blend of 62% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and a splash each of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. Grapes are sourced from three different estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's acidic and extracted, but opens up with exposure to air into a supple, rich, muscular, raspberry and cherry-flavored red blend. There are hints of rock, fennel and smoke, and a long, concentrated and well-rounded finish.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark, dense, ripe and oaky, this ramps up the oak flavors to higher levels, with rich layers of smoke, cedar, honey and butterscotch wrapped into the spicy, sweet fruit. As the wine ages and opens up the lovely cherry/cassis core fruit should come into the spotlight. Call it a Washington take on ripe, high-octane California reds.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"Sweet and welcoming; a good deal among pedigreed red wines. The nose on this 100% Monastrell from older vines is mammoth, toasty and dark, while the palate is chunky and virtually melts with blackberry, plum and cherry flavors. A real-deal red with breadth and class. 1,000 cases made.","province":"Levante"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a dry Chardonnay, notable for its firm structure. Acidity and oak tannins provide the framework for the candied Meyer lemon, mango, floral, mineral and buttered toast flavors. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish that suggests very modest aging. Drink now through 2008.","province":"California"},{"country":"ar","description":"Few Argentinean wineries are doing everyday red wines better than Chakana. A case in point is this excellent, superbly balanced, easy-drinking Cab. The nose is meaty, earthy and magnetic, while the palate is ripe, harmonious and full of cassis and raspberry. It's fruity more than complex, with stature and style.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"ar","description":"Color, power, flavor and commendable balance; that's pretty much the format for Punto Final, one of ar's go-to brands for Malbec. This youngster is ripe and ready, and it holds form onto a long finish. If it seems a little young and clumsy upon pouring, air it out and it'll improve.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"A classic Bordeaux blend (about 30% each Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot, the rest Petite Verdot) This wine is still locked up tight upon release. There is metallic minerality underpinning the tart, austere fruit, but there are also surprising high notes of brandied cherries, and a sense of depth missing in more ordinary wines. This is definitely a wine to cellar for up to a decade. As always, this is sensitive, detailed winemaking.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is one of the riper of Siduri's crop of '05 single-vineyard Pinots. It bursts with cherry jam, sweet cola, vanilla and coffee fudge flavors that make it delicious, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The complex of acids, tannins and oak give it dimensions worth pondering. Best now and for five years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This doesn't disappoint. It's a Cabernet-based blend, with Merlot and Syrah. The '03 is lushly soft but dry and rich, with ripe, velvety tannins framing intense blackberry, coffee, tobacco and spice flavors.

Elegant and intense, it's ready now.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A 50/50 Cab/Merlot blend from Pepper Bridge, this is quite tight and reductive but grudgingly opens out. It's a stiff, hard wine, layered with blueberry, raspberry and cassis, and annotated with baker's chocolate and anise. Dark and unyielding, it has the muscle and authority to age for another six or eight years. There's a hint of green tea in the chewy tannins.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines.

This is good Washington merlot, with muscle, extract and plenty of stuffing. Flavors run to the dark side, blue/black fruits, mineral, licorice, smoke. It's got the kind of mass that will stand up to all meats, and the balance to age over the next decade or so. Nicely built, still tight and chewy.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"A bit oily textured, with bright lemon and herb notes that add some balance.

Plump and easygoing.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"From the cool Green Valley, a wine that didn't get quite ripe this year.

Not for them flamboyant fruit or a heavy plaster of oak. You won't find tropical fruits, scads of spices and vanilla.

Aged in a combination of American and Hungarian oak, there's a slightly reedy, wooden note and high-toned acidity on the finish.","province":"Virginia"},{"country":"it","description":"This is a very informal and easygoing red table wine that would taste great with pizza. It opens with a bright ruby color and shows aromas of cherry, raspberry and toasted almond.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"it","description":"Badia a Coltibuono's Cancelli is an informal, well-priced and handy little wine to stock for easy meals at home with family and friends. The simple bouquet is redolent of cherry and mild spice and the mouthfeel is tonic and bright.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"Heavy for a Pinot Noir, it's almost unrecognizable. While it is a nice, rustic red wine, dry and spicy, with lots of berry fruit, it's just not particularly Pinot-esque.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"Soft, young and fruity, with juicy black berry fruit flavors and only light tannins. Think barbecue.","province":"Southwest fr"},{"country":"US","description":"The Grand Vin from Water's Crest hits the nose with intense aromas of char, smoke and dark cherries, but is laced with a veil of green, vegetal notes throughout. On the palate, flavors of black coffee and rich black fruit are followed by a sweet vanilla chaser. Sturdy but supple tannins add structure and bite.","province":"New York"},{"country":"US","description":"After the initial bouquet of charred oak and espresso blow off, pretty aromas of ripe black cherries, spice and smoke linger on this beautifully balanced, regal Merlot blend. There's plenty of coffee and char on the palate as well, but layers of earth, mushroom and smoke flavors add complexity and depth.","province":"New York"},{"country":"US","description":"Soft and somewhat sweet, this rustic Petite Sirah has candied flavors of raspberries, mocha, bacon and black pepper. An easy sipper to enjoy now.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Too acidic, even for Petite Sirah, and the acidity compounds the tannins, making for a harsh mouthfeel. There are lovely berry and coffee flavors and a spicy, dry finish.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Rich flavors of peaches, pears, buttercream and toast appear in this dry Chardonnay, which shows no signs of tiredness, although many 2007s do. The chief problem is excessive softness. It lacks balancing acidity and brightness.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"There's not a ton of intensity to the bouquet of this wine, but some serious sniffing can coax out suggestions of red apple and white florals. The mouth offers a bit more by way of full, juicy cantaloupe and grapefruit supreme flavors. Fresh and easy; drink now.","province":"Languedoc-Roussillon"},{"country":"US","description":"A flamboyantly rich red wine, brimming with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry, red currant, cola, bacon, cocoa and licorice flavors.
