A real mouthful, with a measure or two of depth. Finishes big. Imported by Winebow.","designation":"Montsalvat"},{"country":"es","description":"This monster is intensely mineral, with aromas of crushed stones mixed with leather, lavender, pepper and cherry. In the mouth, it's heady with maple, leather, asphalt and cola. Comes at you in layers, the last of which is a finishing flow of espresso. Aged 20 months in new 500-liter barrels, not barriques. Imported by Europvin/Michael Skurnick Wines.","designation":"Manyetes"},{"country":"US","description":"With a majority of Grenache, this wine flatters with pure, sweet red and black cherry flavors. Syrah seems to bring color and depth, while Mourv dre contributes a delicious chocolate note. The wine is fully dry, high in alcohol, soft in acidity and utterly delicious.","designation":"Sticks and Stones"},{"country":"es","description":"Elevated from the first nosing through the multilevel palate and then out the door. Fragrant like an aromatic magnet, with red licorice, wild flower and jammy fruit. A potent brew, with some medicinal cherry to the toasty finish. Super healthy, with an aggressive personality. Could use a year or two to settle because now it's rather tannic. Imported by Europvin.","designation":"Clos Martinet"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a deliciously drinkable Cab, bursting with flavors of sun-ripened cassis and black currant fruit flavors, and a generous coating of well-toasted oak. It's dry, with a polished, velvety mouthfeel, and the tannins, while sturdy, are sweet enough to permit instant consumption.","designation":"Cyrus"},{"country":"US","description":"Perhaps even more closed and tannic than the Hillside Reserve, a big wine with a good future. Oozes ripe, pure black currant flavors, well-oaked, and is totally dry. Give it until 2008, then try again.","designation":"Wild Boar Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"A marvelous Cab that seduces with lush, ripe flavors of black currants, smoked meat and charry oak. Perfectly balanced, with softly expressive tannins. Displays power and elegance.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Young and a bit aggressive now in acids and tannins, with a raw, jammy quality, but what a good wine it will be in a year or two. Big and warm in red and black cherries, with hints of root beer and cinnamon, it will easily hold for 6 to 8 years.","designation":"Garys' Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Classic Napa Cabernet, from the clean, varietally pure black currant and cassis aroma to the smooth tannins and ripe currant and cassis flavors. This is a balanced, elegant wine, despite the full body. It goes down gently, leaving behind a long aftertaste of currants.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This lovely Cabernet shows well-defined black currant, olive and spice flavors, and has a good balance of acidity and grippy tannins. It's rich, dry and complex. The oak is pronounced, but perfectly balanced with the fruit. Really displays class and pedigree.","designation":"Chicken Ranch Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a distinctive blend of Roussanne and Viognier. It's impressively rich, offering up complex waves of kiwi, vanilla custard, white peach sorbet and white chocolate flavors. That makes it sound sweet, but it's a dry wine. A little soft, but totally delicious.","designation":"Contrarian"},{"country":"es","description":"Pure and nutty, with aromas of dried apricot and sea air. In the mouth you get lots of almond and butter, while the A-rate finish is buttery but also quite complex. A classic, refined wine that dances across your tongue like a ballerina. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.","designation":"NPU Amontillado"},{"country":"US","description":"About as fancy as Petite Sirah gets. Has the bones and authority of a great Cab. Lush, smooth tannins and full-bodied, with powerful, intense flavors of blackberries, plums, espresso, peppery spices and subtle notes from oak barrels.","designation":""},{"country":"es","description":"Sassy and forward, with ripe aromas and exotic flavors. This wine registers at 16% but it's not fortified, so it comes across more like a sweet but dry wine than, say, Port. Expressive and rich, with cherry cough drop, dark chocolate and raisin flavors. At one moment it's table wine, the next an elixir. And the finish won't quit. Perfect with cheese. Imported by Jorge Ordo?ez/Fine Estates from es.","designation":"Dol? de l'Obac"},{"country":"US","description":"A very fine Pinot. Medium-bodied and dry, it hits with tremendous spice and ripe red cherry flavors that are succulent. Although it's a silky wine, it has a great grip of tannins and acids that cry out for food. Achieves real complexity through the long finish.","designation":"Three Vineyards"},{"country":"US","description":"Pours dark, smells dramatic with its tapestry of blackberries, green olives, grilled meat, smoky oak and cocoa. This marvelously rich wine goes down smooth and velvety. Turns intense in flavor through a very long finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Take a sip, and you think, Wow, that's good. Dark, deeply aromatic in blackcurrants, mocha java coffee, subtle herbs, green olives and fine oak. Turns sweet but dry in blackberry and cherry flavors wrapped in beautifully ripe, soft, expressive tannins.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"I like this wine because it's different. You'll find green apple and pineapple flavors, and various toasted notes of wood, coconut and hazelnut, not to mention lees and Oriental spice. Those crisp Green Valley acids undergird the richness. Finishes complex and with great finesse.","designation":"Dobles L as Don Miguel Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Before you spend this much, you should know this isn't a wine to enjoy now or even soon. It's too tannic, too closed in. But chew on it and discover a rich core of blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit. I don't think it's a classic Oakville Cab, but it should reward cellaring. Drink 2008 and beyond.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"US","description":"Truly varietally correct, in the silky mouthfeel, crisp acids, delicate mouthfeel and cherry flavors, but goes the extra mile in achieving real complexity. Addictively drinkable, one of those wines whose pleasure is accentuated by a slight resistance, due to a sprinkling of dusty tannins.","designation":"Firepeak Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a tremendous Cabernet, the kind that screams its importance from the first sniff, but it's really too young to drink now. It's powerful in black currant and new oak, with suggestions of herbs and spices, but once those youthful tannins kick in, the wine shuts down. It should begin to come around by 2008 and hold for long after.","designation":"Cain Five"},{"country":"US","description":"With a higher percentage of Syrah than Sticks and Stones, Linne's Rising Tides is darker and deeper. It suggests black cherries veering into black currants, with a rich, dark chocolate note, and a finish of sweet, charry oak. Nonetheless it's a dry wine, and a little soft.","designation":"Rising Tides"},{"country":"US","description":"A fabulous Merlot that impresses with its instant deliciousness and complexity, yet is likely to hang in there and improve. Dark and full-bodied, with black currant, plum, grilled meat, olive, dark chocolate and spice flavors. The tannic structure is intricate, soft and complex. Drink now through 2010.","designation":"Suscol Ranch"},{"country":"US","description":"There's a lot of well-toasted oak on this wine, but it's easily able to handle it. In fact, the wood meshes seamlessly with the bright, intense cherry, pomegranate and spice flavors to produce extreme complexity. Still young and vibrant. Best in a year or so.","designation":"Fritschen Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"This is quite a serious Cabernet from a winery that hasn't been too visible for a while. It's intensely concentrated in cassis fruit, and well-oaked, and also fairly tannic and dry. Graceful and elegantly structured, it may well hold for a decade or more.","designation":"Miriam Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"This Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc blend continues the Dolce tradition of being among the finest dessert wines in California. The wine as usual is rich and unctuous, a glyceriney sweetie packed with apricot, peach, honey, vanilla and cr me br?l e flavors offset by crisp acidity. It's sweet, but not too sweet.","designation":"Late Harvest"},{"country":"es","description":"From Daphne Glorian, among the region's original new wavers, Clos Erasmus is simply one of the best, most typical Priorat wines out there. And while the '02 may not rank as a classic, it's still superb. Aromas of graphite, mineral and licorice dominate, backed by layered cherry, plum and earth notes. From four small vineyards around the town of Gratallops. About 450 cases made. Imported by European Cellars.","designation":"Tinto"},{"country":"es","description":"Nutty and intense, like peanut brittle reduced to liquid form but with less than half the corn syrup. It delivers beautiful texture and intensity; it's almost fruity, but then mushroom, almond and macadamia nut take over. With perfect weight and a finish that doesn't quit, this is a great dry Sherry. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.","designation":"Don Jos  Oloroso"},{"country":"US","description":"No malolactic fermentation makes this wine very acidic in feeling, with a fresh, green apple crispness. The flavors veer towards apples, limes and Meyer lemons, with complexities of mango and apricot. It's a very intense wine, and a notably good one. One sip is not enough. A bottle may be.","designation":"Red Shoulder Ranch"},{"country":"US","description":"Long and rich in ripe black cherry, blueberry and blackberry flavors, with an exquisite edge of dusty spice, this fully dry wine excites for its balance and seductiveness. It?s silky and airy, but a serious Pinot Noir. So good now it?s hard to resist, but could actually improve over the next 5 years.","designation":"Melville Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"How big this wine is, but how drinkable now. It's not just the fruit, which ranges from blackberries to cherries and cocoa, it's the tannic structure. Somehow it's soft and intense at once. Totally dry, and not overly alcoholic, this Zin picks up even more power on the finish.","designation":"Beatty Ranch"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark, full-bodied and rich, with well-detailed black currant and cocoa flavors and a flamboyant but balanced coating of new oak. Impresses not only for its power, but for the soft luxury of its mouthfeel. Beautiful now, and perhaps best over the next 5 years to capture in its youth.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Showing the best structure of Flora Springs' impressive quartet of '04 vineyard desigated Cabs, this is a firm, well-sculpted wine whose pedigree stands out, but it needs time. It's a big, tannic, closed wine, dry and astringent. But there's a gigantic heart of blackberry fruit, and I would be surprised if this wine doesn't turn into a real beauty by 2010.","designation":"Rutherford Hillside Reserve"},{"country":"es","description":"Round and lush, with immense fruit from the nose to the palate. Beautifully balanced, with sweet plum and berry flavors, a lash of smoke and a touch of pepper and thyme. There's nothing raw or earthy about this wine; it's opulent and pure, a testament to vineyard management and great winemaking in a tough year. Doesn't even need much cellar time; drink from 2006C09. Imported by Rare Wine Company.","designation":"Finca Dof "},{"country":"es","description":"A beauty that represents Priorat in its most complete form. Meaty and savage at first, Cims is a terroir wine of the first order. Still, it's polished, with a soft, smooth texture and impressive cherry, cola, spice and vanilla flavors. Coffee and mocha on the finish seal the deal. Made by Sara P rez of Mas Martinet. Imported by Multiple Importers.","designation":"Classic"},{"country":"es","description":"This reserve-level P.X. sets the gold standard for excellence in sweet sherry. The lovely bouquet straddles the line between unadulterated sweetness and impeccable slyness. The flavors of fig, chocolate, caramel, browned butter and cinnamon are amazing. So chewy and thick, but balanced by firm acids. Brilliant.","designation":"Cardenal Cisneros Reservas"},{"country":"US","description":"Nemesis contains almost 90% Syrah, the highest percentage of  Linne Calodo's three current red releases. It's a big, dark wine, saturated with cassis and dark chocolate flavors, with delicious notes of cherries, raspberries and oak. It has an interesting and complex tannin-acid structure. This compelling, authoritative Rh?ne blend showcases the brilliance of its terroir.","designation":"Nemesis"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a young wine that opens with a blast of white pepper, then airs slowly to reveal layers of cassis, grilled meat, chocolate, anise, tar and toasty oak. In the mouth, it's flamboyant and full-bodied, a little soft, but decadent. This wine is so rich in fruit, you could pour it over vanilla ice cream. It will be fabulous with a charbroiled steak.","designation":"Bone Rock"},{"country":"US","description":"This complex Syrah and  (with a little Zin) showcases both varieties at their western Paso Robles best. The Syrah is rich in dark berry-cherry and mocha flavors, while the Cabernet adds cassis and a nice tannic structure. I'm not sure what the 4 % of Zin brings, maybe a wild, peppery note. The final impression is of real class and distinction. Drink now and for the next few years.","designation":"Optimus"},{"country":"US","description":"Tasted in a rather tannic flight, this baby was even more tannic. It pours inky black, and reveals nothing in the aroma, save for grapes and oak. Yet there are powerful signs of a magnificent future, especially the long, sweet finish of blackberry syrup. Great now with robust fare, but should hold through the decade.","designation":""},{"country":"es","description":"The 2002 is the current vintage (reviewed in June), but this wine is superior and is just now entering its prime; call it red nectar with a cement foundation. Mogador offers the purest Priorat fruit going, and the '01 is ethereal, with chewy blackberry, chocolate and vanilla flavors along with horsehide, black pepper and tobacco on the finish. Imported by Europvin/Michael Skurnick Wines.","designation":"Tinto"},{"country":"US","description":"This fabulous mountain Cabernet blend is hefty in tannins, but it's so delicious and balanced, it's totally drinkable now. Massive black currant flavors penetrate the palate and last forever on the finish. Oak adds smoky, spicy complexities. Cellar a case of this wine through 2015 or so, opening one bottle a year to experience its evolution.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"ar","description":"Plump, woody and ultimately too weedy to score better. And the palate and finish are both tight as nails, with heavy tannins. Nowhere near balanced, as it goes in every direction. Imported by Paterno Wines International.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"za","description":"Smells raisiny and overripe, with a heavy mouthfeel and baked fruit flavors.","designation":""},{"country":"za","description":"Bricking already at this young age, with herbal notes and dried-out fruit. Light and inoffensive, but surprisingly past its prime.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Despite 15-1/2 percent alcohol, this wine still has residual sugar! Think what the brix must have been at harvest. Drinks like a Port, which is a major fault for a dry table wine. Tasted twice, with consistent results.","designation":"Peck Ranch Vineyard Reserve"},{"country":"ar","description":"Flat and vinegary, with mulchy aromas. An organic wine with not a lot going for it. It's chewy, with no overt edge or balance. Imported by S&amp;F Trading Company.","designation":""},{"country":"cl","description":"Murky and damp smelling, with buttery strawberry flavors. Peppery and dry, with a raw, thin mouthfeel. Acceptable at a base level.","designation":"Paso Hondo Reserva"},{"country":"es","description":"Saturated and completely unidentifiable as Cabernet. It's a monster in terms of color and size, and the flavors and aromas go all over the map but settle nowhere you'd recognize. On the border of acceptable. Imported by CIV/USA.","designation":""},{"country":"cl","description":"Green bean and bell pepper aromas, then red pepper and more green pepper to the palate, which does offer some plum and berry. Finishes with red pepper flake. Not impressive.","designation":""},{"country":"cl","description":"Good color, but mossy and rooty, with lemon-cola aromas. Shrill and tangy, with heat. Fails to turn the corner toward ripeness.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"cl","description":"Heavily toasted, with lemon and burnt-toast aromas. The palate is extremely lemony and short of any lushness normally associated with Merlot. Has color but no ripeness. Proof that Casablanca is not great for Bordeaux varieties.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"US","description":"I criticized Williams Selyem's Feeney Vineyard Zin for overly high alcohol, at 15.8 percent. This one is an inexcusable 16.3 percent. I wish someone would explain to me why it's necessary to harvest at these levels, unless you're making Port.","designation":"Bacigalupi Vineyard"},{"country":"ar","description":"Raisiny, with a texture that's flat as Kansas.
