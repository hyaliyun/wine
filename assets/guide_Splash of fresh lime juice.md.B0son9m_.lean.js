In a small frying pan, cook the bacon over medium heat until it&#39;s crisp and the pan full of gorgeous bacony fat, about 4 minutes. Take the pan off the heat, the bacon out of the pan and straight into the cavity of the chicken, sitting the chicken breast side up in a roasting pan as you do so. Pour the brandy into the still hot frying pan and let bubble for a minute. Pour the brandy mixture over the chicken. Place the roasting pan into the hot oven and roast for 45 minutes, making sure juices run clear between leg and body. Let rest 10 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56229,&quot;Loin of Pork Stuffed with Cepes or Truffles 1 (4-pound) loin of pork 3 truffles or 2 ounces dried cepes (porcinis) Salt Freshly ground black pepper Cloves garlic, thinly sliced 3/4 pint (1 1/2 cups) hot meat stock or water 1/4 pint (1/2 cup) white wine Serving suggestions: find salad and some sauteed potatoes Instructions: Ask your butcher to bone the loin and remove the rind, but keep both bones and the rind for the cooking. If you are using dried cepes, cover them with warm water and leave to soak for 30 minutes or until they are soft. Drain, reserving the liquid. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lay the meat on a board and season well with salt and pepper. Cut the truffles or cepes into little pieces and lay at intervals along the meat interspersed with slivers of garlic. Roll the meat up and tie it with string into a long bolster shape. Place it in a roasting pan surrounded by the bones and the rind cut into strips. Roast the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Pour in the hot stock or water, the wine, and the liquid from the cepes. Cover and cook for a further 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Remove the pork and keep hot. Strain the juices and reduce, then season to taste. Serve with the sliced pork. Or, if serving the pork cold, pour off the juices into a bowl and chill. Remove the fat, but keep it for frying bread or little potatoes--it has a splendid flavor. The juices will have jellied and should be chopped and arranged around the cold pork in a serving dish. Serve with what you will, such as a fine salad and some sauteed potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 56230,&quot;Cedar Plank-Smoked Salmon 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup kosher salt Freshly ground pepper 1 pound skin-on center-cut wild salmon fillet 2 slices lemon 3 to 4 sprigs thyme<br> Instructions: Brine the fish: Combine the brown sugar, salt, 1 teaspoon pepper and 4 cups water in a large bowl. Stir until the sugar and salt dissolve. Add the salmon and weigh down with a can or skillet to keep it submerged. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. Soak the wood chips and cedar plank in water 1 hour, then prepare your grill for smoking. About 30 minutes before smoking, remove the salmon from the refrigerator; drain and pat dry. Place the salmon, skin-side down, on the cedar plank and season with salt and pepper. Top with the lemon slices and thyme sprigs. Let stand at room temperature to dry out, 30 minutes. Once the grill reaches 250 degrees F, place the plank with the salmon on the cooler side of the grill. Close the grill and let smoke until golden and just cooked through, about 20 minutes. If using a gas grill, turn off the flame and let the fish sit 10 more minutes (this is not necessary if using charcoal; it imparts more smoky flavor). Remove from the grill and serve hot or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 56231,&quot;Breakfast Grilled Cheese 1/3 cup whipped cream cheese 1/4 cup small-curd cottage cheese 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for topping 4 frozen waffles (untoasted) 1 to 2 tablespoons jam (any flavor) 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more if needed Ground cinnamon, for topping Instructions: Mix the cream cheese, cottage cheese and confectioners&#39; sugar in a medium bowl.

Spray the iron on the top and bottom with cooking spray. Place the block of feta in the center of the waffle iron, then press until the feta melts and the waffle iron closes. Allow to cook until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix together the tomatoes, olive oil, olives, parsley, oregano, garlic and lemon zest and pour into a food processor. Briefly pulse until the mixture looks coarse. Taste and season to your liking. Remember, feta is salty; do not over season with salt. Remove the feta waffle from the waffle iron and cut into 8 wedges. Place on a platter and serve with the tomato mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 56234,&quot;Whole Roasted Baby Flounder with Sweet Onion Marmalade 12 cups finely sliced Wadmalaw Sweets or other sweet onions, such as Vidalia or Maui (about 3 pounds) 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 2 cups heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 4 12- to 18-ounce dressed baby flounders 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup peanut oil 8 tablespoons unsalted butter Instructions: To prepare the marmalade, bring the onions and stock to a simmer in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let gently simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, put the cream in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes or until the cream reduces by half. Uncover the onions, add the salt and pepper, and increase the heat to medium. Cook the onions, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes or until the liquid begins to get syrupy. The onions should be very slightly browned. Stir in the reduced cream and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the mixture is a little thicker than heavy cream. Add the vinegar, stir to combine well, and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors. Keep warm while cooking the fish. (Cooled and then tightly covered, the marmalade will keep in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Rinse the flounder and pat dry. In a shallow plate, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Dredge both sides of the flounder in the seasoned flour, shaking to remove the excess. Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the butter begins to sizzle. One at a time, carefully lay the flounder in the skillet, white-skin side down. After 2 minutes, sneak a peak at the bottom side to make sure it is browning without burning, but don&#39;t be timid--a nice nutty brown is good. Carefully turn the flounder with a spatula and cook about 2 minutes or until browned. Transfer the fish to a baking sheet large enough to hold them all in a single layer. Roast the flounder in the top third of the preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes, depending on their size. Look closely: the inside of the fish should be just flaky and opaque. It is important not to overcook them. While the fish are roasting, warm the marmalade to a simmer. Place the fish on warm serving plates, top with the warm sauce, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 56235,&quot;Roasted Pineapple with Whipped Cream 6 slices fresh or canned pineapple Butter flavored cooking spray 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar 1 cup heavy whipping cream, cold 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons white rum Small bunches mint or leaves, for garnish Instructions: Spray both sides of the pineapple rings with nonstick cooking spray. Rub the pineapple slices with the dark brown sugar. In a small chilled bowl, beat the cold whipping cream with an electric beater until it starts to thicken. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until it forms soft peaks. Add the rum and continue beating until medium stiff peaks form. Heat a grill or grill pan until very hot. Spray the grill with more nonstick cooking spray. Brush the pineapple slices with butter and lay the pineapple in a single layer on the grill until browned, turning once, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Add the pineapple and let roast until brown. Remove to a plate and allow to cool slightly. Arrange the pineapple slices on a serving platter, then add a large dollop of the chilled whipped cream to each slice. Serve 2 pineapple rings per person. Garnish; with small bunches of mint or a few mint leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling, Vinho Verde]&quot; 56236,&quot;Butter Pecan Crumpets 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon sugar, plus extra for sprinkling<br> 1/4 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1/2 cup milk, warmed to about 100 degrees F<br> 1 teaspoon active dry yeast<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> Coconut oil cooking spray, for spraying the skillet and molds 1/2 cup pecans, chopped<br> Apricot jam, for serving<br> Unsalted butter, for serving<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt to combine. Combine the milk and 1/2 cup warm water (about 100 degrees F) in a bowl and sprinkle with the yeast. Once the yeast starts to bubble, after 3 to 5 minutes, pour the liquid into the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon to combine. The batter will be thick. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. The mixture will rise slightly and some bubbles will form on top. Stir the baking soda and 1/4 cup warm water (about 100 degrees F) into the batter. Cover back up and let rest until doubled in size, another 30 minutes. Spoon the mixture into a large liquid measuring cup with a pouring spout for ease of pouring into the crumpet molds. Put a cast-iron skillet over low to medium-low heat and spray with the cooking spray. Spray four 3-by-1-inch ring molds with the cooking spray and place in the hot skillet. Fill each ring half full with batter (the batter should spread inside the rings; if not, add another 1/4 cup water and stir well to thin it). Wait for bubbles to start to form, then top with some pecans and sprinkle with sugar. The bubbles will help keep the pecans and sugar from sinking to the bottom of the crumpets. Cook until golden on the bottom, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the rings, flip and cook another 1 to 2 minutes, just to cook the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve with apricot jam and butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56237,&quot;Roasted Eggplant Garlic Salad 1 small eggplant 1 onion 2 cloves garlic, unpeeled 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan Salt and coarsely ground black pepper 1/4 cup loosely packed cilantro, roughly chopped Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub the eggplant and onion with the olive oil. Place on a baking sheet. Bake until the eggplant and onion have both softened, turning once, about 25 to 30 minutes. Add the garlic to the baking sheet with the eggplant and onions at the halfway point, after about 15 minutes. Cool until warm enough to handle. Peel the eggplant and the garlic and place in the bowl of a food processor. Cut the onion into quarters or large chunks, and add to food processor. Add vinegar, lemon juice, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Pulse until combined. Pulse longer if making a dip. Add cilantro. Taste and adjust seasonings. Refrigerate until ready to eat. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 56238,&quot;Cherry Jam Devil\\u2019s Food Cake Nonstick cooking spray 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for dusting the pans<br> 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar<br> 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup vegetable oil<br> 3/4 cup hot coffee<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 3 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1 cup sour cream, at room temperature<br> 1 cup Cherry Jam Filling, recipe follows 2 cups of your favorite chocolate frosting<br> 2 tablespoon cornstarch 2 cup frozen pitted sweet cherries<br> 2/3 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer for your filling. For the craquelin: Add the butter and sugar to a second stand mixer bowl fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until combined. Add the flour and beat to combine. Stir in a few drops of food coloring of choice and beat until uniform in color. Scoop the paste out onto a sheet of parchment paper with a rubber spatula. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and use your hands to press out into an even sheet. Then roll gently a few times with a rolling pin to flatten to an even 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet and freeze for 20 minutes. When the craquelin is frozen, remove it from the freezer. Peel the top piece of parchment off and cut rounds with a 2-inch round cutter. For the choux dough: Combine the butter, sugar, salt and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan over low heat. Once the butter has melted, bring it to a boil over medium heat. As soon as it boils, remove the pan from the heat and sift the flour directly into the pan. Stir the batter into a paste with a wooden spoon; you will have to beat it hard. Return the pan to medium heat. Stir the batter continuously until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and is slightly shiny, about 3 minutes. Transfer the batter to a stand mixer bowl fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until slightly cooled, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one thoroughly before adding the next. Fit a large pastry bag with tip #808 and fill with the choux dough. Pipe twelve 2-inch circular mounds, about 2 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the batter has a peak, dab it smooth with a wet fingertip. Beat the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water and brush the surface of the puffs with the beaten yolk. Using a small offset spatula, gently lift the craqulin rounds off the parchment and place on top of the cream puffs. Bake on the middle rack for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and continue baking until the puffs are golden brown, light, airy and crisp, 30 to 35 minutes more. If the cream puffs still don&#39;t feel completely dry and crisp at the end of the baking time, poke a hole in the bottom with a paring knife and place them back into the oven for a few more minutes to crisp up. Remove from the oven and cool completely on a wire rack. For the filling: Remove the stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment from the freezer. Add the cream cheese and sugar to the bowl and beat on high speed until completely combined. Add the heavy cream and vanilla and mix on low speed until mostly combined. Increase the speed to high and whip until soft peaks form. Add the dulce de leche (or your flavoring of choice) and beat until stiff peaks form. If you would like to tint your cream filling, add a few drops of food coloring at this point. To assemble: Cut the puffs in half with a serrated knife and set the tops aside. (If the puffs are very moist inside, scoop out the excess dough and re-crisp them in a 350 degree F oven for about 5 minutes. Cool completely before continuing.) Pipe with an open star tip or spoon the whipped cream filling into the bottom halves of the cream puffs. Replace the puff tops. Pipe a small star or dollop of whipped cream on top and decorate as desired with berries or melted chocolate.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56242,&quot;Maple Bacon Ice Cream 1 cup grade B maple syrup 4 cups half-and-half 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided 5 egg yolks 1/2 pound thick-cut bacon (about 6 slices) Instructions: In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, reduce the maple syrup to 1/2 cup. Set aside. Over moderate heat in a medium saucepan, heat the half-and-half with 1/2 cup sugar until hot and just bubbling around the edges. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks with 1/2 cup sugar, then add 1 cup hot half-and-half mixture in a slow stream, whisking constantly. Pour the whole egg mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture coats the back of the spoon and registers 170 degrees F on a thermometer. Do not let boil. Pour the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a medium bowl and whisk in the maple syrup. Cover with parchment paper letting the paper touch the surface of the mixture, to prevent a skin from forming. Chill the mixture until very cold, at least 6 hours and up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a rimmed sheet pan with heavy foil. Place a baking rack over the lined sheet pan and arrange the bacon slices across the rack next to each other. Bake until crispy, about 15 minutes. When cool enough to handle, finely chop. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside. Place the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring with a fork, until the sugar starts to melt. Stop stirring and cook until the sugar is a golden caramel color, about 10 minutes. Add the bacon and stir to coat. Pour onto prepared baking sheet and let harden. Chop the candied bacon into small pieces. Freeze the custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions, 20 to 30 minutes and at the last minute, add the candied bacon and let churn until just combined. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze. BYOC: Try adding some cayenne pepper to your chopped bacon before you stir it into the melted sugar.

Stir in the Sofrito and alcaparrado and cook until the liquid is evaporated and the Sofrito is sizzling. Season with the salt, pepper, and cumin. Toss in the bay leaves. Raise the heat to high and add the rice and corn. Cook, stirring, until the rice is coated with the oil and the grains begin to turn \\chalky,\\ about 3 minutes. Pour in enough chicken broth to cover the rice by 1-inch. Bring to a boil and cook until the level of the broth meets the level of the rice. Lower the heat to very low, stir the rice thoroughly but only once, and cover. Cook until the rice is tender but with a little bite and all the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving. Heat the oil and achiote seeds over medium heat just until the seeds give off a lively, steady sizzle. Don&#39;t overheat the mixture or the seeds will turn black and the oil a nasty green. Once they&#39;re sizzling away, pull the pan from the heat and let stand until the sizzling stops. Strain as much of the oil as you are going to use right into the pan; store the remaining oil for up to 2 days at room temperature in a jar with a tight fitting lid.

Lightly coat the squid with flour and fry 360 degree F oil until golden brown. We make this pizza the same way as the margarita except that the spicy oil is drizzled on instead of just olive oil and then the calamari is placed on top, and garnished with scallions. Prepare a hot charcoal fire, setting the grill rack 3 to 4 inches above the coals. On a large, oiled, inverted baking sheet, spread and flatten the pizza dough with your hands into a 10 to 12-inch free-form circle, 1/8-inch thick. Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness.<br> When the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the 2 corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear.<br> Using tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil.<br> Slide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired. Pizza Dough: Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it&#39;s shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls. Combine all the ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to very low, and gently simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the flavors continue to infuse the oil as it cools Strain the oil into a clean jar. When it has cooled to room temperature, cover and refrigerate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 56253,&quot;Callaloo 1 cup water 1/4-pound salt pork Meat from 2 cooked crabs, optiona 2 tablespoons butter, divided 4 chives, minced 1 onion, minced 3 garlic cloves, minced 8 okra, cleaned and diced 12 dasheen leaves, cleaned and stripped from their stalks* 4 cups coconut milk 1 1/2 cup grated or cubed pumpkin Salt Rice or cornbread, for serving Instructions: Pour 1 cup of water into a large saucepot.

Cook until the apricots are plump and all the liquid has been absorbed, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool; stir in the pistachios. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Unroll the pie dough on a clean surface; gently roll out the outer 2 inches of the dough to make the edges slightly thinner. Put the brie in the center of the dough and top with the fruit-and-nut mixture. Trim about 1 inch off the edge of the dough, all the way around. Brush the edge with some of the beaten egg. Pull the dough up and over the cheese to meet in the middle, folding and pleating as needed; pinch the dough at the top to seal. Transfer the wrapped cheese to the baking sheet and brush with the remaining beaten egg. Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 375? F.

While you make the vegetables, pour enough oil to submerge the snapper into a wide, deep, heavy-bottomed pot. You will need at least a quart, depending on the width of the pot and the thickness of the fish. Heat the pot over medium-high heat to 370 degrees F. Make the vegetables: Heat 2 tablespoons canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced ginger and sausage and cook until the sausage begins to give off its fat, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until they begin to give off their liquid, adding more oil if necessary. Add the tomatoes, scallions, carrot, leek, and cl, and cook until just soft, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and keep the vegetables warm. Fry the fish: Score the snapper 4 times from top to belly, starting about 3 inches behind the head and making the last slash about 2 inches from the tail; take care not to cut into the flesh. When the oil is almost hot enough, dredge the snapper in the flour, shaking off any excess. Skewer the fish from head to tail with a metal skewer, curving the fish as needed.

Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Mix the granulated sugar and eggs. Add the oil, slowly beating well as the oil is added. Add the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour and mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla and red food coloring. Divide the batter evenly among the pans and bake for 40 minutes, testing for doneness with a toothpick. Cool the layers in the pans for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto racks to finish cooling while you prepare the frosting. For the frosting: Cream the cream cheese and butter.

Spray four 6-inch cake pans with cooking spray. Prepare the cake mix according to the package directions. Divide the batter among the prepared pans and bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool on a rack 10 minutes, then unmold and cool completely.<br> For the buttercream frosting: Beat the sugar, butter and salt with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until incorporated. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium high and mix until smooth. Mix in enough milk to make it spreadable. Reserve 1/2 cup frosting in a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Mix food coloring into the remaining frosting to desired color.<br> For the decorations: Cut off the domed tops of the cake rounds with a serrated knife so they are completely flat (save the trimmings for another use). Using a paring knife or 5-inch round cutter, cut a 5-inch circle from the center of one cake round, making sure to keep the outer ring intact (this will be the rim of the mug). Trim the cutout circle to a thickness of 1 inch, then use a paring knife to cut out a handle that is about 4 inches long and 2 inches wide. While you assemble the cake, freeze the handle on a small plate until very firm (this will make it easier to frost).<br> Place a cake round cut-side up on a cake stand or serving platter. Spread with a thin layer of frosting almost to the edge. Top with another cake round and spread with a thin layer of frosting. Repeat with a third round. Top with the cake ring. Frost the entire cake with a thin layer of frosting to make a crumb coat (you don&#39;t need to frost the inside of the ring). Spread a thin layer of frosting on the handle. Freeze the cake and handle until the frosting is set and the handle is firm, about 30 minutes.<br> Frost the cake--excluding the center cutout on the top--with more frosting. Smooth the sides and rim with an offset spatula. Frost the handle. Hold the handle gently against the cake and insert two to four 4-inch skewers to attach it. Smooth over any smudges in the frosting on the handle. Pipe a stripe of the reserved white frosting around the top and bottom of the mug (or wrap with strips of sour candy rope). When ready to serve, fill the cavity at the top of the cake with the pudding and spread flat to the rim with an offset spatula. Just before serving, top with whipped cream, leaving a rim of pudding showing.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56266,&quot;Fresh Fruit Parfait with Lemon-Poppy Seed Yogurt 2 peaches, pitted, quartered, diced 2 kiwi, peeled, quartered and sliced 1 cup blueberries 1 lemon, juiced, plus zest for garnish 1 tablespoon sugar 2 cups lowfat plain yogurt 1 tablespoon poppy seeds Mint sprigs, for garnish Instructions: In a medium bowl place cut fruit, blueberries, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon sugar.

Sweeten the tomatoes with a light dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar (sprinkling through a wire strainer will help an even dusting with no clumping!). Drizzle olive oil over top, again making sure to get some on every tomato.<br> Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Put the pan in the oven and cook for about 8 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 56289,&quot;Pastura 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting work surface 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1 1/3 cups honey, warm 1 large egg 12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 1/4 cup heavy cream About 6 ounces unblanched whole almonds (about 1 1/2 cups) Vegetable spray Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Measure the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves into the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the honey and egg and beat on low to medium speed just until mixed. This makes a very sticky dough. You can roll it out immediately or scrape it into a ball, place it in a bowl, cover with a tea towel, and chill for 2 hours or up to overnight. Combine the chocolate and cream in a heatproof bowl and place over (but not touching) a saucepan with gently simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until melted and smooth. Let cool until warm. (To melt in a microwave, mix the chocolate and cream in a bowl and microwave on high for about 30 seconds. Stir, then repeat.) Stir the almonds into the chocolate. Meanwhile, cut 4 sheets of parchment paper large enough to fit your baking sheet. The dough is very sticky and difficult to roll out even on a well-floured surface. Lightly spray 2 parchment sheets with vegetable spray. Transfer half the dough onto 1 sprayed sheet of parchment and top with the second sheet. Begin to spread the dough out with your hands, then roll the dough into as even a rectangle as you can, about 10 inches by 15 inches. It can easily be pushed and prodded into shape. Peel off the top sheet of parchment. Spread half the chocolate mixture in a 3 or 4-inch-wide band lengthwise down the center of the dough, leaving the top half of the dough and a 1-inch border around the remaining 3 sides bare. Use the bottom parchment to fold 1 side of the dough lengthwise over the chocolate mixture. Carefully peel back the parchment paper and press the edges of the dough together with a fork to seal. Slide the shaped log, still on the parchment, onto a baking sheet. Lightly spray the remaining 2 sheets of parchment with vegetable spray, and repeat the shaping and filling with the remaining half of the dough and chocolate mixture. Slide the log onto the same baking sheet, if there is room. The dough is so soft it is best to not move it off the parchment until after baking. Bake for 20 minutes. Cool completely and then slice into 1/2-inch slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56290,&quot;White Chocolate Risotto 5 cups unsweetened almond milk 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and beans scraped<br> 2 tablespoons butter<br> 2 cups Arborio rice<br> 4 ounces white chocolate, chopped<br> 1/8 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1 cup blackberries<br> 4 ounces unsweetened dark chocolate, grated, for garnish<br> Instructions: Bring the almond milk, sugar and vanilla beans and pod to a simmer over low heat for 5 minutes. Remove the pod and keep the milk warm while you prepare the risotto. Heat the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon to coat evenly with the butter. Lower the heat to medium low and begin adding the milk 1 cup at a time, stirring often and allowing each addition of milk to be absorbed before adding the next. Be sure to run the spoon along the bottom of the pan to ensure the risotto doesn&#39;t stick or burn. Cook until the rice is tender but still firm, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the white chocolate and salt. Serve warm, garnished with the blackberries and a sprinkling of grated dark chocolate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56291,&quot;Rustic Strawberry Tart and Sweetened Whipped Cream 4 cups strawberries, halved 1/2 cup granulated white sugar<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting your work surface<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1 teaspoon lemon zest<br> 1 teaspoon lemon juice<br> 2 store-bought pie dough crusts, thawed if frozen<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 tablespoon water plus a splash 1/3 cup apricot preserves<br> Sweetened Whipped Cream, for serving, recipe follows 1 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon granulated white sugar<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Add the strawberries to a bowl along with the sugar, flour, vanilla extract, lemon zest and lemon juice and toss together until well combined. Set aside while you prepare the crust. Lightly flour your work surface so the crust doesn&#39;t stick. Unroll the pie crusts and lay one on the other, overlapping about halfway. Use a rolling pin and roll the crusts in the center to join them together and to spread them out slightly. It should be about 19 inches by 11 inches and fit on a sheet pan. Use a knife to round the top and bottom edges slightly and along the sides to neaten up the edges; no more than 1/2-inch of dough should be cut away. (Discard the extra dough.) Transfer to a parchment-lined-sheet pan. Spoon the strawberry mixture into the center of the dough leaving a 1-inch border around all sides. (Be sure they aren&#39;t too mounded so they bake evenly in the oven.) Working carefully, fold edges of the dough up and over the strawberries, pleating them as you go. In a small bowl, whisk the egg and 1 tablespoon water together. Use a pastry brush to lightly coat only the folded edge of the dough. Place the sheet pan into the oven and bake the tart for 30 minutes. Rotate the pan halfway through the bake to make sure it bakes evenly. While it is baking, heat the apricot preserves in a small pan with a splash of water until warmed through. When the crust is golden brown, remove it from the oven. Brush the strawberries gently with the warmed apricot preserves and cool completely before cutting and serving with the Sweetened Whipped Cream. With a whisk, a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream and white sugar until it has formed soft peaks.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 56292,&quot;Sausage and Tri-Color Pepper Sauce for Pasta 1 pound Italian sausage, pricked 1/4 cup olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 each small green, yellow and red bell pepper, cored and sliced 1/2 teaspoon each dried thyme and rosemary, crumbled Salt and freshly ground pepper 1/3 cup chicken broth 12 ounces tubular pasta Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, to taste 1/3 cup toasted bread crumbs combined with 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves Instructions: In a skillet set over moderately high heat, cook the sausages until they are browned well, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil over the chicken. Rub the chicken to coat evenly with seasonings. Place under broiler to lightly brown the chicken skin, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken from broiler and set oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Pour the stock and wine into the pan and cover tightly with foil. Braise chicken in the oven until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow chicken to rest in baking pan, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place a large saucepan over high heat. Add the milk and 3 cups water and bring to a boil. Slowly add the polenta, whisking constantly to prevent lumping. Reduce the heat to low and cook, whisking occasionally to prevent sticking, until polenta is done, approximately 45 minutes. Add the cheese, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Place a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is preheated add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and the greens. Season lightly with some of the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Toss with tongs, lowering heat if necessary to prevent burning, until wilted and tender, then check the seasoning and adjust to your taste. Preheat the broiler. Remove chicken from roasting pan and place on an ovenproof sheet pan. Remove and discard the onions and lemons.

Fill the pot with just enough water so the turkey is completely submerged. Quickly remove the turkey from the pot of water then mark the water line on the inside of the pot with a wax pencil or crayon. This will be the fill line to let you know exactly how much oil you will need to add to the pot. Discard the water and make sure to thoroughly dry both the turkey and the pot before adding the oil. It is extremely important to make sure the turkey and pot are completely dry. Any water in the hot oil will cause it to pop and splatter. Add enough oil to the pot to reach the fill line and with a paper towel wipe off the fill line that you drew. Put the pot on the propane burner provided in the turkey frying kit. Clip the oil thermometer provided to the pot and into the oil. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 250 degrees F. Arrange the turkey on the insert from the frying kit. Slowly submerge the turkey into the hot oil. Bring the temperature of the oil up to 350 degrees and maintain this temperature for the duration of the cooking time. Fry for about 45 minutes and remove turkey from oil and check the internal temperature. Turkey is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 151 degrees F. After removing the turkey from the oil, allow it to rest on a cutting board or platter, until the internal temperature reaches 161 degrees F.

Cut each of these pieces in half lengthwise and in half again, to make a total of 12 \\sticks.\\ (If your chorizo is thick, these pieces may be too large for the dates, in which case cut in half again.) Insert each chorizo piece into a date and close the date around it. Wrap a strip of bacon around each date. Secure, if necessary, with a toothpick. (May be prepared ahead.) Place the wrapped dates in a skillet with the seam side of the bacon down and saute until the bacon is golden. Turn and brown on the other side. Drain on paper towels. You may now serve the dates, or proceed to coat and fry them. If you are continuing, this step may also be done in advance. Wipe out the skillet, then heat the oil at least 1/2-inch deep to about 380 degrees F. Dust the dates with flour, then dip them into the egg and immediately into the hot oil.

Soak in the fridge overnight or up to 24 hours. When you&#39;re ready to fry the chicken, remove the bowl from the fridge and let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes to take off the chill. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 360 degrees F and mix the breading. Put the flour, seasoned salt, paprika, pepper, thyme and cayenne (extra cayenne if you like heat) in a very large bowl and stir together well. In a small bowl, combine the milk and remaining 1/4 cup buttermilk. Pour into the flour mixture and, with a fork, gradually mix until there are little lumps throughout. This will adhere to the chicken and make for a crispier breading. If necessary, add a little more flour or milk to the bowl in order to make it slightly lumpy. Heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 365 degrees F. Lower the heat slightly, if necessary, to keep the oil from getting hotter. Working in batches, thoroughly coat each chicken piece with the breading, pressing extra breading onto the chicken if necessary. Place the breaded pieces on a plate. Add the chicken to the oil 3 or 4 pieces at a time. Make sure they aren&#39;t sticking together, then cover the skillet and fry for 5 to 7 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the chicken isn&#39;t getting too brown. Turn the pieces over, cover again and cook 3 to 5 minutes more. All the while, monitor the temperature of the oil to make sure the chicken doesn&#39;t burn. Transfer the fried chicken pieces to a baking sheet (they will not be completely cooked through) and continue frying the rest of the chicken. Bake the thighs for 15 minutes to finish the cooking process. Sometimes I&#39;ll cut into the thicker part of one of the larger pieces, just to make sure the chicken is cooked through. (If any pink juice or meat is visible, the chicken needs to continue cooking in the oven.) Cover and keep warm. For the waffles: Preheat the waffle iron to the regular setting. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, vanilla and 2 egg yolks. Pour over the dry ingredients and very gently stir until halfway combined. Pour in the melted butter and chopped jalapenos and continue mixing very gently until combined. In a separate bowl (or using a mixer), beat the 4 egg whites with a whisk until stiff. Slowly fold them into the batter, stopping short of mixing them all the way through. Scoop the batter into your waffle iron in batches and cook according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions (lean toward being a little deep golden and crisp!). Keep warm. For the sauce: Pour the pancake syrup and bourbon in a small pot and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and whisk in the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, then the cayenne. To serve: Place 2 chicken thighs on top of a waffle. Pour the warm sauce over everything and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 56319,&quot;Grilled Sweet Potato Wedges with Maple Butter 3 sweet potatoes, each cut into 8 lengthwise wedges 3 tablespoons olive oil Maple Butter, recipe follows Flaked sea salt, to taste 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/4 cup maple syrup 1/2 teaspoon allspice Instructions: Heat grill to medium-high heat.

Drop the tomatoes into the blender jar or food processor bowl followed by the garlic clove, the almonds, basil leaves, peperoncino and 1/2 tsp salt. Blend for a minute or more to a fine puree; scrape down the bowl and blend again if any large bits or pieces have survived. With the machine still running, pour in the olive oil in a steady stream, emulsifying the puree into a thick pesto. Taste and adjust seasoning. (If you&#39;re going dress the pasta within a couple of hours, leave the pesto at room temperature. Refrigerate if you&#39;ll use it longer storage, up to 2 days, but let it return to room temperature before cooking the pasta.) To cook the spaghetti, heat 6 quarts of water with 1 tablespoon salt, to the boil in the large pot. Scrape all the pesto into a big warm bowl. Cook the spaghetti al dente, lift it from the cooking pot, drain briefly, and drop onto the pesto. Toss quickly to coat the spaghetti, sprinkle the cheese all over, and toss again.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Set aside. For the tapenade: Place the olives, lemon juice, oil, capers, rosemary, thyme, anchovies and garlic in a food processor. Blend until smooth. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pizza dough into two 10-inch diameter circles, each about 1/4-inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 4 circles of dough from each and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Using the tines of a fork, prick the dough all over. Spread about 1 tablespoon of the tapenade over each dough circle (any extra can be used to top fish or chicken, or mixed through pasta or used as a spread for sandwiches) and place a slice of tomato on top. Drizzle with olive oil and bake until the dough is crisp and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Place the tuna and the olive oil from the tuna can in a small bowl. Using a fork, lightly mash the tuna.

Over very low heat, cook at a bare quiver for 3 hours, adding more water as necessary as it evaporates. With an oven glove, turn the can over and cook for 2 1/2 hours more. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate overnight. In a blender, combine the milk, eggs, sugar, flour, butter, salt, vanilla, cloves, and cinnamon and blend until completely smooth. Let the batter sit in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Heat a small nonstick skillet and pour in about 2 tablespoons of the crepe batter, swirling the pan immediately to make sure the batter covers the pan evenly. Cook until small bubbles form on the surface, then flip to the other side. Slide onto a plate and make the remaining crepes in the same way, stacking them on the plate until you are finished. To assemble the crepes: open the can of cooked condensed milk and stir it up from the bottom with a fork, blending to an evenly thick consistency. Spread about 1 tablespoon of the \\cajeta evenly over the surface of one crepe. Scatter some of the toasted pecans over the top and roll up into a tube. Repeat with the remaining crepes and reheat in a low oven for a few minutes before serving.

For the choux paste: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Bring the water, milk, butter, sugar and salt to a simmer over medium heat in a medium saucepan, stirring with a wooden spoon. As soon as it comes to a boil, add the flour, stirring constantly, until the dough forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and let the dough cool for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed to allow the dough to cool, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, with the mixer on medium speed. When all the eggs have been incorporated, scrape the dough into a pastry bag fitted with your desired tip. Pipe the dough into 4 1/2-by-3/4-inch lengths on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 3 inches apart. You should end up with about 15 eclairs. With a damp fingertip, flatten any points. Bake until eclairs are deep golden brown and puffed, rotating the sheets halfway through, 22 to 25 minutes. They should be very light and crisp. Turn the oven off. Poke each eclair on either end with a toothpick to allow some steam to release. Return the eclairs to the oven, prop the door open a crack and allow them to dry out, about 15 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and allow the eclairs to cool completely. For the chocolate glaze: Meanwhile, bring the cream to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and mix in the chocolate, cocoa powder and honey. Whisk until the chocolate has completely melted. Transfer to a medium bowl and allow the glaze to cool and thicken. For the pastry cream: Add the milk, vanilla bean and salt to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and cornstarch until thick, pale and smooth. Remove the vanilla bean pod from the hot milk and scrape the seeds into the milk, discarding the pod. Temper the hot milk into the egg mixture by slowly pouring it in while whisking constantly. When combined, pour back into the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir continuously until thickened, then remove from the heat and mix in the butter and vanilla extract. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then set a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour. For the caramelized bananas: When the pastry cream is almost ready, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat. Stir together the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl, then pour into an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Place the bananas cut-side down on the cinnamon sugar, coating them as much as you can. Using a paring knife or fork, poke the skin of the bananas a few times to allow steam to release. Bake until completely caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before gently flipping them over. Remove the bananas from their skins and discard the skins. Place the roasted bananas in a food processor and puree until smooth. Add the pastry cream and puree until smooth. Pour into a pastry bag fitted with a small metal tip. For the garnish: In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crispy. Add the peanuts and salt and toast together, about 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel-lined sheet tray to drain any excess fat. When cooled slightly, roughly chop the mixture. To serve, poke a small hole in both ends of each eclair using a paring knife. Fill the eclairs from both ends with the banana pastry cream. Dip the tops in the chocolate glaze, allowing any excess to drip off. Lightly sprinkle with the bacon and peanut garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 56330,&quot;Huevos a la Mexicano Tacos with Chipotle-Honey Bacon 1/4 cup honey 1 tablespoon chipotle in adobo puree 8 slices bacon 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 small Spanish onion, finely diced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 serrano cl, finely diced 8 large eggs 2 tablespoons creme fraiche 4 corn tortillas, store-bought or homemade, recipe follows 4 ounces fresh masa Instructions: For the chipotle-honey bacon: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Whisk together the honey and chipotle in a small bowl until combined; set aside. Put the bacon slices on a baking sheet in one layer, about 2 inches apart. Bake, flipping once, until the bacon is golden brown and crispy, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, blot the top of the bacon with some paper towels and carefully pour off any fat from the baking sheet. Immediately brush the top of the bacon slices with the honey glaze and let sit until the bacon cools down and the glaze hardens. For the creme fraiche eggs: Heat the butter and oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and some salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the serrano and cook to soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Whisk the eggs in a bowl until light and fluffy. Add the eggs to the skillet, dollop with bits of creme fraiche and cook, stirring constantly, just until soft curds begin to form. Stir in some more salt and pepper and immediately remove from the heat. Spoon some of the eggs into each tortilla, top with 2 strips of bacon and fold. Serve immediately. Roll the masa into four 1-ounce balls; cover them with damp paper towels. Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. Line a tortilla press with a piece of plastic wrap or a self-sealing bag that has been cut so that only the bottom is still attached. Put one of the dough balls slightly off center in the press and close to flatten. Carefully peel the tortilla from the plastic. Cook in 30-second increments, turning a few times, until warmed through and lightly toasted. Keep warm wrapped in clean kitchen towels and repeat with the remaining masa, stacking and rewrapping the tortillas so that they steam and stay pliable. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 56331,&quot;Quinoa and Bean Pilaf 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 bell peppers (1 red, 1 green), cut into 1/2-inch pieces 3 scallions, sliced (white and green parts separated) 3 scallions, sliced (white and green parts separated)<br> 2 stalks celery, diced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 tablespoons tomato paste Pinch of cayenne pepper Kosher salt 1 cup quinoa 2 15-ounce cans black and/or kidney beans, drained and rinsed 4 cups baby spinach (about 3 ounces) 1/2 cup shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese Hot sauce, for serving (optional) Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bell peppers, scallion whites and celery and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, tomato paste, cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring often, until the tomato paste turns brick red, about 2 minutes. Stir in the quinoa, then add 2 cups water and the beans. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until most of the water is absorbed and the quinoa is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Add up to 1/4 cup more water if necessary.<br> Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the spinach until just wilted. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and half each of the scallion greens and cheese. Divide among bowls and sprinkle with the remaining scallion greens and cheese. Serve with hot sauce.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 56332,&quot;Butternut Squash Agnolotti with Bacon and Aged Balsamic 1 pound all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting 5 large eggs 3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Semolina flour, for dusting 4 cups cubed butternut squash Extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Kosher salt 1 pint ricotta cheese 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 2 large eggs Extra-virgin olive oil 3 slices bacon 3 garlic cloves, smashed 1 cup finely diced butternut squash Kosher salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup chicken stock 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves 1/2 Granny Smith apple, finely diced 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving Aged balsamic vinegar, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the pasta dough: Put the flour in a pile on a clean, dry work surface. Make a hole about 8-inches wide in the center of the flour pile. Crack all the eggs into the hole and add the olive oil and salt. With a fork beat the eggs and slowly begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture. Do not worry about the lumps. When most of the flour is incorporated, begin kneading the dough mixture with your hands. Knead the dough until it is smooth and supple, about 10 to15 minutes. It is really important to put your whole body into kneading otherwise the pasta will not develop the proper consistency. You need to knead! Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it relax for at least 1 hour. If using immediately do not refrigerate. While the dough is resting, make the filling: Put the butternut squash onto a baking sheet. Drizzle with some olive oil and add the cinnamon and a big pinch of salt. Mix it all together to coat the squash and arrange it in 1 layer on the baking sheet. Roast until the squash is soft and browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven and put it into the bowl of a food processor. Add the ricotta cheese, Parmesan, and the eggs and process until smooth. Taste and add salt, if needed. Scrape the filling into a pastry bag and refrigerate until ready to use. Roll the pasta: Set the pasta roller on the widest setting. Start with half the pasta dough. Using your hands, flatten the dough as much as you can to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Run the dough through the roller twice dusting it with flour in between rolls if it feels sticky. Fold it into thirds turn it 90 degrees and run it through the pasta machine 2 to 3 times. Continue to run the pasta through the machine reducing the setting between each run. Stop when you get to the second to last setting. Always hold the pasta on the tops of your hands, palms down! If you hold it with your fingers up you will create stretch marks and those are never good. To assemble the agnolotti: Lay the pasta sheet on a floured work surface. Brush the lower half of the pasta (the part that is closest to you) lightly with water. This is the \\glue\\ that will hold the agnolotti together. Use the water sparingly, if you use too much it will slide and not stick. Pipe 1-inch balls of filling onto the pasta that has been brushed with water, leaving about 2-inches between each ball. Fold the top half of the pasta over the balls to meet the bottom edge. Using your 2 index fingers poke around each filling ball to seal the agnolotti shut and make sure there are no air bubbles. Cut out each agnolotti using a small round fluted cutter. Transfer to a sheet tray coated with semolina or polenta. Cover and set aside until ready to use. To make the sauce: Put a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil into a large saute pan over medium high heat. Cut the bacon into small pieces and add it along with the garlic to the pan. When the garlic is lightly browned and aromatic remove it from the pan and discard it. When the bacon is crispy add the squash, season with salt, to taste, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the butter, chicken stock, and sage, and cook until the sauce thickens and looks velvety. Stir in the apple and taste for seasoning. Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the agnolotti and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully remove the pasta from the water and immediately put it into the pan with the sauce. Bring it to a boil, shaking the pan frequently. Remove from the heat, sprinkle in the Parmesan, and swirl the pasta until it&#39;s coated with the sauce. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately, sprinkled with a little more grated Parmesan and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.

Squeeze the lemon over the zucchini and almonds and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle the oil over the platter. The platter can sit for up to 20 minutes this way, allowing the flavors to gently marinate the zucchini, but still leaving a crunch of the raw zucchini.<br> Just before serving, tear the mint leaves and strew over the platter.

To serve, finely chop the garlic and cl and stir through with the lime juice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 56335,&quot;Mozzarella Kosher salt 12 ounces fresh mozzarella curd Instructions: Heat a pot of water until very hot (160 degrees F to 170 degrees F). Add a generous amount of salt. Place a large bowl filled with ice water nearby. Put the curd in another large bowl; add enough hot water to cover the curd. Let the curd soften, about 3 minutes, then gather it into a ball and hold it over the water; fold and pull it like taffy until elastic, about 5 minutes, dipping it back into the hot water if it gets stiff. Don&#39;t overwork the curd, as this will make your finished cheese rubbery. If the water cools too much, simply pour it off and add more of the hot water. When soft and smooth, divide the curd into 4 portions and form each into a ball. Plunge the mozzarella balls into the bowl of ice water and let cool. Slice and eat! Serve the fresh cheese at room temperature. Refrigerate leftovers, covered with salted water, for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Prosecco]&quot; 56336,&quot;Chicken Spaghetti 1 whole raw chicken, cut into 8 pieces 1 pound thin spaghetti, broken into 2-inch pieces 2 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar 1/4 cup finely diced green bell pepper 1/4 cup finely diced red bell pepper 1 teaspoon seasoned salt 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Two 10 3/4-ounce cans cream of mushroom soup 1 medium onion, finely diced Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the chicken pieces to the boiling water and boil for a few minutes, then return the heat to medium-low and simmer, 30 to 45 minutes.<br> Remove the chicken and 2 cups of the chicken cooking broth from the pot. When the chicken is cool, remove the skin and pick out the meat (a mix of dark and white) to make 2 generous cups.<br> Cook the spaghetti in the same chicken cooking broth until al dente. Do not overcook. When the spaghetti is cooked, combine with the chicken, mushroom soup, 1 1/2 cups cheese, the green peppers, red peppers, onions, seasoned salt, cayenne, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir in 1 cup of the reserved chicken cooking broth, adding an additional cup if needed.<br> Place the mixture in a casserole pan and top with the remaining 1 cup cheese. Cover and freeze up to 6 months, cover and refrigerate up to 2 days or bake immediately until bubbly, about 45 minutes.

Pulse for a few seconds to combine. Add the butter and pulse 10 to 12 times, until the butter is in small bits the size of peas. With the motor running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse just until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a floured board and knead quickly into a ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.<br> Roll the dough slightly larger than 10 by 14-inches. Using a ruler and a small knife, trim the edges. Place the dough on the prepared sheet pan and refrigerate while you prepare the apples.<br> Peel the apples and cut them in half through the stem. Remove the stems and cores with a sharp knife and a melon baller. Slice the apples crosswise in 1/4-inch thick slices. Place overlapping slices of apples diagonally down the middle of the tart and continue making diagonal rows on both sides of the first row until the pastry is covered with apple slices. (I tend not to use the apple ends in order to make the arrangement beautiful.) Sprinkle with the full 1/2 cup of sugar and dot with the butter.<br> Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the pastry is browned and the edges of the apples start to brown. Rotate the pan once during cooking. If the pastry puffs up in one area, cut a little slit with a knife to let the air out. Don&#39;t worry! The apple juices will burn in the pan but the tart will be fine! When the tart&#39;s done, heat the apricot jelly together with the Calvados and brush the apples and the pastry completely with the jelly mixture. Loosen the tart with a metal spatula so it doesn&#39;t stick to the paper. Allow to cool and serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 56341,&quot;Orange Chicken 2 tablespoons cornstarch 4 egg whites 4 boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces 1/2 cup orange juice (I used Simply Orange) 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 packed tablespoon brown sugar 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil Dash salt Dash crushed red pepper 1 clove garlic, pressed A little grated or minced ginger 1 teaspoon cornstarch Vegetable or peanut oil, for frying Instructions: For the chicken: In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and egg whites with a fork until almost frothy, about 1 minute. Add the chicken to the mixture and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. For the sauce: Meanwhile, put the orange juice, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, sesame oil, salt, crushed red pepper, garlic and ginger in a small nonstick skillet and whisk. Heat until bubbling and starting to thicken, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl and add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the cornstarch slurry to the sauce. Mix in and thicken for 1 minute. Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F. Carefully drop the chicken into the oil and move it around, flipping gently, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Let the pieces drain on a plate lined with paper towels for 2 to 3 minutes. Then drop them back into the oil for 1 minute to really solidify the coating. Toss the chicken in the sauce and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 56342,&quot;Quick Sausage Meatballs with a Tomato and Basil Sauce, Spaghetti and Sweet Raw Peas Olive oil 8 good-quality pork sausages 1 pound spaghetti Sea salt A few sprigs fresh marjoram, thyme or rosemary, leaves picked 11 ounces fresh peas, in their pods 1 block Parmesan, to serve Olive oil 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely sliced 1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves picked, stalks finely chopped 2 (14-ounce) cans good-quality plum tomatoes Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Good quality balsamic vinegar Instructions: Heat a large saucepan and add a few glugs of olive oil. Snip the sausages apart, then squeeze and pinch the meat out of the skins so that you get little meatball shapes - don&#39;t make them too big or they will take too long to cook. Try to get at least 3 balls out of each sausage. Don&#39;t worry about rolling them into perfect balls and making them look all fancy - rough and rustic is good! Put them into your pan. Keep frying and turning the meatballs until they&#39;re golden brown and cooked through. Meanwhile, put the spaghetti into a large pan of salted boiling water and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. To make your tomato sauce, heat a separate pan and pour in some olive oil. Add the garlic and the chopped basil stalks and move them around the pan for a couple of minutes. Put some small basil leaves aside for later, and sprinkle the rest into the pan. Add the tomatoes and season carefully with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a simmer, break up your tomatoes a bit more with a spoon and add a swig of balsamic vinegar - it&#39;s lovely for adding sweetness to the sauce. Add the herbs to the pan of sausage meatballs, tossing everything in all the lovely flavors. Cook for around 30 seconds. When your spaghetti is cooked, drain it and divide the pasta and meatballs between 4 bowls. Spoon over the tomato sauce. Sprinkle over the reserved basil leaves and serve with a handful of fresh peas per person in the middle of the table, so that everyone can have a go at shelling their own, and a little Parmesan for grating or shaving over the top. \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Next, find a durable thick cloth and fold it over several times to create a square; this will steady the clams as you shuck them and also protect your hand. Using the towel as a mitt, hold the clam firmly in the palm of your towel-covered hand; have a small bowl handy to catch the delicious juice. Insert the tip of a clam or oyster knife between the shell halves, and work it around one side to the other as you pry it open. Using the knife, cut the muscles away from the top shell, bend the shell back, and discard it. Run the knife underneath the clam to detach it completely, but leave it in its shell (take care not to cut the meat itself.) Tip out the clam juice into the bowl and pour it back over the shucked clams. Nestle the clams in a bed of crushed ice or rock salt to keep them steady. Spoon the cucumber mignonette on top and serve as part of a raw shellfish bar. In a small bowl, combine the rice wine vinegar, shallots, ginger, cucumber, black pepper, and cilantro; mixing with a fork.

Spray a 9-by-13-inch ceramic or metal baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted, boiling water until about 2 minutes less than package instructions. Reserve 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking water. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, heat a large Dutch oven or heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Heat the olive oil in the pan, then add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and starting to brown at the edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic is very aromatic, another minute. Add the sausage and cook, crumbling into small chunks with the back of a wooden spoon, until browned all over, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup pasta water to the pan and scrape up any of the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour in the heavy cream and cook, stirring frequently, until it comes to a simmer. Stir in the kale, then cover the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the kale is wilted and tender and the heavy cream has thickened, another 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle the nutmeg and about 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper on the kale (taste here, as your sausage might have different seasonings). Remove from the heat and stir in the ricotta until just combined, followed by 1/4 cup each of the fontina and mozzarella. Add the pasta and stir until it is coated in sauce and the cheese starts to melt, adding pasta water if the mixture seems too thick. Taste and season with a little more salt, pepper and red pepper flakes if desired. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and top it with the remaining 1/4 cup fontina, 1/4 cup mozzarella and the Parmesan. Broil the pasta until the cheese is brown and bubbling, about 5 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56374,&quot;Fried Chicken with Ancho Honey 1 quart buttermilk, plus 2 cups Kosher salt 2 teaspoons chili de arbol powder, or 2 tablespoons hot sauce 2 chickens (3 to 4 pounds each), cut up into 8 pieces each 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon sweet paprika 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper Freshly ground black pepper Peanut oil, for deep-frying Ancho honey, recipe follows 1 cup honey 2 tablespoons ancho chili powder Salt Instructions: Whisk together 1 quart of the buttermilk, 2 tablespoons salt, and the chili de arbol in a large bowl or large baking dish. Add the chicken, turn to coat, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Place the remaining 2 cups of buttermilk in a bowl. Stir together the flour, garlic and onion powders, paprika and cayenne in a large bowl and divide among 2 shallow platters and season generously with salt and pepper. Drain the chicken in a colander and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces a few at a time in the flour mixture and pat off excess, then dip in the buttermilk and allow excess to drain off. Dredge in the second plate of flour and pat off the excess. Put the chicken pieces on a baking rack set over a baking sheet while the oil heats. Pour about 3 inches of oil into a deep cast iron skillet; the oil should not come more than halfway up the sides of the pot. Put the pot over medium-high heat and heat the oil to 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the chicken pieces to the hot oil, 3 or 4 at a time and fry, turning the pieces occasionally, until evenly golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a rack to drain; repeat to cook the remaining pieces. Serve hot, drizzled with the ancho honey. Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl. Season with salt, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 56375,&quot;Pork and Kielbasa with Sauerkraut, Mushrooms and Potatoes 3 pounds fresh (refrigerated) sauerkraut 2 cups chicken or beef broth 1 ounce (1 cup loosely packed) dried mushrooms 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more if needed 2 pounds pork shoulder (butt) or loin, cut into 1-inch cubes, well trimmed 1 pound kielbasa 1 teaspoon caraway seeds 2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks 3/4 pound parsnips, scrubbed and cut into 2-inch chunks (or use 2 additional potatoes) 1/2 cup sour cream, plus more to pass at the table Salt and pepper 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill for garnish Instructions: Drain the sauerkraut and reserve the brine. Taste the sauerkraut and if you find it much too strong, rinse it until you like the way it tastes -- keeping in mind that the flavor will be diminished when it is cooked with the other ingredients. Drain well and set aside. Heat the broth in the pressure cooker. Set the dried mushrooms in a bowl and pour the hot broth over, submerging them in the broth with the back of a spoon. Cover with a plate and set aside until the mushrooms are soft, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse and dry out the cooker. Heat the butter and oil over medium-high heat. Brown the pork and kielbasa in 3 or 4 batches, about 4 minutes per batch, adding more oil if needed. Set aside. With a slotted spoon, remove the reconstituted mushrooms from the broth and squeeze them over the bowl to catch the liquid they release. Coarsely chop the mushrooms if the pieces are large. Carefully pour the broth into the cooker, taking care to leave behind any sediment on the bottom. Set the cooker over medium heat and stir well to scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Add the mushrooms and half of the sauerkraut. Set the browned pork and kielbasa on top. Cover with the remaining sauerkraut and sprinkle caraway seeds on top. Set the potatoes and parsnips on the kraut. Lock the lid in place. Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Reduce the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 10 minutes. Quick-release the pressure. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow excess steam to escape. Ladle out 1/2 cup of the broth and blend the sour cream into it. Then stir this mixture back into the pot as you stir well to distribute all of the ingredients. If you&#39;d like a stronger sauerkraut flavor, add some or all of the reserved brine. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle lightly with dill. Pass additional sour cream in a bowl at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 56376,&quot;Creme Chatelaine 5 egg yolks 1 3/8 cups superfine sugar 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest 5 egg whites 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 1/4 cups flour, sifted 1/2 cup creme de cacao 1/2 cup rum 6 egg yolks 4 tablespoons superfine sugar 4 teaspoons water 1 cup marsala 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, whipped 4 marrons glace Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Bake bacon in a single layer on a sheet pan for 10 to 15 minutes. When crisp break bacon in halves. Set aside. Pour cold water into a 10-inch saute pan to a depth of about 2 inches. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat so that the surface of the water barely shimmers. Add the vinegar. Break 4 of the eggs into individual saucers, then gently slide them out 1 at a time into the water and, with a large spoon, and lift the white over the yolk. Repeat the lifting once or twice to completely enclose each yolk. Poach until the whites are set and the yolks feel firm yet soft when touched gently, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and either serve immediately, or place in a shallow pan or large bowl of cold water. Repeat with the remaining eggs, adding more water as needed to keep the depth at 2 inches, and bringing the water to a simmer before adding the eggs. To serve, reheat the eggs as necessary by slipping them into simmering water for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Place 2 toasted English muffin halves on each of 4 plates and lay 2 half strips of bacon on each. Place 1 poached egg on top of each muffin half and drizzle with the Tasso Hollandaise. Arrange the oysters on top of the eggs and around each plate, garnishing with the chopped green onions and parsley, and serve immediately. In the top of a double boiler, or in a bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, whisk the egg yolks with the lemon juice and 2 teaspoons water until egg yolks are thick and pale yellow. Remove the double boiler or bowl and saucepan from the heat and gradually add the butter, whisking constantly to thicken. Add enough tepid water to thin to pouring consistency. Add the tasso, salt, and cayenne and whisk well to blend. Adjust the seasoning, to taste. Serve immediately, or cover to keep warm for up to 10 minutes, whisking occasionally to keep from separating. In a bowl, combine the buttermilk with 1 tablespoon of the Essence. Add the oysters and marinate for 20 minutes. Combine the masa harina and flour with the remaining Essence in a shallow dish. In a deep-fryer or a medium, heavy pot with high sides, heat the oil to 360 degrees F. Dredge the oysters in the flour mixture and shake the pieces in a strainer to remove any excess. Carefully add to the hot oil in batches, and cook, turning occasionally, until golden on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the oysters with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and serve immediately. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \\New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch<br> Published by William Morrow, 1993. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 56378,&quot;Grilled Breakfast Tacos 8 ounces fresh chorizo (about 2 links) 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup cherry tomatoes 2 ears yellow corn, shucked 1 bunch scallions 1 jalapeno, halved 2 limes, halved Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped 8 large eggs 2 tablespoons heavy cream Eight 6-inch corn tortillas 4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, finely shredded (about 1 1/2 cups) Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium heat. Prick the chorizo links 3 or 4 times with a fork (this keeps them from bursting on the grill). Brush them all over with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Grill, flipping as needed, until charred all over and cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly, then slice into 1/4-inch-thick rounds; set aside. Meanwhile, thread the tomatoes onto a 10-inch skewer. (If using a wooden skewer, leave just 1/2 inch sticking out on each end so you do not have to soak it.) Put the skewered tomatoes, corn, scallions, jalapeno and limes on a rimmed baking sheet or large platter, brush the vegetables and limes liberally with 2 tablespoons of the oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place the vegetables and limes (flesh-side down) on the grill. Grill the corn, using tongs to rotate the ears occasionally so they cook evenly, until lightly charred in spots, 7 to 9 minutes. Grill the tomatoes, scallions, jalapenos and limes, rotating as needed, until deeply charred, 4 to 6 minutes. Return the vegetables and limes to the baking sheet when done cooking. Transfer the cooked chorizo to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, halve the tomatoes, cut the kernels off the cobs and thinly slice the scallions and jalapenos (seed the jalapeno, if desired). Put the cut vegetables, the juice of 2 of the lime halves and the cilantro in a large bowl; stir to combine, and season with salt and pepper. Cut the remaining 2 grilled lime halves into wedges; set aside. Meanwhile, whisk together the eggs, cream and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Place a large cast-iron skillet on 1 side of the grill, and pour in the remaining oil (it might seem like a lot, but you do not want the eggs to stick). Heat the oil for 1 minute, then add the egg mixture. Use a heat-resistant spatula to stir the eggs until soft curds form, 6 to 8 minutes. Gently stir in the chorizo. While the eggs are cooking, grill the tortillas on the other side of the grill until lightly charred on both sides and warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes total. To assemble the tacos, divide the egg mixture among the warm tortillas, sprinkle each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the cheese and top each with a spoonful of the grilled salsa. Serve immediately with the grilled lime wedges and any remaining grilled salsa on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 56379,&quot;Cheese Platter French Camembert, Le Chevrot (a sharp goat cheese) Rondin with herbs (a creamy goat cheese) Montagnolo (a creamy blue cheese). Instructions: Go to the best cheese shop in town and ask the person at the counter which cheeses are ready to serve. Taste everything; they expect you to. We all know that the Brie may look terrific, but it can be underripe and tough or overripe and ammoniated. You want only the freshest cheeses that are perfectly ripened. Take them home, refrigerate them, and then bring them to room temperature a few hours before serving.<br> Second, be sure to have a platter or wooden board that is flat and large enough to hold the cheeses without crowding them. Arrange the cheeses with the cut sides facing out, and with several small cheese knives, maybe one for each type of cheese.<br> Third, to finish the platter, add sliced breads or crackers, and green leaves. I use either lemon or galax leaves, which you can get from your florist. If you have a garden, any large flat leaf like hydrangea looks beautiful, but be sure they aren&#39;t poisonous and are pesticide-free!<br> Overall, the simpler the design, the better the platter looks. Group each kind of cheese together and add one large bunch of green or red grapes in the center to create a visual focal point. Fill in the spaces with lots of crackers or small slices of bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 56380,&quot;Classic Vanilla Buttercream 2 cups sugar 1/2 cup water 4 egg whites 1 pound butter, cut up 1 to 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions: In a small clean dry saucepan, place 2 cups sugar and then pour 1/2 cup water down the sides of the pan. Make an X in the sugar with 1 finger to encourage the water to seep into the middle of the pan of sugar. Bring to a boil and cook until softball stage or 235 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Meanwhile, in a mixer with a whip attachment, whip the whites until they form soft peaks. When the syrup is up to temperature, drizzle it down the wall of the mixing bowl with the mixer running. Continue whipping until light, fluffy and almost cooled down. Start adding the butter a few cubes at a time to cool the frosting and thicken it. When it gets thick you can stop adding butter; you may not use the whole pound (it depends on how much water you cooked out of your syrup). Add vanilla extract to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 56381,&quot;Chicken Karahi 6 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 teaspoon ginger, julienne 2 to 3 fresh tomatoes, diced 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 1 green chili, finely chopped 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 pound chicken, cooked 1 cup water 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala 1/2 teaspoon dried fenugreek 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped 1 tablespoon finely chopped green coriander Instructions: Heat oil in a large deep frying pan adding chopped onions and fry for 4 to 5 minutes on a medium heat or once the onions are slightly brown. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a further 1 or 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, salt, chili powder, green chili, ground cumin and turmeric. Turn up the heat and further cook for another 1 minute then put in the chicken. It is very crucial that spices are mixed within the pan at this point to ensure that the chicken cooks with texture and flavor. Add water after stirring the chicken into the spices. Turn down the heat slightly and stir in the garam masala and fenugreek and cook for a further 5 minutes, also adding in the bell pepper stirring now and again. Serve sprinkled with green coriander. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 56382,&quot;Chicken Francese with Lemon and Pecorino 1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast 2 heaping tablespoons of finely grated Pecorino cheese 4 tablespoons very finely chopped parsley 1 egg, beaten well Flour for dredging 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 cup chicken stock 6 thin, round slices of lemon, seeds removed 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: Cut the chicken breasts into 6 pieces of roughly equal size. Place the pieces between sheets of waxed paper, and pound with a mallet until they&#39;re thin. Season with salt and pepper. Place cheese and parsley in a wide, shallow bowl. Slowly add the beaten egg, whisking until it&#39;s smoothly incorporated. Place the flour on a wide plate. Dip the pounded chicken in the egg mixture. Remove, letting excess egg drip off. Place each cutlet in the flour, and coat lightly. Remove from flour and hold them in a single layer. Add the olive oil to a saute pan large enough to hold the 6 cutlets in a single layer. Place over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the cutlets. Saute, turning once, until the cutlets are golden on the outside, just cooked on the inside (about 2 minutes per side). Remove the cutlets, and hold them in a single layer. Spill the oil out of the saute pan. Return the pan to high heat. Add the white wine, and reduce it to 2 tablespoons. Add the chicken stock and the lemon slices. Boil for 5 minutes, then remove the lemon slices. Keep boiling the sauce until it&#39;s reduced to 1/2 cup. Turn heat to very low. Swirl in the butter until the sauce is thickened. Add the reserved chicken, turning them until they are coated in sauce. Divide cutlets among 2 plates, pour remaining sauce over them, sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley, and serve immediately.

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Toss the potatoes with some olive oil in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour onto a baking sheet in an even layer and transfer to the oven. Roast until golden brown, stirring halfway through, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside until ready to use. Meanwhile, season the boiling water with salt. Add the string beans and blanch until tender yet crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the beans from the boiling water and shock in a bowl of ice water to stop cooking. As soon they are cold to the touch, drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. Set aside until ready to use. Set a heavy-bottomed, high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat and fill with 1 to 2 inches of oil. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F. Lay out a large piece of plastic wrap on a cutting board. Set the pork chop on the plastic wrap and cover with another piece of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet, evenly pound the chop to approximately 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick. To a shallow dish, add the flour. To a second shallow dish, add the eggs and whisk to combine. To a third dish, add the breadcrumbs. Dredge the pounded pork chop in the flour on both sides and shake off any excess. Then coat the chop in egg, again shaking off any excess. Lastly, add the chop to the breadcrumbs, pressing the breadcrumbs into both sides of the chop. Test the temperature of the frying oil with a piece of breadcrumb; if it bubbles all around and doesn&#39;t stop, the oil is ready. Carefully add the pork chop to the oil and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and season with salt. While the pork is frying, make dressing. For the salad and dressing: Add the shallot, vinegar and mustard to a bowl. Whisk in the olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Butter a 9-inch pie plate. Pulse the graham crackers and peanuts in a food processor until finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse to combine. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the side of the prepared pie plate. Bake until set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. Meanwhile, put the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave at 50 percent power in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until melted and smooth. Spread evenly in the prepared crust with a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon; set aside until the chocolate sets, about 10 minutes. Make the filling: Beat the heavy cream in a bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form; refrigerate until ready to use. In another bowl, beat the peanut butter, cream cheese, milk and vanilla on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix on low speed until incorporated. Gently fold half of the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture until combined, then fold in the rest. Spoon into the prepared crust and smooth the top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours or overnight.

Add the butter, sage, rosemary, shallots and a pinch of salt, and cook an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, cut off the skinny neck of the squash and cut in half (remove the stem, but leave unpeeled). Cut the bulb into 4 quarters. Remove the seeds and stringy flesh and add them to the Dutch oven. Cook until fragrant and golden, about 5 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and allow to reduce for a couple of minutes. The seed mixture should look rich and flavorful. Add 2 cups water and the chicken stock and nestle in the squash, flesh-side up (you should be able to just fit one nice-size squash in almost one layer). Cover and simmer until very tender, about 40 minutes. Once cooked, cool slightly, remove the squash, scoop out the flesh and place in powerful blender. Strain the liquid through a metal sieve, gently pressing against the solids to extract all of the flavor. Blend the broth with the squash until very creamy, about 1 solid minute on high. Wipe the Dutch oven clean and place the soup back into the pan. Heat gently, and then stir in the vanilla just before serving. Season with salt and pepper and pour over a little chunk of either cooked spicy sausage or a small lump of crab meat in a shooter glass. Top each shooter with a tiny bit of chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 56390,&quot;Biscotti Regina 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter 1 cup sugar 3 large eggs 4 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Zest of 1 small lemon 1 cup milk 2 cups sesame seeds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

Add shallots and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, until soft. Stir in rice and half of the chopped mint making sure to coat all the rice grains with the oil. Add wine and cook until most of the liquid (as well as the alcohol) has evaporated. Season with a little salt and pepper. Ladle in 1 cup of hot stock. Using a wooden spoon, stir gently until most of the stock has been absorbed. Keep adding stock a cup at a time and stirring. After about 10 to 15 minutes, test the rice. It should be cooked and creamy but still have a slight bite to it. (You may not need all of the stock.) Gently fold in peas and 1/4 cup butter. Stir in the parmesan cheese and taste for seasoning. Remove from heat and cover while you sear the scallops. Set a non-stick saute pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Pat the scallops with paper towels to make sure they are very dry. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Add scallops to pan, making sure not to overcrowd, and cook until they are nicely browned on both sides, about 4 to 8 minutes depending on the size of your scallops. Check the risotto and add a bit more stock if it has gotten too thick. In a shallow bowl or plate, make a nice mound of risotto and top with 3 or 4 scallops. Garnish with remaining mint and a drizzle of olive oil.

Add the rice back to the bowl, cover with enough cold water to come 2 to 3 inches above the surface of the rice and soak for at least 6 hours and up to overnight. Soak the mushrooms in 1 1/2 cups warm water in a medium bowl until softened, about 45 minutes. Soak the dried shrimp in a small bowl with enough warm water to cover until slightly softened, about 15 minutes. Drain the shrimp and set aside. Fill a large pot or wok that fits an 8- to 10-inch steamer basket with water (the water shouldn\\u2019t touch the bottom of the steamer) and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Line an 8- to 10-inch steamer basket with 2 layers of damp cheesecloth or a damp lint-free towel. Drain the rice, spread it in an even layer in the prepared basket and poke a few holes halfway through the layer. Insert the basket in the steamer, cover and steam until the rice is translucent and tender, about 35 minutes. Uncover and remove from the heat to cool slightly. Meanwhile, squeeze the water from the mushrooms and remove and discard the stems. Roughly chop the caps and transfer to a small bowl with the reserved shrimp. Measure out 2 tablespoons of the mushroom-soaking liquid into another small bowl and discard the remaining soaking liquid. Mix the light soy sauce, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, chicken bouillon powder, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt with the reserved mushroom-soaking liquid until the sugar and salt are dissolved; set aside. Add the peanuts, oil and scallion whites to a wok or large nonstick pan and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until the peanuts darken slightly and the scallions have slightly softened, about 1 minute. Add the sausage and cook until it releases some oils, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and shrimp and cook until heated, about 2 minutes. Swirl in the wine around the hot sides of the wok or pan and stir until most of the wine has evaporated. Add the rice and gently break up the clumps with the back of a wok turner or a spatula. Re-mix the seasoning sauce in the small bowl, then pour most of the sauce over the rice, leaving about 2 tablespoons behind. Cook, stirring and breaking up the rice clumps, until the seasonings are mixed into the rice. If there are parts of the rice that without seasoning, pour the reserved sauce directly over that rice. Mix in the scallion greens and cilantro. Divide the sticky rice among 4 small plates. Alternatively, transfer the sticky rice to small bowls and firmly press on the rice mixture to mold to the shape of the bowl. Invert onto larger plates and remove the glass bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 56393,&quot;Bucatini Marinara with Sausage 3 tablespoons butter 1 medium onion, diced (about 1 1/2 cups) 1 medium carrot, diced 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper flakes 2 (28-ounce) cans diced tomatoes 1 dried bay leaf 2 teaspoons sugar Kosher salt 1 pound bucatini pasta or thick spaghetti 12 ounces ricotta cheese, room temperature 1/2 cup julienne fresh basil leaves, for garnish Grilled Sweet Italian Sausage, recipe follows 8 links sweet Italian sausage Instructions: Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.

I like goat cheese for the \\tang\\ factor and the supple texture. This goes great with a bowl of my chicken soup but can really fit in with any soup for the \\comfort\\ factor. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, shut off the heat and add the thyme leaves. The thyme should make a crackling sound as it hits the oil, cooking it slightly and mellowing the flavor. Add the bread in a single layer. Turn the heat back on and cook over medium heat until the first side browns, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a pair of tongs to turn the toasts on their second side and season with kosher salt. Top each round with a slice of cheese and continue cooking them over very low heat or off the heat, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Adjust the seasonings with sea salt, to taste. Serve alone or alongside soup, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56432,&quot;Pepperoni Breadstick Bites 1 (10.6-ounce) can refrigerated breadstick dough 1 (3.5-ounce) package Hormel?

Add the egg, vanilla extract and salt and mix on low speed until combined. Add the flour cup by cup, mixing on low speed after each addition, just until incorporated. (The dough will look crumbly.) Scrape down the sides of the bowl and dump out onto a lightly floured surface. Use your hands to push the dough into a mound. Divide the dough in half and flatten each half into a thick square. Wrap both pieces of dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and rest the dough at room temperature for 15 minutes to soften slightly. Sprinkle flour over the counter and a rolling pin. Remove the dough from the plastic wrap and dust lightly with flour. Roll each piece of dough into a square that is 1/4-inch thick. Cut the dough into 4-by-2-inch rectangles (or use a cookie cutter). Carefully place on the prepared baking sheets. Continue until all of the dough has been cut into rectangular cookies. Bake the cookies until golden brown on the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, prepare the edible chalk. Heat the candy melts in a bowl in the microwave until melted, about 1 1/2 minutes. Pour into a pastry bag and cut the tip. Insert the tip of the pastry bag into 1 end of a silicone tube mold. Apply even pressure to the bag to fill the mold with candy, then tap the mold on the counter to flatten out the candy. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Remove from the molds and set aside for cookie decoration. Prepare the royal icing: You will create 2 batches of black icing, one that&#39;s stiff for piping the cookie borders, and one that&#39;s loose to flood the cookie surface. Place 1/2 cup royal icing in a bowl. Pour in 10 drops of black gel food coloring and whisk together until the color is evenly incorporated. Pour into a squeeze bottle. Following the shape of the cookie edges, pipe a border of stiff icing on each cookie. Place the remaining royal icing in a bowl. Pour in 15 drops of black gel food coloring and enough water to reach the consistency of pure maple syrup (add water by the teaspoon). Whisk until the color is evenly incorporated and the desired consistency is reached. Pour into a squeeze bottle. Flood the cookie surface with this icing, filling the rectangle evenly with color. Use a toothpick to push the icing into the corners of the rectangle or to poke any air bubbles that may form. Repeat until all the cookies have been decorated. Allow the cookies to dry for at least 4 hours. When ready to serve, present the chalkboard cookies with the edible chalk. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56471,&quot;Spiced Chocolate Fondue 1 cup heavy cream (see Cook&#39;s note) 4 cinnamon sticks 8 ounces finely chopped semisweet chocolate Cubed pound cake Mini-bananas Fresh or dried orange slices Fresh or dried pears Almond cookies Coconut strips Strawberries Instructions: In small saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream and cinnamon sticks just to boil.

Cut the salmon into paper-thin slices. Reserve. Roll or stretch the dough into 4 (8-inch) circles. Place the pizzas on a lightly floured wooden peel. Brush the center of each pizza to within 1 inch of the edge with olive oil and sprinkle it with some of the red onion. Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake 8 to 12 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Remember that the oven is very hot and be careful as you place the pizza into and out of the oven. Mix the dill with the sour cream or creme fraiche and freshly ground pepper to taste. Transfer the pizzas to heated dinner plates and spread them with the sour cream mixture. Divide the salmon, and arrange decoratively over the cream. Place a spoonful of golden caviar in the center of each pizza, then spoon a little of the black caviar into the center of the golden caviar. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball). Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. To prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. If you find this difficult to do, use a small rolling pin to roll out the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Prosecco]&quot; 56476,&quot;Mini Key Lime Cheesecake with Raspberry Sauce Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the molds 3/4 cup fine graham cracker crumbs 1/4 cup sugar<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) salted butter, melted<br> Two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 3/4 cup sugar<br> 2 teaspoons freshly grated lime zest<br> 1/4 cup Key lime juice (from about 13 small Key limes or 2 large regular limes)<br> 1 heaping tablespoon cornstarch<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 3/4 cup thawed frozen raspberries 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lime zest<br> Instructions: For the crust: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Place a piece of veal on the plastic, and cover with another sheet of plastic. Pound the meat with a meat pounder or other flat utensil until it is uniformly 1/8 inch thick. Repeat with remaining pieces. (The butcher could also do this step.) Lay the veal out on the work surface. Top each piece with a slice of prosciutto and then a slice of cheese. Fold the veal over to completely enclose the prosciutto and cheese and secure with toothpicks. You should have nice little flat pachages about 3 by 2 inches. Sprinkle both sides of the veal with salt and pepper, to taste. Place the flour on a small plate and dredge the veal packages in the flour, shaking off any excess. Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter foam subsides, add the meat and brown on both sides, turning as necessary. Reduce the heat if necessary to keep the veal from burning. When the packages are golden brown, transfer them to a heated plate. Add the Marsala to the pan juices and stir well to release the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to low, return the veal to the pan, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, with a lid slightly ajar, until the meat is tender and cooked through. Return the veal to the heated plate. Add the lemon juice and parsley to the pan, increase the heat, and cook for 1 minute, or until the sauce has thickened.

Add nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, sugar and eggs. Whisk together until smooth, about 3 minutes. In a medium bowl, mix together walnuts, brown sugar, and banana slices. Slice the ends off the French bread. Starting at 1 end, measure about a half inch down the loaf and slice the bread 3/4 of the way through. Measure about another half inch, and slice cleanly through the bread. You should have a 1-inch slice of bread with a cut down the middle. Repeat this process until the bread is all sliced up. Take a piece of the cut French bread and stuff a few tablespoons of the banana mixture into the slit in the middle. Add a good amount, but do not overstuff so that the mixture won&#39;t stay in the center. Repeat until all the slices are stuffed. Preheat a skillet or flat-top grill over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, coat it with 2 tablespoons of butter. Pour the crushed-up cornflakes onto a plate. Take a slice of stuffed bread and dip it into the egg mixture, coating both sides liberally.

Flip the toast over and cook the other side. Repeat the coating and cooking process for each slice of bread, and add more butter to the grill or skillet as necessary, about 2 tablespoons of butter per slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 56511,&quot;Penne with Vodka Sauce and Mini Meatballs Kosher salt 12 ounces penne pasta 8 ounces ground beef chuck 3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces) 1/4 cup breadcrumbs 1 large egg, lightly beaten 3/4 cup chopped fresh basil 3 cloves garlic (1 minced, 2 sliced) 2 1/2 pounds beefsteak tomatoes, halved 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup vodka 1/4 cup heavy cream Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Preheat grill to high or preheat the broiler. Cut the avocado in half lengthwise. With a spoon carefully remove the avocado meat. Reserve the shells. Cut the avocado into 1/3-inch dice and place in a mixing bowl. Add lime juice and cover closely with plastic wrap. Remove the lobster meat from tail and parboil for 1 minute or until no longer translucent. Place lobster meat on the grill basting with butter just long enough to get a little grill flavor (about 1 minute per side). If cooking indoors, broil until lightly golden. Remove lobster from the grill and dice into approximately the same sized cubes as the avocado. In a large bowl, gently mix the avocado, lobster, red bell pepper, jicama and onion. Drizzle in half of the vinaigrette and carefully stir to mix evenly. Taste for seasoning and add more dressing or salt or pepper, as needed. Generously stuff the avocado shells.

Add sugar and 1 cup of the flour. Mix well and let stand in a warm place about 15 minutes for the yeast to activate. Mix another 2 1/2 cups flour into the yeast mixture with the dough hook attachment until smooth. With the machine running, add 1 cup flour and knead for 6 minutes. Turn out onto a board and lightly knead in remaining 1/2 cup flour. The dough should remain rather wet to ensure a soft and light bread. Shape the dough into a ball and put it in an oiled bowl. Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk about 20 minutes. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press dough with finger to gently stretch dough to fit in pan, and then use a rolling pin to lightly flatten. Oil an 11 by 17-inch baking sheet with 1/3 cup olive oil. Transfer the dough to the baking sheet. Using your fingertips, nudge the dough into a rectangle. Cover and let rise again until doubled, 30 to 40 minutes. To bake, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Make indentations all over the dough by pressing with your fingertips being careful not to puncture all the way through the dough. Brush olive oil over the top, filling in the wells.

Let cool completely. Meanwhile, cut 4 sheets of parchment to about the size of baking sheets. In separate microwave-safe bowls, melt the melting candy in the microwave in 10 second intervals until fully melted.<br> Dip a 1/2-inch paintbrush into one color of melted candy, making sure you have a generous amount on the brush. Paint a 1-inch stripe on one of the parchment pieces; the line should be opaque-- brush on more if necessary. Repeat with the remaining melts, covering each piece of parchment with different colored candy lines. You should have 72 brushstrokes of the white candy and 96 brushstrokes each of the yellow, orange and red candy. If the bowls of melting candy harden during the process, soften in the microwave as needed. Let the stripes set at room temperature until dried, about 15 minutes. Pipe or spread a generous amount of frosting on the cupcakes (at least 1/2 inch of frosting per cupcake). Press a milk chocolate drop candy, point-side up on each cupcake, positioning it on the lower third of the center.

Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until fork tender, about 30 to 60 minutes depending upon the size of the potatoes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pan. Swirl the pan over medium heat until the skins are dry, about 1 minute. Halve the potatoes crosswise. Put the halves in a ricer cut-side down, and press the potato through the ricer into a bowl. The flesh should easily pass through the holes and the skins remain in the ricer. Discard the skin, and repeat with the remaining potatoes. (Alternatively, peel the cooked potatoes and put through a food mill or mash with a hand-held potato masher.) Immediately stir the butter into the warm potatoes, then add the buttermilk and combine well. Meanwhile, heat the milk in a small saucepan until steaming but not boiling. Slowly stir the milk into the potato mixture. Season with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper, to taste.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Make the shortcake: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and lemon zest. Work in the butter cubes with your fingers until the mixture is crumbly. Then, using a spoon, press the egg yolks through a mesh sieve into the flour mixture and combine with your hands. Add the cream and vanilla and mix until it forms a dough. It should be fairly wet.<br> Finish and bake the biscuits: On a lightly floured surface, flatten and shape the dough until it is about 1 1/2 inches thick. The less you work the dough, the more tender your biscuits will be. Use a knife to cut the dough into 2-inch squares. Lightly roll the scraps back into one piece and cut additional squares. To me, thicker, smaller-size cakes are moister after they bake and taste better the next day! Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the center of the oven and bake until lightly brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside to cool.<br> To serve: Split the shortcakes like a sandwich to create a top and a bottom piece. Spoon the strawberries and their juices over the bottom half of each shortcake bottom. Place a scoop of raspberry sorbet in the center of the bottom half and cover it with whipped cream and more strawberries for a little hidden surprise. Top with the other biscuit top.

Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or your hand for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth, and dough is elastic. The starter will be thick and stretchy. It will become more elastic after it has risen. Scrape the starter into a clear container with high sides, and cover with plastic wrap. Mark the height of the starter and the time on a piece of tape on the side of the container so you can see how much it rises. At this point, you have two options. If you plan on making the dough the same day, let the sponge rise at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to indent on top. This may take 6 to 8 hours. It will triple in volume, and very small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top of the surface as it reaches its peak and begins to deflate. Use it before it sinks too much. If you plan to make the dough the following day, let the sponge rise for 1 hour after mixing, then place it in the refrigerator and let it rise for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water in the dough. Let it sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature. This may take several hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56556,&quot;Cola Barbecue Ribs 1 20-ounce bottle cola 2 cups ketchup 2/3 cup apple cider vinegar 1/3 cup lightly packed dark brown sugar 1/3 cup Dijon mustard 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons sweet paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 racks baby back ribs (8 to 10 pounds total), membranes removed Vegetable oil, for the grill Instructions: Make the barbecue sauce: Bring the cola to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat.

Remove 1 cup of the barbecue sauce to a small bowl; brush over the ribs. Wrap each rack of ribs separately in foil. Put the racks, overlapping if necessary, on the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat). Cover and cook, flipping the ribs after 30 minutes, until just tender and beginning to pull away from the bones, about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove the ribs from the grill and carefully unwrap; pour any juices into the pan with the remaining barbecue sauce. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Increase the grill heat to medium high.

Score the skin of the duck breasts and season them lightly with salt and pepper. Add 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil to the skillet and put in the duck breasts, skin side down. Cook slowly, rendering the fat, until the duck skin is golden and crisp, about 5 to 6 minutes. Turn the duck breasts over and cook them in the duck fat for 2 minutes. Remove the duck breasts from the pan to a plate, cover them with foil, and let them rest for 5 minutes. After the duck has rested, return them to the skillet, skin side down, over medium heat. Spoon the duck fat over the breasts until they are just heated through. The skin should be crispy and duck meat should be pink in color. Transfer to a cutting board. In another medium skillet over medium-high heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the pancetta and cook until it begins to color, about 5 minutes. Add the shallot and garlic and cook until they are soft, about 5 minutes. Lower the heat to medium and add in the spinach and the frisee. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, then add the hazelnuts and toss the greens gently to coat them with the oil. Cook the greens until just wilted, about 2 minutes. To serve, divide the greens onto 2 plates and garnish with the chives. Slice the duck breasts and fan them over the greens. Spoon the Razz Cherry Garlic Glaze across the duck and garnish with chervil. Combine the red wine, grenadine, vinegar, and sugar in a saucepan over high heat and bring it to a boil. Peel and slice the garlic as thinly as possible. Add the garlic and razz cherries to the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Continue to cook until the sauce is reduced and syrupy, about 15 minutes.

The wall I made measured 30 by 35-inches and weighed about 50 pounds. You can use the same techniques to make a smaller version. Make a base: Place metal rulers on a parchment paper lined surface so they form an open space that measures about 30 by 35 inches. If you don&#39;t have metal rulers, you could also use modeling clay or wood rulers. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the open space to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. Dark chocolate is stronger than white chocolate so that is the reason it is used at the base. When the chocolate has set, remove the rulers and peel off the parchment paper. Repeat this process with a layer of white chocolate. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the white layer to the bittersweet layer. The white chocolate layer will be the grout between the bricks. Make the bricks: Mix red coloring to a large bowl of tempered white chocolate. Use an offset spatula to spread the red chocolate over the part of the base that will represent the brick layer. This layer should be about 1/2-inch thick. Use the back of the offset spatula to roughen the surface of the bricks to make them more realistic. Make sure you leave space for the door that will be added later. Use a straight edge as a guide as you draw your finger through the red chocolate to create the grout lines. My centerpiece had 13 rows of bricks. The bricks are about 4 inches wide by 2 inches tall with a 1/2-inch grout. Allow the chocolate to set. When the chocolate has set, use an airbrush with red and black paints to give the brick character. Make the door: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered bittersweet chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to cut the outline of the door. You should size this to fit the opening at the bricks. My door was 11 inches wide by 23 inches tall and had a curved at top. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. At this time, you can also cut the door handle and 2 hinges. My hinges were each 1-inch by 2.5 inches and my handle was 11/2-inches in diameter Use your airbrush to paint graffiti on the wall.

Drain on paper towels. While the bacon is cooking, grate the cucumber on the large holes of a box grater. Wrap the grated cucumber in cheesecloth and squeeze to remove as much liquid as possible. Combine the cream cheese and mayonnaise in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the cucumber and red onion and mix until combined, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. To assemble the sandwiches, divide the cream cheese mixture evenly between 4 slices of bread. Break the strips of bacon in half and top each sandwich with 4 halves. Sprinkle the borage petals over the top, then cover with the remaining four slices of bread and press down firmly. Cut away the crusts. Slice the sandwiches diagonally in half and then diagonally again, to make triangles.

Stir to combine and add enough olive oil until it becomes a loose paste. Add the pork and toss to completely coat. Let sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours or refrigerate overnight Romesco: This can totally be done ahead and kept in the refrigerator for any grilled meat or fish need! Preheat the grill to medium Coat a saute pan with olive oil and add the garlic and crushed red pepper. Bring the pan to a medium heat. When the garlic is very aromatic and starting to turn golden, add the tomatoes and piquillo peppers. Season with salt, to taste, and cook until the tomato is very soft and mushy, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Grill the bread on both sides until nice and toasted. When cool to the touch, cut it into cubes. In a food processor, pulse the almonds and bread cubes until they become a coarse paste. Add the cooked tomato mixture and toss in the saffron, sherry vinegar and parsley. Pulse, pulse, pulse to puree. Taste and season with salt, if needed. It should be really yummy! Add 2 tablespoons olive oil or a couple of tablespoons of water if the mixture is really thick. Before grilling, skewer the pork to make kebabs, putting about 4 to 5 pieces of meat on each skewer. Don&#39;t jam the meat super close together, it&#39;s ok if the meat is touching, but do it loosely so the heat can reach all the sides and cook evenly. Brush the grill with a wire grill brush and then rub down with an oiled towel to pick up any pieces of loosened crud. Grill the skewers on all sides so each side gets nice and brown (brown food tastes good), about 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove the kebobs from the grill to a serving platter and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve with the Romesco sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Grenache, Tempranillo, Syrah, Barbera]&quot; 56634,&quot;Fish Vera Cruz 12 tomatoes, chopped 6 jalapeno peppers, chopped 1/2 tablespoon dried oregano 1/2 tablespoon garlic salt 1/2 Spanish onion, chopped 1/2 bunch cilantro leaves, chopped Vegetable oil, for frying 4 individual fish fillets of your choice Salt and pepper Instructions: In a medium saucepan, boil the tomatoes, jalapenos, oregano, and garlic salt for about 8 minutes, or until tomatoes have cooked down to a liquid. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. *Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Return sauce to pan, add chopped onion and cilantro, and stir well. Heat through and keep warm until ready to serve. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat (you can use as little as 2 tablespoons oil to up to 1/2-inch deep). Season fish with salt and pepper and then carefully place in the pan; this may require adding the fish in 2 batches if your skillet is not large enough to hold all 4 fillets. Saute or pan-fry the fish until cooked on 1 side (fish will be opaque on that side). Carefully flip fish and continue cooking until cooked on second side and cooked through in the middle; the fish should be opaque in the middle. Cooking time will vary based on thickness of the fish fillets and the type of fish, but it should not take more than 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer fish onto a serving platter or each of 4 dinner plates and top with the sauce.

Add the garlic, tomatoes, saffron, and seasonings. Stir for about 2 minutes, then add the white wine and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until almost all the liquid has evaporated, before adding the fish stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes. At the end of 45 minutes, add the potatoes and begin to cook. While the broth is simmering, make the Peppery Croutons by brushing one side of each French bread slice with olive oil, sprinkle with cracked pepper, and toast in a 300 degree oven until crisp (about 12 minutes). After the potatoes have simmered for 10 minutes, add the lobster. Return to a boil and cook at a strong simmer for 5 minutes, before adding the fish chunks and the shrimp and cook until the fish is just cooked, but not yet flaking apart. Remove the bay leaves, taste for seasoning, and serve immediately, garnished with the Peppery Croutons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 56647,&quot;Chilean Sea Bass* 1/2 cup chopped shallots 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 cup clam juice 1 cup white wine 2 tablespoons honey 1 sheet gelatin, bloomed 4 Chilean sea bass fillets, skinned Serving suggestions: fresh vegetables and starch of choice Instructions: Saute shallots, garlic, red chili flakes, and cayenne pepper in a large dry skillet or saucepan over medium heat until fragrant.

In a large mixing bowl combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Make a well in the center and add the yolks and club soda. Using a whisk, stir from the inside working your way out, slowly incorporating the dry ingredients without forming any lumps. Peel the bananas and dip in the batter and coat well. Fry in hot oil for 4-5 minutes until batter is puffy and golden brown. Drain on paper towels when done. While bananas are cooking, prepare caramel sauce. Combine the sugar and water in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat. Cook, swirling the pot around, until the mixture is a deep caramel color and looks like syrup, about 8 minutes. Add the butter then carefully pour in the cream (it will bubble up) and continue to cook for another minute. Add a pinch of salt then cool before serving. To serve the banana split, cut the bananas lengthwise and top with a large scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Pour warm caramel sauce over the top and finish with a sprinkle of banana chips and toasted pecans. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Merlot]</p><p>&quot; 56649,&quot;Pineapple Salsa with Taro Chips 3 cups diced fresh pineapple (1/4-inch dice) 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br> 1/4 cup crumbled queso fresco<br> 3 tablespoons minced seeded jalapeno (about 1 medium jalapeno)<br> 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (about 1 lime)<br> 2 tablespoons minced garlic (about 3 garlic cloves)<br> 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger<br> 1 vine-ripe tomato, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch dice Kosher salt Nonstick baking spray, for the foil 2 medium taro roots (approximately 13 ounces each), peeled<br> Kosher salt Instructions: For the pineapple salsa: Add the pineapple, cilantro, queso fresco, jalapeno, lime juice, garlic, ginger and tomato to a large bowl and stir to combine. Add salt to taste. Let stand for at least 20 minutes to allow the flavors to combine. For the taro chips: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with foil and very lightly coat the foil with baking spray. Using a mandoline, slice the taro root into 1/8-inch-thick rounds. You want the taro to be thin but still sturdy. If you can see through the taro after you&#39;ve sliced it, it is too thin. Spread the taro chips between the baking sheets, making sure they do not overlap. Bake, rotating the baking sheets halfway, until the chips are brown in spots and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Season immediately with salt. Let cool for 10 minutes, then serve with the pineapple salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 56650,&quot;Chocolate Chip Shortbread Cookies 1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), softened to room temperature 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.

Preheat a big, deep pot over medium heat. Add oil, garlic, and crushed pepper. As you chop vegetables (peppers, onion, and celery), add them to the pot. Once vegetables are in there, increase heat a bit. Stir in olives, capers, and raisins. Salt the diced eggplant and stir into the pot. Add tomatoes, diced and crushed, to the pot and stir caponata well to combine. Cover pot and cook caponata 15 to 20 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Stir in parsley and remove pan from heat. Polenta: Bring 3 cups chicken broth to a boil. Add polenta and stir constantly until the cornmeal masses together. Stir in herbs, butter, cheese, salt, and pepper. Spread polenta out over a serving platter. Make a shallow well from the center out and fill with half of the prepared caponata. This stands as a complete dinner on its own, so rich with vitamins and fresh vegetables. Refrigerate the remaining caponata for a later use. If you prepare a salad, keep it simple. Dress mixed greens with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Caponata can also be used as a bruschetta topping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 56653,&quot;Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy with Onions &amp; Sage 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter 1 large red onion, halved and sliced 1/4 inch thick 4 large garlic cloves, peeled and halved 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour 4 cups good chicken stock, preferably homemade 2 tablespoons Cognac or brandy 10 large fresh sage leaves 2 bay leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio Instructions: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute, stirring often, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the onion becomes browned and starts to caramelize. Sprinkle on the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 1/2 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, Cognac, sage leaves, bay leaves, 2 teaspoons salt (depending on the saltiness of the chicken stock), and 1 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour and strain, pressing the solids lightly and then discarding them. Refrigerate until ready to use. After the turkey is cooked, remove it to a carving board to rest while you finish the gravy. Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat and add the wine. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring and scraping up all the bits clinging to the bottom of the pan. Slowly whisk the gravy base into the pan.

Lining it with parchment paper is helpful as well. In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of simmering water, melt the butter and bittersweet chocolate together, stirring often to avoid scorching. Set it aside off the heat. In a big bowl, whisk both sugars, the eggs and yolks. Whisk in the salt and vanilla. Add the melted butter and chocolate and whisk to just combine. Gradually stir in the flour and mix until everything is combined and smooth. Stir in the chocolate chips.

Brownies need time to set, and if you try to cut them while they are too warm, they will fall apart and ruin your day.

Stir to combine and let sit for about 15 minutes. If the water is too hot it will kill the yeast and if it is too cold the yeast will not activate. When ready the yeast will look bubbly on top and smell very yeasty. Combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil and the yeast mixture. Using a fork, gradually stir the flour into the liquids until combined. Turn the dough out onto a smooth clean work surface and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth homogeneous consistency. Lightly coat the mixing bowl with olive oil, and return the kneaded dough to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and put in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F, and preheat the grill. For the topping: Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, the smashed garlic cloves, crushed red pepper and pancetta to a large saute pan over medium heat. Cook the pancetta slowly until it gets brown and crispy. Once the garlic has become golden brown remove it and discard. Turn the heat up to high and add the mushrooms. Season with salt and saute until the mushrooms are soft and wilted, about 5 minutes. Reserve. Portion the prepared dough into golf ball-size pieces. Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like, I like irregular shapes). If not using the dough right away, wrap each piece individually in plastic and reserve until ready to use. Brush the preheated grill with oil to remove any crud. Carefully arrange each piece of dough on the grill and grill on both sides until the dough is stiff and crisp and has grill marks on both sides. That little bit of char adds a DELICIOUS flavor! Schmear each piece with stracchino, top with the pancetta/mushroom mixture, and sprinkle with Parmesan. Put the pizza in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with chives and drizzle with the aged balsamic, if desired.

Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and bake until toasted, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool, then finely grind in a food processor. (Leave the oven on.) In a large bowl, whip the butter with a mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add the sugar and cream together until thoroughly combined. Add 1 egg and the egg yolk and mix until blended, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Fold in 1/2 cup ground almonds, the flour, almond extract, vanilla extract and orange liqueur with a rubber spatula. Stir the rabbit figurine into the filling, if using. Unfold the puff pastry on a floured surface and roll out slightly. Cut 1 piece into an 11-inch circle and the other piece into a 12-inch circle. Place the 11-inch round on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon cold water. Brush the edge of the pastry with the egg wash. Spread the almond filling in an even layer in the center, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border. Gently lift the 12-inch round and place it over the filling so the edges match up. Press down on all the edges so the egg wash acts as a glue to stick the pastry together. Crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Brush with any remaining egg wash. Place the cake in the refrigerator to firm up slightly, about 15 minutes. Bake the cake until the pastry is golden brown and puffs up slightly, about 35 minutes.

Cover the bottom of a deep baking dish with a layer of Bolognese sauce. Lay out the uncooked pasta sheets over the sauce until they cover the baking dish entirely. Cover the pasta with another generous layer of Bolognese sauce. The liquid from the sauce will cook the dried pasta so be sure to add enough sauce. Drizzle the bechamel sauce and sprinkle the mozzarella on top, until both are distributed evenly. Add another layer of dried pasta, laying the sheets in the opposite direction. Repeat the process of adding sauces, mozzarella, and pasta for another 2 to 3 layers or until two-thirds of the baking dish&#39;s depth is filled. Top off the last layer of sauces and mozzarella with a generous sprinkle of the Parmigiano cheese.<br> Place the pan in oven for approximately 40 minutes and let rest for 20 minutes before serving. In a hot saucepan, melt the unsalted butter with the olive oil, and add the carrots, onion, celery, and chili pepper. Cook the ingredients over medium heat, until they are soft.

Microwave for 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted and smooth, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add about three-quarters of the sifted confectioners&#39; sugar into the marshmallow mixture and stir to combine. Once the mixture becomes too stiff to stir, grease your counter and hands with shortening (or wear greased plastic, disposable gloves) and dump the mixture onto the counter. Knead, adding the remaining quarter of confectioners&#39; sugar, a little at a time, until the fondant is very smooth, not sticky and holds its shape into a ball without relaxing. Use right away or grease it lightly with additional shortening, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and store in an airtight plastic bag or container at room temperature for up to several days.<br> Remove a 1-ounce piece of the fondant (about 2 tablespoons) and set aside. Color the larger piece of fondant brown (7 or 8 drops), rolling and kneading to evenly incorporate the color. Work in a little confectioners&#39; sugar if the moisture from the food coloring makes the fondant too soft. (Wear plastic, disposable gloves and wash your hands well between colors so as not to bleed colors.) Pinch off a very small piece of the 1-ounce chunk and color with a tiny amount of black gel, working in additional confectioners&#39; sugar if needed. Color the remaining 1-ounce piece tan (about 2 drops), working in additional confectioners&#39; sugar if needed.<br> For the monkey heads, ears and arms: Divide the brown fondant into 6 pieces. Divide each piece into a large piece (two-thirds) and a small piece (one-third). Roll the larger pieces into an oval-shaped head. Pinch a small piece off all the smaller pieces. Gather together and roll out to about 1/4-inch-thick with a greased rolling pin. Cut out 12 ears using the tip of a 1/2-inch plain pastry tip. Press a cavity in each ear using the back of a paint brush. Brush the tops of the heads with a little water and stick on the ears. Divide the remaining smaller pieces in 2 and roll into long arms.<br> Set squares of parchment on overturned bath cups. Press sets of arms together to make a \\v\\ shape. Drape sets of arms over the cups so the arms hang down. Press the heads on top of the point where the arms meet. Roll out the tan pieces of fondant to about 1/4-inch-thick using a greased rolling pin. Cut out 2 eyes from each piece with the tip of the 1/2- inch pastry tip. Cut out a nose from each with a pastry tip with a 3/4-inch-wide base. Pull the noses slightly to make oval. Brush the front of the faces with a little water. Stick the noses on and make nostrils with a wooden skewer. Use the curved base of a pastry tip to make a smiling mouth indentation. Attach the tan eyes above the nose. Roll the black fondant into tiny eyeballs and press in the eyes. Let the monkeys dry, uncovered, overnight.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 56671,&quot;Easy Pickles 1 1/4 cups apple cider vinegar 1 1/4 cups water<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns<br> 1 small bay leaf<br> 1 teaspoon red cl flakes, optional<br> 4 to 5 Kirby cucumbers, quartered into spears to fit your jars OR 3/4 of a pineapple, cut into spears to fit your jars<br> Instructions: In a nonreactive stockpot over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, peppercorns and bay leaf (and cl flakes, if using) to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves.

Dock the bottom and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the crust with parchment, fill it with pie weights or dried beans and bake it for 15 minutes. Remove the pie weights and parchment and bake the crust for 10 minutes more, or until the bottom begins to turn golden brown and is cooked through. Set aside to cool completely. For the ganache: In a heavy saucepan over low heat, combine the cream, butter and vanilla and cook, stirring, until the butter has completely melted. Increase the heat to medium high and bring the mixture to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and pour in the chopped chocolate. Leave the pan undisturbed for a few minutes to allow the chocolate to melt. Whisk until the ganache has emulsified and is shiny. For the pastry cream filling: Whisk together the milk, cream, granulated sugar, cornstarch, vanilla, salt and egg yolks in a heavy saucepan over medium heat until thickened and just starting to bubble. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in half the chocolate ganache until well combined. Place a piece of plastic wrap on the surface and let cool in the refrigerator at least 1 hour For the assembly: Pour the remaining ganache into the crust and, using the back of the spoon or an offset spatula, spread it along the bottom and up the sides until the inside of the crust is completely coated; let it set up in the refrigerator, at least 15 minutes. Once the ganache has set, spread the pastry cream filling into the crust and refrigerate while you make the whipped cream. Whip the cream in a medium bowl with an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until it begins to thicken. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and cocoa powder and continue to beat until it holds stiff peaks. Gently spoon the whipped cream on top of the pastry cream and spread it carefully and evenly until it just touches the edges of the dough. Chill the pie in the refrigerator for a few hours to set. Before serving, melt the chocolate pieces and drizzle chocolate over the pie. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, pulse together the flour, salt, sugar and butter until the mixture resembles cornmeal with some pea-size pieces of butter remaining. In a small bowl, stir together the ice water and the lemon juice. Slowly add the liquid to the flour mixture, pulsing, until the dough just comes together. Squeeze a small piece of dough between your thumb and index finger to make sure it holds its shape. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it in half. Gently turn over each piece of dough a few times so that any dry bits are incorporated. Form each piece into a loose disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 56681,&quot;Walnut Vinaigrette cup (4 ounces) walnuts, lightly toasted (see Note) 1 cup water 1/2 cup sherry vinegar 2 tablespoons minced shallots 2 teaspoons fine sea salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup olive oil 1/2 cup imported walnut oil Instructions: Place all of the ingredients, except the oils, in a blender and process on high speed.

Add the chicken tenders and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. For the corn dog batter, cut the corn away from the cob and transfer to a blender. Use the back of a knife to scrape the milk off the cob and add to the blender. Add the remaining buttermilk, the honey and 1 teaspoon salt and blend until completely smooth. With the blender off, add 1 1/4 cups of the flour, the cornmeal and baking powder. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to lightly stir the dry ingredients into the corn mixture until just combined. Blend until the mixture is mostly smooth (a few lumps is fine). Fill a large Dutch oven or pot halfway with oil and heat to 350 degrees F over medium heat. While the oil heats up, remove the chicken tenders from the buttermilk mixture onto a baking sheet lined with several layers of paper towels. Pat the chicken dry with additional paper towels. Use a pair of kitchen shears to cut off the pointed end of each skewer. Carefully insert 1 skewer about three-quarters of the way through each chicken tender. Set aside. Pour the remaining 1/2 cup flour onto a plate. Lightly season with salt. Working with one chicken tender at a time, dredge in the seasoned flour and then carefully dip into the batter (which is still in the blender), submerging completely. Tip the blender as needed to make it easier to cover the chicken with batter. Carefully place the battered chicken in the oil and fry until the chicken is cooked through and the outside is golden brown, about 5 minutes, turning occasionally. Do not fry more than 3 chicken tenders at a time or they will to stick to each other. Transfer the fried \\corn dogs\\ to a paper-towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil. Season liberally with salt. Dredge, batter and fry the remaining chicken. Allow the corn dogs to sit for at least 5 minutes before eating. Serve with hot sauce, ketchup, honey mustard or yellow mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 56684,&quot;Cyclops Shakshuka Focaccias Focaccia Dough, recipe follows Olive oil, for drizzling Sauce, recipe follows 8 medium eggs<br> Freshly ground black pepper Flake salt<br> Fresh cilantro leaves, for topping<br> Fresh parsley leaves, for topping<br> Feta, crumbled, for topping<br> 1/2 cup (106 grams) olive oil, plus more for drizzling 4 cups (570 grams) bread flour, plus more for dusting 2 teaspoons instant yeast<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups (360 grams) warm water 8 ounces raw breakfast sausage Kosher salt, to taste<br> 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 3/4 teaspoon sweet paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 large clove garlic, finely chopped<br> One 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> 4 ounces store-bought fire-roasted red pepper (1 whole pepper), finely chopped<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> Instructions: Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. To form the Focaccia Dough, press your middle three fingers in the center of each dough ball, stretching and pressing outwards until you have a 5- to 6-inch round with a flat center and 1/2 inch or so of border. The dough should be a bowl for the sauce and egg. Drizzle each with olive oil and massage the oil into the dough. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of the Sauce into the center cavity of each round (making sure to get the sausage pieces), then crack an egg in the center of each. Bake until the dough is lightly golden and the egg is just set but still a little jiggly, 12 to 14 minutes. Drizzle the focaccias with olive oil and season the eggs with a crack of black pepper and a sprinkle of flake salt. Top with cilantro, parsley and crumbled feta. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and grease each with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flour, yeast and kosher salt and whisk to combine. Add the water and remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil and mix with the dough hook until a dough forms, scraping down the sides as needed. Knead on medium speed for 12 to 15 minutes. Lightly flour a work surface. Scrape the dough out onto the floured surface and form into 8 equal-sized balls. Place 4 dough balls onto each prepared baking sheet and then drizzle oil onto each dough ball. Cover each with a towel and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add the breakfast sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Season with the kosher salt, red pepper flakes, paprika, cumin, coriander, black pepper and cinnamon. Cook until the meat is browned and the spices are toasted, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Add the tomato sauce and peppers and stir to combine. Add the honey and stir to thoroughly incorporate. Cook the sauce, uncovered, for 5 to 8 minutes until thickened. Season to taste.

Add 1 tablespoon of the butter and melt. While the butter is melting, break the eggs into a large bowl. Add the melted butter and whisk well. Season with salt and pepper. Return the pan to medium-low heat. Add the olive oil and the remaining butter and heat. Add the egg mixture and grasp the pan by its handle (using a potholder if necessary to protect your hand). Start shaking the pan forward and back while stirring the eggs slowly with the back of a fork, gently lifting a moving the cooked egg so that the liquid egg slips beneath it. After about 30 seconds, the egg will have formed a uniformly cooked but still fairly moist \\pancake\\ shape. At this time, add any filling of your choice, the tomato and goat cheese, or leave the omelet unfilled in the classic French style. To fold the omelet, immediately tilt the pan to about a 45-degree angle by raising the handle, so that the cooked eggs nearest the handle begin to fall and fold over; you may use the fork or spatula to help this happen. Hold the far edge of the pan over a heated serving plate and continue tipping the handle up, so that the omelet folds over on itself and rolls out of the pan onto the plate. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 56707,&quot;Perfect Roast Turkey 1 (12 pound) fresh turkey Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 large bunch fresh thyme 1 lemon, halved 3 Spanish onions 1 head garlic, halved crosswise 4 tablespoons melted butter 1/4 to 1/2 cup good olive oil 8 carrots, peeled and cut in 2-inch chunks 10 red new potatoes, quartered 3 heads fennel, fronds removed, and cut in wedges through the core Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Grease a 13-by-9-by-2-inch baking pan with butter. Using a double boiler over medium heat, cook the rice in the milk uncovered for 25 minutes, and then covered for another 25 minutes, until the rice is thoroughly cooked. If the rice is still a little too firm, let sit on the burner over low heat for another 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature. While the rice is cooking, make your egg mixture by combining the egg yolks, vanilla and salt in a bowl. In another bowl, combine the sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add the egg yolk mixture, dry ingredient mixture, 3 tablespoons butter and the heavy cream to the cooled rice, mixing between each addition. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan. Add the raisins, if using. Set the entire pan in a water bath and bake for 1 hour. If you use raisins, halfway through the baking you have to stir the bottom by sliding a knife along the sides (this is so the raisins will not gather at the bottom) without disturbing the custard. Bake until the rice pudding is no longer liquid. It will have solidified and a slight caramel colored crust will have formed on top. Cool and refrigerate until serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56710,&quot;Hidden Valleyandreg; Perfect Spinach Artichoke Dip 1 16-ounce bag frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry 2 15-ounce cans quartered artichoke hearts, rinsed well and drained 1 envelope Hidden Valley?

Sprinkle with additional crumbled bacon, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56714,&quot;Rainbow Brioche 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (about half of one 1/4-ounce packet) 2 tablespoons sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 cup whole milk 4 large eggs 1 1/4 sticks (10 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed and at room temperature, plus more for the plastic wrap and brushing the bread Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple gel food coloring Instructions: Place the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix on low speed to combine. Add the milk and 3 of the eggs and mix on low speed until well combined. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough starts to pull away from the side of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium and start adding the butter, a little at a time and waiting until it is completely incorporated to add more, about 5 minutes. Increase the mixer to medium-high and continue to mix until the dough is glossy and slightly tacky but not sticky, about 7 minutes. Divide the dough into 6 equal-size pieces. Add a few drops of red food coloring to one piece of dough and knead until vibrant and no streaks remain; set aside. Repeat with the remaining 5 pieces of dough, tinting each with one of the remaining colors (orange , yellow, green, blue or purple). Place each tinted piece of dough in a separate small bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. To assemble, individually roll out the 6 pieces of chilled dough on a sheet of parchment paper into six 9-by-5-inch rectangles. Stack the pieces on top of each other in the color of the rainbow, so red on the bottom, then orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Roll out the stack of dough again to a 12-by-8-inch rectangle; this will ensure that all the layers stick and bake together. With the red layer on the bottom, and starting from a shorter end, start rolling the dough into a tight spiral, like a jelly roll cake. Generously butter one 9-by-5-inch nonstick loaf pan and place the rolled dough inside, seam-side down. Generously butter a piece of plastic wrap large enough to cover the pan and place it butter-side down loosely over the pan. Let the dough rise until it comes to 1/2 inch above the rim of the pans, 2 to 3 hours. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Beat the remaining 1 egg with 1 tablespoon water. Remove the plastic wrap and brush the top of the loaf with the egg wash. Bake until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the middle reaches 190 degrees F, about 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes, then run a knife around the sides of the loaf to loosen and turn the loaf out of the pan. Let cool completely top-side up on the rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 56715,&quot;Lemon-Pistachio Macaroons 1/3 cup shelled unsalted pistachios 3 large egg whites 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest 3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 14-ounce package sweetened shredded coconut (about 3 packed cups) Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Pulse the pistachios in a food processor until finely ground but not powdery. Whisk the egg whites with the sugar, lemon zest, vanilla and salt in a large bowl until frothy. Stir in the ground pistachios, then stir in the coconut until completely combined. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the coconut mixture onto the prepared pans. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the macaroons are golden, 25 to 30 minutes.

Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 56727,&quot;Parmesan-Garlic Chicken Wings 2 lemons, plus wedges for serving 1 head garlic, cloves smashed and peeled 1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for the grill 1/2 cup packed fresh basil, plus 2 large sprigs 5 large sprigs oregano, halved 8 to 10 sprigs thyme, halved Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 5 pounds chicken wings 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese Instructions: Grate the zest of 1 lemon and set aside; juice both lemons. Combine the garlic and olive oil in a large microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the garlic starts sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes; let cool. Add the lemon juice, herb sprigs, 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and the chicken wings. Using your hands, rub the wings with the oil mixture; firmly press the wings down, making sure they are covered with some of the herbs and garlic. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, stirring once or twice. Meanwhile, pulse the butter, basil leaves, lemon zest and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a mini food processor until combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat a grill to medium high and prepare for indirect grilling: On a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side; on a gas grill, turn off half the burners. Remove the basil butter from the refrigerator. Remove the wings from the marinade. Brush the grill grates with olive oil and place the wings on the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat). Cover the grill and cook, turning the wings once, until almost completely cooked through and the skin is beginning to crisp, about 30 minutes. Move to direct heat and grill, turning often, until the skin is crisp and lightly charred, 10 to 15 more minutes. Transfer the wings to a large bowl. Add the basil butter and toss to coat. Add the parmesan and season with salt and pepper; toss again. Serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 56728,&quot;Cucumber Salad 3 medium cucumbers (about 2 1/4 pounds), peeled, halved lengthwise, and thinly sliced 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sour cream 3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon white distilled vinegar Pinch of cayenne pepper Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large bowl, mix the cucumbers and salt and set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. In a colander in the sink, drain and rinse the cucumbers thoroughly under cold running water. Set aside to drain for 10 minutes. Press down on the cucumbers to extract as much liquid as possible. Transfer the cucumbers to a large bowl and mix with the sour cream, dill, vinegar, cayenne, and season with pepper to taste. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56729,&quot;Sauteed Collard Greens with Garlic, Peppers and Onions 1 bunch collard greens 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 medium onion, sliced 1/2 red or green bell pepper, sliced 1 teaspoon minced garlic Salt and pepper Instructions: Remove and discard all but 1 inch of the collard stems. Cut the remaining stems out of the leaves, separating the leaves and stems. Cut the leaves into 2-inch squares. Slice the stems into thin slices. Wash the leaves in a big basin of water. Leave the water in the basin or sink and use a strainer to dip the leaves out of the water. Don&#39;t wash the leaves inside a colander or pour the water off the container with the leaves inside; this would allow any sand to stay with the greens. Wash the stems separately in the same basin of water, using the same method as the leaves. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt. Have a colander ready in the sink to drain the greens and a bowl of water with ice cubes in it to chill the greens. Cook the stems for 1 minute. Add the leaves, and once they turn bright green, fish out a small leaf to taste it. The greens are done when they taste tender. You can&#39;t really tell whether the greens are done without tasting them. Pour the cooked greens into the colander to drain. Once the hot water has drained off, carefully put the hot greens into the ice water. Once the greens feel cool to the touch, drain them in a colander again. Drain for about 10 to 15 minutes so that they are quite dry. (At this point, the greens may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.) Put the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute the onions gently in the oil. Raise the heat and add the peppers, and then the garlic. Add the blanched greens and saute until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 56730,&quot;Roasted Vegetable Frittata 6 eggs 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 cup store-bought roasted vegetables or Anne Burrell&#39;s Roasted Veggie Ratatouille, recipe follows 1 eggplant, cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices 1 large zucchini, cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices 1 summer squash, cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices 3 beefsteak tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch slices Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1 large red onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons chopped fresh marjoram leaves 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves Instructions: In a medium bowl, beat the eggs, salt and pepper until combined. Preheat the oven to the broiler setting.<br> Add the olive oil to an 8-inch cast-iron skillet and place over medium heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the eggs and vegetables. Let them cook, undisturbed, until the edges are set, about 2 minutes. Slip an offset spatula (a butter knife will work, too) under the sides and tilt the pan, to help the uncooked egg slide underneath. Repeat this all around the edge of the pan, until the top is wet but no longer runny.<br> Place the skillet under the broiler, and cook until the top is golden and bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes, keeping a close eye so it doesn&#39;t burn. Remove the pan from the oven. Cut into 6 wedges, and serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the eggplant, zucchini, squash, and tomatoes in 1 layer on a baking sheet or baking sheets, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt. Roast until the vegetables are soft and pliable, about 20 to 30 minutes, turning them halfway through the cooking. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. When cool enough to handle transfer them to a cutting board and cut them into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and coat the bottom with olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the onion, crushed red pepper and season with salt, to taste. Saute until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the peppers and season again with salt, if needed. Cook until the peppers are soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add the roasted vegetables to the pan along with the vinegar, marjoram, and thyme. Toss well to coat and add 2 to 3 more tablespoons olive oil, if needed. Taste to check the seasoning and transfer to a serving platter or bowl. Voila! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 56731,&quot;Green Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette 2/3 cup cranberries, thawed if frozen 2 tablespoons honey, plus more as needed 1/2 cup walnuts 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 head butter lettuce, large leaves torn 1 bunch watercress, trimmed and torn 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh tarragon Instructions: Put the cranberries in a small saucepan; add the honey and 1/3 cup water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries pop and the liquid thickens, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Toast the walnuts in a small dry skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool slightly, then roughly chop. Stir the olive oil and vinegar into the cooled cranberries. (Add more honey, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the vinaigrette is too tart.) Season with salt and pepper. Toss the lettuce and watercress in a serving bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spoon the vinaigrette over the lettuce and top with the walnuts and herbs. Toss before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56732,&quot;Grilled Onions 3 whole onions (large) Instructions: Preheat grill to high.

Line three 9-inch round cake pans with parchment circles and spray lightly with cooking spray. Combine the butter, oil and 2 cups sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl between each egg. Beat in 1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste until incorporated. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Add a third of the dry ingredients to the mixer and beat on low speed. Add half of the buttermilk and beat until just incorporated. Alternate dry and wet ingredients, ending with the dry and scraping down the bowl as needed until the batter is smooth. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cake pans and bake until the cakes are lightly golden and the centers spring back to the touch, about 30 minutes. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, to make the cake syrup, combine the remaining 1 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste with 1 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. For the vanilla Swiss buttercream: Bring a medium saucepan filled with 2 inches of water to a simmer. Whisk together the egg whites and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and set the bowl over the simmering pot. Continue whisking until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture feels hot to the touch, 1 to 2 minutes. Wipe the condensation from the bottom of the bowl and attach it to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat the egg white mixture on medium-high speed until the whites are glossy and the underside of the bowl is no longer warm, about 5 minutes. With the mixer running, begin adding a few chunks of butter at a time. Continue to add all the butter in this way until the buttercream is smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla bean paste and salt. For the assembly: Trim the tops of the cakes, if necessary. Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of each layer of cake with the cake syrup, allowing it to soak in slightly. Add about 1 1/2 cups of buttercream to the top of the first cake and smooth it into an even layer with an offset spatula. Place the second cake on top of the first and add another layer of buttercream. Place the last cake on top and frost just the top with the remaining buttercream. Arrange some of the blackberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries decoratively around the top edge of the cake. Serve with the remaining berries on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56735,&quot;Maple-Glazed Roast with Winter Vegetables 1 stick unsalted vegan butter, melted 3/4 cup Dijon mustard 1/2 cup pure maple syrup 2 tablespoons vegan Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon garlic powder Sea salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 1 1-pound plant-based roast<br> 1/2 pound assorted winter vegetables, such as acorn squash (cut into wedges) and mushroom caps Vegetable oil, for drizzling 2 cloves garlic, minced Sea salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Make the glaze: Whisk the melted butter, mustard, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder in a bowl; season liberally with salt and pepper.

Dip a piece or 2 of the stuffed brioche in the custard mixture and allow to soak for 30 seconds on each side. Add 1 tablespoon of butter to the griddle per brioche slice. When melted, gently transfer the soaked slices from the custard to the griddle. Cook until the bread is golden, the custard is cooked and the filling is warm, about 2 minutes each side. Soak and cook the remaining stuffed slices, adding the remaining butter to the griddle. Serve with powdered sugar and maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</li></ul><p>&quot; 56750,&quot;Chipotle Dark Chocolate Cupcakes 1 cup gluten-free flour mix 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum 1 1/4 cups soy milk 1/2 cup canola oil 1/4 cup espresso 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon vinegar 1 chipotle dark chocolate bar, cut into 12 large chunks 8 cups powdered sugar 1 cup cocoa powder 8 ounces vegan butter spread, such as Earth Balance 3/4 cup soy milk 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br> Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Prepare three 8-inch cake pans with baking spray and parchment liners. Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream together the granulated sugar, light brown sugar and butter on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Slowly add the eggs, one at a time, mixing each fully before adding the next. With the mixer on low, slowly trickle the oil into the mixture. Once added, increase the speed to medium-high and continue to mix until the mixture thickens and begins to look like mayonnaise. Using a silicone spatula, scrape down your bowl, making sure to get anything at the bottom of the bowl that has not been mixed well. In a small bowl, combine the buttermilk and vanilla extract. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Add a third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat on medium high speed for 90 seconds. Bring the speed down to low and, alternately, add the buttermilk mixture and remaining flour mixture in 4 stages, beginning with the buttermilk mixture and ending with the flour mixture. Fold in the mashed bananas. Mix only enough to incorporate the ingredients after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared pans, filling two-thirds full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. The top of the cake should spring back slightly after a gentle tap with your finger. Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before removing from the pans. Allow the cakes to cool completely before frosting. For the salted caramel Swiss meringue buttercream: Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the egg whites and confectioners&#39; sugar on medium-high until the mixture thickens to fluffy white, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce speed to medium and gradually add the softened butter. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue mixing for 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the speed and add the prepared caramel sauce, vanilla and salt. Mix until combined. To assemble the cake: Frost the top of 1 cake round with some salted caramel Swiss meringue buttercream. Drizzle with some prepared caramel sauce and sprinkle with some pecans. Add a second round and repeat with the buttercream, caramel sauce and pecans. Top with the remaining cake round and frost the entire cake with the buttercream.<br> Combine the sugar, corn syrup and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan, making sure the sugar is completely wet, but being careful not to let the sugar water coat the sides of the pan. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook for about 4 minutes. The cooking process is done when the sugar has reached a nice amber color. Do not stir during the cooking process. Quickly remove the sugar from the heat and add the heavy cream. The mixture will bubble. Stir to combine. Whisk in the butter, sea salt and lemon juice. Allow to cool completely before use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56752,&quot;Ricotta, Arugula and Grape Pizza with Pine Nuts and Lemon Oil One .25-ounce package active dry yeast 2 teaspoons sugar<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring the work surface<br> 1 cup whole-wheat flour<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for coating the bowl<br> 1/2 cup ricotta cheese 3 ounces baby arugula<br> 1/2 cup red grapes, sliced in half<br> 2 tablespoons pine nuts<br> Lemon oil, for drizzling Instructions: For the dough: In a small bowl, combine the yeast with the sugar and 3/4 cup warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes until it begins to foam. In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour and salt and make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Using a fork, incorporate the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients until a dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, continue to work and then knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly coat a clean bowl with additional olive oil and add the dough, turning once to coat the dough in the oil. Cover and set in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Punch down the dough and divide it into 2 pieces, using 1 piece for the pizza. Wrap the remaining dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze for another pizza. For the pizza: Stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle or oval that will fit on the grill pan. Add the dough to the hot grill pan and cook until stiff and bubbles start to form, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until grill marks form and the crust is completely cooked through, 1 to 2 more minutes. Transfer the crust to a baking sheet and spread with the ricotta. Bake until the ricotta warms through and melts slightly, about 6 minutes. Top the warm pizza with the arugula, grapes and pine nuts.

To make the potatoes: In a medium saucepan combine the vermouth, water, parsley, tarragon, lemon zest, and salt. Set aside. Cut the potatoes in half horizontally. Slice a small portion off of the rounded ends-- so the potatoes stand up without rolling around -- and discard. Add the halved potatoes to the saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until just fork tender, about 8 minutes. Set the potatoes aside to cool in the liquid for 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes, reserving 2 teaspoons of the cooking liquid. Discard the herbs and lemon zest. With a small spoon or melon baller, scoop out a little of each potato, to make a little \\bowl\\ for the cheese. Toss the potatoes with the oil in a small bowl, and stand them up on a baking sheet. Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: In a medium bowl, cream the cheese with the creme fraiche and the 2 teaspoons of reserved cooking liquid. Fold in the minced parsley, tarragon, chives, and chervil. Season with pepper, to taste. Remove the potatoes from the oven and let cool slightly. While the potatoes are still warm, spoon a dollop of the cheese mixture into each potato. Set the potatoes on a platter and top off with the chive segments to garnish.

Heat the oven to 225 degrees F. Grease and dust a cookie sheet with flour. Place a plain nozzle in a piping bag. Make the meringues by whisking in a large bowl the whites of eggs until very stiff. Beat in the salt and water, and gradually start beating in the sugar little by little (if this is done too quickly the whites will lose their bulk and turn almost liquid). Fold in the last tablespoon of sugar. The mixture should now have a good gloss and be very \\peaky. Now place the glistening white meringue mixture into the forcing bag and pipe it into two 9-inch circles (being the same diameter as the cake) on the cookie sheet and dust with the chocolate powder. The remaining mixture can then be piped into small animal shapes as decoration. Place the meringue mixture immediately into the preheated oven (225 degrees F.) on the middle shelf and bake for 2 1/2 hours. When ready the discs and animals should lift easily from the baking sheet and have a hollow sound when gently tapped, these can be cooled on a wire rack until required. They can also be stored in an airtight tin for several days, should you want to prepare this dessert ahead of time. Cream Filling: Whip the cream until stiff and divide the cream into 2 bowls. The almonds can be placed on a cookie sheet and broiled until golden brown and cooled. The sponge cake can now be split in 2 and the base lightly soaked with rum. Assembly: Place the base of the cake on a plate. Spread a little chestnut puree over this and then a good wallop of fresh cream from one bowl. Pop the second layer of sponge cake on top and sprinkle with rum. To the cream in the first bowl, add more of the chestnut puree and beat in very thoroughly. Blend together with rum. Scoop this on top of the cake. Take one layer of the baked cooled meringue and place this on top. From the second bowl, take the puree, whipped cream and spread a thick layer of this gently on top of the meringue disc. Lower the second round of meringue on top. To the remainder of cream, add the last of the chestnut puree and spread this over the sides of the vacherin and a thin layer over the top, using a palette knife. Gently press the flaked almonds over the sides. Decorate the top with meringue animals and dust with the chocolate powder. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56804,&quot;Chicken and Broccoli Stir-Fry 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2 breasts), sliced against the grain 2 cloves garlic, minced 1-inch piece peeled fresh ginger, minced 1 tablespoon soy sauce 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon, plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon dry sherry 1 tablespoon dark sesame oil About 1/3 cup chicken broth or water 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 5 cups broccoli, trimmed sliced stalks (about 1/4-inch thick) and medium florets (keep the 2 cuts separate) Instructions: Toss the chicken with about half the garlic and ginger, the soy sauce, sugar, 1 teaspoon of the cornstarch, 1 teaspoon of the salt, the sherry, and the sesame oil in a bowl. Marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes. Mix the remaining cornstarch with the 1/3 cup broth or water. Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and heat. Add the broccoli stems, and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the florets and the remaining garlic, ginger, 2 tablespoons of water, and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper, to taste. Stir-fry until the broccoli is bright green but still crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Get the skillet good and hot again, and then heat 2 more tablespoons oil. Add the chicken and stir-fry until the chicken loses its raw color and gets a little brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Return the broccoli to the pan and toss to heat through. Stir in the reserved cornstarch mixture and bring to a boil to thicken. Add more water if need to thin the sauce, if necessary. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if you like. Mound the stir-fry on a serving platter or divide among 4 plates; serve with rice.

Prepare three 10-inch cake pans by spraying them with cooking spray, then place a parchment paper circle in each cake pan, then spray again (this will make sure the cake layers don\\u2019t stick). Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, sift the flour and baking powder together; this will make sure everything gets distributed nice and evenly in the batter. Set aside.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the sugar, butter and salt on medium-high speed until it\\u2019s nice and fluffy and light in color, 8 to 10 minutes, stopping a few times to scrape down the bowl and paddle with a rubber spatula. Reduce the speed to low and add the eggs one at a time, beating until completely combined and scraping down the sides of the bowl between additions. Increase the speed to medium-high for about 30 seconds once all the eggs are incorporated. Scrape down the bowl. Add the vanilla to the milk. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Alternating between the flour mixture and milk while the mixer is running, add half of the flour to the bowl and mix until combined, scrape the bowl, then add half the milk, scrape the bowl, then the remaining flour, scrape the bowl, then add the remaining milk. Scrape down the bowl. Scrape the batter off the spatula\\u2014don\\u2019t bang the spatula on the side of the bowl, as that will knock the air out of the batter! Gently fold in the sprinkles by hand with the spatula.<br> Gently spoon the batter evenly into your prepared pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake until a toothpick inserted in each cake comes out with no crumbs sticking to it, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes in the pans. Remove the cakes from the pans and cool completely on the rack, about 1 hour.<br> For the American buttercream: On medium speed, beat the butter, vanilla and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk until combined. Stop the mixer and add the confectioners\\u2019 sugar 2 cups at a time, beating on low speed to combine. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl between each addition. Beat in the milk in 2 additions on low speed, then increase the speed to medium-high and whip until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add more milk a tablespoon at a time if the frosting seems too thick.<br> To assemble the cake: Level the tops of the cake layers with a serrated knife or cake leveler. Adhere one of the cake layers to a cardboard cake round or cake plate with a dab of frosting to hold it in place. Frost the top of the layer with about 1 cup of the buttercream. Stack the second layer on top and repeat. Add the third layer and frost the top and sides with a thin coat of the buttercream (this is a crumb coat). Refrigerate until the frosting is firm, 20 to 30 minutes.<br> Frost the top and sides of the cake with a thicker layer of buttercream and refrigerate again until very firm, about 1 hour.<br> For the decorations: Lightly dust a work surface with cornstarch and roll out the blue fondant to a large circle about 22 inches in diameter and about 1/8-inch thick. Drape the rolled fondant over the top of the cake. Working from the top down the sides, lightly press and smooth the fondant over the cake with either a fondant smoother or your hands. Pop any air bubbles with a cake tester or toothpick and continue to smooth. Trim the excess fondant from the bottom of the cake with a pizza cutter. Set aside.<br> Make waves from the green fondant by rolling some of the fondant into about a 4-inch-long tapered rope and curling in the tapered end to the base, making a spiral. Lightly flatten and trim the bottom of the wave to make a clean edge. Continue making more waves. Adhere the waves by dabbing a drop of water onto the backside of each and lightly pressing them around the base of the cake.<br> Make clouds from the white fondant by making a small 1-inch ball of the fondant, press 1 gumball into the center and 2 to 3 more gumball around to make a cloud shape. Roll out another piece of the white fondant ?-inch thick and cover the gumballs, lightly pressing around, trim any excess from the bottom (save the trimmings for the octopus tentacles) and tuck the edges under to make a cloud shape. Continue making more clouds. Adhere the clouds around the sides of the cake, above the waves, with a dab of water.<br> Make octopus tentacles by taking a piece of the red fondant and rolling it into a hot dog shape. Take a small piece of the pink fondant and roll it into a thin rope the same length as the red fondant and lightly flatten it with the heel of your palm. Press the pink fondant onto the red fondant, then roll it into a tapered rope about 10 inches long so it has a pink stripe on it. Continue making more tentacles. To make the suction cups for the tentacles, take little pieces of the white fondant and roll them in balls about the size of peas or small blueberries and make a little dimple in the center with the end of a ball tool. Adhere the balls along the pink stripe on each tentacle with little dabs of water. Attach the tentacles to the cake with dabs of water, or make it look like they are coming out of the top of the cake by using skewers.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56806,&quot;Creamy Leek and Corn Orzo Kosher salt 1 cup orzo 4 tablespoons finely sliced washed leek (white and light green part only) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 ears corn, top half of kernels cut from cobs and cobs scraped for milk 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: Bring a medium pot of boiling water to a boil over medium heat.

Slowly add 1 1/2 cups room temperature water, whisking continuously, until a smooth yet loose mixture forms. Try to break up any little lumps and be sure to mix in any flour on the sides of the bowl. Let sit for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the soy sauce, sugar and 1 tablespoon water in a small saucepan over low heat, whisking occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in the sesame oil. Set aside. For the beef filling: Add the beef, cornstarch, scallion, soy sauce, sesame oil, baking soda, sugar, white pepper and 2 tablespoons cold water to a food processor. Process on low, stopping to scrape down the sides from time to time, until the mixture is pale pink with a gummy texture, about 2 minutes. Generously oil your hands and scoop out a heaping teaspoon of the beef mixture. Flatten in your palms to form a 3-inch piece of beef filling. Lay on a greased plate. Repeat to make 10 pieces. Set a steamer rack in a large wok or wide pot and fill with water up to the rack, about 2 inches. Bring to a full boil over high heat with the lid on. Generously grease two 8-inch nonstick round metal cake pans with vegetable oil, about 2 teaspoons. Set one aside. Give the batter a nice whisk to make sure it is fully combined. You will have to do this each time before making a batch. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the prepared cake pan. It will not fully coat the bottom of the pan. Adjust the heat under the wok to medium high, carefully remove the lid and place the pan on the rack. Cover and let steam for 15 seconds. Remove the lid again and move the pan around to try to coat the bottom as much as possible; the batter should be slightly set but still loose enough to flow. Cover again and let steam for another 15 seconds. Remove the lid, lay 2 pieces of the beef filling directly in the center, creating a line down the middle. Let steam for another 90 seconds. Remove the lid and, using oven mitts, remove the pan to a trivet. Let sit for 30 seconds. Using a silicone or plastic bench scraper or spatula, cut the rice noodle in half, creating 2 semicircles with a piece of beef filling on each side. Focusing on one rice noodle semicircle at a time, gently fold over one of the sides to cover the beef completely. Fold the remaining side directly on top, tucking the flap under the roll to hide the seam. Repeat with the remaining semicircle. Carefully transfer to a dinner plate. Repeat with the reserved prepared cake pan Continue with the remaining batter and beef filling, whisking the batter each time and using a clean paper towel to wipe down the pans before greasing them with vegetable oil. Otherwise, any residual batter could cause a rip. Drizzle half of the sweet soy mixture all over the rolls and serve the rest on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56823,&quot;Pan-Fried Salmon with Green Goddess Tzatziki 1 cup plain 2-percent fat Greek yogurt 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus extra for seasoning 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra for seasoning 1/2 an English hothouse cucumber, seeded (1 pound) Four 7-ounce salmon fillets, each about 1-inch thick, skinned 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: For the tzatziki: Combine the yogurt, mayonnaise, basil, chives, tarragon, vinegar, salt and pepper in a food processor.

Line two baking sheets with parchment. Generously sprinkle flour on a work surface. Roll the pizza dough out into a 12-inch square, using more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Cut the dough into quarters, then cut each quarter into 4 strips. Carefully tie each strip into a knot and arrange on the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Wrap loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until slightly puffed, about 30 minutes. Bake the knots until golden brown on the bottom and lightly golden on the top, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheets as needed. Meanwhile, put the butter, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter is melted and beginning to bubble, cook the garlic, swirling the pan, until it is soft and fragrant but not brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley. Brush the garlic butter on the warm knots and sprinkle each with Parmesan. Eat warm or at room temperature. Garlic knots can be baked, cooled and frozen for up to 1 month. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small pot. Add the bulgur and quinoa and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer the grains to a fine-mesh strainer and hold under cold running water to stop the cooking. Let the grains drain in the strainer for 15 minutes, then spread them out on a thick layer of paper towels to absorb any extra moisture. Meanwhile, coarsely grind the flaxseeds in a spice grinder, just to break them open. Stir together the warm water, agave and yeast in a measuring cup or small bowl. Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Whisk the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl; add the foamy yeast mixture and olive oil and mix together with a stiff rubber spatula. When the dough starts to come together, mix in the cooked grains, ground flaxseeds and sunflower seeds; form the dough into a uniform ball in the center of the bowl. Be sure to scrape and use any dough stuck to the sides. The dough will be very sticky at this stage. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours. Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour. Sprinkle a generous amount of flour on a clean, dry work surface. Scrape the dough onto the floured surface and knead for a couple of minutes, working in just enough flour to make the dough less sticky but still moist to the touch. Flour your hands periodically to prevent sticking. Form the dough into one single ball or divide it into smaller balls. Place the dough ball(s) on the prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let the dough rest for 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes, the dough can be shaped and cooked as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 56826,&quot;Seared Jumbo scallops with Uni Sauce, Yukon Potatoes, Onion Jam and Parsley Oil 4 ounces fresh Uni 1/2 pound butter, softened 1 tablespoon Tamari 1 teaspoon Sansho powder 2 cups clam broth 1/2 cup white wine 2 egg yolks 1 teaspoon freshly chopped tarragon leaves 1 teaspoon tarragon vinegar 2 bunches fresh parsley 1 cup olive oil 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 Jumbo scallops Peanut oil, for frying 4 tablespoons Onion Jam, recipe follows 4 teaspoons freshly chopped parsley leaves 4 teaspoons freshly chopped chives 4 teaspoon truffle oil Micro watercress, for garnish Sliced nori, for garnish 1 1/2 pounds yellow onions, sliced 2 tablespoons butter 1 1/8 cups red wine vinegar 1/8 cup balsamic vinegar 1/2 cup sugar Salt Instructions: For Uni sauce: In a blender, puree 4 ounces fresh Uni.

The compound butter will keep, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week and in the freezer for up to 1 month. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 420 degrees F. For the smashed potatoes: Combine the olive oil and grated garlic in a small bowl and set aside. Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water by 1 to 2 inches. Season the water generously with salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and cook the potatoes at a low boil until fork tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and transfer a rimmed baking sheet. Using the bottom of a cup, gently smash the potatoes into patties. Drizzle with the garlic oil and bake until the skin is crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. When the potatoes are done, remove them from the oven and keep warm. For the steak: Meanwhile, line a sheet pan with a rack and set aside. Season the steaks liberally with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil on both sides. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the steaks and cook, undisturbed, for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Flip the steaks and add the garlic, thyme, rosemary and butter. Using a sauce spoon, baste the steaks with the melted butter and aromatics and cook 1 1/2 to 2 minutes more. Transfer the steaks and aromatics to the prepared sheet pan and cook in the oven until the internal temperature registers 140 degrees F, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer them to a cutting board and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes. Remove the bone from each steak and slice the meat against the grain. Season to taste with salt. Slice six 1/2-inch coins of compound butter. Plate the steak, top with the compound butter and serve with the smashed potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 56830,&quot;Beef Ribs with Orange BBQ Sauce 3 racks center-cut beef ribs (8 or 9 pounds total) 1 sweet onion, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch rings 6 fresh thyme sprigs 2 teaspoons fennel seeds 1/4 cup kosher salt 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 1/4 cup cracked mustard seed 1/2 cup paprika 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper 1/4 cup granulated garlic Orange BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 1 cup ketchup 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup molasses 1 cup orange juice 1 tablespoon onion powder 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 teaspoon honey 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons orange marmalade 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes Instructions: Begin by toasting the fennel seeds in a dry pan over medium-high heat. Toast for 4 or 5 minutes, until they become fragrant; toss occasionally as they toast so they don&#39;t burn. Transfer to a spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. Rinse the ribs in cool water and pat dry with paper towels. Unless your butcher has already done so, remove the membrane from the back and trim off any excess fat. Combine the dry rub ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Coat both sides of the meat with a heavy layer of the dry rub. Refrigerate overnight, uncovered.<br> Heat half the grill to medium to create indirect heat.<br> Set out a few large sheets of foil (one for each slab). Divide the sliced onion and thyme between the sheets and spread them out evenly. Place 1 rack on each sheet, meat side down, and fold the foil over to form a sealed pouch around each rack. Place each pouch on a roasting tray (to keep foil from getting pierced and letting steam out) and grill it over indirect heat for 2 hours.<br> Open the foil and peel it back so the ribs are exposed. Carefully turn the meat over so the meat side is on top, then cook for 1 1/2 hours with the foil open. When done, the ribs will be tender and the meat will have shrunk back from the bones.<br> For the last 10 minutes, remove the ribs from the foil and place them directly on the hot side of the grill. Brush with the Orange BBQ Sauce and allow the heat to caramelize the sauce and crisp the exterior, then flip the ribs and brush the other side for the final 5 minutes. Serve with additional sauce. Whisk together all the ingredients in a medium saucepan and simmer over medium-low heat for 25 to 30 minutes, until it reaches a ketchup-like consistency.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 56831,&quot;Homemade Breakfast Sandwiches with Homemade Maple Sausage, Egg and Cheese 4 Portuguese or kaiser rolls, sliced in half 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus 1 tablespoon not melted 1 tablespoon olive oil Homemade Maple Sausage, formed into 4 (4-ounce) patties, recipe follows 4 large eggs Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 4 slices American cheese Hot sauce, optional, for serving Ketchup, optional, for serving 1 pound ground pork 2 tablespoons maple syrup 2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon granulated onion 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the inside of each roll with the melted butter and toast in the oven until slightly crispy and golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside until you are ready to build your sandwich. Heat the olive oil in a cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Brown the sausage patties for 3 to 4 minutes per side. Once they are browned and cooked through, remove the patties to a paper towel-lined plate. In the sausage drippings, add the remaining tablespoon of butter and crack 4 eggs into the skillet. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper and cook them to your desired doneness. For this I prefer a fried egg, cooking 2 minutes per side, but you can do whatever you like best. Once the egg is cooked to your liking, top each egg with a slice of American cheese. Place a lid over the skillet to melt the cheese. To assemble a sandwich, place a sausage patty on the bottom half of the toasted roll and top with the egg and cheese. Have it plain or dressed with the condiments you prefer. I like to eat mine with ketchup and a little hot sauce! In a large bowl mix the pork, maple syrup, sage, salt, fennel seeds, garlic, onion and red pepper. Cook the sausage however you like - make patties and sear or crumble and cook in a skillet like hash. Cook&#39;s Notes: You can use all different types of meats and spices to make the sausage your own! Make sure you form the sausage patties in the same size and shape of the bread you are using, that way every bite you take of the sandwich has every component it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 56832,&quot;Moroccan Carrot Salad with Parsley and Roasted Lemon 1 large lemon, washed, sliced into thin rounds, and then quartered 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for lemons 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 2 pinches cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon orange zest, plus 1/4 cup orange juice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 medium carrots, peeled and grated (about 4 cups) 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts Instructions: Place the lemon pieces in a cold skillet.

Pour about 2 inches of water into a large saucepan and set up a collapsible steamer inside. Steam the onions until easily pieced by a knife, about 30 minutes. (For more tender onions you may steam them a little longer; however, they might be somewhat harder to hollow out. Either way they&#39;re delicious!) Set aside to cool. Slice off about a third of the top portion of each onion. Using a paring knife, cut out the insides of each onion, leaving about 4 outside layers intact, to make a container for stuffing. Chop the onion insides and tops. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring, until crispy and the fat has rendered, about 3 minutes. Add the chopped onion, herb sprigs, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and sugar. Season with pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Add the wine and cook until dry, scrapping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to get up any browned bits, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cream and remove from the heat. Remove and discard the herb sprigs. Stir in the cheese and mustard. Lightly butter a baking dish. Season the inside of the onions with salt and pepper, and spoon the stuffing into each onion cavity, mounding it slightly on top. Set the onions in the dish. Heat the butter in the skillet. Add the breadcrumbs and stir until they absorb the butter. Spoon the buttered breadcrumbs on top of each onion. Roast the onions until well browned and heated through, about 40 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56839,&quot;Christmas Cookies 8 cups sifted all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 cups butter (3 sticks) 3 cups sugar 4 eggs 2 teaspoons almond extract 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Colored Icing, recipe follows 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 3 tablespoons water 6 to 8 drops food coloring, plus more as needed (recommended: Seelect Natural Food Coloring) 1/2 teaspoon almond extract Colored sprinkles, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder. In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter with sugar until fluffy and light. Mix in the eggs, almond extract, and vanilla extract. Turn down the mixer and slowly add the flour mixture, a third at a time to make a stiff dough. Divide the dough into 4 pieces.

When the rice is cooked let it cool until it is not steaming any more then turn the rice out of the pot into a wooden bowl and start to add the shari. Add a few tablespoons of shari at a time and toss the rice and fan it while adding the shari the idea is for the rice to absorb the shari while it is warm and for the rice to absorb it evenly.
