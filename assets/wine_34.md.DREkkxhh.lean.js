This could age for at least 20 years, and certainly won't be ready to drink before 10.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"The Conterno wines have long set the standard for more traditional Barolo.

The fruit is exquisitely ripe, the quintessence of black currants, but this density is balanced by lightness and grace. The mouthfeel is round and soft. Luxurious tannins will protect the wine as it ages.","designation":"J. Daniel Cuvee"},{"country":"US","description":"An amazing wine, made from old vines near Olivet Lane. The grapes were mistaken for Zinfandel for decades and sold as such, until recently identified as Petite Sirah, Valdepenas, Mourvdre and Alicante Bouschet.

Magnificent, lush texture, fabulous tannins, this wine is world class in every sense.","designation":"Two Acres"},{"country":"fr","description":"A deliciously concentrated and powerful wine from the domaine of ngociant Bouchard Pre et Fils.

It should keep forever.","designation":"Rocche Marcenasco"},{"country":"fr","description":"With the superlative 1999 vintage, Louis Jadot, one of the top Burgundy ngociants, has been able to produce a deep, dense purple-colored wine.

A big, chunky wine with enormous presence, rounded out by the wood.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This flagship wine shows impeccable balance and finesse. It's well put together, as the couture people say, and drips with lavish, minty French oak. Soft tannins add interest as well as ageability.

Very high quality, and worth holding through 2010.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is great red Burgundy from the oldest domaine in the village. It is all there: powerful floral aromas, flavors of a coulis of black fruits, ripe tannins and sweet fruit with balancing acidity. The wine manages to combine a deep, almost brooding strength with a dense, silky texture. For a 2000, a lesser year than 1999, this is a great achievement. Keep for at least 12 years.","designation":"Le Musigny"},{"country":"fr","description":"A wine that is too tart and hard, with flavors of unripe apples.

This is a very tannic wine, for starters. It plasters the mouth with numbing dust, and is as dry as the grave. But you know what? It doesn't have the core of fruit needed to age. It's earthy and tough and in the absence of flavor, the acidity stands out.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Currently this wine is much too dominated by wood.

The palate is big and burly, with a modicum of plum fruit but also a strong green flavor. The mouthfeel is proper but the overriding green core hinders rather than helps. Usually Santa Rita's Cabs are riper than this.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells curiously inert, with a hint of Port and currants and oak. The flavors are much less fruity than the winery's regular Syrah, veering toward prunes, herbs and earth. It's very dry. The finish is spartan and scouring.","designation":"Huerhuero Creek"},{"country":"US","description":"A simple, sweet wine.

Wild berry flavors along with a touch of bacon follow on the palate. The finish is light and a tad woody, and the finishing note is one of chocolate.

For the price, it delivers.","designation":"Pionero"},{"country":"US","description":"This Chard is fermented on lees for 4C6 months, in both French and American oak, which is more than you can say for most other Chards at this price. Slate, pear and vanilla aromas don't prepare you for the uber-malo toasty flavors that coat pear and apple-skin fruit on the palate.

It straddles that mysterious line perfectly.","designation":"Rouge"},{"country":"US","description":"Some rough, numbing tannins mask the underlying cherry fruit.
