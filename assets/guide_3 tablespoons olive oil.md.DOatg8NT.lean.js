Sprinkle Mexican blend cheese on top of the chicken. Then top with the pepper Jack slices. Remove the ramekin. Take hold of the pointed end of one of the triangles and fold it up and over the filling, tucking the tip under the bottom edge of dough to secure (the dough will not cover the filling completely). Repeat with the remaining triangles (there will be some gaps where you can see the chicken mixture). Bake until the dough is golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 25 minutes. Brush the dough with butter and sprinkle on the scallion greens. Let cool for 15 minutes. Use a spatula to slide the ring off the baking sheet onto a platter.

Split a biscuit in half and warm in the oven. Set the biscuit on a plate open faced. Dust biscuit with powdered sugar. Spread blackberry jam on each half. Chop or shred 3 ounces turkey and 3 ounces bologna and cook in a saute pan with butter until hot and the bologna starts to slightly brown. Remove from heat and place on both halves of the biscuit. Spray desired amount of warm Swiss Whiz over the top of the meat. Toss the arugula in a bowl with the lemon zest and juice, and place a handful on top of the Swiss Whiz. Top the biscuit with a fried egg, if using. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 11 more sandwiches. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the flours, baking powder, sugar, salt and baking soda in a large bowl. Add as much of the flour mixture as you can fit to a food processor and add half the butter. Pulse to incorporate, then add the remaining flour and butter and pulse again. Turn out into a large bowl, add the buttermilk and heavy cream, and using your hands, mix until just combined. (The dough will be very shaggy, as though there is not enough moisture. This is okay!) Divide the dough into 2 halves and stack one half on top of the other. Form a rectangle as best as possible with your hands, pressing each half into each other. Repeat this step 6 times. This will create the flaky layers in the biscuits. Roll the dough out into a 1-inch-tall rectangle. Cut into 3-inch-square biscuits using a knife. Brush the tops with egg wash and bake until golden brown on top, 15 to 20 minutes. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk well, until salt and sugar dissolve. Set aside to cool completely. Pour the brine over the raw turkey. Brine the turkey for 8 hours, refrigerated. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the turkey and rinse under cold water. Place in a shallow pan. Cover with plastic wrap and then foil. Bake turkey until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 165 degrees F, 35 to 50 minutes. Let cool, then slice to desired thickness. Melt the butter in a medium pot. Add the flour and cook for a few minutes over medium heat until slightly brown. Add the milk and thyme and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture starts to thicken. Turn the heat down to low, and add the cream and Swiss cheese. Stir until melted evenly. Once melted, remove from heat. Add the Dijon, lemon juice, nutmeg and pepper. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Pour the warm cheese into a whipped cream dispenser and charge with 3 chargers.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the beef and cook, stirring to break it up into small crumbles, until cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, roughly chop half of the cheese, leaving other half as slices. Set aside.<br> Using a slotted spoon, remove the beef from the skillet and transfer to a large bowl; discard the fat and liquid in the pan. Let the beef cool completely in the bowl, then stir in the chopped cheese. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a 20-by-14-inch rectangle. Arrange the beef and cheese mixture evenly on one half of the dough, starting on the shorter end and leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Drizzle 2 tablespoons ketchup evenly over the beef mixture and the uncovered half of the dough; repeat with all the mustard, and then the red onion. Lay down the remaining cheese slices evenly over the half of the dough with no beef mixture, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Arrange the bacon pieces and 24 dill pickle chips just over the beef mixture.<br> Working from the short side with the beef mixture, tightly roll up the dough into a log, jelly-roll style. Pinch the open ends together to seal, then tuck them underneath the log. Transfer the log, seam side-down, to the prepared baking sheet, brush all over with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

In a mixer or by hand, in a separate bowl whip egg whites to soft peaks. Add 1/2 cup of sugar to egg whites and mix until stiff peaks form. In another bowl whisk yolks, vanilla extract and 1 cup of sugar to a ribbon stage. Add a small amount of dry ingredients to the yolk mixture and alternate with a little of egg whites. Using a rubber spatula, continue folding until all ingredients are combined. Bake at 375 degrees F on a greased half sheet tray or a cookie sheet lined with parchment and grease again. Bake approximately 12 to 14 minutes or until springy and toothpick is almost dry. Do not overbake. In a blender combine above ingredients for approximately 1 minute or until smooth. Reserve as filling Over a double boiler melt white chocolate. Add water and mix until no lumps remain. Roughly chop berries and add to sauce. Reserve Whip egg yolks, sugar and vanilla until lightly fluffy. Cut chocolate into small pieces, place in sauce pan and add the cream. Heat to approximately 150 degrees F stirring constantly. Stir hot cream mixture into the egg yolks and continue stirring for 1 minute to assure that sugar is melted. Keep warm and ready for glazing. Melt over a double boiler and place into a piping bag or a parchment cone. On a separate sheet of parchment paper pipe out wings freehand or draw with a stencil to trace. Place in freezer so they set up. Reserve for garnish. TO ASSEMBLE CAKE Take cake and cut into two triangles then cut each in half laterally. On bottom half, ladle berry filling and evenly distribute. Then apply white chocolate berry sauce. You can at this point add fresh berry slices if desired. Place top half back on top then place cake on a wire rack for glazing. Using warm ganache ladle glaze on top of cake and allow to run down sides. If ganache is thin add another coat. Place in refrigerator until glaze is solid. Take a whisk and splatter white chocolate sauce on top and decorate with more berries. With wings, they can garnish entire cake or you can use smaller wings to garnish each individual serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73771,&quot;Lowcountry Chicken Bog 3 ripe large tomatoes or 9 ripe plum tomatoes 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper to taste 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons peanut oil 6 chicken thighs, bone in and skin on, but trimmed of any fat Salt to taste 1 cup finely chopped yellow onion 1 cup finely chopped celery 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 2 cups uncooked converted long-grain white rice (I use Uncle Ben&#39;s) 4 cups chicken stock 1 large sprig fresh thyme 2 small bay leaves 2 teaspoons Tabasco sauce Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Take 1 of the balls and press out gently in a lined tortilla press or by hand to a disk about 3 1/2 inches; it will be thicker than a tortilla, about 1/4-inch. Place carefully on the comal and cook over medium to low heat until the underside is opaque and speckled with brown, about 2 minutes. Turn the sope over and cook on the second side for a further 2 minutes. Remove from the comal and immediately (although you may burn your fingers a little) pinch up the dough around the periphery of the sope, return it to the comal, and cook briefly until the dough is firm and cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Continue with the rest of the balls. Heat a very small amount of the lard or oil in a skillet and let the sopes heat through for about 1/2 minute on each side. Spread with the bean paste and top liberally with the rest of the ingredients. Serve immediately. Heat the lard in a heavy 10-inch skillet, add the onion and fry over medium heat without browning, until translucent, about 30 seconds. Gradually add the beans and their broth and continue cooking over fairly high heat, mashing them down to a paste texture, about 10 minutes. Melt the lard in a small skillet. Skin and crumble the chorizo into the pan, and cook over low heat until the fat has been rendered out. Add the potatoes and cl, if using, and continue cooking over medium heat, scraping the bottom of the skillet from time to time to avoid sticking, until well seasoned, about 8 minutes. Season with salt. Set aside to cool a little before using. Crush or blend the garlic, chiles and salt to a paste. Gradually add the tomatoes (unpeeled), grinding well after each addition. The sauce should be textured and the skin will never all completely disappear. Sprinkle the top with the onion and cilantro and serve. Chiles Asado: Place the whole chilies on an ungreased griddle over medium heat and turn them from time to time until the flesh is fairly soft; there will be brownish patches on the skin and the color will have faded somewhat. Then, if they are to be ground with other ingredients, chop roughly before blending. * Tomatoes Asados: The whole tomatoes are cooked on a ungreased comal or griddle until they are slightly charred and mushy to guarantee a specially delicious table or cooked sauce. About half the cooks I know then skin the tomatoes, while others, including me, blend them unskinned. While the appearance of the sauce may not be as attractive, the flavor and texture are incomparable. This method of cooking tomatoes is particularly recommended for freezing and storing for the months when tomatoes are not at their best (not a problem in Mexico). You may want to broil them in a more practical way. Choose a shallow pan in which the tomatoes will just fit in 1 layer, not too large or the juice that is exuded will dry up. (I used to line the pan with foil, but no longer. It is high time that we gradually ease foil out of the kitchen or use it very, very sparingly. The mining of bauxite for the production of aluminum has destroyed far too many tropical forests on this planet.) Place the pan about 2 inches below a heated broiler and broil until the top halves of the tomatoes are soft and the skin is blistered and slightly browned. Turn the tomatoes over and repeat on the other side. The exuded juice will be sweet and syrupy so save it to blend with the tomatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 73814,&quot;Fish and Chips 3 quarts peanut or vegetable oil, for frying 2 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch wide sticks 2 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch wide sticks<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> Kosher salt<br> 3/4 bottle cold light beer<br> 1 pound white fish, such as cod, cut diagonally into 1 1/2-inch wide strips, 5- to 6-inches long<br> Instructions: Heat the oil in a large deep, pot over medium heat. Bring the oil to 325 degrees F. Regulate the temperature with a candy thermometer. Keep the potato sticks in a bowl of water to prevent browning before frying. Remove to paper towels and dry well before placing in the oil. Working in batches, fry the potatoes until they are cooked through and tender but have no color, 4 to 5 minutes. Be sure the fries have plenty of room and gently swish them around as they are cooking. Remove them from the oil and put them immediately on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and raise the temperature of the cooking oil to 375 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cayenne, seafood seasoning, baking soda and a pinch of salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and gently stir in the cold beer. Mix until just combined. When the oil is preheated to the correct temperature, dip the fish in the batter mixture. Coat the fish generously. When adding the fish to the oil, dip about 1/3 to 1/2 of the fillet into the oil and allow the batter to start puffing and then gently slide it into the oil completely. Fry the fish until they are golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes, turning the fish over during the cooking time. When the fish are done, remove from the oil and put immediately on paper towels to blot the excess oil. Arrange the fish on a baking sheet lined with a cooling rack. Hold the fish in the preheated oven until serving. Work in batches and be sure not to crowd the oil. Again, working in batches, fry the fries a second time at 375 degrees F, until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove them from the oil, immediately put them on paper towels and toss with salt. Transfer the fish to a serving platter and serve with the fries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73815,&quot;Crawfish and Cream over Pasta 1 pound linguine or fettucine 2 tablespoons olive oil 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup chopped yellow onions 2 tablespoons minced garlic 2 teaspoons Essence, recipe follows 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 1/4 cup dry white wine 2 cups heavy cream 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 pound crawfish tails* (See Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 cup chopped green onions 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 cup grated Parmesan 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, about 8 minutes.

Drain in a colander and run cold water over. Drain well again and squeeze out excess liquid. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil, chili flakes and garlic in a large saute pan over medium heat and cook for 1 minute. Add the broccoli rabe, salt and pepper and cook until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. In a separate large saute pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Add the sausage links and using a wooden spoon, gently break up the meat into coarse pieces. Cook until deep golden brown. (You do not need to cook all the way because it will continue to cook in the oven.) Combine the sausage and the broccoli rabe and let cool slightly. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and oregano, bring to a boil and cook until the mixture thickens, about 15 minutes. Stir in the basil and season with salt and pepper. Let cool slightly. Dissolve the yeast and water in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the oils and mix for 30 seconds. Add the cornmeal, 3 cups of the flour and salt and beat for 5 minutes. Switch to the dough hook and mix in the remaining 2 1/2 cups of flour and knead, using the dough hook for 2 minutes. Add the butter and knead until incorporated. The dough is a very moist dough so do not add more flour unless absolutely needed. Place the dough in a large bowl lightly oiled with vegetable oil, cover with plastic wrap or clean kitchen towels and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Punch down the dough and allow to double in size again. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place 2 pizza stones into the oven to preheat as well.

Recipe from \\New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch. Published by William and Morrow, 1993. In a heavy medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until soft and fragrant, 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, salt, and pepper and cook until the mushrooms start to give off their liquid, about 3 minutes. Add the green onions, parsley, and garlic and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the stock and heavy cream and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened to a sauce consistency, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve, or cover and keep warm until ready to use. In a saucepan, bring the water, vinegar and salt to a simmer over high heat. Crack an egg into a cup and slide the egg gently into the water. Crack another egg into the cup and when the water returns to a boil slide this egg into the water as well. When the water returns to a simmer, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the eggs are set. Watch carefully and remove the eggs when the yolks are still soft, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. (Test by lifting an egg slightly out of the water on a slotted spoon and gently pressing the center with your finger; the yolk should be soft and the white firm.) Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining eggs. (Poached eggs can be made ahead and kept immersed in a bowl of water in the refrigerator. Reheat by immersing briefly in simmering water before serving.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot]&quot; 73829,&quot;Grilled Beef Fajitas Vegetable oil, for grilling 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 large onion, thinly sliced 1 poblano pepper, seeded and thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 corn or small flour tortillas 1 1/2 pounds skirt steak, cut into four 5-to-6-inch pieces 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped, plus whole leaves for serving Sour cream, for serving Pickled jalapenos, for serving Instructions: Preheat a grill over medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates with vegetable oil. Toss the garlic, onions, poblanos and bell peppers with the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and spread onto a 20-inch-long piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil.

Photo by Con Poulos &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 73831,&quot;Potato and Sage Fritters 1/4 cup warm water 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 envelope (1 1/8 teaspoon) active dry yeast 1 pound russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes Cold water 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons sea salt 2 large eggs 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage leaves 2 teaspoons freshly grated lemon zest 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 4 to 6 cups peanut oil, for deep-frying Instructions: To make the sponge: In a small bowl, combine the water, flour and yeast. Mix well and set aside in a warm place until yeasty-smelling and covered in very small bubbles, about 45 minutes. In a medium saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of sea salt. Reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until the potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and mash the potatoes with a fork. Allow them to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and olive oil until thoroughly combined. In a bowl, combine cooled potatoes with the sponge, flour, sage, lemon zest, pepper, and 2 teaspoons of salt. Mix to evenly distribute the ingredients. Add the egg mixture to potato mixture, and stir until thoroughly combined. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. You should have a thick, sticky batter. Add a bit more flour, if needed. Cover the bowl with a towel and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F. Scoop 1 tablespoon of the risen batter at a time, and use another spoon to scrape it into the hot oil. Don&#39;t crowd the fryer. Fry fritters until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, turning them over occasionally. Drain the fritters on paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Sprinkle with sat and serve warm. Entertaining Tip: You can fry up a couple of batches of these an hour before your guests arrive and simply heat them again in a 300F oven before serving. Or keep warm in a 250F oven after making them. The fritters are great alone but they are equally great with a couple of dipping sauces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 73832,&quot;Chocolate Tacos 4 large egg whites 3/4 cup superfine sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour Pinch of kosher salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Nonstick cooking spray 8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 1 pint salted caramel ice cream, slightly softened 1/2 cup roasted pecans, chopped Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the egg whites and sugar and beat with a whisk until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the flour, salt, melted butter, heavy cream and vanilla with a rubber spatula until combined. Prop up each end of a long wooden spoon on a can or bowl (you&#39;ll use this to shape the taco shells). Heat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat; coat with cooking spray. Spoon 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan; use a small offset spatula to spread the batter into an even 4- to 5-inch pancake. Cook on the first side until golden brown at the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the reverse side, about 1 more minute. Remove from the pan and immediately drape the pancake over the wooden spoon. Set aside to set, about 5 minutes. Repeat to make 8 to 10 tacos, wiping out the skillet and adding more cooking spray as needed. Put the chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water; stir until melted. Dip the edges of the taco shells in the melted chocolate and return to the wooden spoon; let set, about 5 minutes. (If making in advance, refrigerate until ready to serve.) Fill the taco shells with ice cream and garnish with some chopped pecans. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73833,&quot;Wild Mushroom and Epazote Risotto 6 cups brown chicken stock 2 tablespoons butter 1 yellow onion, peeled and minced 1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or more to taste 1 1/2 cups round short grain rice such as Arborio 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound fresh assorted mushrooms, preferably wild, ideally a mixture of crimini, oyster, shiitake and portobello, cleaned 2 cloves garlic, minced or pureed 1/2 cup grated manchego cheese (or substitute Parmesan) 1 bunch epazote, picked and coarsely chopped Instructions: Place the chicken stock in a medium pot and bring to a simmer. Heat the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven until it foams. Add the onion, season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and cook 5 minutes until softened. Add the rice and stir well to coat with the butter. Cook 5 minutes until rice is opaque. Add wine, stir, and cook until it has been absorbed. Lower the heat to low, add one ladle of the chicken stock, and stir. Cook, stirring, until the stock has been absorbed. Continue adding stock and stirring frequently until rice is al dente and most of the stock is gone. Reserve 1/2 cup stock for finishing the dish.<br> In the meantime, cut the mushrooms into slices or wedges according to their natures. Keep the various types separate. Heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat for 1 minute then add some olive oil. Add one type of mushroom, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Shake and season with some salt and pepper. Cook until mushrooms are lightly browned, then add some of the garlic, toss, and saute one minute until its flavor is released. Then remove the mushrooms from the pan and reserve. Return the pan to the heat, add more olive oil and when it smokes add another batch of mushrooms. Continue in this way until all mushrooms have been cooked, wiping out pan occasionally when required.<br> When rice is al dente and mushrooms are all cooked, add mushrooms to the rice and stir well. Add some or all of the reserved stock if necessary to give risotto a slightly soupy character. Add grated cheese and epazote, taste and adjust seasoning, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 73834,&quot;Shrimp Macadamia 1 pound potatoes, boiled, drained Milk Freshly ground salt Freshly ground white pepper 24 jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined Clarified butter 3 ounces Macadamia nuts, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, crushed 1/4 cup dry sherry 1/4 cup fresh butter, plus extra for potatoes 1/2 lemon, juiced 2 scallop shells Parsley sprigs, for garnish 1/4 teaspoon paprika, for garnish Instructions: Mash potatoes adding enough milk and butter to make a smooth mixture.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and a pinch of salt. Make a hole in the center of the flour mixture and add the pumpkin, ricotta, milk, vanilla and egg yolks and mix gently to combine. In a medium bowl, combine the egg whites with a pinch of salt. Using a mixer or whisk, beat the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks and look very fluffy, like snowdrifts. Using a rubber spatula, scoop a third of the egg whites into the pumpkin batter and fold to gently combine. Repeat this process two more times until all the whites have been added. Do this gently but quickly ? the idea is to not squish the air out of the egg whites. This is the secret to keeping the pancakes fluffy! Place a griddle over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, drop a pat or two of butter onto the griddle. Once melted, schmear the butter around and wipe up any excess with a paper towel. Using a 2-ounce ladle, spoon ladlefuls of batter onto the buttered griddle to create 3-inch pancakes. Let the pancakes cook until bubbles appear on the surface, burst, and then stay open ? this will take about 5 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook the second side until golden brown. Re-butter the griddle and repeat until all the batter is gone or everyone is full. Hold the finished pancakes in the warm oven. For the compote: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the apples, cider, cinnamon stick, star anise and brown sugar. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer (BTB, RTS), then continue cooking until the liquid has reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the maple syrup and raisins. Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes or until slightly thickened. Remove from the heat and serve spooned over the pancakes, dusted with powdered sugar if desired. Try not to eat too many. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 73841,&quot;Cinnamon French Toast 1 cup Egg Beaters?

When you are satisfied that the butter and cream cheese are evenly mixed and there are no lumps, add the powdered sugar and mix to incorporate. When all the lumps are out, add the vanilla and food coloring and mix to incorporate. For the glaze: Combine equal parts seedless raspberry jam and water, heat in the microwave until liquid, stirring to make sure it&#39;s fully combined. For the garnish: Roll the fondant out about 1/8-to-1/4-inch thick. Cut out 12 circles, one for each cupcake. Allow the fondant to harden a bit, and then stamp the word bullying on all the circles. Use the red marker to make the circle and slash sign on top of the bullying word. To assemble: Core and fill the cupcakes with raspberry jam. Using a round tip, pipe small round balls of cream cheese frosting on the top of the cupcakes. Make a second layer of balls so the cupcake looks like it has a pile of dodge balls on top of it. Dip the top of the cupcakes in the raspberry glaze and place the garnish on top &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73852,&quot;Shrimp in Lemon Sauce: Garides Avgolemeno 24 large shrimp, cleaned and deveined 1/2 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 cup fish broth 1/2 cup finely chopped tomatoes 2 eggs 1/3 cup lemon juice 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 6 wooden skewers, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes Instructions: Marinate the shrimp in the olive oil, oregano, and garlic 30 minutes Preheat a grill.

Bring sugar solution to the boil then reduce to a simmer and add the berries. Poach berries for 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat and allow to cool in liquid. While cooling, soak apricots in apricot brandy. Place berries in a food processor along with soaked apricots and peach brandy. Puree until smooth. Whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks. Fold cream into berry puree. Divide the mixture into four 3-inch diameter custard cups. Freeze. Make the sauce: Combine the apricots, apricot brandy and 1/2 cup of the simple syrup. Place in a blender and puree until smooth. Reserve until needed. Make the sugar cage: Combine the sugar, water and glucose in a small saucepan. Stir once with a metal spoon. Place over medium heat for 2 minutes then turn to high. Cook sugar to a very light caramel. While sugar is cooking prepare a small bowl of ice water, enough to just cover the bottom of the saucepan. When sugar is at desired color, immediately remove to the ice water, taking great care not to get any water in saucepan. This mixture can be used right away or reserved and reheated to use in the future. Sugar is at desired consistency when a metal tablespoon dipped into the mixture runs off in a thread like the consistency of honey. The sugar should not be too thin. To form a cage, lightly grease with vegetable oil the outside of a 6-inch metal mixing bowl. Stand the mixing bowl upside down on a piece of aluminum paper. Lightly grease the aluminum paper outside the bowl. Dip a spoon into the sugar and flick the sugar back and forth over the bowl in one direction. Repeat this across the bowl in the other direction, creating a lattice of sugar. Allow to cool for 1 minute. To remove the cage from bowl, using the whole of the hand, gently twist the cage free. Repeat with remaining sugar to create a total of 8 cages. Assemble the dessert: Remove the frozen parfait from the freezer. Run a paring knife around the ramekin to loosen parfait. (If parfait doesn&#39;t come out immediately, place the custard cup in warm water for 10 seconds to help loosen.) Place a cage, round side down, in the middle of a serving plate. Unmold parfait in middle of cage and spoon sauce around. Top with another cage to create a dome effect. Place berries around the plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 73872,&quot;Chicken Divan with Almonds 1 (2-pound) head broccoli, stems removed 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup chicken broth 1 cup milk Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan 3 tablespoons dry sherry 12 slices cooked chicken or turkey 1 cup slivered almonds 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: Place a collapsible steamer in a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, pour in enough water to just reach the bottom of the steamer, and bring to a boil.

Do not set the burner to its highest setting, as you may need to increase the heat after you have added the turkey. It will take about 20 minutes for the oil to heat. Meanwhile, rinse the turkey well, pat it dry inside and out, and set it on end in a sink to drain. When the oil reaches 350 degrees F, pat the turkey dry again, and sprinkle it with salt. Place the turkey in the basket and carefully and slowly lower the basket with the turkey into the oil. Immediately check the oil temperature and adjust the flame so that the temperature does not drop below 300 degrees F; maintain the temperature at 325 to 350 degrees F. As it cooks, occasionally move the bird around in the oil with tongs so that it does not scorch. Whole turkeys take only 3 to 5 minutes per pound to fry to perfection. When it is done, the turkey will float to the surface with a perfectly crispy, browned skin. If you are unsure, you can test the meat for doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer deep into the thigh meat or breast meat; it should register 180 degrees F. Using the basket insert, carefully remove the turkey from the oil and hold it over the pot for a moment to allow any excess oil to drain back into the pot. Then lay the bird on the oven rack and allow it to rest for 20 minutes before carving. Just before carving, melt butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Add parsley, stir to combine, and cook until just sizzling. Carve turkey as desired, drizzle slices with butter sauce, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 73886,&quot;Maple Roasted Stuffed Bacon Rolls 3 generous cups fresh bread crumbs (Use all white or a combination of white, soft rye and or whole wheat.) 1 stick butter 3/4 cup minced yellow onion 1/3 cup minced celery 2 large cloves garlic, minced 1/3 cup minced water chestnuts 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves (or use 1/2 teaspoon crumbled aromatic dried thyme) 1/4 cup chopped flat leaf Italian parsley 1/2 pound fresh chicken livers, (rinsed well, drained, with any connective tissue cut away and the livers dried gently with paper towel) 1/2 pound fresh chicken livers, (rinsed well, drained, with any connective tissue cut away and the livers dried gently with paper towel)<br> 1 cup rich, well seasoned Chicken Stock or \\doctored\\ *canned broth 1 extralarge egg, lightly beaten Salt to taste Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup pure maple syrup (approximately) 2 1/2 pounds thin sliced packaged bacon To secure the bacon rolls: wooden tooth picks Instructions: For the bread crumbs: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Tear the bread into pieces (leave the crusts on) and place in the bowl of your food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until of fine crumb consistency (see note). Measure your bread crumbs (3 generous cups) and place on a shallow baking sheet. Place in the oven and set your timer for 10 minutes. When the timer goes off, check the crumbs. They should feel dry with a light golden color. If still soft, swish them around to redistribute and place back into the oven for a few minutes and check again but don&#39;t allow them to scorch. Remove from the oven and pour the crumbs into a bowl. Note: Generally, between 5 and 6 slices of bread will yield 1 cup of crumbs. To prepare the stuffing: Melt 3 tablespoons butter in an 8inch skillet over medium heat. When the butter is hot and bubbling, stir in the minced onions, celery and garlic. Saute the vegetables until softened and fragrant 3minutes. Stir in the minced water chestnuts and thyme. Cook gently for one more minute just to release the flavor of the thyme. Stir in the parsley and remove from the stove. Pour the contents of the skillet into the bowl with the crumbs and fold together to combine. Replace the skillet to the stove over medium heat and melt 2 more tablespoons of butter. When hot, add the chicken livers in a single layer and sear on both sides until golden. Reduce the flame, cover and simmer for 2 minutes just to cook through. (Avoid overcooking the liver. They should retain pinkness in the center.) Uncover the skillet, raise the heat and cook just a bit to caramelize the bits of onion and liver that cling to the bottom of the skillet. Remove the livers to a cutting surface and allow them to cool slightly. Meanwhile, pour the butter out of the skillet but do not wipe out the interior. Place the skillet back over medium heat and pour in the chicken stock. Bring the stock to a boil and reduce by 1/2 as you occasionally scrape any bits of caramelized liver and vegetables up off the bottom of the pan. While the stock reduces, chop the chicken livers into small but still textural pieces making sure they don&#39;t become \\pastelike. Fold into the bowl of crumbs. When not more than 1/2 cup of stock remains in the skillet, remove from the stove and *swirl in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Pour the reduced and concentrated stock/butter mixture into the bowl of crumbs and when just warm, stir in the beaten egg. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. To work with bacon: Lift small walnut sized portions of the stuffing mixture and gently squeeze to help the crumbs bind together. Roll each portion into a ball and place on a tray. Cut your packages of bacon in half widthwise using sharp kitchen shears. Take two pieces of bacon (equal to 1 whole piece) and lay them in a \\crisscross\\ on your work surface. Continue assembling as many pairs of bacon strips as can comfortably fit on your work surface. To assemble bacon rolls: Brush the exposed (facing up) side of the bacon lightly with some maple syrup. Take one ball of stuffing and place in the center where the two pieces of bacon cross and overlap. Wrap the exposed bacon around the stuffing alternating with the bottom, side, top and side strips. Secure the roll with one or two tooth picks. If not baking right away, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. To roast: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the stuffed bacon rolls on a roasting rack that sits over a shallow baking sheet. Roast them in a preheated oven until crisp and piping hot throughout, about 30 to 35 minutes (see TimeManagement Tip).

Roll one sheet of puff pastry into a 10-inch (25-centimeter) square and the other into a 12-inch (30-centimeter) square. Using a plate, bowl, or cake tin as a guide, cut out one 10-inch (25-centimeter circle) and one 12-inch (30-centimeter) circle. Discard any off-cuts and place the pastry circles in the fridge to chill. In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium. Add in the diced onion, season with salt and pepper and cook just until lightly brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and leafy greens and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. In a small bowl, stir together the mushrooms or shredded chicken and gravy. Place the smaller pastry round on a rimmed baking sheet. Spread with an even layer of mashed potatoes leaving about a 1-inch border. Top with wilted greens mixture followed by the roasted vegetables, cranberry sauce, if using and the mushroom/chicken and gravy mixture. In a small bowl, beat together the egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash and retrieve the second slightly larger pastry circle from the fridge. Brush the egg wash around the border of the smaller pastry circle and gently lay the larger circle overtop, being sure to encase the filling underneath. Using the sides of your hands, press the edges together to adhere then brush the top with more egg wash, avoiding the cut sides. Using the back of a paring knife, flute the edge of the pie to create a scalloped effect and seal the top and bottom together. If desired, lightly score a pattern into the top of the pie with the tip of the paring knife, ensuring the knife does not cut through the pastry. Poke a vent hole in the center of the pie and poke in the sprig of sage or rosemary so that it stands up straight. Return the pie to the fridge while you set your oven rack to the bottom position and preheat it to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). When heated, take the pie from the fridge and bake immediately for 35 to 40 minutes or until a deep golden brown. Allow the pie to cool slightly before removing the herbs from the top and crumbling some over the pie. Serve with more gravy and cranberry sauce, if desired. In a small saucepan, heat the broth over low heat until steaming. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat and sprinkle over the flour. Whisk together and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute, whisking occasionally. While whisking, slowly add in the warm stock. Add in sage or rosemary, season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Cook until the gravy reaches your desired thickness, about 5 to 10 minutes. Before serving, remove the sage or rosemary and season with more salt and pepper to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73892,&quot;Oyster Cracker Crusted Fish Sticks 1 1/4 pounds (567 grams) skinless walleye or cod filet<br> Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup (120 grams) all-purpose flour<br> 2 large eggs<br> 3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) oyster crackers (about 2 heaping cups)<br> 1 teaspoon dried chives<br> 1 teaspoon dried dill<br> 1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br> Olive oil cooking spray Tartar Sauce, recipe follows Lemon wedges, for serving<br> 3/4 cup (172 grams) mayonnaise 1/4 cup (60 grams) finely chopped kosher dill pickles<br> 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh Italian parsley<br> 2 teaspoons chopped capers in brine 2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill<br> Pinch sugar<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Once the oil is shimmering, add the squash and cook, stirring only once, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the bell pepper, jalapenos and garlic and stir to combine. Add the onion, chili powder and cumin and cook until the onion is softened, about 3 minutes. Add the vegetable broth, crushed tomatoes and salt and cook until thickened, about 10 minutes. Transfer a bowl and chill to cool. For the tamales: In a stovetop pressure cooker, add 3 cups of water along with the corn husks. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions for locking on the lid. Cook under high pressure just until the pressure is reached. Quick-release the pressure and carefully remove the lid. Remove the husks and cover with a damp towel, reserving the hot liquid. Place the masa in a medium bowl and whisk in the salt and baking powder. Add the vegetable shortening by pinching it together with the masa, rubbing it together to disperse. Add all of the hot water from the pressure cooker and stir until a batter is formed. Lay the husks out and spread a large golf ball-sized amount of the masa in a thin layer, leaving a 1/4-inch border. Add about two tablespoons of the chilled filling. Fold the tamale like an open-ended envelope, starting with the sides and then the bottom. Place the tamale seam-side down in a steamer basket to let gravity hold it in place. Continue with the remaining husks and filling. Very carefully wrap the whole bunch of tamales in foil, leaving the tops exposed, and stand the tamales on their ends so they stand upright in the steamer basket. If your steamer basket has handles, this will help. Add 1 cup water to the pressure cooker, then lower in the filled steamer basket, and pressure cook over high heat at high pressure for 10 minutes. Quick-release the pressure, then remove the basket and plate your hot tamales. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 73901,&quot;Black Plum &amp; Cardamom Crumble 8 black plums (about 2 1/2 pounds) 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1 teaspoons ground cardamom<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup whole wheat flour<br> 1/2 cup light brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom<br> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 1/3 cup raw pistachios, chopped<br> 1 pint vanilla ice cream, softened 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 cup store-bought caramel sauce Instructions: For the filling: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Add the beef, and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink; breaking up any lumps with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in oregano, cloves, and cinnamon. Pour out any excess fat and stir in the tomato paste until thoroughly incorporated. Add chipotles, raisins, almonds, and olives; salt to taste. Remove from heat. When mixture is cool, add cheese and mix well. Char the flesh of the peppers over a gas flame, under a broiler or on a grill. Alternatively, set a rack over an electric burner or use a very hot heavy frying pan. Cook, turning frequently, until the skins are blistered all over. Take care not to overcook and burn right through the pepper. Put peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let sweat for about 10 minutes to loosen the skins. Rub off as much skin as possible and cut a slit along the side of each pepper, keeping the stems and tip intact. Carefully remove the seeds and inner membranes, but do not rinse with water. Heat 1-inch of oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat until very hot. Place flour in a shallow platter and season with salt and pepper. Beat egg whites until foamy, add a pinch of salt, and whip to stiff peaks. Lightly beat the egg yolks and fold into the whites. Stuff the chiles with picadillo, leaving enough room to close the opening. Overlap the seam slightly and gently squeeze closed. Secure with wooden toothpicks if desired. Pat the peppers dry and lightly coat in the seasoned flour. Pick the cl up by its stem and dip into the egg batter, making sure they are well covered, tap off excess. Fry until evenly browned, about 3 minutes each side. The egg burns easily so take care not to cook too long. Drain on paper towels. To serve, ladle a pool of Tomato Ranchero sauce on plates and set chiles rellenos on top, serve immediately. Combine and puree the tomatoes, onion, cilantro, cumin, and garlic in a food processor. Heat the oil in a saucepan or skillet and fry the tomato puree over high flame. Add broth, and salt. Simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly and is heated through. If sauce tastes somewhat bitter, add a pinch of sugar. Sprinkle with a dash of hot red pepper sauce. Sauce may be served hot or cold.

Refrigerate until ready to use. For the turkey burgers: Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grill grates with vegetable oil. Mix the ground turkey, olives, dill, capers, oregano, garlic, lemon zest, 2 teaspoons salt and a generous amount of pepper in a large bowl until well combined. Divide the mixture into 4 equal balls (about 6 ounces each). Working with one ball at a time, divide it in half and flatten to make 2 patties, each about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Spoon 1 tablespoon of feta into the middle of one of the patties, leaving about a 1-inch border. Top with the other patty and press the meat together very tightly, forming a large patty shape with the cheese secured inside. (If needed, refrigerate the patties if you notice they are becoming a little malleable and too soft to work with while you build the remaining burgers). Repeat with the remaining balls and cheese. (At this point, you can freeze the burgers, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and placed inside a freezer bag, for up to 3 months.) Thaw in the refrigerator before cooking.) Grill the burgers, flipping once, until golden grill marks have formed, the meat is no longer pink on the top and an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Meanwhile, split the buns open and brush both sides with the olive oil.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Microwave the butter and spice mix in a small bowl until the butter melts. Let cool to room temperature. Sprinkle 1/4 cup granulated sugar on a cutting board. Unfold the puff pastry on top of the sugar and roll out into a 10-by-12-inch rectangle. (Lightly dust the rolling pin with flour if the dough starts to stick.) Brush the spiced butter evenly on the puff pastry, then sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar on top. Starting from a long side, roll the dough into a tight log. Slice the log into 18 rounds. Place each round cut-side down. Make a slit in each round from the center of the coil to the end of the dough strip. Open up the round into a semicircle; you should have 4 stacked strips of dough in graduated sizes (the pieces will puff up and form a tree when baked). Arrange 9 semicircles about 4 inches apart on each baking sheet. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are puffed and golden, 18 to 22 minutes. While still warm, carefully reshape the trees with a skewer if necessary. Let cool completely on the pans. Make the icing: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 tablespoon milk and the vanilla in a small bowl until smooth. Gradually stir in up to 1 more tablespoon milk until the icing is thick but pourable. Spoon the glaze into a small resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner. Pipe on the cookies. Decorate with coarse sugar and/or nonpareils. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 73909,&quot;Black Bean Soup 1 cup salsa 1 pinch allspice Two 15-to-19-ounce cans black beans, drained and rinsed 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth Instructions: In a large nonstick saucepan, combine the salsa and allspice.

Soak for 30 minutes. Drain the rice, then rinse it well. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt. Crush the saffron using a mortar and pestle, then add 3 tablespoons boiling water from the pot and allow to steep and break down.<br> Add the rice to the boiling water and cook until it&#39;s soft on the outside but still has a bite on the inside, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and rinse under cool water to stop the cooking.<br> Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet with a lid over medium-high heat and add the ghee and the saffron water; swirl it around so it coats the pan evenly. Add the rice and pack it down firmly with the back of a spatula, mounding it slightly higher in the center. Use the handle of the spatula to poke a few holes in the rice, stopping right before you get to the very bottom of the rice (this allows the steam to escape). Carefully cover the skillet with a clean dish towel and then the lid, folding the corners of the towel up around the lid so they don&#39;t touch the stove (if you&#39;re working with a gas range, you may want to fold the towel up around the lid before putting it on the skillet to be extra careful that your towel doesn&#39;t touch the flame). Cook on medium-high for 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium-low until the bottom is golden brown, about 7 minutes more. Carefully uncover the skillet, keeping the cover level so that any moisture collected under the towel doesn&#39;t spill out and burn you or fall back into the rice. Flip the rice out onto a plate so that the crispy bottom becomes the top.

Set aside for at least 30 minutes to let flavors meld. Prepare charcoal grill for medium-hot direct-heat cooking. To make the Chili Rojo: add all chili ingredients, except extra wine, to a blender or food processor. Puree thoroughly, using extra wine if necessary to make a thick, smooth sauce. To make the burger patties: take 6 tablespoons ground beef and mix with 6 tablespoons cl Rojo. Make 6 equal hand-formed patties with the remaining ground beef. Place 2 tablespoons of the cl mixture onto the center of each patty. Carefully enclose each patty around the cl mixture to form a ball. Carefully flatten each ball back into a thick patty, keeping the cl mixture inside. Season the patties liberally with salt and pepper. To make the Crema: mash the avocados in a food processor or with a potato masher. Add the rest of the ingredients and fold gently until thoroughly mixed. When the grill is hot, oil the grill rack and cook the burgers over a medium-high flame until done, about 3 minutes per side for medium rare. If the exterior of the patties begins to burn, move them to a cooler side of the grill until the centers have had a chance to cook. Add a slice of cheese to each patty about 1 minute before they are done. Let patties rest off the heat for 1 or 2 minutes after cooking, and meanwhile toast the buns on a cooler side of the grill. To assemble the burgers: spread each bun bottom with a layer of Avocado Crema.

With the paddle attachment, beat the butter slowly until it is smooth and creamy. Add the brown sugar; cream the mixture at moderate speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time. After each addition, beat until the eggs are incorporated before adding more. After the eggs are fully incorporated, mix until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, sift the cake flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda and nutmeg together. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure even mixing. Then add one-quarter of the sifted dry ingredients to the butter mixture. Mix just until blended. Mix the milk and banana puree. Add approximately one-third of the liquids. Mix just until blended in. Repeat until all ingredients are incorporated. Fill the cupcake liners half full with batter and bake until golden and baked through, about 35 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. To assemble: Cut the center out of each cupcake and fill with the French Banana Buttercream. Dip the top of the cupcake in the Chocolate Ganache. Generously frost the top of each cupcake with the Italian Meringue Buttercream Frosting. Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan. Dissolve the sugar. Boil until it reaches 240 degrees F. While the syrup is boiling, bet the yolks with an electric mixer with a wire whip until thick and light. When the syrup reaches temperature, pour it very slowly into the beaten yolks while whipping constantly. Continue to beat until the mixture is completely cool and the yolks are very thick and light. Whip in the butter a little at a time, adding it just as fast as it&#39;s absorbed by the mixture. Beat in the vanilla and banana puree. If the icing is too soft, refrigerate until it is firm enough to spread. Put the chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl. In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream to a simmer. Once a simmer is reached, pour over the chocolate chips. Using a whisk, whip until smooth and creamy. Combine 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan. Boil to reach 230 degrees F. Leave it alone. Cook over medium heat. While the syrup is boiling, using a whip attachment, start beating the egg whites and cream of tartar in a mixing bowl. Once peaks begin to form, add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar to make the peaks stiff. When the syrup reaches temperature, slowly pour it into the beaten egg whites while whipping constantly with the mixer on the lowest speed. Beat on high until cool, about 5 minutes. Turn down to medium-low speed and add the butter on the sides and scrape. Turn to high and beat until you have a smooth texture. Add the vanilla and chocolate ganache. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 73927,&quot;Cilantro and Coconut Chutney 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds 1 teaspoon ground fennel seeds 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom seeds 2 cups fresh cilantro leaves, washed and roughly chopped 1/4 cup coconut milk<br> 1/3 cup fresh coconut (or sweetened, shredded coconut) 1 teaspoon minced ginger 1 teaspoon sugar Pinch of salt 1 small green chili, minced 1 clove garlic, minced Juice of 1/2 lime Instructions: Heat a skillet over medium-low heat and toast the coriander, cumin, fennel and cardamom seeds until very aromatic, about 1 minute.

Slice the onion (see Cook&#39;s Note). Whisk the flour, cayenne, paprika, thyme, oregano, cumin and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a bowl. In a small deep bowl, whisk the eggs, milk and 1 cup water. Place the onion in a separate bowl, cut-side up, and pour all of the flour mixture on top. Cover the bowl with a plate, then shake back and forth to distribute the flour. Check to make sure the onion is fully coated, especially between the \\petals.\\ Lift the onion by the core, turn over and pat off the excess flour; reserve the bowl of flour. Using a slotted spoon, fully submerge the onion in the egg mixture (spoon on top, if necessary). Remove and let the excess egg drip off, then repeat the flouring process. Refrigerate the onion while you heat the oil. Fill a large deep pot with at least 3 inches of the oil, leaving 2 inches of space at the top. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 400 degrees. Pat off excess flour from the onion. Using a wire skimmer, carefully lower the onion into the oil, cut-side down. Adjust the heat so the oil temperature stays close to 350 degrees.

Place an approximately 20-inch-long piece of plastic wrap over the muffin pan, leaving about 4 inches of excess plastic hanging over the ends of the pan. Press the plastic into each cup of the pan, making sure the cups are completely lined with the plastic wrap. Using a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon measure, scoop about 1 1/2 tablespoons ice cream into each muffin cup so they are filled to the top. Place a chocolate cookie on top of each ice cream-filled muffin cup and gently press down. Freeze until the ice cream hardens, about 3 hours. Place a wire rack over a baking sheet. Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Carefully remove the plastic wrap from the muffin pan to release the bonbons from the muffin cups. Place the bonbons cookie-side down on the baking sheet lined with the wire rack. Slowly pour some of the chocolate shell ice cream sauce over about 1 to 2 bonbons at a time to cover completely. Before the sauce hardens, sprinkle the top of the bonbon with the chopped mint candies. The sauce will harden in about 30 seconds, so continue to coat 1 to 2 bonbons at a time before topping them with the chopped candies, until all 24 are coated and topped. Transfer the bonbons from the rack to the parchment-lined baking sheet with an offset spatula or butter knife. If needed, dip the offset spatula in hot water, then use it to remove the bonbons from rack. (The hot spatula will help prevent the chocolate shell from cracking when you remove them.)

Stir in 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cool slightly. Whisk the water and sugar in a bowl; sprinkle the yeast over top. Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the olive oil-garlic mixture. Whisk the flour and 2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture. Gradually stir with a wooden spoon to make a rough dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, dusting with more flour as necessary. Form into a large ball. Brush a large bowl with olive oil, add the dough and turn to coat. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat to 450 degrees F. Put a baking sheet on the rack to heat up while the dough rises. (The baking sheet should be the same size or slightly larger than the baking sheet that you will later form the dough on.) Once the dough has doubled in size, brush a rimmed baking sheet generously with half of the remaining olive oil. Put the dough onto the oiled baking sheet and stretch and pat evenly into the pan, making sure that it reaches the edges. Use your fingertips to make dimples all over the dough. Brush with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt. Arrange the tomato slices on the pizza in a single layer, making sure that each bite will have a piece of tomato. Sprinkle the tomatoes lightly with salt. Place the baking sheet with the dough directly on top of the preheated baking sheet in the oven (this helps with a crispy crust). Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheets and sprinkle the Parmesan over the dough. Continue to bake until the dough is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes While the pizza is baking, make the Caesar dressing: Whisk together the lemon zest and juice, egg yolk, anchovies, garlic and honey in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a large platter or cutting board. Toss the romaine with the dressing. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Top the pizza with the salad. Use a vegetables peeler to shave ribbons of Parmesan over the salad. Drizzle with olive oil, cut into pieces and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 73955,&quot;Fried Calamari with Pink Lemonade Chili and Tamarind Reduction over Sesame Black Rice Oil, for frying Two 12-ounce cans frozen pink lemonade concentrate 2 tablespoons tamarind paste<br> 3 guajillo chiles, seeded<br> 3 pasilla chiles, seeded<br> 2 tablespoons sesame oil<br> 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 2 cups black rice<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 1 teaspoon ancho chili powder<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound thinly sliced calamari rounds and tentacles<br> 1 pound thinly sliced calamari rounds and tentacles 2 tablespoons black sesame seeds<br> 1 bunch fresh basil<br> 1/2 cup vodka<br> Instructions: Heat a deep fryer or Dutch oven filled with oil to 375 degrees F.

Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a saucepan over a medium-low heat. Add the onions, garlic and a touch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the onions are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rice and increase the heat to medium-high. Toast the rice, stirring, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the white wine and cook until it has reduced to almost dry and you hear a sizzle. Add the simmering chicken stock 1 cup at a time and cook, continuously stirring, until it has absorbed almost all the way. Repeat this process until the rice is almost cooked; this will range from 15 to 20 minutes, depending on your rice. The rice kernels should still be a little al dente and the risotto should be creamy and a pourable consistency, not dry or clumpy. In a small saucepan, add about 1/2 cup simmering chicken stock and 2 tablespoons butter. Add the peas, then season with a little salt and pepper and stir. Place over low heat and cook until the peas are warmed through. Add the chives and tarragon. Transfer half of the peas to a bowl and mash with a muddler or fork. Return the mashed peas back to the pot of peas and keep warm. If the mixture looks dry, add 1/4 cup more of the stock. When the risotto is finished, shut the heat off and add the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoon olive oil, half the Parmesan and all the lemon zest. Let it sit for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir and taste for seasoning. Add a little more Parmesan if needed. Add the white balsamic vinegar and lemon juice and stir. Garnish with more Parmesan and the pea mixture. Serve in warm bowls or on warm plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 73958,&quot;Cheese Souffle 4 tablespoons softened butter 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan 3 tablespoons flour 1 cup hot milk 1/4 teaspoon paprika Pinch nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon white pepper 4 egg yolks 5 egg whites 1 cup coarsely grated Swiss cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter a 6-cup souffle or straight-sided baking dish with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter. Dust the interior of the dish with the Parmesan and knock out the excess. In a large saucepan, melt the remaining butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the butter and flour foam and froth. Remove the pan from the heat and beat in the hot milk, then simmer over medium heat and stir slowly until thick, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the seasonings, then the egg yolks, 1 by 1. Whip the egg whites to stiff, shining peaks, then whisk 1/4 of them into the sauce to lighten it. Delicately fold the remaining egg whites into the sauce, alternating with the grated Swiss cheese. Turn the souffle mixture into the prepared dish and set in the oven. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and bake until the souffle has puffed 1 or 2-inches above the rim and has browned on top, about 25 to 30 minutes.

Set the sliced cucumber into a colander. Then place the colander into an empty bowl that will allow space for drainage between the colander and the bowl. Mix the cucumber slices with 2 teaspoons salt, and then place them in the fridge to drain for 12 hours or overnight. The salt will draw out excess moisture from the cucumbers so that your pickling solution doesn&#39;t get watered down with the natural juices of the cucumber. Twelve hours later, or simply the next day, you want to toast your mustard seeds, coriander seeds, celery seeds and turmeric. Just place them in a small saute pan over medium heat, moving them around in the pan until you get the aroma of the spices. Remove the spices from the pan and set aside. Thinly slice the Vidalia onion and set aside Take the cucumbers out of the colander and place them in medium bowl. Mix the onions in with the cucumbers. Toss the cucumbers and onions with the toasted spices. In a small pot, bring the vinegar, sugar and remaining 1/4 cup salt to a boil. Pour the hot vinegar liquid over the cucumbers, onions and spices, and let sit until the liquid comes to room temperature. Once at room temperature, they are ready for the refrigerator and will be ready to eat the next day.

Trim the edges, if necessary, and cut the puff pastry into 4 squares. You may need to roll the puff pastry larger or smaller depending on the size of the meat. Put them in a single layer onto one or two baking sheets and into the refrigerator to firm up. Rinse the dried mushrooms in cold water, put them into a small bowl and cover them with hot water. Let soak for 20 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is very hot, season the meat with salt and pepper and sear on each side for 1 minute per side. Set aside. Turn the heat down to medium, add the shallots to the pan and cook until they are soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the butter and fresh mushrooms and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the dried mushrooms and chop them finely. Add them to the pan along with the sherry, if using. Turn the heat up a bit and cook until the mushrooms are almost dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the thyme and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 more minute, take the pan off the heat and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the pastry from the refrigerator. Put a large tablespoon of the mushroom mixture in the center of a pastry square and spread it out to the same size as the meat. Place a piece of tenderloin on top and brush some egg wash around the edges of the pastry. Fold up the corners and sides of the pastry so they meet and overlap slightly in the middle. Turn it over so the seams are down and shape it into a neat package with your hands. Repeat with the other three squares. If the pastry has gotten soft, put the packages back in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes to firm up. This will make sure the pastry does not just melt into a gooey mess in the oven before it has a chance to puff up. Save the remaining mushroom mixture for the sauce. When you are ready to bake, cut a design into the top of each package with a paring knife. Brush them all over with egg wash. Bake for 14 minutes for medium rare or adjust the time shorter or longer according to how you like your meat cooked. While the Wellingtons are baking, reheat the mushroom mixture. Add the cream and cook on high for 2 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Remove from the heat, cover and keep warm. When the Wellingtons are ready, remove them from the oven and serve with the sauce and a big glass of hearty red wine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah]&quot; 73962,&quot;Sushi Rice 3 1/3 cups short grain rice 4 cups water, plus 1/4 cup water 6 tablespoons rice vinegar 5 tablespoons sugar 3 teaspoons salt Instructions: Rinse rice in water until the water runs clear and then drain in a colander for 1 hour. Place the drained rice in a rice cooker or in a pot with a tight-fitting lid and add 4 cups water. Over medium heat, cover and bring the water to a boil. Boil for about 2 minutes, reduce heat and allow to simmer for another 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook for about 15 minutes, or until water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, remove lid, and place a towel over pot. Replace lid and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes. While the rice cooks, combine vinegar, sugar and remaining 1/4 cup water in a saucepan. Heat over low temperatures, stirring, until sugar and salt dissolve. Let cool. Empty rice into a hangiri (or other nonmetallic) tub and spread it evenly over the bottom with a shamoji (or large wooden spoon). Run the spatula through the rice in slicing motions to separate the grains. While doing this, slowly add vinegar mixture. Add only as much as is necessary; the rice should not be mushy. If you have help, fan the rice with an uchiwa (fan) during the cooling and mixing procedures. Do not refrigerate the rice. Keep it in the tub covered with a clean cloth until ready to use. The rice will last one day. &quot;,&quot;[Sak, Junmai Ginjo, Nigori, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 73963,&quot;Everything-Spiced Pigs-in-a-Blanket with Cherry Pepper Relish and Horseradish Honey Mustard One 16-ounce jar cherry peppers, drained 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 3 tablespoons honey<br> 3 tablespoons cider vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Pinch salt<br> 1 cup whole-grain mustard 1/4 cup yellow mustard<br> 1/2 cup honey<br> 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish<br> 1/4 cup poppy seeds 1/4 cup sesame seeds 1/4 cup dried garlic<br> 1/4 cup dried onion<br> 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt<br> 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper<br> 4 links smoked sausage or kielbasa (about 2 pounds) 1 package puff pastry (2 sheets)<br> 1 egg, lightly scrambled<br> Instructions: For the relish: Add the cherry peppers, garlic, honey, cider vinegar, olive oil and salt to the bowl of a food processor.

Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until well incorporated, about 1 minute. (Turn off the beaters and use your hands to help combine if needed). Fold in the chocolate chips with a rubber spatula or mix them in with your hands. (You should have about 4 cups of cookie dough.) Remove 1/4 cup cookie dough and roll into 6 heaping teaspoon sized balls and place them 1-inch apart on a baking sheet. Bake until the cookies are set and browned around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 25 minutes. Cut the cookies in half.<br> Make the ganache: Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.<br> Assemble the cake: Place a cake layer on a cake stand or platter. Press half of the remaining cookie dough evenly on top of the cake (it should be about a 1/2-inch-thick layer). Top with the other cake round and then press the remaining cookie dough evenly on top of the cake. Drizzle some of the ganache around the edge of the cake letting it drip down the sides. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the ganache over the top of the cake. Spread the remaining ganache around the bottom of the cake to make a 1-inch border. Press the mini chocolate chips into the ganache. Decorate the top of the cake with the cookie halves. Chill until the ganache has set, about 20 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73965,&quot;Spicy Cherry Ribs 2 teaspoons yellow mustard 2 pork rib racks (St. Louis style spare ribs) 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1 recipe Spicy Cherry Glaze, recipe follows 2 tablespoons scallions, chopped 1 teaspoon sesame seeds 1 tablespoon oil 1 cup diced red onion 4 tablespoons minced ginger 3 cups canned cherries in syrup, preferably Bing 2 tablespoons minced garlic 2 tablespoons tequila (recommended: Cabo Wabo Resposado) 3 tablespoons hot sauce (recommended: Sriracha) 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon sherry wine vinegar 4 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place ribs onto aluminum foil. Brush the mustard onto the ribs. Mix dry ingredients thoroughly. Then cover the ribs with the rub. Let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Wrap the ribs, meat side down, in the aluminum foil then place onto a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 225 degrees F and cook for another 1 1/2 hours. Then, open the foil and cook for 1 hour. Remove ribs from oven, and discard the foil. Cut into 4-rib portions. Liberally slather on the Spicy Cherry Glaze, then place, bone side down, in a roasting pan. Pour the remaining sauce over the ribs and continue to cook for 1 1/2 hours, basting occasionally. When ribs are fork tender, place under broiler for 10 minutes to crisp the cherry glaze. Serve immediately garnished with scallions and sesame seeds. In a medium saute pan over medium heat, add oil, onion, ginger, cherries and garlic. Saute until lightly caramelized. Deglaze with tequila, hot sauce, sesame oil, sherry wine vinegar and soy sauce. Let simmer for 15 minutes. Season, with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 73966,&quot;Duck Breast Crusted with Honeyed Nuts Coffee Infusion and Brandied Cherries 4 tablespoons blanched almonds, toasted 4 tablespoons blanched hazelnuts, toasted 4 tablespoons walnuts, toasted 6 ounces wildflower honey 4 cups duck consomme 4 cups heavy cream 2 tablespoons cracked espresso beans Salt Freshly ground black pepper 4 Moulard duck breasts Salt and pepper 4 tablespoons canola oil, plus 2 tablespoons 4 cups cleaned endive 1 orange, zested 1 teaspoon sugar 4 ounces brandied cherries Instructions: To make the crust, chop the toasted nuts coarsely. Do not reduce the nuts to a powder. Stir the nuts into the honey and set aside. To make the coffee sauce, in a heavy-bottomed saucepot, bring the consomme and the cream to a boil, reduce the heat, and let simmer. Stirring occasionally, reduce the sauce by about 3/4, until it will coat the back of a wooden spoon. Add the cracked coffee beans, cover, and turn off the heat. Let the sauce infuse for 10 minutes, then strain, and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Set sauce aside and keep warm. Preheat the broiler. To prepare the duck breast, trim away excess fat and lightly score the skins with a sharp knife. Season with salt and pepper and cook, skin side down, over medium heat in 4 tablespoons of the canola oil. As the duck breasts render their own fat, the skins will crisp and become golden brown. Drain off excess fat periodically. Cook the duck breasts for about 10 minutes. Turn the breasts onto their flesh side and cook for 1 more minute. Remove the breasts from the pan, and wipe pan clean with a paper towel. In a separate saute pan, heat the remaining canola oil. Add the endive, orange zest, and sugar, and saute until the endive is wilted. Set aside and keep warm. Spread each breast with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the honey nut crust, and place them back in the clean pan. Caramelize the duck under the broiler for 1 minute, making sure the crust doesn&#39;t burn. Remove the breasts to a plate and rest for 5 minutes. To serve duck breast, slice each breast into 1/4-inch thick pieces and fan out. Place slices on warmed plates with sauteed endive. Pour the coffee sauce around duck breast, and garnish with the brandied cherries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Riesling]&quot; 73967,&quot;Duck a l&#39;Orange 2 Pekin (Long Island) duck breasts or 1 mallard breast (1 1/2 to 2 pounds each) Salt and pepper 1 juicing orange or 6 kumquats 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup concentrated duck broth, 2 tablespoons homemade duck glaze or 1 tablespoon commercial glaze 1/8 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon orange flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) 1 tablespoon balsamic, sherry, or red wine vinegar, or more to taste 1 1/2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter Orange wedges Instructions: Use a sharp knife to score the skin side of the duck breasts in 2 directions, about 20 slashes per direction. Season the breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Reserve in the refrigerator. Cut off 1 end so the orange can stand on the cutting board, and slice off 2 (2-inch) strips of zest. Cut the zest into fine julienne, then blanch the zest for 1 minute in the cup of boiling water. Juice the orange, strain the juice into a saucepan, and boil it until it&#39;s reduced to about 1 tablespoon. If you&#39;re using the kumquats instead, cut the round ends off the kumquats and eat or discard them. Set the kumquats on 1 end and use a sharp paring knife to trim the zest off three of them. Cut all the kumquats in half lengthwise, and working over a strainer set in a non-reactive bowl, remove the pulp with a small spoon. Push the pulp against the strainer to extract the juice. (Don&#39;t worry if you end up with only a tablespoon or 2.) Place the kumquat zests on a cutting board and slice them into fine julienne. Bring the 1/2 cup water to a boil over high heat, blanch the zests for 1 minute, then drain them in a strainer. If you&#39;re using concentrated duck broth, reduce it in a small saucepan to about 2 tablespoons until it&#39;s lightly syrupy. Heat a saute pan over medium to high heat and saute the duck breasts, skin side down, 8 to 10 minutes for the Pekin duck breasts and 12 to 18 minutes for the mallard. Turn the breasts over, adjust the heat to high, and cook for 1 minute for the Pekin duck and 2 minutes for the mallard. Pour the fat out of the pan ? if it hasn&#39;t burned, save it for omelets ? and deglaze the pan with the reduced kumquats or orange juice. Use a whisk to add the glaze. Add the sugar, Grand Marnier, kumquat or orange zest, and vinegar, and simmer the sauce for about 30 seconds to cook off the alcohol. At this point, adjust the thickness of the sauce ? its consistency is up to you, but many cooks make their sauces too thick; add 1 or 2 teaspoons water to thin it or simmer the sauce for a moment to reduce and thicken it. Whisk in the cold butter, keeping the pan and whisk moving until all the butter melts. (Don&#39;t let it sit without whisking or the butter will separate.) Season, to taste, with the pepper, and if necessary, a few more drops of vinegar. Slice the breasts crosswise, arrange the slices on individual heated plates, and spoon the sauce over the breasts. Serve hot, with orange wedges if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 73968,&quot;Vanilla Custard with Raspberry Mash 2 cups whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 6 egg yolks 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup cornstarch 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 cup cream 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 pint raspberries 1 tablespoon sugar Instructions: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Pour into individual dessert dishes and chill. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. (The custard can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Cover with plastic wrap if you are keeping it longer than that.) Raspberry Mash: Place 1/4 of a pint of raspberries in a bowl with the sugar and mash it with the back of a fork. Toss in the remaining 1/4-pint of raspberries and gently toss to coat. Whip the cream with the sugar and serve on the custard and mash. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 73969,&quot;Tequila Guacamole 4 cal fully ripened avocados from Mexico halved, pitted and peeled 2 g white onion finely chopped 2 g pickled chiles jalapenos finely chopped 2 g pickled carrots finely chopped 2 ounces tequila of your choice 2vinegar from the pickled chiles jalapenos 1 tablespoon olive oil Juice from 1/2 lime Dried oregano to taste salt to taste Instructions: Mix the cl jalapeno, carrots, onion, limejuice, oregano, vinegar and tequila; marinate for two minutes.

Place the bread slices on a flat surface and use a cookie cutter or a small glass to cut holes (about 2-inches wide) in the center of each. Soak each slice and the bread circles in the egg mix, coating both slides. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat and add half of the butter. When the butter begins to foam and brown slightly, arrange 2 slices in the pan. Cook on the first side over medium heat, 3 to 5 minutes, and then turn the slices over, cooking for an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until both sides are browned and the toast is cooked through. Keep warm. Repeat with remaining bread and bread circles. Use a kitchen towel to wipe out the skillet and coat with nonstick cooking spray. Fry 2 eggs sunny side up in the skillet. Repeat with remaining eggs. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the remaining almonds on the bottom of each plate as an \\anchor\\ for each egg. Place a fried egg on top of the nuts and place each piece of toast carefully on top of the egg so the yolk peeks out of the toast hole. Serve a bread circle with each serving. Drizzle with the maple syrup.

Fill a large bowl with ice water. Make the custard: Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) until the sugar dissolves. Slowly whisk in the milk and cook, whisking constantly, until the custard is light and foamy, about 10 minutes (a thermometer inserted into the mixture should register 170 degrees F). Remove the bowl from the saucepan and set in the bowl of ice water; whisk until the custard is cool, about 1 minute. Put the mascarpone in a large bowl. Fold the custard into the mascarpone with a rubber spatula until almost combined, then whisk until just smooth (do not overmix or the custard will be grainy). Combine the espresso and brandy in a shallow bowl. One at a time, dip the ladyfingers in the espresso mixture until soaked but not soggy; arrange 2 rows of about 5 biscuits each in the baking dish. Spread one-third of the mascarpone custard over the ladyfingers. Repeat with a second layer of espresso-dipped ladyfingers, arranging them in the opposite direction. Top with another one-third of the custard. Repeat with the remaining ladyfingers, alternating directions. Spread the remaining custard on top and dust with the cocoa powder. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 4 hours, or overnight. Invert a plate on top of the tiramisu, then flip the tiramisu with the plate. Remove the baking dish and plastic wrap. Invert a serving plate on top of the tiramisu and flip again so it is cocoa-side up. Remove the remaining plastic wrap. Shave curls of chocolate on top with a vegetable peeler.

For the cake: Lightly coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray and set aside. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and sugars together. Stir in the milk and vanilla, and then add the oil. Whisk in the pumpkin puree and pour the liquid mixture over the dry mixture. Use a wooden spoon to stir the batter together, and then switch to a whisk and give the batter a good 3 or 4 beats before pouring it into the prepared baking dish. Use a rubber spatula to smooth out the batter and place it in the oven until the cake is golden and springs back to light pressure, 25 to 28 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely. Meanwhile, place the pecans on a rimmed baking sheet and toast them until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a large plate to cool, then transfer to a cutting board and finely chop. Place the nuts in a medium bowl and set aside. Divide the cake into quarters and crumble it into a large bowl. Once all of the cake is crumbled, drag 2 forks through the cake in opposite directions to crumble it into a very fine crumb (you can also use a food processor to pulse the cake into fine crumbs). Set aside. For the frosting: Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper and set aside. Using a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium speed until airy, about 3 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until combined. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stir the cream cheese frosting into the cake crumbs and, once the mixture looks like wet graham crackers crumbs, roll it into ping pong-size balls. Place the cake balls on the prepared baking sheet and freeze for 1 hour. Place the chocolate and vegetable shortening in a medium microwave-safe bowl and melt at 50-percent power, stirring every 30 seconds until the chocolate is completely melted, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes (or melt the chocolate over a double boiler, stirring often, until the chocolate is melted). Remove the cake balls from the freezer and insert a lollypop stick or small appetizer-length skewer into the top of each one (stick it in far enough so it is more than halfway through but doesn&#39;t puncture the other side of the ball). Dip each ball into the white chocolate, using a spoon to help coat the underside. Tap the stick against the side of the bowl a few times and swirl the stick to encourage the excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl. Dip the top of the ball into the nuts, and then place the cake pop back on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet, nut-side down (so the stick points straight up). Repeat with the remaining cake balls. Let the cake pops stand at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving. Serve that day or refrigerate for up to 3 days and then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 73983,&quot;Smoky Chicken and Corn with Honey Butter 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons honey Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 ears of corn, shucked and cut into 1-inch pieces 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced 1 bunch scallions, trimmed and cut into 2-inch sections 4 sprigs fresh thyme 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each) 1/2 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high. Mix the butter, honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl. Tear off 4 large sheets of heavy-duty foil. Divide the corn evenly among the sheets, placing it off to one side. Top with the mushrooms, scallions and thyme. Season the chicken with salt and the paprika and place on top of the vegetables. Place a heaping tablespoon of the honey butter on top. Fold the other half of the foil over the chicken and vegetables and fold the ends twice to seal, leaving room for heat to circulate. Grill the foil packets for 8 minutes. Flip the packets, gently press and cook 6 more minutes. Flip back onto a platter to rest, 3 minutes. Carefully open the packets and top with the remaining honey butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]&quot; 73984,&quot;Chimichanga 3-pound boneless shoulder chuck roast Salt and freshly milled black pepper 1/4 cup bacon drippings or vegetable oil 1 medium onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 cup beef stock 2 small tomatoes, preferably Italian plum, chopped 1/2 cup chopped roasted mild green chiles, such as New Mexican, preferably fresh or frozen, seeded 4 thin 10- to 12-inch flour tortillas, warmed Vegetable oil for deep-frying Grated Monterey Jack, asadero, or mild Cheddar cheese, or a combination Sour cream, chopped tomato, and sliced scallions Pico de Gallo (page 77) or other favorite salsa Instructions: Rub the roast with salt and pepper. Warm 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings in a Dutch oven or other large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides. Reduce the heat to low, scatter half of the onion and half of the garlic over and around the meat. Pour the beef stock over it. Cover and simmer for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, until the roast is very tender. Let the meat sit in the cooking liquid until cool enough to handle. Drain the meat, reserving the cooking liquid. Shred the meat into bite-size pieces with your fingers or in several small batches in a food processor. Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute the remaining onion and garlic in the fat until the onion softens. Add the meat and saute until well-browned, about 10 minutes. Scrape the meat up from the bottom every few minutes, getting it crusty in some spots. Pour the reserved cooking liquid into the pan and add the tomatoes and chiles. Cook for about 15 minutes, until most of the liquid has evaporated. The meat should remain moist but not juicy. Adjust the seasoning if you wish. (The meat can be made ahead to this point and refrigerated, covered, for up to several days. Warm the meat before proceeding.) You&#39;ll need about 5 cups of the shredded meat mixture for the chimichangas. Spoon it evenly over the tortillas. Roll up each tortilla, tucking in the ends to make a secure fat tube that resembles an overgrown Chinese egg roll. Secure the rolls with toothpicks. Shortly before you plan to eat the chimichangas, warm at least 4 inches of oil in a Dutch oven or other large heavy pan to 375 degrees F. Fry the chimichangas one or two at a time until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Turn the chimis to fry them evenly. Drain them and arrange on serving plates.

Add a drizzle of oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the ham and scallions. Cook until the scallions are charred and the ham is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool completely. Put the potatoes in a large pot with heavily-salted cold water to cover by about an inch (add as much salt as you would to pasta water). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain in a colander and return the potatoes to the still-hot pot, tossing them to cook out any residual moisture. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the brine and 1 teaspoon salt to season the potatoes while still hot so they absorb the flavor. Toss very well. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, mustard, sugar, garlic powder, remaining 2 tablespoons brine, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper until smooth. Fold in the potatoes, cooled scallions and ham, eggs, cornichon, celery, parsley and dill. Toss to completely coat the potatoes with the dressing. Sprinkle with additional parsley and dill to garnish. Serve at room temperature or cover and chill until cold, at least 2 hours. This can be made a day ahead. Taste before serving, as you may need to add more salt once it\\u2019s chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 73986,&quot;Caramel Monkey Bread Cooking spray 5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4-ounce packet instant yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon fine sea salt 1 cup whole milk 6 large eggs 2 sticks unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 1 stick unsalted butter 2/3 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt Cooking spray 2 cups sugar 4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 stick unsalted butter All-purpose flour, for dusting Instructions: Make the brioche: Coat a large bowl with cooking spray and set aside. Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix on low speed to combine. Add the milk and eggs and mix until combined, then increase the speed to medium high and mix until the dough begins to pull away from the sides, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium; start adding the butter, a few pieces at a time, beating until incorporated before adding more, about 5 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and continue to mix until the dough is glossy and slightly tacky but not sticky, about 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to the prepared bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Make the caramel: Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture starts to boil, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue cooking, swirling the pan but not stirring, until dark amber, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, heavy cream, vanilla and salt. Let cool to room temperature. Assemble the monkey bread: Coat a 15-cup bundt pan with cooking spray. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Put the butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Slice the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each into a 9- to 10-inch-long log. Slice each log into roughly 10 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball, dusting the surface with more flour as needed. Pour about half of the caramel into the bundt pan. Working in batches, coat 20 dough balls in the butter, letting the excess drip off, then roll in the cinnamon sugar and arrange in a single layer in the pan. Drizzle the remaining caramel on top. Repeat with the remaining 20 dough balls, melted butter and cinnamon sugar, then arrange in the bundt pan. Set aside until the dough is slightly puffed, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350? F. Place the bundt pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the monkey bread is dark golden brown on top, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 73987,&quot;Steak and Black Bean Tostadas 8 corn tortillas 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil Kosher salt 1 pound cube steak, thinly sliced into 3- to 4-inch strips, 1/4-inch thick Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion, thinly sliced (about 2 cups) 1 clove garlic, finely minced 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed 1/2 cup beef broth 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lime zest 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1 teaspoon chili powder One 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained 1/2 cup beef broth Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 firm ripe mangoes, peeled, seeded and cut into small dice 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lime zest 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1/8 teaspoon chili powder Kosher salt 2 tablespoons roughly chopped pickled jalapenos, for garnish Lime wedges, for serving Instructions: For the tortillas: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Continue to beat for another couple minutes. The batter should be completely homogeneous and feel a bit dense and heavy. Transfer the batter to a large mixing bowl. Rinse the bowl of the mixer well and change the paddle attachment to the whisk attachment. Beat the egg whites on medium-high speed, until they hold stiff peaks, about 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly, incorporate a bit of the whipped-up egg whites into the heavy batter. Repeat with the rest of the egg whites, folding them gently but persistently, until the batter is completely incorporated and seems lighter and puffier. Don&#39;t overmix, or you will remove the puff effect from the beaten egg whites. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the sides and bottom of a 14-cup bundt pan and lightly coat with all-purpose flour. Shake out any extra flour. Pour the batter into the prepared mold and bake in the oven about 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown on top, seems beautifully puffed up and a toothpick comes out moist but not wet. Remove from the oven. Let cool for at least 10 minutes. To make the lime syrup: Combine the lime juice with the granulated sugar in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat for a couple minutes, just until the sugar has dissolved. Run the tip of a knife around the edges of the cake. Place an inverted platter or board on top of the bundt pan. Invert to release the cake. With a toothpick or wooden skewer, poke holes all over its surface, going as deep as the toothpick will go--I poke at least 100 times! Pour half the lime syrup evenly over the cake. Let it absorb for a few minutes. Pour over the rest of the syrup and let it sit for a few minutes, while you make the glaze. To make the lime glaze: In a small mixing bowl, using a small whisk or fork, combine the lime juice with the vanilla and confectioners&#39; sugar until thoroughly mixed. With a tablespoon, add half the glaze, one tablespoon at a time, over the cake, slowly so it absorbs and coats the cake. Wait a few minutes and add the rest of the glaze. Let some of the extra glaze slide down the sides, as it will give it a pretty glazed look. Grate some fresh lime zest over the top. If there is any leftover, cover so it will remain moist -- it usually becomes more moist after a day or two. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 74003,&quot;Basic Buttered Peas 1 quart water, for boiling 1 pound peas 1 tablespoon salt (for boiling peas) 1 tablespoon butter Salt and freshly ground black pepper Optional additions: pearl onions and lettuce, freshly chopped tarragon, chives, mint, parsley, soaked and chopped dried wild mushrooms or chopped prosciutto. Instructions: Shell the peas if using fresh peas, if using frozen defrost fully before cooking. Bring the water to a rapid boil. Stir in the salt and add the peas. Boil the peas for 1 minute or until they are cooked. Drain the peas when done and add peas to a wide skillet over high heat. Toss in pan until fully dry. Add butter and salt and pepper to taste. Add any optional additions if you choose, and combine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74004,&quot;Banana Peel Cake with Brown Sugar Frosting Peels from 2 very ripe bananas, stem and very bottom discarded (see note) 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened, plus more for buttering the pans<br> 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 2 large eggs, separated<br> 1/2 cup buttermilk<br> 1 2/3 cups cake flour, plus more (any type) for flouring the pans<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt<br> 1/2 cup unsalted butter 1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup milk, 2 percent or higher<br> 1 3/4 to 2 cups powdered sugar, sifted<br> Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the cake: Cut the banana peels into 1-inch pieces and place them in a small saucepan with 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly, then drain the banana peels, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water. Meanwhile, butter and flour the sides of two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter and flour the pans again to coat the paper. Transfer the peels and the 1/4 cup of cooking water to a tall, narrow container and puree with an immersion blender until completely smooth (a mini food processor would do the trick, too!). Cream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl using an electric mixer (or a wooden spoon for an arm workout) until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing until incorporated, and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Mix in the banana peel mixture, then stir in the buttermilk until well-combined. In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the butter mixture and stir gently, just until combined. Put the egg whites in another bowl (make sure it&#39;s clean and dry!) and whisk until soft peaks form -- either by hand or with the whisk attachment on an electric mixer. If using an electric mixer, start slowly and gradually increase speed to medium-high. You&#39;re done when you pull out the whisk or beater and a soft peak is formed, but immediately collapses. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter and divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake pulls out with dry crumbs rather than wet batter, about 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool completely in the pans. When the cakes are completely cool and you&#39;re ready to assemble, make the frosting: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in the brown sugar and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in the milk, raise the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring constantly until the mixture boils. Remove from the heat and let cool to lukewarm. Gradually whisk in 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar, beating until smooth. Add the additional 1/4 cup powdered sugar if the frosting is too loose. Use the frosting immediately, as it will begin to thicken and stiffen as it sits. To remove the cake from the pans, invert one cake pan on a serving plate, lift pan, and peel the parchment. Repeat for the second cake pan. Put one layer of the cake on a serving platter and spread about one-third of the frosting evenly over the top. Set the other layer on top, and spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74005,&quot;Lemon Semifreddo with Orange and Mango Salad 1/2 cup sliced almonds, toasted 2 cups heavy cream 1 1/4 cups sugar, plus 1 tablespoon 8 egg yolks 1/2 cup lemon juice 3 lemons, zest finely grated Pinch salt 3 oranges, supremed, plus the juice 1 mango, cut into small cubes 10 mint leaves, cut into chiffonade Instructions: Line a loaf pan with plastic wrap. Be sure to leave plenty of plastic around the edges so they can be folded over to cover the top. Put the almonds in the bottom of the prepared pan in an even layer (this will eventually become the top, so make it look pretty!). Reserve. Whip the cream with a whisk or an electric beater until it forms medium peaks. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Bring a saucepan with about 1-inch of water to a boil, over low heat. In the metal bowl of a stand mixer, combine the 1 1/4 cups of sugar, egg yolks, lemon juice and zest and the pinch of salt. Whisk to combine. Put the metal bowl on the saucepan, and reduce the heat under the saucepan so the water is just at a simmer. Whisk the egg mixture until it gets very light and fluffy, this will take about 4 to 5 minutes. For an insurance policy you can take the temperature of this mixture. It should be about 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Put the mixer bowl on the mixer and beat with the whisk attachment until the mixture has doubled in volume and the bottom of the bowl is cool when touched. Fold in the reserved whipped cream in increments. Do this gently but quickly. When it is a homogeneous mixture, pour it into the prepared loaf pan. Fold the plastic over the top and transfer to the freezer. Freeze at least 4 to 5 hours, but this can be done overnight or up to a couple days in advance. Combine the oranges, mangoes, mint and remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar in a small bowl. Let the mixture macerate for about 1 hour before serving. To serve: Remove the loaf pan from the freezer and open the plastic. Turn the semifreddo out of the loaf pan to a serving platter and remove the plastic. With hot knife, slice the semifreddo into 1-inch slices and garnish with the orange/mango salad.

In a medium saucepan, heat the cream to a boil. Remove from the heat and immediately pour over the chocolate. Let sit for 1 to 2 minutes, and then slowly stir the chocolate into the cream until it is smooth and completely combined. The heat of the cream should be enough to melt the chocolate, but if it is not completely melted, feel free to heat it in the microwave or over a hot water bath, just be sure to stir every few seconds or it will likely burn. When the mixture is smooth, add in the chili powder and taste to make sure it is spicy enough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Once chilled, scoop the ganache with a spoon and roll between your palms to form a uniform sphere. At Kakawa, we weigh each ball to about 1/2-ounce. At this point, you may roll them in the cocoa powder to coat or alternatively you may chill again and dip in tempered chocolate. If at any point they get too gooey or soft, just stick them back in the refrigerator for a little while. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 74038,&quot;Floosh&#39;s Stuffed Cabbage 1 extra-large head green cabbage (large enough to yield 14 large leaves), core carefully removed with a sharp knife 3/4 cup finely chopped onion 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 1/4 pounds raw lean ground turkey 1/3 cup ketchup 1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 3/4 cup jellied cranberry sauce 1/3 cup low-sugar grape jam or preserves 2 cups low-fat plain marinara sauce 1/3 teaspoon salt Chopped scallions, for optional garnish Instructions: Place cored cabbage head in an extra-large pot and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil on the stove. Once boiling, cover and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, rotating the cabbage occasionally with tongs or a large heat-resistant spoon, until the leaves soften, loosen, and begin to fall off the head. Remove the pot from heat. Carefully remove the cabbage head and leaves from the pot, drain it, and let it cool. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce and filling. To make the filling: Combine onion, garlic, turkey, ketchup, tomato paste, and sugar in a large bowl. Knead with your hands until the mixture is evenly combined. Set aside. To make the sauce: Combine cranberry sauce, jam or preserves, marinara sauce, and salt in a large glass measuring cup, and stir with a whisk or fork until smooth. Set aside. Once the cabbage is cool enough to handle, gently remove 14 large leaves. (Refrigerate the rest for another use.)

Add the sugar, eggs, and kiwi mixture. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring until it thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 12 minutes. Set the pan over a large bowl of ice and continue to stir until the mixture has cooled slightly. Strain the mixture into a clean bowl and refrigerate until thickened and well chilled. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, combine the egg whites and sugar and whip until the mixture is firm and glossy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 74046,&quot;Cheesesteak Crepe 6 eggs 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/4 teaspoon salt 8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded 8 ounces mozzarella, shredded 10 slices American cheese 1 tablespoon whole milk Salt 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 onion, chopped Salt and ground pepper One 5-pound rib eye roast, ribs removed, thinly sliced Granulated garlic, for sprinkling Store-bought chimichurri, optional Instructions: For the crepe batter: Add the eggs, flour, oil, salt and 1 cup water to a blender and blend until it has a thin batter consistency. Combine the Monterey Jack and mozzarella together in a bowl to make a cheese blend. For the cheese sauce: Stack the American cheese, then add to a vacuum sealer bag. Add the milk and a pinch of salt in the same bag. Seal the bag. For the crepes: Add 1 tablespoon of the canola oil to a nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat for about 1 minute. Pour some batter into the pan, making sure it covers the whole pan. Let the batter settle, then add some cheese blend and let melt. Flip the crepe over and let it cook on the cheese side until melted, then remove the crepe from the pan. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 9 more crepes. Heat the pan with the remaining tablespoon canola oil. Add the onions with a pinch of salt and a pinch of ground pepper until sauteed. Remove the onions, then add the rib eye to the pan. Add some granulated garlic, salt and pepper and cook until the meat is cooked all the way through. For the cheese sauce: Boil 2 quarts of water. Add the sealed cheese bag to the boiling water and let cook until melted, about 1 minute. Remove from the water. Fold a cooked crepe in half, then add 8 ounces rib eye and one scoop of onion in center of the crepe. Add the cheese sauce drizzle. If desired, add your favorite sauce or chimichurri. Roll the crepe over the center. Enjoy. Repeat to make 9 more crepes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM (Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre)]&quot; 74047,&quot;Chipotle Mashed Potatoes with Bacon 2 pounds Idaho or Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup whole milk 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 1/2 cup finely chopped cooked bacon 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped canned chipotle chiles in adobo Instructions: Put the potatoes in a medium pot, cover with cold water and add 2 tablespoons salt.

Add the onion, fennel and lemon zest and stir until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the pine nuts and rice, saute for 2 minutes, stirring to coat. Pour in just 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and lower the heat. Simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 10 minutes. Scrape the parboiled rice mixture into a bowl and add the dill and parsley; season with salt and pepper. Allow to cool. Now on to the grape leaves. Bring a big pot of water to a simmer. Blanch the grape leaves in the hot water for 5 minutes until pliable. Drain then trim the stems and any hard veins from the leaves. Pat dry with paper towels. To assemble the dolmades, lay a grape leaf on a work surface, shiny-side down. Put 2 tablespoons of the rice filling near the stem end of the leaf. Fold the stem end over the filling, then fold both sides toward the middle, and roll up into a cigar ? it should be snug but not overly tight because the rice will swell once it is fully cooked. Squeeze lightly in the palm of your hand to secure the roll. Repeat with remaining grape leaves and filling. Place the dolmades in a large Dutch oven or wide deep skillet, seam-side down in a single layer. Pour the remaining cup of broth, remaining olive oil, and the lemon juice over the dolmades, the liquid should reach halfway up the rolls, add some water if necessary. Cover the pan and simmer over low heat for 30 to 40 minutes, until the dolmades are tender when pierced with a fork. Serve warm, at room temperature or cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 74050,&quot;Grilled Cheese on Pump 4 tablespoons softened butter 8 slices pumpernickel bread 8 teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 large dill pickles, thinly sliced lengthwise 8 slices Emmentaler Swiss cheese, folded in 1/2 Instructions: Heat a skillet over medium heat.

Remove the pan from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Skim the foam from the top, and slowly pour into a container, discarding the milky solids in the bottom of pan. What makes clarified butter so great is its higher smoke point. This means you can cook meats and fish at a higher temperature than you can with regular butter, making it ideal for pan-frying. By clarifying the butter during a slow cooking process, you&#39;re able to strain out the milk solids that burn quickly as well as the water and salt. You&#39;ll lose about 1/4 of your original butter amount during the process, and the clarified butter will keep, tightly covered in the refrigerator for about 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74056,&quot;Black and White Frozen Shakes 1 cup chocolate syrup 2 pints vanilla ice cream 2 quarts skim milk 1 tray ice cubes Instructions: In a blender, for each shake, combine 3 squirts of chocolate syrup (about 1/4 cup) 1/2 pint vanilla ice cream (about 2 to 3 scoops), 2 cups skim milk and 4 ice cubes.

Line a standard muffin pan or cupcake pan with 12 cupcake liners. Mix the coffee extract into the brewed coffee. Set aside and allow to cool slightly. In a bowl of a stand mixer, sift together the flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt and mix to combine. Add the butter, vanilla and eggs and beat on medium speed until combined. Add half of the coffee and beat for 20 seconds. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the remaining coffee. Beat for another 20 seconds until the batter is smooth. Divide the batter among the cupcake liners, filling them three-quarter full. Bake until a tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Set the pan on a rack to cool. For the ganache: In a medium saucepan, bring the cream, corn syrup and granulated sugar to a boil over medium-low heat, whisking until the sugar is dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat and add the chocolate, whisking until the chocolate is melted. Add the coffee extract and whisk until smooth. Add the butter and whisk until smooth. Transfer the ganache to a bowl to cool. For the salted caramel coffee frosting: If using the espresso powder, mix the espresso powder and the vanilla together in a small bowl until dissolved and set aside. Using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the butter on medium-high speed until creamy. Add the caramel and beat until combined. Reduce the speed to low, add half of the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix until incorporated. Add the rest of the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix until combined. Add the coffee extract and vanilla (or the espresso powder and vanilla mixture) and continue to mix at medium-high speed until completely incorporated, scraping the sides as necessary. Whip the frosting until fluffy. If necessary, use 1 to 2 tablespoons milk to loosen the frosting. To assemble: Cut a small and shallow hole in each cupcake and fill with the ganache. Frost the cupcakes with the salted caramel coffee frosting and sprinkle with a few granules of fleur de sel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 74059,&quot;Le Tarte aux Poires Pastry, recipe follows 1/2 cup butter 1 cup superfine sugar, sifted 2 eggs 1/4 cup flour, sifted 1 1/4 cup ground almonds 2 tablespoons Kirsch 4 large firm pears, halved, peeled, cored, bottom and top removed, stored in lemon water to prevent discoloration 5 tablespoons apricot jam 2 teaspoons lemon juice 5/8 cup cold water 2 cups pastry flour, sifted 1/2 cup butter, cut into small cubes and chilled 2 tablespoons superfine sugar, sifted 1 egg, beaten Instructions: Roll out pastry to fit greased and floured 8-inch flan ring.

Score the fat on the belly and season both sides with salt and pepper. Make a bed in a roasting pan with the carrots and onions. Lay the pork belly on top, skin-side up. Pour over the cider and a cup of water. Cook 30 minutes to get the fat running. Stir together the honey and Dijon with a spoonful of water. Brush the mustard mixture onto the fat, and lower the heat to 325 degrees F. Continue cooking, basting occasionally with the honey, for 3 hours. An hour before the belly is done, start the lentils. Rinse the lentils in cold water, drain, and put in a saucepan with 1 1/2 cups water, the shallot, bay leaf and thyme. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer gently until tender, 30 to 40 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure no more water is needed. Drain the lentils, and season with salt, and pepper. Set aside to reheat later. Remove the belly from the oven when it&#39;s done, and transfer to a baking sheet. Return it to the oven at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes to crispen the skin. Meanwhile, drain the juices from the roasting pan into a measuring cup, reserving the vegetables and keeping them warm. Pour the fat off the juices, using some to moisten the lentils and saving the rest for another use. Deglaze the roasting pan with the vinegar and reduce to a glaze, then add the cooking juices and cook down for a minute or two. Reheat the lentils gently. Slice the belly and serve with the vegetables, and with the pork-fat moistened lentils. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 74063,&quot;Chocolate Glazed Marble Cupcakes 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s note) 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 cup chopped semisweet chocolate (not chips) 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat the eggs and sugar together in another medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and foamy, about 2 minutes. While beating, gradually pour in the butter and then the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add half the flour mixture, followed by the milk and the remaining flour mixture, beating until each addition is just incorporated. Remove one-third of the batter (about 1 cup) and stir in the cocoa powder. Alternate dropping spoonfuls of the batters into the cupcake liners, using a larger spoon for the yellow batter and a smaller spoon for the chocolate batter. Swirl with an offset spatula or a skewer. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes on a rack in the tin for 10 minutes, and then remove from the tin. Cool on the rack completely. Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just simmers. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit for 1 minute. Then gently stir until smooth and glossy. Cool the glaze slightly until thickened but not hard. Spread 1 tablespoon of glaze on top of each cupcake or dip the top of the cupcake in the glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 74064,&quot;Seaweed Risotto with Jumbo Lump Crabmeat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 1/3 cup chopped shallots in fine dice 3 cloves of garlic in fine dice 1 1/2 cups or so Arborio Rice 5 cups (reserving 1 cup) of hot Maine Coast Sea Vegetable stock (Dashi) 1 pound hand picked Jumbo Lump Crabmeat at room temperature (30 minutes) picked over for cartilage 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon 2 tablespoons of chopped chives Juice of 1/2 lemon 1/2 teaspoon plus of Nori granules with ginger, (Maine Coast Sea Vegetables) 4 tablespoons of Nori, Maine Coast Sea Vegetables cut in julienne Instructions: Preparation: Heat the oil in the cooker.

Mix together the paprika, chili powder and smoked sea salt. Slather each ear with the Roasted Poblano Mayo, and then dust in the Cotija, cilantro and seasoned salt. Roast the whole poblano over an open flame on your stove-top until all sides are charred black, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Let rest in a paper bag until cool, about 15 minutes. Peel off the charred skin, and then remove the stem, seeds and ribs. Mince the pepper. Stir together the minced poblano with the mayo, honey, cumin, garlic and some salt. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74066,&quot;Curried Cauliflower Fritters 1 cauliflower Flour, for dusting Vegetable oil 1 small piece potato, peeled, optional A small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked Sea salt 1 lemon 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 2 teaspoons black mustard seeds 2 to 3 dried red chiles 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 3/4 cups self-rising flour 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1 1/2 cups cold beer Sea salt Instructions: First make your batter. Smash up the cumin and mustard seeds, chiles and peppercorns in a pestle and mortar until you have a powder. Put the flour into a mixing bowl and stir in the ground spices and the turmeric. Pour in most of the beer and whisk gently. Check the consistency - you want it to be the thickness of heavy cream. If it&#39;s too thick, whisk in the rest of the beer. Don&#39;t worry too much about having little lumps in the batter, as they&#39;ll just become nice crunchy bits when you start frying. Season with sea salt and put aside. Trim the bottom of the stalk and break the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Slice up the stalk into 1-inch pieces - this way it will all cook at the same rate. Wash the cauliflower, drain it and pat dry with kitchen towels. Place the cauliflower pieces in a bowl and dust with a little flour. Pour the oil into a deep saucepan - you want it to be about 4 to 5 inches deep - and heat it to 350 degrees F. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer don&#39;t worry, just drop a piece of potato into the oil. When it floats to the surface and starts to sizzle, the oil will be at the right temperature so remove the potato from the pan. Shake any excess flour off the cauliflower. One by one, dip the pieces into the beer batter, then carefully place them in the hot oil, moving them away from you as you do so. Make sure you stand back so you don&#39;t get splashed. It&#39;s best to fry them in batches so you don&#39;t overcrowd the pan (but serve them as soon as each batch is ready). Each time a batch of cauliflower is nearly ready, add some battered parsley leaves to the pan and fry for 40 seconds (you want to serve them scattered over the fritters). Fry the pieces gently, turning them a couple of times with a slotted spoon.

In this case, cut the drumsticks off and make a stock with them, just as you would a chicken stock. Use in the recipe instead of chicken stock. With a clean kitchen towel or paper towel, pat the guinea thighs dry. Season them with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Dredge in the flour and pat off all excess flour. Meanwhile, heat a large (12-inch) saute pan over medium heat for one minute, and then add the olive oil. It should be hot but not smoking by the time you are done flouring the guinea thighs. Brown the thighs, skin side down first, adjusting the heat and adding more oil so that the meat sizzles at a nice pace. Cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, and then turn the meat and cook another minute or two to color the other side. If your pan is small, cook the thighs in two batches. Transfer the thighs to a plate. You will now need a 4-quart straight sided saute pan or an enameled cast-iron Dutch oven. This pan should be wide enough to have the thigh pieces fit in single layer and deep enough to hold at least 4 quarts of liquid (a stock pot will work in a pinch). Put this pan over medium-high heat. Add enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Add the pancetta and sweat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the onions and garlic and sweat for another five minutes or so, so that the onions are soft and translucent. Add the rosemary, sage, and a small pinch of pepper. (The pancetta should add enough salt to the sauce so don&#39;t worry about salting yet.) Sweat for one more minute. Add the wine, 4 cups of the stock, livers, capers, vinegar, and lemon juice. Add the reserved guinea thighs and bring the braise to a simmer. There should be well more liquid than is needed to cover the meat. This is a good thing, as this dish is all about having plenty of sauce and it will reduce as you cook it. Simmer until the guinea is fork-tender and the meat pulls away from the bone easily, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Carefully remove the thighs and reserve on a plate. Turn up the heat and boil the sauce, stirring from time to time to make sure it isn&#39;t sticking and burning, until it reduces by half. To thicken it slightly, use a blender to puree 1 cup of the reduced sauce and add it back to the pan. Stir and taste for seasoning. Add a couple drops of lemon juice if needed. Salt is probably not needed, but use your judgment for final seasoning. The dish can be made up to this point a day ahead. To finish, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the bread slices in a small baking dish that has been generously coated with olive oil. Ladle the remaining 1 cup of stock evenly over all of the bread. Set two thighs on each slice, skin side up. Toast in the oven until the bread has turned a crispy golden brown on the bottom, about 10 minutes; use a spatula to check and be careful as the toast tends to stick. Reheat the sauce. Remove the thighs from the toasts, and carefully remove the crostones from the pan and turn them over so that the brown side is up. To plate, set one slice of toast on each plate. Remove the thigh bone from the meat and place the meat from two thighs on each toast. Spoon some of the warmed sauce over each thigh and a little more to run off the crostone. Garnish with celery leaf (inner yellow leaves only), Italian parsley leaf, and long strips of lemon zest.

Add the chicken and toss to coat. Marinate at least 30 minutes, or in the refrigerator up to overnight. For the sauce: When you&#39;re ready to make the curry, place a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and butter. When the butter has melted, add the Ginger-Garlic Paste and serrano peppers. Saute until lightly browned around the edges. Add the tomato paste and cook until the tomato has darkened in color, about 3 minutes. Add the garam masala and the paprika and saute for about 1 minute to draw out their flavors. Add the tomatoes, salt, and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. You may need more water depending on how much liquid the tomatoes give off. Meanwhile, fire up your grill. When it is nice and hot, lightly brush it with oil. Place the chicken on the grill, shaking off some of the excess marinade. Cook until it&#39;s charred, about 2 minutes on each side. (Don&#39;t worry that the chicken will still be a little uncooked, it finishes cooking in the sauce). Pour the sauce into a blender or food processor, or use an immersion blender, and process until smooth. Pour back into the skillet and bring back up to a boil. Add the chicken and fenugreek leaves, if using. Take the heat down to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes. Add the cream and stir through. Garnish with minced fresh cilantro, and serve over rice, with naan, or a crusty piece of bread! Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste. Save what you don&#39;t use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It&#39;s a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 74109,&quot;Individual Chili-Cheddar Meatloaves Nonstick cooking spray ? small onion chopped ? green bell pepper chopped 1 small garlic clove, minced ? cup chili sauce or ketchup, divided 6 ounces Cabot? 50% Reduced Fat Jalapeno Cheddar, grated (about 1? cups) 6 ounces raw extra-lean ground beef 1 tablespoon maple syrup 1 teaspoon chili powder 6 crushed saltine crackers a dash of salt ? teaspoon black pepper Dash of Worcestershire sauce Dash of red pepper flakes 1 large egg, lightly beaten Instructions:</p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li><li>Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; place over medium heat.

Once it has rendered a few tablespoons of fat, increase the heat to medium and cook until the pork is a crisp golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cracklings to a small ovenproof dish; reserve.<br> Add the butter, onions, savory or thyme, and bay leaves to the fat in the pot and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the onions have softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Add the potatoes and stock. If the stock doesn&#39;t cover the potatoes, add a little water. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and boil the potatoes vigorously until they are soft on the outside but still firm in the center, about 10 minutes. If the stock hasn&#39;t thickened slightly, smash a few of the potato slices against the side of the pot and cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer.<br> Reduce the heat to low and season assertively with salt and pepper (you want to almost over season at this point in order to avoid having to stir once the fish is added). Add the fish fillets and cook over a low heat until the fish is almost done, 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the chowder to sit for 10 minutes (the fish will finish cooking during this time).<br> Gently stir in the cream and taste for salt and pepper. If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate (only cover the chowder after it has chilled completely). Otherwise, let it sit for up to an hour at room temperature, allowing the flavors to meld.<br> When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over a low heat; don&#39;t let it boil. Warm the cracklings in a low oven (220 degrees F) for a few minutes. Use a slotted spoon to mound the chunks of fish, the onions, and potatoes in the center of large soup plates or shallow bowls, ladle the creamy broth around and scatter the cracklings over top. Finish each serving with a sprinkling of chopped parsley and minced chives. Melt the butter in a heavy 7 to 8-quart stockpot over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, carrots, bay leaves, parsley, thyme, and peppercorns and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables become very soft without browning, about 8 minutes.<br> Place the fish head on the vegetables and stack the fish frames evenly on top. Pour in the wine, cover the pot tightly and let the bones sweat until they have turned completely white, 10 to 15 minutes. Add enough very hot or boiling water (approximately 2 quarts) to just barely cover the bones. Give the mixture a gentle stir and allow the brew to come to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, uncovered, carefully skimming off any white foam that comes to the surface (try to leave the herbs, spices and vegetables in the pot).<br> Remove the pot from the stove, stir the stock again and allow it to steep undisturbed for 10 minutes. Ladle through a fine-mesh strainer and season lightly with salt. If you are not going to be using the stock within the hour, chill it as quickly as possible. Cover the stock after it is thoroughly chilled (it will have a light jellied consistency) and keep refrigerated for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74111,&quot;Pan Roasted Muscovy Duck Breast with a Clementine - Tomatillo Sauce Served with Wild Rice Risotto 1 Muscovy whole duck breast, approximately 2 pounds Salt and freshly ground pepper Clementine and Tomatillo Sauce, recipe follows Wild Rice Risotto, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup rice wine vinegar 3 cups tangerine juice 3 cups orange juice 4 whole black peppercorns 1/4 cup water 6 cups chicken stock reduced to 2 cups 2 clementines, quartered and sliced 1/4-inch thick 2 tomatillos, quartered and sliced 1/4-inch thick 2 tablespoons ancho cl powder 1 tablespoon freshly grated horseradish Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 cups arborio rice 6 to 8 cups chicken stock 1 cup wild rice, cooked 2 tablespoons fresh thyme butter, procedure follows 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Set aside. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the beans, and cook until they are bright green and crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Strain, and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, pulse the tomatoes, chopped shallots, ginger, 1 tablespoon of the oil, sugar, curry, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor until it becomes a puree. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sliced shallots, and cook, stirring frequently, until a deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree, and cook, stirring and scraping up the bottom frequently, until the paste is thick, dry and a few shades darker, 15 to 20 minutes. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, if the paste sticks to the bottom of the pot. (Be sure to scrape the side of the pot down, as some cooked paste may cling to it, and you want to make sure all the paste makes it into the sauce there&#39;s flavor in there!) Add 2 cups of water and the coconut milk to the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the eggplant, and simmer until soft, about 6 minutes. Add the peppers, and cook until soft, about 6 minutes. (The sauce should be a bit looser than marinara; continue to gently simmer if necessary.) Add the shrimp and green beans, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are pink and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in most of the basil and cilantro, and season with salt. Transfer the curry to a serving bowl. Top with the lychees and the remaining basil and cilantro.

Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl. Add the yeast mixture to the flour and stir to make a shaggy dough. (The dough should be tacky. If it feels too wet and sticky, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time; if it&#39;s too stiff, add a little water.) Transfer to a lightly oiled surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 3 minutes. Place an inverted bowl over the dough and let rise slightly, 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and form each into a ball; arrange 3 inches apart on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Rub the tops of the dough lightly with olive oil and cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 2 hours before baking; let sit, covered, until ready to use. One hour before baking, put a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 500 degrees F (or 550 degrees F if your oven goes that high). Make the sauce: Combine the tomatoes and their juices with 1 teaspoon salt in a blender; blend until smooth. Generously sprinkle a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet with cornmeal. Place 1 ball of dough upside down on the cornmeal using floured hands. Gently pull the dough into an 8- to 10-inch circle, reflouring your hands as needed and being careful not to deflate the dough. Spread about 1/4 cup tomato sauce on the crust; top with one-quarter of the mozzarella. Drizzle with 1 to 2 teaspoons olive oil and season with salt. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone and bake until the crust is dark golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and sprinkle with basil. Let cool 2 minutes before slicing.

Add the turkey and let it brine in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. To prepare the turkey for cooking: Remove the turkey from the brine the night before roasting and pat it thoroughly dry with paper towels. Combine the rosemary, sage, and butter for the herb crust in a small bowl. Season, to taste, with kosher salt. Work the butter under the skin of the turkey and massage it into the breasts and the legs. Massage the butter on the outside of the skin as well. Tie the legs together over the breast so they will protect it during cooking and help keep it moist and juicy. Gravy preparation: Put the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, apples, bay leaves, cinnamon stick and thyme in a roasting pan and season with salt. Arrange the turkey on top of the veggies and refrigerate overnight UNCOVERED! Yes, that&#39;s right, uncovered. This will help the skin dry out and become really brown and crispy. Make sure that there is no raw food near the turkey in the refrigerator. After refrigerating overnight, the turkey is ready to go in the oven. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Put 2 cups chicken stock and 1 cup apple cider in the bottom of the roasting pan. Roast the turkey in the preheated oven until the skin gets really nice and brown, about 40 minutes. Lower the oven heat to 350 degrees F for the remainder of the cooking time. Baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so and add more stock to the roasting pan, if needed. Cook about 17 minutes per pound. Once it gets to the proper color, tent the turkey with aluminum foil to prevent it from getting too dark. Remove the turkey from the oven when an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the turkey registers 160 degrees F. Make sure that the thermometer is not touching a bone when doing the reading. When the turkey has reached the proper temperature, remove it from the roasting pan to a cutting board and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil. Strain all the veggies over a bowl to separate them from the stock/mixture. Discard the veggies. Skim off the fat and add it to the roasting pan. This is the fat for the roux. Put the roasting pan over 2 burners and over a low heat and whisk in the flour. Cook until the mixture looks like wet sand, about 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in the remaining 1 cup apple cider, remaining chicken stock and the stock/cider mixture. Cook until the mixture has thickened and reached a gravy consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Pour into a serving pitcher or bowl. Carve the turkey, transfer to a serving platter and serve with the gravy.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 74149,&quot;Cherry Peach Pantry Galette 1 round refrigerated pie crust 1 pound sliced frozen peaches, thawed and well drained<br> 12 ounces frozen sour cherries, thawed and well drained<br> 3 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 large egg<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet or large rimmed baking pan with parchment paper and lay the round of pie crust on top. Toss the peaches and cherries with the cornstarch, vanilla, cinnamon and 1/3 cup sugar in a bowl until well combined. Mound the fruit mixture in the center of the dough round and spread slightly, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border. Fold the edges over the fruit, pleating as necessary. Whisk the egg and mix with a tablespoon of water. Using a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on the exposed crust. Sprinkle the remaining tablespoon sugar over the top of the fruit. Bake until the crust is golden brown all over and the fruit juices are thick and bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool slightly and serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Moscato, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 74150,&quot;Beef Shepherd&#39;s Pie 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 medium onion, diced 3 medium carrots, peeled and thinly sliced 1 rib celery, thinly sliced 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, quartered 2 cloves garlic, minced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 teaspoon dried oregano 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 pound ground beef 1/2 cup canned low sodium beef broth 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 4 cups Mashed Potatoes, recipe follows 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, optional 3/4 cup whole milk 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled quartered Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br> Instructions: Heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, mushrooms, garlic, half the salt, and oregano. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook until mushrooms are soft and tomato paste has turned brick red, about 8 minutes more. Stir in the beef, the broth, the remaining salt, the Worcestershire, and some pepper, breaking up any large clumps of meat, cook until the meat is no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Transfer the meat and vegetables to a 2-quart oval casserole dish and spread the mashed potatoes over the top, leaving a 1/4-inch boarder around the edge. Make a decorative pattern on the top of the potatoes, if desired. Sprinkle with cheese, if using, and dot with the remaining tablespoon of butter. Bake until potatoes brown and the juices bubble around the edge, about 40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Put the potatoes in a saucepan with cold water to cover by about 1-inch and add the salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes. At the same time, combine the milk and butter in a small saucepan and warm over low heat until the butter is melted. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Drain the potatoes and return to the saucepan. Toss the potatoes over medium heat until dry. Add the heated milk mixture and mash the potatoes until just slightly chunky, then stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 74151,&quot;Roasted Garlic Soup with Asiago Crostini 6 large heads garlic Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 4 cups chicken stock 1 tablespoon dried Italian seasoning 1/4 cup heavy cream Chopped fresh parsley, for topping For the crostini: 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced Freshly ground pepper 1/2 teaspoon hot Hungarian paprika 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed 1 sourdough baguette, sliced 1 inch thick on the diagonal 1/2 cup shredded asiago cheese Instructions: Make the soup: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut the tops off the garlic heads to expose the cloves and remove any excess papery skins. Place on a large sheet of foil; drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Close the foil around the garlic, leaving a space between the tops and the foil, and place on a baking sheet. Roast until soft and fragrant, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove from the foil, let cool and squeeze out the garlic into a bowl. In a large heavy soup pot (preferably enameled cast iron) over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the roasted garlic and cook, stirring, until slightly thick, about 5 minutes. Add the flour and cook until a dark golden roux forms, stirring frequently, 5 to 6 more minutes. Add 1 cup chicken stock and stir to incorporate, then repeat until all of the stock has been added. Add 2 cups water in 1-cup increments, stirring after each. Add the Italian seasoning, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, and stir to combine well. Bring to a simmer and cook 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the crostini: Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, the paprika and oregano and mix well. Place the bread on a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush with the oil-spice mixture. Top each slice with about 1 teaspoon cheese and bake until the cheese is melted and the bread is starting to crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the cream to the soup and cook at a very low simmer, stirring occasionally, 10 more minutes. Adjust the seasoning if needed. Ladle into small mugs or bowls; top with parsley and drizzle with olive oil. Serve with the crostini. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</li></ol><p>&quot; 74152,&quot;Gingerbread Reindeer 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 tablespoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces, at room temperature 1/4 cup molasses 1 large egg One 1-pound box confectioners&#39; sugar 5 tablespoons meringue powder Black gel food coloring Brown gel food coloring 18 red cinnamon candies Instructions: Whisk together the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, allspice, nutmeg, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl until well blended. Beat the granulated sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl starting on low speed and increasing to medium, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the molasses until combined, then beat in the egg (the mixture will look curdled). Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture a little at a time until the mixture comes together. Then increase the speed to medium and beat until well incorporated and a sticky dough forms. Divide the dough in half, flatten into 2 disks and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Keeping one disk refrigerated, roll the other disk on a well-floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch, sprinkling flour on and under the dough as needed and sliding a spatula underneath every so often to prevent sticking. If the dough looks crackly or breaks apart, press it back together from the outside edge in. With a 4-inch gingerbread man cookie cutter, cut out cookies as close together as possible. Pull away the extra dough around each shape and use a small spatula to transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Gather together the scraps, leaving behind the excess flour, knead a few times to form a smooth dough again and reroll in the same way. (If there are any pieces of stuck dough on your surface, scrape them away with a spatula, flour the surface again and then continue to roll the dough.) Bake the cookies in the center of the oven racks, rotating them from top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until slightly firm to the touch but not brown, about 12 minutes. Cool the cookies 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely before icing. The cookies will continue to firm as they cool. Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Meanwhile, make the royal icing for decorating. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 6 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on low until the icing thickens. The icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. (If overbeaten, it will get aerated, which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the icing sit for a bit to settle, then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth it out.) Spoon about 1/3 cup of icing into each of 3 separate bowls (cover any remaining icing with plastic wrap and reserve in case you need more). Leave 1 bowl white. Dye the second bowl black and the third light brown. Thin out the light brown icing with 1 teaspoon water. Transfer the icing to separate resealable plastic bags. Snip a very tiny hole in the corner of the white and black icing bags, and snip a larger hole in the corner of the light brown icing bag. Place each cookie right side up in front of you. With the black icing, pipe an outline around the head of each cookie, around the arms and across the chest with a bowed line. Turn the gingerbread man upside down so it is standing on its head; now you can see the shape of the reindeer&#39;s head. Pipe black antlers coming out of the top of the head, over the gingerbread man&#39;s legs and feet. Using the loose light brown icing, flood each reindeer&#39;s head, using a toothpick to nudge the icing into any tight spots. Place a red cinnamon candy in the center of each face for the nose. Dry until set, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Once the brown base has dried, pipe on the rest of the face. Pipe 2 white dots above the nose for the whites of the eyes, and 2 white dots on the underside of the ears for downy fur. Use the black icing to pipe a smiling mouth and eyebrows. Once the white icing has slightly dried, pipe in black pupils. Give your reindeer some personality! Let the icing dry until hardened, 1 hour or ideally overnight. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days, but are best eaten fresh. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74153,&quot;Cuke-with-a-Kick Finger Sandwiches 1 cucumber 4 tablespoons butter, at room temperature 2 scallions, minced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon red horseradish (or white if you can&#39;t find red) Large pinch salt Several grinds of black pepper 10 slices very thin white bread (recommended: Pepperidge Farm) Instructions: Peel the cucumber and slice it very, very thin. Lay the cucumber slices out on a sheet of paper towel and cover them with a second sheet. Let stand until the paper towels soak up the cucumber slices&#39; liquid, about 15 minutes.

Make the super sauce: Stir together the ketchup, maple syrup, hot sauce, soy sauce and vinegar. Using a chef?s knife, mash the garlic to a paste with 1/4 teaspoon salt and stir into the sauce. Lightly sprinkle the salmon with salt and pepper. Brush half of the sauce on the salmon. Grill, flipping once and brushing the salmon with the remaining sauce, until grill marks appear and the fish is just cooked through, about 6 minutes. Toss the scallions with the oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a couple turns of pepper. Grill, flipping once, until charred and slightly wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve the salmon with the scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74156,&quot;Sweet Bread with Pineapple Jam Half a 1-pound pineapple, cored and finely chopped (juice reserved) 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar 1/2 cup golden raisins 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 small cinnamon stick 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 1 cup plain white cornmeal 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup boiling water 1 cup whole milk 2 large eggs Instructions: Make the jam.

Rub the pork all over with the mustard, then the spice rub. (You may not need all of the rub.) Soak the wood chips in water at least 30 minutes; drain. Heat a charcoal grill and prepare for indirect grilling: Bank the coals to one side, leaving the other side empty. Set up a drip pan on the empty side. Let the fire burn down to a low heat (225 degrees F to 250 degrees F). Scatter some of the wood chips over the hot coals. Put the pork on the cooler side of the grill, over the drip pan, fat side facing the heat. Cover and cook until a thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 160 degrees F, 5 to 6 hours, adding a handful of wood chips every 1 to 1 1/2 hours and more charcoal as needed. Meanwhile, make the barbecue sauce: Combine the vinegar, brown sugar, ketchup, hot sauce, red pepper flakes and 2 teaspoons each salt and pepper in a nonreactive pot. Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use. Remove the pork from the grill, wrap in foil and return to the cooler side of the grill. Cover the grill and cook until a thermometer inserted into the center of the pork registers 195 degrees F to 200 degrees F, 3 to 5 more hours, adding more charcoal as needed. Remove the pork from the grill and let rest 30 minutes. Carefully unwrap and pour off any juices. Pull the meat into chunks, discarding the excess fat and bone.

Place the potatoes in a large saucepan of cold, salted water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. When the water boils, lower the heat to medium and simmer the potatoes until they&#39;re fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes. For the venison: Season both sides of the venison tenderloins with salt and pepper. Heat a large saute pan over high heat and add the oil. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the tenderloins. Reduce the heat to medium and sear the tenderloins on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the loins from the pan and let rest until ready to serve. For the potatoes: Drain the potatoes well and transfer to a bowl. Mash the potatoes until there are no lumps. Stir in the butter, nutmeg, cream, salt, and white pepper. Stir until creamy, adding more cream if needed. You want smooth, creamy potatoes. Taste and season with more salt and white pepper, if needed.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a small saucepan, combine the half-and half, vanilla bean, and vanilla extract. Heat over medium heat just until scalded; do not allow the mixture to boil. Fill a large bowl with water and add ice. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the egg, egg yolks, and granulated sugar and mix. Gradually stir in the scalded half-and-half mixture and place the smaller bowl in the bowl of ice water to cool completely. Stir in the heavy cream and top equally the cranberry prepped ramekins. Place in a baking dish just large enough to hold them and add enough hot water to the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the baking dish tightly with foil and bake until the custard is set but still quivers in the center, about 35 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the water and refrigerate to cool completely.

Transfer 1/4 cup of the mixture to a zip-top bag holding the chicken. Seal the bag and massage the marinade into the chicken. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Reserve the remaining mixture to make the gochujang glaze (refrigerate if the chicken is marinating overnight). In a large Dutch oven, heat the oil until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees F. In a pie dish or shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk. In a separate pie dish or shallow bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and self-rising flour. Mix 3 tablespoons of the buttermilk-egg mixture into the flour mixture; lightly whisk to work the buttermilk into the dredge to create little crispy, craggily bits. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Dunk the chicken first in the buttermilk-egg mixture, then dredge in the flour mixture to coat thoroughly. Working in batches if necessary, gently drop the chicken into the oil. Cook until the internal temperature of the chicken is 160 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes. (With the carryover time, it should go up to 165 degrees F.) For the ginger mayo: Whisk the mayo, ginger, soy sauce and vinegar together. To serve: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk the butter into the bowl of the reserved marinade until smooth. Spread each bun top with the ginger mayo. Top with some kimchi. Toss the chicken in the glaze and place on the bun bottoms. Sprinkle the chicken with sesame seeds. Close the sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 74195,&quot;Avocado Roast Corn Nachos 1-ounce olive oil 8 ounces red onion, peeled and sliced 2 cloves garlic, minced 4 avocados, peeled and diced 1/2-ounce cilantro, chopped 1 jalapeno pepper, stemmed, cored, diced small 4 ounces roasted corn kernels (roasted on the cob) 4 ounces black beans, cooked, drained 1 ounce fresh lime juice fresh 1 teaspoon kosher salt 12 corn tortillas, cut in 2-inch round pieces 2 ounces queso cotija, grated Instructions: On a sheet pan lay out red onions rings and coat with olive oil.

Put prawns in a shallow, non-aluminum baking dish. In a small bowl, whisk together citrus oil, onion, garlic, cilantro, and lemon juice. Pour over prawns, cover, and let marinate, refrigerated, 1 to 4 hours. Preheat grill or broiler. When ready to cook, thread prawns on skewers and discard marinade. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and grill or broil, turning once, until just done, 2 to 3 minutes. Shrimp can be served warm or at room temperature. They are delicious on their own or with Citrus Aioli. Cook&#39;s Note: Leaving the shells on the prawns protects them from drying out during cooking. This method works so well that I use it often when preparing shrimp or prawns for salads, pasta, pizza, and sandwiches. Simply reduce the cooking time if they will later be cooked more, for instance as part of a sauce or pizza topping. Peel shrimp after they come off the grill. 2 cloves garlic Coarse salt 1 cup prepared mayonnaise 2 lemons, zested 1 lemon, juiced Freshly ground black pepper Using a mortar and pestle, or on a cutting board, finely mash the garlic cloves with a pinch of salt.

Heat a wide saucepan, add a splash of oil and a knob of butter, and when you hear a gentle sizzling add the sliced garlic, thyme leaves and leeks. Move the leeks around so every piece gets coated. Pour in the wine, season with pepper and stir in the stock. Cover the leeks with the slices of Parma ham, place a lid on the pan and cook gently for 25 to 30 minutes. Once the leeks are tender, take the pan off the heat. Whiz the mushrooms and bread with a pinch of salt and pepper in a food processor until the mixture looks like bread crumbs. Heat a generous glug of olive oil in a frying pan. Add the garlic cloves and the rosemary and cook for a minute, then fry the bread crumbs in the oil until golden and crisp. Keep shaking the pan - don&#39;t let the bread crumbs catch on the bottom. Drain on paper towels, discard the rosemary and garlic and allow the bread crumbs to cool. Bring a big pan of salted water to the boil. Lay the lasagne sheets on a clean working surface and sprinkle with a little flour. Place the sheets on top of each other and slice into 1/2-inch strips. Toss through your fingers to shake out the pappardelle, then cook in the boiling water 2 minutes or until al dente. Remove the Parma ham from the saucepan, slice up and stir back into the leeks. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then stir in the Parmesan and the rest of the butter. Drain the pasta, reserving a little of the cooking water, and add the pasta to the leeks. Add a little of the cooking water if need be, to give you a silky, smooth sauce. Serve quickly, sprinkled with some pangrattato, extra Parmesan and any leftover thyme tips. Serve the rest of the pangrattato in a bowl on the side. \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Put the kosher salt in a large bowl and slowly (and carefully!) pour the boiling water over the salt. Stir to blend. Add the molasses, honey, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, sage, thyme and garlic to the salt and water mixture. Stir to blend. Add the remaining 3 quarts of cool water. Add the ice to a cooler or bucket large enough to hold the brine and the turkey. Pour the brine over the ice and use a large whisk to blend all of the ingredients. Submerge the turkey, breast side down, in the brine. Make sure the cavity of the bird fills with the liquid as you are submerging it. Cover the cooler and allow the bird to sit in the brine overnight or for about 12 hours. Remove the bird from the brine and dry it thoroughly with thick (absorbent) kitchen towels. Take care to wipe inside the cavity as well. Discard the brine. Whisk together the butter and the lemon zest. Gently lift the skin covering 1 breast of the turkey and spread half of the butter right on the meat under the skin. Repeat with the other breast. The butter will add extra moisture and richness as the bird roasts. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the turkey in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Put on the lower rack of the oven and roast until the internal temperature of the turkey taken from the thickest part of the thigh reads 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove the turkey from the oven to a cutting board or serving platter and tent with foil. Allow to rest for 15 minutes before carving and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 74204,&quot;Sous Vide Pork Chop 4 ounces brown sugar 2 ounces ground cumin 2 ounces granulated garlic 2 ounces dry oregano 2 ounces smoked paprika 2 ounces ground black pepper 2 ounces kosher salt 1 pound butter, at room temperature 2 ounces garlic, chopped 2 ounces shallots, chopped 1 ounce dry parsley 4 tea bags 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1 1/2 pounds red potatoes Kosher salt and ground black pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts 3 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and ground black pepper Three 16-ounce bone-in pork chops 3 ounces fresh rosemary sprigs Kosher salt and ground black pepper 6 ounces olive oil 18 ounces Pineapple Curry Chutney, recipe follows 3 ounces extra-virgin olive oil 10 cloves garlic, tops trimmed 1 yellow onion, medium dice 1 red bell pepper, medium dice 1 poblano pepper, medium dice 8 ounces rice wine vinegar 6 ounces canned pineapple juice 10 ounces brown sugar 1 ounce fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped 1 pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into small chunks Instructions: For the dry rub: Combine the brown sugar, cumin, granulated garlic, oregano, smoked paprika, pepper and salt in a bowl and mix well.

Sprinkle the chicken generously with salt and add to the pan, skin-side down, in an even layer. Brown the chicken well on both sides. Once the chicken is brown on all sides, remove it from the pan and reserve. Drain the oil from the pan and return it to the heat. Coat the pan lightly with new olive oil. Add the sausage to the pan that the chicken was browned in. Brown the sausage well. Add the onions and season with salt. Cook the onions over medium heat until they are translucent and very aromatic, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Add the cherry pepper juice and wine to the pan and reduce it by half. While the wine is reducing, scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Return the chicken, skin-side up, to the pan and add the chicken stock and cherry peppers. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer for 5 more minutes; add more chicken stock if the stock has reduced too much. Stir in the oregano just before serving. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.

Once all of the polenta has been incorporated, reduce the heat to medium and immediately switch over to stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook the polenta for 5 minutes over medium, medium-low, adding water if the polenta becomes too thick to loosen it up. When the polenta is thoroughly cooked, it should look creamy and not feel gritty on your tongue. Remove it from the heat and stir in the Parmigiano and mascarpone. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve immediately, or place a sheet of plastic wrap right on the surface of the polenta to prevent a skin from forming on the top. To reheat, add a little water to the polenta and heat over low to medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 74209,&quot;Yellowtail Ceviche 8 ounces yellowtail, medium diced 1 tablespoon diced red pepper 1 diced yellow pepper 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves 1 jalapeno, minced 2 limes, juiced 1 tablespoon coconut milk 1 shallot, minced 1/2 cucumber, hollowed into 4 serving cups Instructions: Mix all ingredients except for cucumber and let marinate for 10 minutes.

Cover with 1 to 2 inches cold water and season generously with salt; the water should taste like the sea. Bring the pot of water to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and garlic well and pass through a food mill or ricer. DO NOT use a food processor or blender; it will result in a very sticky and rubbery end product. While passing the potatoes, bring the heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan and remove from the heat. While the potatoes are still hot, add one-third of the cream and the butter and stir vigorously into the potatoes. Repeat this process with the remaining cream until you achieve a velvety and smooth consistency. Taste the potatoes for seasoning and add salt if needed.

In another bowl, mix together 1/2 cup water with the cl powder, fennel powder, garam masala, ginger powder and turmeric. Add this mixture to the saucepan. Saute until you see the oil bubbling up, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the yogurt and stir well for about 2 minutes. Add 2 to 3 cups water. Cover the pan and simmer on medium-low heat until the lamb is tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the fenugreek leaves. Allow it to settle down, covered, for about 20 minutes. When ready to serve, spoon the curry out into bowls. Garnish with the cilantro and serve with a side of basmati rice, chapati or naan. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Malbec, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 74234,&quot;Toasted Sesame Santa Hats 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick; 57 grams) unsalted butter, softened 1/3 cup (75 grams) granulated sugar 2 tablespoons (35 grams) tahini 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 2 large egg yolks 1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup (60 grams) sesame seeds (toasted or untoasted), optional 5 large egg whites 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup (106 grams) halvah 10 ounces ruby chocolate (either a bar broken into pieces or chips) or one 10-ounce package dark chocolate chips (72%) 1 tablespoon (22 grams) refined coconut oil White dragees, for topping Instructions: To make the cookies: Cream together the butter, sugar, tahini and sesame oil in a medium bowl with a hand mixer until light and pale, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the egg yolks, mixing until fully combined. Scrape the sides of the bowl, then add the flour and salt. Mix just until a stiff dough forms. Turn out onto a piece of parchment paper and form a log that is 1 1/2 inches in diameter. If using the sesame seeds, pour them onto a plate and roll the log of dough in the seeds, pressing gently so they adhere. Tightly wrap the log of dough and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Place a rack in the upper third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice the dough into 1/4-inch-thick rounds, rotating the log as you cut the cookies to keep them as round as possible. Place the dough onto the prepared baking sheet 1 inch apart (you should be able to fit 24 rounds of dough). Bake until puffed and set; begin checking at 11 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on the pan for 2 to 3 minutes before placing on a wire rack to cool. To make the meringue: In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Place the bowl over a pot of barely simmering water over medium heat. Allow to heat gently while whisking the mixture continuously. Continue to do this for about 10 minutes, or until the mixture is frothy and warm to the touch and registers 150 to 155 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Attach the bowl to the mixer with the whisk attachment and beat until the bowl is cool and the meringue is thick and shiny and stiff peaks form, at least 10 minutes. Add the vanilla, mix to combine and then transfer the meringue to a large pastry bag fitted with a wide round tip. Arrange all of the cookies in a single layer on a baking sheet that will fit in your freezer. Onto the center of each cookie, pipe a small dollop of meringue in the center, then place a 1/2 teaspoon-size nugget of halvah on top of the meringue to \\u201cglue,\\u201d it down. Pipe meringue around the perimeter of each cookie and then continue to apply in a snowman-like blob (with a round bottom, smaller middle and a tiny top) that is 2 inches high. Freeze for at least an hour or until the meringue feels firm. To make the chocolate coating: In a medium mixing bowl, add the chocolate and coconut oil. Set the bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water over medium heat. Heat until the chocolate is fully melted. Remove from the heat and cool. Working quickly, remove the cookies from the freezer. Dip the meringue portion of the cookies in the chocolate coating and return to the tray to set. Decorate with spots of white dragees. Store in an airtight container in either the fridge for up to a week or the freezer for a month or longer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74235,&quot;Cream of Celery Soup 2 cups chopped celery, divided 2 cups chopped carrots, divided 4 tablespoons butter 2 cups onions, diced 3 tablespoons flour 6 cups hot vegetable broth, divided Salt and pepper to taste 1 cup heavy cream Instructions: In a small saucepan add 1 cup celery, 1 cup carrots, 1 cup vegetable broth.

Whisk together the orange juice, 1/2 cup water, honey and vanilla bean pod and seeds in a medium ovenproof skillet. Arrange the pineapple in the skillet. (It&#39;s OK if the skillet seems overcrowded; the pineapple will shrink as it cooks.) Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook until the pineapple is tender and the juices are reduced to a loose syrup and very bubbly, 12 to 15 minutes. While the pineapple cooks, pulse the flour and sugar in a food processor until combined. Add the butter, and pulse until the mixture is crumbly and moist. Add the egg, and process until the batter is combined and thick. Drop the batter in small mounds all over the pineapple, and roughly spread out with the back of a spoon. (It&#39;s OK if the pineapple isn&#39;t completely covered; the cake will spread as it bakes to cover.) Bake until the cake is golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Set aside the puree. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the carrots, garlic, onions and celery to the Dutch oven. Cook until the vegetables caramelize, about 15 minutes. Deglaze the pot with the red wine, and then add the tomatoes, beef broth, hominy and reserved pasilla cl puree. Bring the whole mixture to a simmer. Start adding all the browned short ribs back into the pan. Cover and cook until the short ribs barely start falling off the bone, about 1 hour 30 minutes.

Add the onions and potatoes and cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots and mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender and have released their moisture, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 45 to 60 seconds. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the warmed chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until thick and bubbly, about 7 minutes. Add the chicken meat and tarragon; taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Transfer the chicken mixture to a large casserole dish; set aside to cool slightly.<br> Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the pie crust dough from the refrigerator. Dust a clean surface lightly with flour and roll the dough out to form a 12- by 8-inch rectangle, about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to the top of the casserole dish. Press the dough onto the sides of the dish to seal the edges. Using a paring knife, cut several slits in the top of the crust to allow steam to escape while baking. Bake until golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Add the butter and vegetable shortening and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal, 8 to 10 seconds. Add enough of the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing between additions, until the dough holds together without being sticky or crumbly. Remove the dough from the processor and shape it into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap. Chill until firm and the moisture has distributed evenly, about 30 minutes.<br> Dust a clean work surface and a rolling pin with flour. Place the disk of dough in the center of the floured surface. Starting in the center of the dough, roll to, but not over, the upper edge of the dough. Return to the center, and roll down to, but not over, the lower edge. Lift the dough, give it a quarter turn and lay it on the work surface. Continue rolling, repeating the quarter turns, until you have a disk about 1/8 inch thick. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until ready for use.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74281,&quot;BBQ Pork Panini Sandwich 3/4 cup white sugar 1 1/2 cups paprika 3 3/4 tablespoons onion powder 3 pound roast pork loin 4 tablespoon butter, room temperature 1 clove garlic, minced 4 French style sandwich rolls, sliced horizontally Dill pickle slices 1/4 pound sliced colby Cheddar cheese 1/2 cup barbecue sauce Instructions: For the dry rub: Mix the rub ingredients together in a bowl.

Sprinkle the breast with salt and pepper. Place the cooked spinach down in a thin layer along the center the breast. Then top with a row of Onion Petals, followed by a row of cranberries in the center of the breast. Fold the duck breast meat over onto itself to form a roll. Place 4 lengthwise overlapping slices of bacon on the work surface and place 2 slices perpendicular to the 4 slices so they overlap by 1-inch to form a cross. Place the duck breast in the center, parallel to the 2 bacon slices, fold the bacon over the duck, and then roll it up to make a neat package. Repeat with the remaining duck breasts. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large ovenproof saute pan. Carefully place the bacon wrapped duck breast in the pan and cook on all sides for about 6 minutes to render and brown the bacon. Drain off most of the fat from the pan and put into the oven to finish the cooking, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and let the duck breast rest for 5 to 8 minutes before slicing. Slice each duck breast into 4 even slices. Place the sliced duck breast on the plate with the Cranberry Duck Sausage. Drizzle with the Cranberry Maple Syrup. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over high heat. Carefully place the onions in the pan cut-side down. Cook until golden brown, 2 minutes on each side. Add the butter and continue to cook the onions in the foaming butter for about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken stock and place the pan in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. In a large mixing bowl, add the ground duck meat, sun-dried cranberries and thyme, and mix well. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the sausage mixture into a piping bag. Find the end of the casing and slip it over the end of the piping bag and push the casing over the tip of the piping bag so that it forms an accordion-like pleat. Keep the casing wet throughout this process (keep dipping your hands in warm water). Applying pressure to the piping bag with one hand, stuff the casing with the sausage. As a sausage is formed, make links by twisting the sausage, and then pipe again. Regulate the flow of the sausage into the casing by applying different amounts of pressure to the piping bag. This will determine how tightly packed the sausage is; if you try and pack the sausage too tightly the casing will burst. If the casing does burst, tie it off at that point and start again.<br> In a cast-iron skillet over medium heat, add the oil and sausages. Cook evenly on all sides until golden brown, about 6 minutes. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the maple syrup, cranberries and vanilla bean and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let steep for 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 74285,&quot;Tomato and Grilled Corn Salad with Almond Vinaigrette 2 tablespoons sliced almonds 2 teaspoons harissa paste 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar 2 shallots, thinly sliced Juice of 1 lime 1 cup grilled corn kernels 2 tablespoons torn fresh mint leaves 2 tablespoons torn fresh Italian parsley 1 tablespoon capers, rinsed 1 jalapeno, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon salt Freshly ground pepper 6 heirloom tomatoes, roughly chopped (about 2 1/2 pounds) 1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese Instructions: For the vinaigrette: Combine the almonds, harissa and garlic in a small saute pan over medium heat and saute for 3 minutes.

Add the tomatillos, jalape?o and sliced onions and cook, turning occasionally, until softened and blistered on all sides but not completely charred, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the pan and wipe out any charred pieces that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan; reserve the pan. Coarsely chop the tomatillos, jalape?o and onions and add to a blender along with half of the garlic, the cilantro leaves and the zest and juice of 2 limes. Blend the sauce until smooth. Season with salt. Heat a large saute pan with the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the diced onions and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the other half of the garlic and the cilantro stems and saute until slightly softened and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chorizo and break it up with a spoon. Cook until browned, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and allow to cool slightly. Add the black beans, pepper jack cheese, 1 egg and salt to taste. Mix to combine. Place the poblanos on an open flame on your stovetop. Cook, flipping occasionally, until completely black and charred, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to steam until the skin pulls away, about 10 minutes. (If you don&#39;t have a gas stovetop, you can broil the pepper in the oven on high, turning occasionally, until charred.) Remove the skin from the pepper and wipe off any excess black char. Make a small slit lengthwise down the center of one side of the poblanos, being careful not to cut all the way through. Remove the seeds and ribs. Stuff each pepper with some of the filling, being careful not to overfill the peppers or else they will burst while frying. Close up the pepper by securing it with toothpicks. Separate the remaining 2 eggs into two large bowls. Add a pinch of salt into each bowl. Whip the egg whites with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat the egg yolks for about 30 seconds until well incorporated, then pour the yolks into the bowl with the egg whites and continue to beat until combined for another minute. To a third bowl, add the flour. Dip the stuffed poblanos into the egg mixture first, and then into the flour. If you feel like the stuffed poblano is not well coated, you can do a double dredge. Fill the reserved cast-iron pan with 2 inches of canola oil. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers. Test the oil with a little flour and, if it sizzles, it&#39;s ready. Gently lay a dredged poblano into the oil and fry on the first side until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, then fry for another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate, season immediately with salt and allow to drain. Transfer to a sheet tray lined with a rack so they don&#39;t get soggy. Remove the toothpicks before serving. Mix together the crema and juice and zest of the remaining lime in a small bowl. Set aside. To serve, spoon some of the green cl sauce onto the bottom of the plate. Lay the fried poblano over the top of the sauce. Garnish with the cotija cheese. Spoon some of the lime crema alongside the fried cl. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Barbera, Grenache]&quot; 74288,&quot;Gingerbread Cake Softened unsalted butter, as needed 1 cup vegetable oil, like soy, peanut, or corn 1 cup sugar 1 cup unsulphured molasses 1 to 2 tablespoons minced crystallized ginger 2 large eggs, at room temperature, lightly beaten with a fork 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon ground ginger 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1 cup water 1 tablespoon baking soda Serving suggestions: Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream Instructions: Lightly butter a 9 by 13 by 2-inch cake pan and line the bottom with a piece of parchment or wax paper.

Grease with butter and dust with flour three 9- or 10-inch round cake pans. In a medium bowl, whisk the flours, sugar, salt, spices and baking soda. In a big bowl, whisk the oil, eggs, egg yolks, buttermilk, vanilla, pineapple and bananas really well. Add the flour mixture into the wet mixture and whisk gently until there are no lumps. Fold in 3/4 cup of the pecans. Divide the batter among the pans, scraping all the batter from the bowl with a rubber spatula. Bake for 35 to 50 minutes, depending on your oven. Be advised: This is a dense, moist cake and you&#39;ll be tempted to overbake it. Try not to. Once you start seeing color on top, keep pressing the top of the cake. When it&#39;s firm, it&#39;s done. Turn out the cake layers onto a wire rack and let them cool completely. Frost with cream cheese frosting and garnish with the remaining 3/4 cup pecans and--if you&#39;re feeling very Southern--sliced maraschino cherries. You can even brulee some pineapple slices for the top of the cake. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine all the ingredients. Whip on low speed for a while. When the sugar is incorporated, turn the mixer speed up and beat until smooth, scraping the sides of the bowl often. To spread, use the frosting at room temperature, but store it covered in the fridge. Rewhip cold frosting before using it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 74291,&quot;Passion Banana Dacquoise 1/4 cup plus 2 1/4 teaspoons almond flour 2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon cake flour 1/4 cup egg whites 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar Shredded, sweet coconut Powdered sugar 2 egg yolks 1/4 teaspoon vanilla 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons sugar 6 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons milk 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon heavy cream 2 sheets gelatin 1/4 cup cold water 3/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons heavy cream 2 egg yolks 2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons sugar 3 ounces white chocolate 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon passion fruit puree 2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoon sugar 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon water 1 sheet gelatin 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon passion fruit puree 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon neutral glaze (mixture of water, sugar and pectin) 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon water 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons sugar 1/2 cup pabana puree (mixture of mango, banana and passion fruit, available at gourmet/specialty stores) 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon cold water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the Macaroons: Sift together the flours. Whisk the egg whites, slowly adding the sugar, until they form firm peaks. Fold in the dry ingredients. Place the mixture into a pastry bag and pipe into 2 1/2-inch mounds onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Top with shredded coconut. Bake for about 20 minutes. Dust with powdered sugar. For the Sauce Anglaise: Combine the egg yolks, vanilla and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl and set aside. In a small saucepot over medium heat, scald the milk, heavy cream, and the remaining sugar. Temper the yolk mixture using a small amount of the scalded liquid, then add the tempered yolks into the saucepot with the rest of the liquid. Over medium heat, stir this mixture constantly using a heat-resistant spatula or wooden spoon until the mixture has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon; this should take approximately 1 minute. Be careful that the mixture does not come to a boil. Strain the mixture into a metal bowl which is sitting in an ice bath. Let cool completely, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve. For the Mousse: In a very small metal bowl or 1 cup glass measure, sprinkle the gelatin into 1/4 cup cold water to soften, and set aside. Place the heavy cream into a large bowl and whip using a hand mixer until soft peaks are formed. Set aside in the refrigerator. Place the egg yolks in a 2-quart mixing bowl and set aside. In a 1/2 quart sauce pot, combine the 2 tablespoons of water and sugar, and bring to a boil. Cook until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage, about 248 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Start beating the egg yolks on medium speed, and slowly add in the sugar syrup. Beat until the mixture is thick and cool. Melt the white chocolate in a bowl over a double boiler over simmering water. Remove the bowl of melted chocolate and set aside, keeping it warm. If you used a metal bowl for the gelatin, melt the gelatin over the same simmering water, otherwise, melt the gelatin in the microwave. Temper the gelatin using some of the beaten egg yolk mixture, then add this back into the egg yolk mixture and mix well. Working quickly to prevent lumps from forming, fold a small amount of whipped cream into the warm chocolate. Then fold in the egg yolk and gelatin mixture. Fold in the remaining whipped cream. For the Gelee: Combine the passion fruit puree, sugar and 2 tablespoons of the water in a pot and bring to a boil until combined. Set aside. Soak the gelatin in a bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoon of water and add it to the mixture when softened. Let everything cool. For the Glaze: Bring all of the ingredients to a boil until well combined, then let cool slightly keeping warm for service. When serving, you do not want the mixture to be so warm as to melt the mousse. For the Pabana Sauce: Combine sugar and pabana puree in a small pot and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat. Mix together the cornstarch and water, then add this to the puree. Return the mixture to medium heat and let simmer for about 5 minutes. To serve: In individual 4-ounce dome shaped molds, place a serving white chocolate mousse about 3/4 of the way up. Add passion gelee into the center of the mousse, then place a macaroon on top. Place the mold in the freezer until it is completely frozen. Unmold the dessert, and dip the rounded part into the soft glaze. Drizzle the pabana sauce around the plate, and place the dome in the center of the serving plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74292,&quot;Rhubarb Pie The crust: (makes two 12-inch galettes) 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (scoop and sweep the flour) 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 4 ounces unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and refrigerated 4 ounces lard, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and frozen 1 egg 5 1/2 tablespoons ice-cold water 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 6 cups rhubarb, stems removed and cut into 1-inch pieces 2 cups cherries or raspberries 1 1/2 cups sugar (our pie was pretty tart, so add more if you like it sweet), plus more for sprinkling over the top 4 tablespoons cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 3 tablespoons unsalted butter Egg wash (1 egg whisked with 1 tablespoon water) Instructions: To make the crust: Have all of your ingredients ready and chilled. Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a food processor. Add the butter and lard. Use the food processor to work the butter and lard into the flour. Work the fats into the flour until it starts to stick together when squeezed, but you want to keep some of the fat in pea-size pieces. If it is too soft and it won&#39;t stay in pieces, place the bowl in the freezer for about 15 minutes and then try again. Whisk the egg, add it along with the water and vinegar to the flour/lard mixture. Stir this with your hand or a wooden spoon, but be very gentle. The goal is to keep the pea-size chunks of fat intact. It will start to look shaggy and not dry. It should hold together when you squeeze it in your hand. Gently knead the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into two pieces and create round disks. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least an hour, or overnight. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F with the rack on the bottom shelf. In a large bowl, toss together the rhubarb, cherries, sugar, cornstarch and spices. Roll out one of the circles of dough and drape it into the pie plate. Place the filling in the pie shell. Break the butter up into several pieces and put it over the filling. Weave the lattice over the top. Crimp the edges. Brush the top with egg wash. Sprinkle generously with sugar. Place the pie on a baking sheet, just in case the juices bubble over. Bake for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F, bake until the juices are bubbling and translucent, and the fruit is very soft. This can take up to 1 1/2 hours. If the top crust starts to get too much color, tent the pie loosely with foil. Allow the pie to cool so the juices set enough to cut the pie.
