Bring the stock to the boil in a large saucepan and add the cabbage, cavolo nero and/or kale. Cook for a few minutes until softened (you may have to do this in 2 batches). Remove the cabbage to a large bowl, leaving the stock in the pan. Toast all but 5 of the bread slices on a hot griddle pan or in a toaster, then rub them on 1 side with the garlic halves, and set aside. Next, heat a large 4-inch-deep ovenproof casserole-type pan on the stove top, pour in a couple of glugs of olive oil and add your pancetta and anchovies. When the pancetta is golden brown and sizzling, add the rosemary and cooked cabbage and toss to coat the greens in all the lovely flavors. Put the mixture and all the juices back into the large bowl. Place 4 of the toasted slices in the casserole-type pan, in 1 layer. Spread over 1/3 of the cabbage leaves, sprinkle over a 1/4 of the grated fontina and Parmesan and add a drizzle of olive oil. Repeat this twice, but don&#39;t stress if your pan&#39;s only big enough to take layers - that&#39;s fine. Just pour in all the juices remaining in the bowl and end with a layer of untoasted bread on top. Push down on the layers with your hands. Pour the stock gently over the top until it just comes up to the top layer. Push down again and sprinkle over the remaining fontina and Parmesan. Add a good pinch of salt and pepper and drizzle over some good-quality olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven for around 30 minutes, or until crispy and golden on top. When the soup is ready, divide it between your bowls. Melt the butter in a frying pan and quickly fry the sage leaves until they&#39;re just crisp and the butter is lightly golden (not burned!). Spoon a bit of the flavored butter and sage leaves over the soup and add another grating of Parmesan.

Add the salt, egg and cream; beat until incorporated. Add the flour and beat until a dough comes together. Form the dough into a disc and then press it evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom; if necessary, use a piece of plastic wrap to help keep the dough from sticking. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour, or freeze for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the tart crust with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake until the edges of the crust look set and just barely golden, about 15 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and pie weights, and continue to bake until the crust is golden brown all over, about 20 minutes more. Cool completely. For the filling: In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla, and beat with an electric mixer until soft and very creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cream and continue beating until the mixture holds stiff peaks, stopping occasionally to scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula, 2 to 3 minutes more. Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the cooled tart shell and smooth with an offset spatula. Top with the berries. Combine the apricot preserves and a splash of water in a small bowl and microwave until warm, about 45 seconds. Strain through a sieve into another bowl.

Set aside. In a small bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let the mixture rest for 5 minutes until foamy. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar at medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. Beat in the yeast mixture. With the machine running on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture until a ball of dough forms. Remove the paddle attachment and attach a dough hook. (If a dough hook attachment isn&#39;t available, the dough can also be kneaded by hand for 15 minutes on a lightly floured work surface.) Mix on medium-low speed for 10 minutes (scraping the sides of the bowl, if necessary). Add the walnuts and raisins and continue to mix until the dough is smooth and springs back when pushed with a finger, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a draft-free area at room temperature (about 85 degrees F) until the dough has puffed slightly, about 2 hours. Butter and flour the inside and outer rim of an 8 1/4 by 4 1/2-inch nonstick loaf pan. Punch the center of the dough to deflate it. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead for 3 minutes. Form the dough into an 8 by 4-inch rectangle and place in the prepared loaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a draft-free area at room temperature until the dough rises about 2 inches above the top of the pan, about 2 hours. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap and bake the loaf until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes. Remove the loaf from the pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours.

Butter the bottoms and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans; dust with flour, then tap out the excess. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, then beat in the vanilla until combined. Alternate folding the flour mixture and milk into the batter with a spatula, adding the flour in 3 additions and the milk in 2, starting and ending with the flour, until just smooth. Add the sprinkles and fold 3 or 4 times until just blended to prevent the colors from bleeding too much. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake the cakes on the same oven rack, rotating the pans about halfway if they seem to be browning unevenly, until golden on top and the centers spring back to the touch, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pans about 10 minutes, then turn out onto cooling racks and let cool completely. For the frosting: While the cakes cool, beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar. Once it&#39;s all been added, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until white and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla until blended. Add 2 tablespoons of the milk, and beat to incorporate. Beat in the remaining milk, 1 tablespoon at a time (the frosting will be spreadable but not runny). To assemble: Place 1 cake layer right-side up on a cake plate or stand, and spread with 1 cup of the frosting. Top with the second cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Decorate the top with additional sprinkles. The cake layers can be made a day ahead; wrap the cooled layers in plastic and aluminum foil and store at room temperature overnight. You can also assemble and frost the cake the day before serving; let it stand at room temperature overnight, covered by a large bowl or cake dome (if your kitchen is very hot, chill the cake and let it stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour before serving). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23814,&quot;Coconut, Cherry and Vanilla Bean Ice Pops 2 cups fresh sweet cherries, such as Bing, pitted and halved 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup Pinch cinnamon 3 to 4 drops almond extract 2 cans full-fat coconut milk 1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped and pod reserved 3 tablespoons raw honey 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Bring the cherries, maple syrup, cinnamon and almond extract to a simmer in a small pot over high heat.

Halve the lemon, squeeze the juice from half and add the juiced half. Reserve the remaining lemon half. Bring the water to a simmer over medium-high heat and stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved. Remove from the heat, add the tea bags and let steep for 5 minutes. Remove the tea bags and add 3 cups of ice to cool the mixture to room temperature, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and make sure they are submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 16 hours. Remove the chicken from the fridge and remove from the brine. Pat dry. Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners (2 if you have a grill with 4 or more burners) and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. The grill should be around 350 degrees F so adjust the burners or air-flow vents as necessary to maintain that temperature. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer\\u2019s guide for the best results.) Lightly oil the grates of the grill and lay the chicken pieces, bone-side down, on the indirect heat side of the grill. Cover and cook until the skin is golden and the chicken is cooked about three-quarters of the way (130 to 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer), 20 to 25 minutes. Flip the chicken pieces so they are skin-side down and continue indirect grilling until the chicken is cooked through and reads 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 15 minutes more. Meanwhile, lightly oil the flesh of the peaches and the remaining lemon half and place flesh-side down on the direct side of the grill. Grill until marked but not too soft, about 2 minutes. Turn the peaches (leave the lemon flesh-side down) and grill just until marked on the other side, about 1 minute more. Remove the peaches and lemon from the grill. Slice the peaches into wedges. Squeeze the lemon into a small bowl and whisk in the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Toss the arugula with the mint, peaches and the grilled-lemon vinaigrette.

Drain, rinse with cold water and add to a bowl. Set aside. Add the pine nuts to a small skillet over low heat. Toast slowly over the course of 3 to 4 minutes, tossing regularly. Remove from the skillet and set aside. For the dressing: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and garlic over low heat so that the garlic slowly infuses the oil, about a minute. When the garlic begins to sizzle, stir it around so it doesn&#39;t get too brown. When the garlic starts to turn golden, add the salt and pepper and stir; set aside for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, pour the oil mixture (scraping out the salt, pepper and garlic) into a small mason jar. Add the lemon juice, lemon zest, basil and parsley, put the lid on and shake it. For the kale: Finely slice 1 bunch of the kale. Set the same skillet (without cleaning it) over medium-high heat. Add the sliced kale and cook until partly wilted, about 5 minutes. Let cool, then add the Parmesan shavings and toss. Season with salt and pepper. Finely slice the remaining 1/2 bunch kale and set aside. For the assembly: Start by pouring 1/4 cup dressing into each quart-size mason jar, followed by 3/4 cup cherry tomatoes, 1 1/4 cups pasta, 1 tablespoon pine nuts, 1/2 cup cooked kale with Parmesan, 8 to 9 mozzarella balls and, finally, 1/2 cup sliced raw kale.

Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer. Add the yolks, then flour, then heavy cream until just incorporated. Remove from the mixer and wrap in plastic wrap and let rest refrigerated over night. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to 1/4-inch thick. Use a round cutter to cut the dough to fit miniature tart molds that are 1 1/2 inches wide. Grease the molds with cooking spray and line the dough in the mold. Place on a sheet tray and bake in oven until golden. Passion Fruit Mousse: Place the passion fruit puree, butter and eggs into a stainless steel saucepan over medium heat. Use a wooden spoon to stir until the mixture becomes slightly thick. Be careful not to scramble the eggs. Make sure to stir along the edges of the saucepan. Remove from the heat and add the soaked gelatin sheets. Strain the mixture into a stainless steel bowl and let cool. Whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form and fold into the cooled passion fruit mixture. Place mousse into a piping bag fitted with a small fluted tip and pipe into tart shells. You can decorate with fresh mint leaves or small pieces of colorful fruit.

Cool completely on the parchment paper, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the paper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 23847,&quot;Painted Chocolate Fruit Tartlets 1/2 recipe pate sable 4 ounces high quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped 1/2 cup creme fraiche 1/2 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons confectioner&#39;s sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Seeds from one vanilla bean (optional) 2 to 4 cups soft juicy fruits (berries, fresh figs, grapes, sliced oranges, nectarines, plums, peaches, pineapples or mango) Instructions: Make the dough, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour or up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator and cut into small pieces. Reknead the dough into a 12-inch log. Cut the log into even pieces; the size of the tartlet molds used will determine how many to cut. For 4 - inch tartlets you&#39;ll get 8 to 10 from one dough, for 3-inches about 12, and for miniature about 14 to 16. (For 65mm tartlet rings, cut the log into 12 to 16 pieces.) Lightly dust a piece of plastic wrap with flour. Round a piece of dough and place it on the plastic wrap. Cover the dough with another piece of plastic and press with the palm of your hand to flatten. Roll the piece out, flipping the whole thing once or twice, rolling on the other side to keep it even. Roll it out to a thickness of about 1/8-inch. It should be about 3/4-inch larger than the mouth of the tartlet mold. Peel the dough off the plastic and center it over the mold. Using floured fingers, gently press the dough down to the bottom of the mold and against the sides, making it even as you go. If the dough tears or is too thin in places, simply patch it with another small piece of dough. (If using tart rings, rotate the mold on a lightly floured surface as you press the bottom and sides with lightly floured thumbs. Be sure to press along the inside bottom to form a nice square bottom edge.) Place the saran over the top of the mold and press with your hand or a small rolling pin to cut any excess dough off the top. (For rings, simply shave off the excess with a paring knife.) Remove the plastic and, using lightly floured fingers, press the dough up around the sides so that it extends slightly above the rim of the mold. Dock it a few times with a fork. Place in the freezer. (Tart rings must be placed in the freezer on a sheet tray.) Repeat with the remaining dough. Scraps of dough can be chilled and reused. The tarts can be frozen in the molds for up to 5 days. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place the tartlets on a sheet tray while they are still frozen and bake immediately. It will take 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the size. They&#39;re ready when the bottoms begin to color and the edges are lightly browned. Remove the molds from the sheet tray and cool completely on a rack. (If using rings, slip the ring off and transfer the baked shell to the cooling rack with a metal spatula.) Tip the cooled shells out of the mold and onto your hand. If they won&#39;t come, gently insert the point of a small knife between the shell and the mold to release it. Then invert it onto your hand. Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pot of simmering water, or in a microwave, until it&#39;s about 3/4 melted. Stir to melt completely. Using a dry pastry brush, brush the bottom and sides of each tart with the melted chocolate. Chill just until the chocolate sets. You probably won&#39;t use all the chocolate. Combine the creme fraiche, heavy cream, confectioner&#39;s sugar and vanillas in a bowl. Whisk until soft peaks form. Be careful not to get it too stiff. Using a pastry bag fitted with #5 tip, pipe the cream in into the shells about 2/3 full. Top with the fresh fruit and/or berries. (Figs and raspberries are a wonderful combination with the chocolate and creme fraiche.) The tartlets can be painted with chocolate as much as a day ahead and filled with the cream up to 4 hours ahead. The fruit, however should be put on within an hour or so of serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23848,&quot;Grape and Honey Dew Green Salad with Mint Splash SALAD: 4 cups California green seedless grapes, whole, stemmed 6 cups honey dew melon, peeled and seeded and cut in 1-inch cubes Mint Splash (recipe follows) MINT SPLASH: 1/2 cup lime juice, fresh 2 tablespoons honey 1 1/2 tablespoons mint, finely chopped Instructions: SALAD</p><ol><li>Toss salad ingredients together.</li><li>Place in clean container, label, date, initial and store refrigerated.

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. Slowly pour 1 cup of the hot milk mixture, whisking constantly, into the egg yolk-sugar mixture. (Do not pour the entire yolk-sugar mixture into the boiling milk mixture, as it will curdle the eggs.) Whisk in the remaining milk. Pour the milk-yolk mixture into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon. Do not boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the rum. Strain the mixture through a fine wire sieve into a heat--proof bowl. Place the sauce in an ice bath. When cool, transfer the sauce to a bowl.

Fill each pumpkin cavity with the chocolate and allow it to set. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes to help the chocolate to harden. When set, the pumpkin candies should pop out of the mold. You can serve them as they are or you can sandwich 2 together. To sandwich them together, pipe a little of the white chocolate on the back of 1 piece and press another candy back-to-back. Let the chocolate harden.<br> Make the pumpkin candy dish: Place some powdered orange food color in a small bowl. Add a few tablespoons of cocoa butter to the food color and stir until well combined. Use a pastry brush (or a clean pastry brush used only for food, not for paint) to paint the inside of the mold (top and bottom) with the color. Make sure the inside is completely coated. You can use a hairdryer to warm up the cocoa butter paint if it begins to cool. Place the mold in the refrigerator for a few minutes until the cocoa butter sets.<br> Use a cornet filled with bittersweet chocolate to pipe the chocolate into the stem at the top of the mold. Allow the chocolate to set.<br> When the painted mold has set, use a ladle to completely fill each piece (the top and the bottom) of the mold with white chocolate. Tap the mold on the counter to encourage the air bubbles to depart. When the mold is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Scrape the mold clean with an offset spatula and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. It may be necessary to give each mold more than one coat. This will make the candy dish stronger. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a chef&#39;s knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat with as many molds as you would like to make.<br> Unmold the pumpkin candy dish. It should pop out of the mold. Fill the bottom of the mold with pumpkin candies. Place the top of the mold in place. Whenever I use cocoa butter mixed with food color, I like to use an electric yogurt maker. The yogurt maker will keep the cocoa butter melted. Leave the \\paints\\ in the yogurt maker at the end of your project. When you are ready for the next project, just plug in the yogurt maker and, in 60 minutes, you are ready to go.<br> The pumpkin candies are made with a special Halloween transfer sheet. It is 3-dimensional and you will need to purchase it before you begin. You will also need to purchase the 3-dimensional pumpkin dish mold. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 23867,&quot;Rice with Chick Peas 1/2 pound dried chick peas, picked over and soaked for 3 hours or overnight 2 quarts water 1 bay leaf 2ounce piece salt pork, rind removed 1 large onion, finely chopped 5 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 yellow bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped 3 ounces smoked slab bacon, rind removed and cut into 1/4inch dice 1 1/2 cups long grain white rice 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup dry sherry Instructions: Drain the soaked chick peas and, in a large pot, combine them with the water and the bay leaf.

Lower the heat to low and add the chickpea flour. Keep the heat super-low while you stir the mixture with a flat-bottom spatula.\\u202fContinue to stir until the mixture looks like wet breadcrumbs; if the mixture looks very dry, add an extra tablespoon of ghee to moisten it. Continue to cook the mixture on very low heat for about 40 minutes. Don\\u2019t stray too far; it&#39;s important to stir the pot frequently to prevent the flour from burning. Within the first 20 to 25 minutes you will smell the chickpea flour, and the mixture begin to soften as the ghee melts into the flour. When the mixture is deep golden brown in color, add the cashews and cardamom. Cook for another 5 minutes to remove the raw flavor of the nuts.\\u202f\\u202f Transfer the batter to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.

Drop by spoonfuls or 1/4 cup of mixture onto a hot, lightly greased nonstick 6-inch pan. Crepes should form and become dry almost instantly as you swirl the pan and its contents. Turn crepe over to cook other side quickly. Remove cooked crepe to waxed paper to cool. They can be stacked with waxed paper between each and then placed in the freezer until you&#39;re ready to fill them. This makes about 9 crepes that can be filled with more than just ricotta. Use for cannelloni, blintzes, etc. To make ricotta filling: Whip all of the ricotta filling ingredients together. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each crepe, then roll up, and tuck in the ends. Spread a little sauce on the bottom of a baking pan to evenly coat the pan. Then, arrange manicotti in pan loosely and cover with sauce. Bake at 425 degrees F, when the sauce bubbles, serve. Prepare the meats: In a large skillet, brown all the meats in the olive oil. There is no need to cook the meats all the way through. Remember to pierce the sausage before cooking to allow fats and water to be released. Set meats aside. Prepare meatballs: Combine all ingredients except the olive oil in a large bowl. Form the meatballs with your hands (there should be about 12). Fry in the olive oil over medium heat until browned, but not cooked all the way through. Set aside. For the gravy: Saute garlic in the olive oil in the same skillet used to saute the meats. Add tomato paste and cook for a few minutes. In a large saucepot, combine the remaining ingredients except the meats and the tomato paste-garlic mixture and simmer. When the mixture begins to bubble, add all the meats and the meatballs. Stir about every 15 minutes, being sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to prevent burning and sticking. If the gravy seems too thick, add a little water at a time. Simmer for about 3 hours, keeping the lid of the pot slightly askew to prevent condensation of the gravy.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 23889,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Super Simple Graveyard Enchiladas 2 tablespoons cooking oil, such as canola or vegetable 1 cup white or sweet yellow onion, finely chopped<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 3 jalape?os, finely chopped, remove seeds if desired Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 rotisserie chicken, skin removed, deboned and meat shredded (or 12 ounces, pre-shredded rotisserie chicken)<br> 1 cup (8 ounces) diced tomatoes with green chiles (I like Ro-Tel; fire roasted red or green salsa works too)<br> 1 cup (4 ounces) shredded Mexican blend cheese, or Cheddar-jack blend Nonstick cooking spray 12 corn tortillas, steamed for pliability<br> 6 to 8 cloves peeled garlic<br> 3 to 4 jalape?os, halved lengthwise, optional<br> 2 1/2 cups prepared mole sauce (I like Do?a Maria here-- just add water!)<br> 1 cup (4 ounces) shredded Mexican blend cheese, or Cheddar-Jack blend, optional Graveyard Garnishes (see recipe below) Shredded iceberg lettuce<br> Greek yogurt or sour cream<br> Hot sauce<br> 4 10-inch flour tortillas Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 F. For the filling: Add the oil to a large pan with straight sides over medium heat. When it begins to shimmer add the onion, cumin, jalape?os, salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, until everything is tender, about 8 minutes. Add the chicken and diced tomatoes. Toss to mix everything together. Stir in the cheese and remove the pan from the heat. For the enchiladas and sauce: Coat the bottom and sides of a -9-by-13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Visually divide the filling into 12 portions. Lay out one tortilla on a plate or cutting board and spread a portion of filling across the lower center of the tortilla. Pull the bottom edge of the tortilla up and over the filling and roll up. Place the filled tortilla seam side-down in the dish, perpendicular to the short side of the dish, so you\\u2019ll have 2 rows. Continue to roll and place the enchiladas in the dish with 6 in each row. There will be a space between the rows. Fill that space with the jalape?o halves and garlic. Pour the mole sauce over the enchiladas and sprinkle the cheese, if using, down the center of each row of enchiladas. Bake until the edges are bubbly and the cheese is melted, 25 to 30 minutes. For serving: If using Graveyard Garnishes (see recipe below), cut a small slit in each enchilada and insert garnishes, upright, in the slits. Serve with a pile of lettuce on the side, and if you like, Greek yogurt and a shake of blood-- I mean hot sauce. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut shapes from the tortillas such as ghosts, trees and headstones. Arrange them in one layer on a baking sheet and bake until firm and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes.

Tear the chiles into large flat pieces and toast them a few at a time, pressing them down with a spatula. When they blister and change color, flip over and toast the other side. Cool and transfer to a coffee grinder reserved for grinding spices. Add the coriander, cinnamon stick, clove, oregano, and peppercorns. Pulverize the spices and sift through a medium-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Add the nutmeg, ginger, paprika, an salt, then stir in the garlic and vinegar. Set up a meat grinder fitted with the coarse grinding plate and the sausage stuffing attachment, or use a sausage-stuffing funnel for the stuffing procedure. Mix together the pork fat, loin, and shoulder and run them through the grinder into the bowl with the spices. Mix the meat and the seasonings briefly but thoroughly with your hands. Cover and refrigerate overnight. If the castings were packed in salt, rinse them for an hour before using. Run water from the tap through each length of casing to check for leaks; either cut the casing where it leaks or discard the piece (to be useful, a casing should be at least 30 inches long wit no leaks). Thread one end of a piece of casing over the suffer or the funnel mouth, pushing it all the way on but leaving a 3-inch overhang for tying off. Begin feeding the sausage meat through; when it first comes out, clamp off the end so that the sausage expands to a 1-inch diameter. If there is an air bubble, stop the machine and work the bubble out towards the funnel end. Feeding the sausage through the grinder in an uninterrupted flow, slowly move the casing away from the suffer as the sausage fills in a continuous 1-inch diameter link. When the sausage is about 6 inches long, pull off an extra 1 inch of casing and twist several times, completing one link and starting another. Continue until all of the sausage meat has been cased, stopping to thread more casing on as necessary. Either twist the links several more times to separate them, or tie pieces of string between them. Place on a rack in the refrigerator, uncovered, for about 36 hours or until dry to the touch and somewhat firm. Set a dish underneath to catch drips.

Using the back of your knife, mash the garlic to form a paste. Add it to a bowl with the lime juice, 1/4 cup oil, cumin, turmeric, garam masala and red cl flakes, if using. Whisk together, then season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Remove 3 tablespoons of the marinade and set aside for the squid. For the squid: Heat up a large grill pan over high heat. Don&#39;t put anything on the grill until it&#39;s screaming hot! That will prevent the excess sticking. Meanwhile, place the lemon juice in a large salad bowl and whisk in a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the arugula and toss to lightly coat. Transfer to a serving platter. Drizzle the nectarine slices with olive oil, and lay them on the grill, turning every minute or so until the fruit have nice grill marks all over. Remove them to a plate. Pat the squid dry with paper towels, if necessary, and add to the reserved marinade. Toss to coat. Shake the calamari of the excess marinade, and place the tubes and tentacles on the hot grill, cooking about 3 minutes per side. If the squid sticks, wait another 30 seconds or so. When it&#39;s well-seared, it will release! Remove the calamari from grill, and slice the calamari tubes (bodies) into rings. Add rings and tentacles to the bowl of reserved dressing and toss well to coat. Arrange the nectarine wedges and calamari on the platter, over the bed of arugula. Drizzle the remaining dressing over the bowl, as desired, and serve. Combine the cinnamon sticks, cloves, green cardamom seeds, black cardamom seeds, if using in a spice grinder or coffee grinder and grind until fine. Store the spice mix in an airtight container away from direct sunlight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 23900,&quot;Root Beer Floats 1 pint vanilla bean ice cream 2 quarts root beer Instructions: Hang a large, well packed scoop of vanilla ice cream on the edge of a fountain glass or other tall drinking glass.

Place the flour on a worktable. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil, wine and water. Combine the ingredients and knead until the mixture becomes an even dough. If necessary, add a little more water and continue kneading. Cut off a small amount of dough and roll into a 1/2-inch thick log. Cut the log into 5-inch long pieces. Then form a &#39;doughnut-like&#39; shape by pinching the opposite ends together. Repeat the above process with the remaining dough. Place the taralli in a pot of boiling water for about 1 minute or until they float to the surface. Stir to prevent them from sticking together. Remove the taralli from the water with a slotted spoon and dry off any excess water with a dishcloth. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and bake for approximately 10 minutes or until golden brown on one side. Turn the taralli over to cook the other side.

Turn heat down to medium. In a separate bowl whisk together the eggs yolks, sugar, and salt. Sugar will dissolve when heated. Slowly dizzle this egg/sugar mixture into the simmering milk mixture and whisk. Combining these too quickly will result in \\scrambled eggs.<br> After you have added these two mixtures together, reduce the heat to a medium low temperature. Remove the vanilla bean and split lengthwise scraping out seeds. Return the pod and the seeds back to the pot. I like to add several drops of food coloring at this point. Continue to stir until the mixture coats the back of a spoon. Strain mixture through a fine-holed strainer, discarding the vanilla pod and refrigerate the mixture over night. Follow manufacturer&#39;s instruction for your ice cream maker, and let the fun begin. Meanwhile, drain the jackfruit and pulse it gently in your processor. We want small pieces of fruit for the ice cream. After about 15 minutes into freezing your ice cream add small pieces of jackfruit to the mixture.

Sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk and allow it to dissolve. Whisk 1 egg and 1 cup of the flour into the yeast mixture. When the dough-sponge is smooth, sprinkle it with an additional cup of flour. Allow the dough-sponge to rise in a warm place until the top layer of flour cracks, about 30 minutes. Lightly beat the 4 remaining eggs. Then, using the dough hook attachment of an electric mixer set at medium speed, or a wooden spoon, work the eggs into the dough. When the dough is smooth, add the sugar, salt, and remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour all at once. If using a mixer, start on low and gradually increase the speed as the dough comes together, mixing for a good 15 to 20 minutes. If you do not have a mixer turn the dough out onto a clean, floured work surface and knead until it is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky. (Don&#39;t be alarmed if the dough seems too wet. It will tighten up into nice, soft, elastic dough.) When the dough comes together, add the butter and mix for another 10 to 15 minutes. Cover the dough with a clean towel and set it aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Stretch the dough to release some of the trapped gasses and redistribute the yeast, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Gently stretch the dough into a rectangle, then roll it out about 3/4-inch thick. Cut the dough with a doughnut cutter. Transfer the doughnuts to a floured board or baking sheet. Cover the doughnuts with a clean towel and allow them to rise in a warm place until they feel soft and fluffy, about 1 hour. To make the crazy glaze: Beat the egg whites until frothy. Add the vanilla and confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until smooth. Divide the glaze between several bowls then color with drops of food coloring. To fry the doughnuts: Heat 2 to 3-inches of oil in a heavy, high-sided pot over medium heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Working in batches of 3 or so, drop the doughnuts into the oil and fry until they float. Turn the doughnuts over in the oil and continue cooking. Cook the doughnuts, turning them once or twice more as necessary, until they are uniformly browned, then transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. While the doughnuts are still warm, dip 1 side of each into the desired color of glaze then set aside on a wire rack until the glaze is firm. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23938,&quot;Grilled Squid and Sweet Onion Salad with Roasted Tomatoes and Green cl Vinaigrette 8 plum tomatoes, halved 2 tablespoons pure olive oil Salt and pepper 16 whole squid, cleaned Olive oil Salt and pepper 2 large sweet onions, (Walla Walla, Vidalia), peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick 1 poblano pepper, roasted, peeled, seeded and chopped 6 cloves roasted garlic 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 3/4 cup pure olive oil 1 tablespoon honey Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Stir in the pancetta-bacon mixture. Transfer to a 2-quart baking dish. Pulse the buns with the remaining uncooked bacon in a food processor until finely ground. Sprinkle the crumbs evenly over the bean mixture. Cover and bake 45 minutes, then uncover and bake until the crumbs are golden brown, about 20 more minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23963,&quot;Grilled Peach and Caramel Crostata One 9-inch-round unroll-and-bake refrigerated pie crust, thawed 1 teaspoon olive oil, for the grill pan<br> 1 pound fresh peaches, peeled, pitted and halved (about 2 large or one 10-ounce bag frozen peaches, thawed)<br> 1 teaspoon white balsamic vinegar<br> 1/3 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice (from 1/2 small lemon) Pinch fine sea salt<br> 1 cup heavy whipping cream 1 tablespoon powdered sugar<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme<br> Instructions: For the crostata: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pie crust on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Drizzle the oil over the grill pan. Drizzle the peach halves with the balsamic vinegar, then grill flat-side down until softened and grill-marked, 3 to 4 minutes. Slice the peaches into wedges and arrange in a circle over the crust, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round. Pleat the edge of the pastry and pinch to seal any cracks in the dough. Combine the sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a small saucepan and cook without stirring until it has become a deep amber color, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the butter, lemon juice and salt. Immediately pour the caramel over the peach slices. Bake the crostata until golden, 20 to 25 minutes. For the thyme whipped cream: Meanwhile, combine the heavy cream, sugar, vanilla and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Whip until the cream has soft peaks, about 2 minutes. Gently fold in the thyme. Let the crostata cool for 15 minutes to let the caramel settle, then cut into wedges and serve with a dollop of thyme whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 23964,&quot;Tuna Carpaccio with Basil Cream and White Truffles 8 ounces fresh tuna 2 egg yolks 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 3 tablespoons heavy cream 1/2 ounce fresh white truffle Instructions: Cut the tuna into 18 cubes, each one 1/2-inch thick, and 1 1/4-inch square. Place the cubes between sheets of lightly-oiled wax paper and flatten with a cleaver. You will have 18 very thin, fairly round \\scallops\\ of tuna. Divide among 6 dinner plates and chill. Prepare the sauce: Put the egg yolks in a food processor. Add the lemon juice, and blend for 3 seconds. Add the oil, by drops, at first, then in a thin stream. The sauce will be fairly thick. Add the basil, blend for 3 seconds, then add the cream. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerating for 30 minutes brings out the flavor. When ready to serve, pour the sauce over the tuna slices. Shave the white truffle over all, and garnish each plate with fresh basil leaves. Note: Fresh white truffles from Piedmont are available in the U.S. from September through December. They are hideously expensive. The dish also works without them, or with extra-thin slices of white mushrooms sprinkled over the tuna. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 23965,&quot;Sausage and Mozzarella Quiche with Pickled Cherry Peppers 1 9-inch frozen pie shell 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese 1/2 cup cooked crumbled Italian sausage 1/4 cup chopped pickled cherry peppers 1 1/4 cups heavy cream 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 3 large eggs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the crust: Par-bake the crust according to package directions.

Season the beef with salt and pepper. Add the medallions to the pan and cook about 3 minutes on each side, for medium-rare, or until desired doneness. Remove beef from pan and set on plates or a platter in a warm spot. Add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil to the skillet. Add the shiitakes and cook over medium-low heat, until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the shallots, garlic, and salt and cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Pull the skillet from the heat, add the Cognac, and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any brown bits that cling to the pan. Return to the heat and cook until the liquid is reduced, about 1 minute. (If you are cooking over a gas flame the alcohol may flame, simply cook until the flames die down.) Add the chicken broth, and cook until saucy, about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat, stir in the sour cream and parsley, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon mushrooms and sauce over the medallions and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 23969,&quot;Three&#39;s Ramen Bowl 5 cups Three&#39;s Traditional Ramen Broth, recipe follows 1 cup Chicken Soy Sauce, recipe follows Kosher salt 2 cups chopped kale<br> 2 pounds fresh ramen noodles<br> 1 ounce chicken or bacon fat<br> 1 cup corn kernels 1 cup Pickled Kimchee Shiitake Mushrooms, recipe follows 1 cup thinly sliced green onions 12 slices Braised Pork Belly, recipe follows Two 6-Minute Marinated Eggs, halved lengthwise, recipe follows 2 sheets nori, quartered<br> 3 pounds pork knuckle bones 3 pounds chicken backbones 1/4 cup white miso paste<br> 1 cup mirin<br> 1 cup sake<br> 1 cup dried shiitake mushrooms<br> 1 tablespoon black peppercorns<br> 4 green onions, white parts only 3 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 2 medium carrots, chopped into large pieces<br> 2 stalks celery, chopped into large pieces 1 thumb-size piece fresh ginger<br> 1 piece dried kombu (2 by 4 inches)<br> 1 white onion, quartered<br> 1 small daikon radish, chopped into large pieces 1 pound roasted chicken backbones 2 cups soy sauce<br> 1 cup rehydrated shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon store-bought kimchee sauce<br> 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> Vegetable oil cooking spray 1- to 2-pounds pork belly, skin on<br> 1 cup teriyaki sauce 1/2 cup mirin<br> 1/2 cup sake<br> 1 tablespoon sesame oil<br> 2 teaspoons sambal<br> 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped<br> 1 thumb-size piece ginger, sliced<br> 1 white onion, sliced<br> 3 eggs Reserved pork belly drippings Instructions: In a medium saucepot, combine the Three&#39;s Traditional Ramen Broth and Chicken Soy Sauce, and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Drop the kale in for a few seconds to wilt, then remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Drop the noodles into the boiling water and cook until they float, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and set aside. Set out four large noodle bowls and divide the chicken fat between the bowls. Pour the hot seasoned broth in the bowls and then add the noodles. Working counter clockwise from 12 o&#39;clock, garnish each bowl in equal sections with the kale, followed by the corn, Pickled Kimchee Shiitake Mushrooms, green onions, three slices of Braised Pork Belly, half of a 6-Minute Marinated Egg and 2 pieces of nori. The colors of the toppings should look evenly distributed and beautiful.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the pork knuckle bones in one roasting pan and the chicken backbones in a second roasting pan. Brush the miso paste over the pork knuckles. Transfer both pans to the oven and roast until the bones are dark golden brown, about 45 minutes. Carefully drain off the chicken fat and reserve the fat for the ramen bowl. Set aside one-third of the chicken backbones for the Chicken Soy Sauce. In a large stockpot, place the remaining backbones and the pork knuckles plus any drippings from the pan. Deglaze the roasting pans with the mirin and sake, and pour into the stockpot. Add the mushrooms, peppercorns, green onion whites, garlic, carrots, celery, ginger, kombu, white onions and radish. Add cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook at a low simmer for 12 hours. Remove the mushrooms and reserve for the Pickled Kimchee Shiitake Mushrooms. Strain the stock. Place the roasted backbones and soy sauce in a medium saucepot and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to low and simmer for 45 minutes. Place the mushrooms in a small bowl and add the vinegar, kimchee sauce and sugar. Stir to combine and marinate covered overnight. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Spray a shallow roasting pan with vegetable oil and place the pork belly in the pan. In a small bowl, whisk together the teriyaki sauce, mirin, sake, sesame oil and sambal, and pour over the pork belly. Sprinkle the garlic, ginger and onion on top. Cover the roasting pan tightly with foil and roast until the pork is fork tender and pulls apart easily, about 6 hours. Carefully pour off and reserve the pork belly drippings for the 6-Minute Marinated Egg. Place a clean piece of parchment paper over the pork belly, followed by a clean roasting pan and a weight to press down the pork -- a couple of cans will do fine. Refrigerate until chilled. Slice into 3-by-1/4-inch pieces. Bring a small pot of water to a rolling boil. Gently lower the eggs into the pot and cook for 6 minutes. Immediately plunge eggs into a large bowl of ice water and chill thoroughly. Carefully peel the eggs and place in a shallow bowl. Pour the reserved pork belly drippings over the eggs and marinate overnight. If the eggs float, use a small plate to keep them submerged. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 23970,&quot;Rosy Prosecco Spritzer 1/2 cup prosecco, chilled 1/4 cup club soda, chilled<br> 1 teaspoon rose water<br> 1 rose petal, for garnish<br> Instructions: In a white wine glass or coupe, combine the prosecco, club soda and rose water. Garnish with a rose petal. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 23971,&quot;Dutch Apple Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface 4 teaspoons granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 14 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced 1 large egg, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons cold water 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 3 pounds baking apples, such as Golden Delicious, Cortland or Mutsu 2/3 cup granulated sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice Generous pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup chopped walnuts Instructions: For the dough: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter, and pulse until the mixture resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits of butter. Add the egg, and pulse until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is very dry, add up to 1 tablespoon cold water.) Remove the dough, gently pat it into a round, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. For the filling: Meanwhile, put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel and core the apples; cut each in half, and cut each half into 4 wedges. Add the apples and granulated sugar to the bowl with the lemon juice, and toss. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the sugared apples, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, about 7 minutes. Strain the apples in a colander over a medium bowl to catch all the juice. Shake the colander to extract as much liquid as possible. Return the juice to the skillet, and simmer over medium heat until it has thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Toss the apples with the thickened juice, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Set aside to cool completely. (The cooled filling can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 6 months.) For the streusel topping: Whisk the flour, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the butter, and rub it into the flour mixture with your fingers until it has been absorbed. Mix in the walnuts. To assemble and bake the pie: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven, place a baking sheet on it and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough disk into a 12-inch circle. Layer it between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Ease the dough round into a 9-inch pie pan. Fold and crimp the edges as desired. Add the filling, and spread it out to make an even layer. Squeeze handfuls of the streusel topping, and drop clumps of it on top of the filling to completely cover it. Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust and streusel are golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes. Let it cool on a cooling rack for at least 3 hours before serving. (The pie keeps well, covered, at room temperature for 24 hours or refrigerated for up to 4 days.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 23972,&quot;Minted Rice Salad 6 tablespoons each vegetable and walnut oil 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 1 bunch mint leaves, rinsed Salt and pepper 3 cups orzo rice, cooked until al dente (6 cups cooked) 2 cups cooked wild rice Instructions: In a blend combine the oils, vinegar and mint; season to taste with salt and pepper.

On a baking sheet, rub the chicken breasts with the vegetable oil and sprinkle with the basil, oregano, granulated garlic and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Bake until the breasts reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the onions, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are caramelized, 8 to 10 minutes. In a separate saute pan, heat another 3 tablespoons olive oil. When hot, add the mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Saute for 7 minutes. Pulse the mayonnaise with the chipotle and sauce in a food processor until blended. Slice the cooled chicken breasts as thinly as possible. On a baking sheet, make four piles of chicken, caramelized onions and mushrooms. Top each pile with 2 slices of provolone and place in the oven until melted. Transfer the stacks to the toasted bread and top with chipotle mayonnaise. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 23974,&quot;Panuchos 2 tablespoons table salt 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano 2 sprigs fresh cilantro 1 head garlic, cloves separated 5 pounds turkey legs or thighs 2 medium red onions, very thinly julienned 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt 1 tablespoon vegetable oil or lard 1 yellow hot cl<br> 1 serrano cl<br> 1/4 white onion, diced<br> 1 cup cooked black beans (canned is fine)<br> Salt 3/4 teaspoon table salt 1 pound prepared corn masa dough for tortillas<br> Vegetable oil, for oiling the comal or griddle 1 small head green leaf lettuce, leaves separated 1 Roma tomato, cut into thin slices 1 avocado, cut into thin slices Instructions: For the shredded turkey: Heat a large pot of water to just below a simmer and add the salt, pepper, oregano, cilantro and garlic. Poach the turkey legs in the barely simmering water for 2 hours. Remove the turkey and pat dry. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Grill the turkey legs until nicely charred. Pull or shred the turkey and set aside. For the pickled red onions: Put the red onions in a mixing bowl with the vinegar, salt and 1/2 cup water. Mix well and let rest for 1 hour. For the black bean puree: In a medium saute pan, heat the oil or lard. Add the yellow and serrano chiles and fry lightly. Add the diced onions and saute until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. In a blender, puree the black beans with just enough water to allow the mixture to run in the blender. Transfer the black bean puree to the pan with the onions and chiles and cook over medium-low heat, 20 to 30 minutes. Add salt to taste. For the tortillas: Mix or knead the salt into the masa. Divide the masa into 15 balls. As you work, keep the masa balls in a bowl covered with plastic wrap to keep the dough from drying out. Add a bit of water if needed for a pliant masa. Heat a comal (smooth, flat griddle) or skillet over medium-high heat until hot.<br> Line a tortilla press with a piece of plastic wrap. Put 1 ball of masa into the center of the press and cover with another piece of plastic wrap. Press down on the tortilla press until the tortilla is about 6 inches in diameter.<br> Carefully peel the plastic wrap off the tortilla and place the tortilla on the hot comal. When it no longer sticks to the comal, flip to the other side. Press the tortilla with a clean, folded kitchen cloth so that it puffs up. Press around the edges to make sure it puffs up all around and leave a few seconds more on the comal before removing the tortilla. Along the side, carefully slit the top layer of the tortilla that puffed up--an opening of 1 inch will do--and lift up all the way inside, creating a pocket. The tortilla will still be very hot, so be careful. Do not create too wide an opening, separate completely or tear. To cool, place on paper towels or a clean dish towel. Repeat the process with the remaining masa balls. Take a cooled tortilla, carefully lift open the top and smear a teaspoonful of black bean puree inside the pocket. Press with your fingers to make sure the bean puree is spread evenly all around. Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas and black bean puree. Just before serving, heat the comal over medium-high heat and add some vegetable oil. To finish the panuchos, place each one on the hot comal and toast until golden on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove to paper towels. (This should be done just before you are ready to serve, as panuchos are best eaten freshly prepared.) To assemble: Top each panucho with a piece of lettuce, some shredded turkey, pickled red onions, a slice of tomato and a slice of avocado. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 23975,&quot;French Toast in a Mug 1/4 cup milk 1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 large egg<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 slice white bread<br> 1 tablespoon semisweet chocolate chips<br> Instructions: Whisk together the milk, maple syrup, cinnamon, egg and a pinch of salt in a large mug until combined. Evenly spread the butter on one side of the bread. Cut the bread into bite-size pieces and add them to the mug, pressing down lightly so all the bread pieces are submerged. Sprinkle with the chocolate chips, nestling them between the bread pieces. Microwave the bread mixture on high power for 2 minutes, pausing every 30 seconds. Let the French toast cool in the mug about 1 minute before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 23976,&quot;Oven Dried Tomato and Black Olive Tians 10 vine ripe tomatoes 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 3 ounces Kalamata olives, pitted 2 ounces freshly picked thyme Salt and freshly ground black pepper Chickpea shortbread, recipe follows 15 ounces all purpose flour 5 ounces chickpea flour Salt 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cumin 16 ounces cold butter, cut into small pieces 4 ounces pureed chickpeas 1 egg Instructions: Blanch the tomatoes in salted boiling water, remove, and shock in ice water. Peel the tomatoes and reserve the peel for the fried garnish. Cut each tomato into four pieces and remove the inner seed core. Season the tomatoes with salt, pepper, and extra virgin olive oil. Place the tomato slices on a meat rack, and bake for 1 hour in a 250 degree F oven. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and cool. When the tomatoes are cool, finely dice them and place on paper towels to dry. When drained, season the tomatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper and fresh thyme (you may need just a pinch of red wine vinegar to adjust acidity). In a food processor, add the Kalamata olives and puree to a paste. Remove and set aside. Place a layer of the tomato mixture into a 1-inch round ring mold and pack down. Place a very thin layer of black olive paste into the mold and pack down. Repeat 12 times. Finish with 1 more layer of tomato and pack down. Just before you are ready to serve, heat the tians through in a 300 degree oven. Preheat a fryer to 300 degrees F. Blot the reserved tomato skins with paper towels to dry them of any moisture. Place the skins in the oil and fry just until the water comes out and the skins are crisp and golden. Don&#39;t fry until the skins are brown, you still want a nice reddish color. Remove from the molds onto a chickpea shortbread and top with fried tomato skins. Mix together flours, salt, and cumin and sift. Cut cold butter into flour by hand. Cut chickpea puree into the mixture and add the egg. Mix just until a dough is formed. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out to 1/8-inch thick. With a 1 1/2 inch round cutter, cut out circles and place on a parchment lined sheet pan. Place in oven and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 23977,&quot;Spice-Rubbed Chicken Breast on Toasted Pita with Piquillo-White Bean Hummus and Arugula Salad Two 15-ounce cans cannellini beans, drained, rinsed well and drained again 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 4 piquillo peppers, drained, patted dry and chopped<br> 1/2 cup tahini<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh oregano<br> Pinch cl de arbol powder<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Honey, to taste 2 teaspoons paprika 2 teaspoons cumin<br> 1 teaspoon coriander<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon cloves<br> 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg<br> 1/4 teaspoon cardamom<br> 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless, chicken breasts (3 or 4 breasts)<br> Canola oil, for brushing 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt 6 ounces baby arugula<br> 4 to 6 pitas, warmed<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the hummus: Combine the beans and garlic in a food processor and process until coarsely chopped. Add the peppers, tahini, olive oil and lemon juice, and pulse until almost smooth. Add the parsley, oregano, cl de arbol and some salt and pepper; pulse a few times until just incorporated. Taste, and add a little honey as desired. If the mixture is very thick, pulse in some water; the hummus should be just pourable, more of a sauce than a dip. Transfer to a bowl. (Makes 4 cups; leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.) For the chicken: Combine the paprika, cumin, coriander, salt, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom in a bowl. Brush the chicken breasts on both sides with canola oil and rub the top side of each breast with some of the spice rub. Heat a nonstick or enameled cast-iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken, rub-side down, until golden brown and a crust has formed, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until just starting to brown on the reverse side, another 2 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until an instant-read thermometer reads 160 degrees F, 7 to 10 minutes longer. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing. For the salad: Whisk together the lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil and some salt in a large bowl. Add the arugula and toss gently. To assemble: Pile some arugula salad on top of a warm pita, spoon over a generous amount of hummus, and pile on some sliced chicken.

Pour about 1/2 cup of the batter in a circular motion to spread on the griddle. When the pancake has started cooking, sprinkle the chopped bacon all over it. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges are cooked, and then flip and cook until completely cooked through. Transfer the pancake to a plate. Sprinkle with the cheese and let it melt, and then top with syrup and serve!! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 23981,&quot;Edamame Succotash 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil 1/2 cup finely diced red onion 1 teaspoon minced garlic 2 strips (1 1/2 ounces) applewood-smoked bacon, finely chopped ( cup) 1 cup (6 ounces) frozen edamame, thawed 1/2 cup fresh corn kernels, from 1 small ear 1/4 cup small-diced red bell pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper Instructions: In a large skillet, heat the sesame oil over medium heat.

Set the colander inside a bowl. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, with a thermometer handy, combine the whole milk and buttermilk and heat, stirring nearly constantly, until the temperature reaches 180 degrees F. When you reach 170 to 175 degrees F, you&#39;ll start to see fine, little curds separating from the whey. At 180 degrees F, turn off the heat, and skim the curds from the whey using a finely slotted spoon, dropping the curds into the cheesecloth-lined colander. (Save the whey for another use, such as breadmaking.) Gather the cheesecloth around the curds and tie it with a 2-foot length of string. Gently squeeze to remove more, but not all, liquid from the cheese, and then hang over the sink or a bowl for 20 to 30 minutes to drain it a bit more. (I use the string to tie the bag to my faucet.) Remove the ricotta from the cheesecloth, spoon it into a container, and stir in the salt.

When the water boils, add the salt to the water and then add the green beans. Cook for 4 minutes. Prepare an ice bath: Fill a large bowl halfway with ice cubes and add some cold water. Place a colander squarely inside the ice bath. The colander will keep you from having to pick the beans out from amongst the ice cubes in the ice bath. When the beans are cooked, remove them from the hot water with a strainer and transfer them to the colander inside the ice bath. Use a spoon to swirl the beans around in the ice bath so they are sure to cool down immediately. Drain and set aside. For the mushroom base: In a 10-inch cast iron skillet, melt the butter and add the mushrooms. Season with salt, to taste, and add the cayenne and mustard. Stir to blend and cook until the mushrooms give off most of their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Using a whisk, add the garlic and flour to the mushrooms. When all of the flour has been incorporated, add the chicken stock. Bring to a simmer. Taste for seasoning. Stir in the cream and sour cream and simmer gently. Continue cooking over low heat until the mixture thickens, 12 to 15 minutes. For the shallots: Pour the oil into a medium frying pan. Heat to 350 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine the flour and cayenne. Toss the shallot rounds in the flour and shake off the excess by shaking the rounds in a strainer once they have been floured. Test the oil by dropping in 1 shallot slice. It should begin to bubble and fry gradually. Prepare a baking sheet fitted with a kitchen towel. Drop a small batch of the shallots into the oil and gently swirl the oil as they fry. This will help them they fry more evenly on all sides. When they are light to medium brown, remove them with a slotted spoon and lay them out on the kitchen towel to cool. Sprinkle with a touch of salt. To assemble: Stir the green beans and some of the shallots into the mushrooms. Simmer on the stove, over low heat until the green beans become tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 10 to 15 minutes. When ready to serve, top with all of the remaining shallots. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 24041,&quot;Chocolate Hazelnut Stuffed French Toast 4 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 cup whole milk Pinch of salt 3 tablespoons butter 8 (1/2-inch) thick slices brioche or challah bread 8 tablespoons chocolate hazelnut spread, divided Grade B maple syrup or powdered sugar, for serving Instructions: In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, milk and salt. Working in batches, melt some of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over moderately-high heat. Dip the bread slices in the egg mixture and quickly transfer to the skillet. Cook 2 slices of the bread until golden brown, and then flip over and cook until golden brown on the other side. Spread 2 tablespoons of the chocolate hazelnut spread on 1 piece of the bread, and place the other piece of cooked bread on top to enclose the chocolate hazelnut spread.

Stir well and let marinate in the fridge for at least 24 hours. For the Korean fried chicken: Preheat the oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F. Chop the chicken breasts into 3 pieces and the thighs into 2 pieces. Disjoint the wing into 2 pieces. There should be 16 pieces total, including 2 drumsticks. Place the chicken into a mixing bowl and season with the salt and pepper. Set aside. Mix the flour, cornstarch and curry powder in a bowl. Set aside half for the dredge and half for the batter. Mix half of the flour mixture with 1 cup water until the consistency of a runny batter. Add more water if the consistency is too thick. Using the other half of the flour mixture, dredge the chicken pieces. Dip the coated chicken into the batter one at a time. Immediately add the battered chicken to the hot oil and let cook for about 12 minutes. Remove the chicken and let it rest for 3 to 5 minutes. This will allow the chicken to have a crispier texture. Using a pastry brush, brush the Korean fried chicken sauce onto the chicken in an even coat, without breaking the crust. Finish with the chopped green onion and sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 24043,&quot;Fancy 5-Minute Grilled Cheese 2 slices light bread 1 wedge light spreadable Swiss cheese (recommended: The Laughing Cow Light) 1 piece jarred roasted red pepper (previously packed in water) 1 slice fat-free American cheese 1 tablespoon light whipped butter or light buttery spread, room temperature, divided 2 dashes garlic powder, divided Instructions: Spray a grill pan with nonstick spray and place over medium-high heat on the stove.

Spread 3/4 cup pistachios on a baking sheet and bake on the lower oven rack until toasted, about 8 minutes. Let cool completely, then pulse in a food processor until finely chopped. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Spread the granulated sugar on one of the prepared pans and bake on the lower oven rack until very hot but not melting, about 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 225?. Meanwhile, combine the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. About 30 seconds before the sugar comes out of the oven, beat the egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in the hot sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, using the parchment paper as a funnel. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat, scraping down the bowl as needed, until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and beat until the meringue is fluffy, about 30 seconds. Reline the baking sheet that you used for the sugar with parchment paper. Gently fold the chopped pistachios and chocolate into the meringue with a rubber spatula until just combined. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch round tip. Pipe the meringue into 1 3/4-inch-wide mounds (about 1 1/2 inches tall) about 1 inch apart onto the prepared pans.

Add the whole sprig of basil, 3/4 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Cook, simmering, until the tomatoes are softened and the sauce is thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, season with the sugar and additional salt and pepper. In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with the Parmesan, egg, torn basil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Lightly mist a medium rectangular or oval baking dish (about 9-by-11-inch) with nonstick cooking spray. Lay half the ravioli in the bottom of the dish (the ravioli will be layered on top of each other). Remove the sprig of basil from the sauce. Spread half the ricotta mixture over the ravioli and top with half the sauce and half the grated cheese. Repeat with the remaining ravioli, ricotta and sauce. Cover with aluminum foil and bake until bubbly, about 45 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Continue to bake until the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Let stand at least 10 minutes. Garnish with extra torn basil. Slice and serve with a green salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Barbera]&quot; 24073,&quot;Gnocchi con Polpette di Manzo 1 (35-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only 1 fresh bay leaf 1 tablespoon dried oregano 2 teaspoons garlic powder Pinch sugar Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 pound ground beef 1 pound ground pork 1/2 bunch fresh parsley, chopped 1 cup bread crumbs 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon dried oregano 2 eggs Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 (16-ounce) bag fresh or frozen gnocchi 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup crushed sweet red pepper (sold in a jar), optional 1 eggplant Special Equipment: Long wooden skewers Instructions: Put the tomatoes into a saucepan over medium heat.

Use a pastry bag with a small round tip or a zip top bag with a corner snipped off to outline and then cover the cookie with royal icing. Allow royal icing covered cookies to dry 24 hours before painting. For painting the background of the cookies, dilute food colors with water until desired color is achieved. (Test color on one of your practice cookies.) To add outlines and details, use concentrated food color or edible food color pens. While the \\paint\\ is still wet, sprinkle with edible glitter to add an extra sparkle to your cookies. Candy Melts Molded Cookies: You can use either heat resistant or non-heat resistant molds for these cookies. Heat resistant molds can filled with the cookie dough and baked in the oven. Non-heat resistant molds can be used to mold the cookie dough only. If you are using non-heat resistant molds, make sure you are using cookie dough that won&#39;t spread too much in the oven. Paint melted candy melts into the details of the mold. Allow the detailed areas to harden. Fill in the mold with a background color, making sure that you can&#39;t see through the mold when you hold it up to a light. Be careful not to overfill the mold with the candy melts. If you fill the mold completely, the candy top will not fit snugly against the cookie base. Place the filled molds in the freezer until the candy is cold. Remove the molds from the freezer and carefully release the candy. Secure the top to the cookie with a dab of melted candy melts. Luster dust brushed on the candy tops adds a beautiful sheen to your cookies. Tinted Royal Icing Cookies: Outline the area of the cookie to be covered using a pastry bag with a small round tip or a zip top bag with the corner snipped off and quickly fill-in the center of the cookie with royal icing. When icing sets, outline and fill-in adjoining areas with additional colors of royal icing. Details can be piped on in complementary or contrasting colors of royal icing after the base color has hardened. Fondant Molded Cookies: You can use either heat resistant or non-heat resistant molds for these cookies. Heat resistant molds can filled with the cookie dough and baked in the oven. Non-heat resistant molds can be used to mold the cookie dough only. If you are using non-heat resistant molds, make sure you are using cookie dough that won&#39;t spread too much in the oven. Using the same molds you used to bake the cookies to decorate these cookies. Lightly dust the mold with powdered sugar and press fondant into the molds. Using a small offset spatula carefully remove the fondant. Secure the fondant to the cookie using a small bit of buttercream icing. You can create detail in the fondant covered cookies by using different colors. Press small bits of fondant into the details of the mold you want to highlight and then fill in with a background color. Luster dust applied to the fondant adds an extra special sparkle to your cookies. The fondant can be painted with food coloring or with edible food color pens to add extra details to the cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 24094,&quot;Clown Man 2 cupcakes 1 pint whipping cream 1 pint blueberries 1 tube red icing 1 box jujubes 1 green ice cream cone Instructions: Press the cupcakes into a ring mold.

Add the butter and stir until it&#39;s all incorporated. Add the cream and stir until it becomes a thick and rich caramel. Add the chocolate and stir until it&#39;s melted and incorporated in the caramel. Remove from the heat. Let cool and reserve in an airtight container. For the raspberry mango filling: Put the raspberries, mango, sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a saucepan and bring to a boil, skimming the surface of the jam regularly. Simmer for about 20 minutes. Let cool. Blend the mixture to reduce to a puree. Pass through a fine sieve to remove the seeds. Reserve in an airtight container and keep refrigerated. For the lemon cream: In a stainless steel bowl, mix the sugar, butter, eggs, lemon zest, and lemon juice together. Place the bowl over a pot of boiling water. Cook&#39;s Note: Do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water, you do not want to scramble the eggs. Cook for approximately 2 minutes, until the cream thickens. Remove from the heat. Pass through a fine sieve. Cover with plastic wrap so that it is directly on top of the cream (to prevent a skin from forming). Let cool and keep refrigerated. For the doughnuts: In a food processor, sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk and stir to dissolve; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the sugar, salt, beaten eggs, vanilla, and butter. Blend thoroughly. Add the flour and then using a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, beat until smooth. You can also knead the dough by hand for about 5 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Roll the dough out on a floured surface to 1/2-inch in thickness. Cut the dough into 1 inch-round doughnuts using a circular cookie cutter (or alternately, a can). Cover with a plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour in a warm place. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 360 degrees F and fry the doughnuts in batches for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, until lightly browned on both sides. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking tray. Fit a pastry bag with a 4 mm pastry tip and insert the tip into the side of the doughnut. Gently squeeze the bag as you slowly pull the tip out of the doughnut. Using this technique, fill the pastry bag with the prepared dark chocolate and salted caramel ganache, raspberry-mango jam, and lemon cream, changing the pastry bag after filling the desired amount of doughnuts with each filling. Sprinkle the doughnuts generously with powdered sugar. Serve warm. Cook&#39;s Note: Chilling the dough makes it easier to roll it (does not stick as much). The dough will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months. You can also use any good quality jams to fill the donuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24120,&quot;Eggs Benedict Water 1/2 cup distilled vinegar, divided 12 large eggs 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 12 slices Canadian bacon 6 plain English muffins, split 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives or finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves HOLLANDAISE SAUCE, recipe follows 1 1/3 cup unsalted butter 2 large egg yolks 2 tablespoons cold water 1 tablespoon strained freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more as needed 1 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground white pepper or a pinch of cayenne pepper Instructions: Pour enough water into 2 large skillets to reach a depth of about 3 inches, and divide the vinegar between them.

That way, it will be runny and gooey and perfect when everyone is ready to eat and they&#39;ll all be interested and excited by what&#39;s going on in the pan. Heat a lug of oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Put a large saucepan with an inch or two of hot water on a low heat. Put a large heatproof bowl over the saucepan so you have a bain-marie.<br> Add the chopped shallots to the frying pan and cook them gently for around 5 to 10 minutes with a pinch of salt and pepper and the herbs. Once they&#39;ve softened, but not coloured, add them to the bowl with the cider and all of the cheese.<br> Leave the cheese to slowly melt down, only stirring now and then to help it along. Once it has mostly melted, stir in the creme fraiche, then a swig or 2 of hot water to loosen the mixture a little. Have a taste to check the seasoning, and get all of your dipping ingredients and skewers at the ready. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 24177,&quot;Tomatoey Simmered Frozen Salmon 1/4 cup olive oil 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound cherry tomatoes 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar Four 4- to 5-ounce frozen skinless salmon fillets Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.

Heat a small pan with extra-virgin olive oil and cracked garlic in it over medium low flame. Trim ends of eggplants and remove a sliver of the skin off of 1 side, so the eggplant sits flat for you to slice it. Cut the eggplant into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange the eggplant on cookie sheets. When garlic sizzles in oil, using a pastry brush, brush both sides of sliced eggplant. Season eggplant with salt and pepper and roast in hot oven 15 minutes or until tender. Turn eggplant once. Take a couple of tablespoons of remaining extra-virgin olive oil and place in a second pan, a medium skillet, over medium high heat. To hot garlic oil, add remaining chopped garlic and red onions. Saute the red onions and garlic 2 to 3 minutes then add chopped fire roasted tomatoes and tomato sauce then season with salt and pepper. Lower heat and allow sauce to thicken. Remove eggplant from the oven. Get split sub rolls ready to fill, arranging the split rolls on a broiler pan. Preheat broiler to melt cheese on subs.

For Arnold&#39;s Alabama white sauce: Combine mayonnaise, buttermilk, Parmesan, vinegar, granulated garlic, horseradish, lemon juice, mustard, hot sauce, Worcestershire, granulated sugar, pepper, garlic and 1 tablespoon BBQ seasoning in a food processor. Blend until fully combined, about 30 seconds. Let sit overnight, refrigerated, for best flavor. For the BBQ smoked fried chicken: Preheat a smoker for cooking with cherry wood. Rub 1/2 chicken with some of the BBQ seasoning on both sides. Smoke with cherry wood until internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F. Cover with margarine and rub both sides with more BBQ seasoning and wrap in aluminum foil. Place back on smoker until temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Remove from smoker and leave in foil to confit in fat overnight. For Arnold&#39;s hot sauce: Bring hot sauce, corn syrup, honey, granulated sugar, granulated garlic, sriracha, paprika, brown sugar, cayenne, white pepper and 1/4 cup BBQ seasoning to a slow simmer in a saucepan, and simmer, stirring, for 10 minutes. Let cool. For the Spanish rice: Melt margarine in a saucepan and add onions. Saute until onions are translucent. Add rice and cook, stirring, until rice gets a little brown. Add tomatoes and celery and cook until soft. Add chicken broth and stir once. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.

Serve on Spanish rice, covered in Alabama white sauce and Arnold&#39;s hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]&quot; 24183,&quot;Indian Omelet 6 large eggs 3/4 cup minced red onion (about 1/2 medium onion) 1 small serrano cl, seeded and minced Small handful fresh cilantro, minced (about 2 tablespoons), plus extra leaves for garnish 3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric 3/4 teaspoon paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable, canola or grapeseed oil Small handful coarsely crushed potato chips (about 1/4 cup; optional) Instructions: In a large bowl, beat the eggs until slightly frothy. (If you are not in a hurry, you can go the extra mile: Separate the eggs and beat the egg yolks in one bowl, the egg whites in another, until very frothy. Gently fold the yolks into the whites. This will make a much lighter omelet!) Carefully stir in the onion, cl, cilantro, turmeric and paprika and add couple of generous pinches of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Heat the oil in a medium (10 to 12 inch) non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Keep a heatproof spoonula (a curved, spoonlike spatula) at the ready. When the oil starts to shimmer, pour in the egg mixture. Using your spoonula, stir the egg mixture in small circular motions to distribute the onions, cl and cilantro evenly around the pan. This also helps move some of the uncooked egg down to the surface of the hot pan. Sprinkle the potato chips (if using) evenly over the top. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile, grab a plate that&#39;s as big as your pan. Check your omelet. It&#39;s all right if it&#39;s not fully cooked, but it shouldn&#39;t be super-runny. If it is, cover the pan and cook for 1 minute more. Slide the omelet, cooked side down, onto the plate. Then, holding the plate from underneath, place your pan over the plate and flip the omelet back into the pan. The omelet should land with its uncooked side down. Cook, uncovered, for another minute. Slide the omelet onto a serving plate, cut it into 4 wedges and serve with fresh cilantro leaves on top! Smaarti Tip Don&#39;t omit the serrano cl even if you don&#39;t like spicy foods. Scrape out the seeds and use just the flesh; that slight bitterness really makes this omelet sing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 24184,&quot;Good Morning Muffins 4 cups all-purpose flour Generous 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons baking powder 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup shortening 1 1/2 to 2 cups sweet orange marmalade (use 2 cups if you like the bitter marmalade taste, less if you don&#39;t) 1 cup orange juice 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3 whole eggs, beaten 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons melted butter 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon salt Wheat germ, for sprinkling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the muffin batter: Sift together the flour, granulated sugar and baking powder. Place the flour mixture in a mixing bowl. Use a pastry cutter to mix in the butter and shortening. Mix the marmalade, orange juice and vanilla in a small bowl. Pour the marmalade mixture into the flour mixture. Pour the eggs into the bowl. Mix all ingredients together gently, using fewer than 10 large strokes. For the topping: Mix the granulated sugar, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a small bowl. Fill muffin pans with batter. Sprinkle 1 heaping teaspoon of topping ingredients over each muffin. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon wheat germ over the top for extra crunch if desired.

Turn on the heat to medium and saute the onions until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, garlic, 1/4 cup water and more salt to taste. Stir to combine and allow to cook down until the sauce is reduced and the flavors have melded, 15 to 20 minutes. For the eggplant: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel the eggplant lengthwise, alternating every inch so there are still some strips of skin remaining. Slice the eggplant into 1/2-inch rounds and arrange on a sheet tray. Season the eggplant on both sides generously with salt and set aside. Set up a dredging station with three bowls: place the flour into one bowl, eggs into another and panko in the third. One at a time, dip the eggplant rounds into the flour first, then the eggs and finally the panko. Press the breading into the eggplant to ensure it is fully coated. Place on a sheet tray lined with a rack. Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan until it shimmers. Add the eggplant in batches and cook until golden brown, turning once, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain the eggplant on a paper towel-lined tray. Drain the oil from the pan and set the pan aside for later. Top each piece of eggplant with a spoonful of sauce and a slice of fresh mozzarella. Bake until the cheese is just melted, 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese. For the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the pasta water generously with salt. It should be as salty as the sea. Add the rigatoni and cook according to package directions. Drain and set aside. To finish, add a few scoops of sauce to the saute pan that the eggplant was cooked in. Add the cooked rigatoni and toss in the sauce, ensuring all of the noodles are coated. Add the Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of olive oil. To serve: Plate 2 pieces of the eggplant Parmesan alongside a generous scoop of rigatoni and finish with the fresh basil.

Combine milk, vanilla sugar, and both zests in a small saucepan. Scald mixture over medium heat, cover, and let infuse for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bloom gelatin in water. Whisk dairy base in a medium mixing bowl until smooth. Remove gelatin sheets from water, reserving the water, squeeze out all excess liquid, and stir into milk mixture. Strain milk mixture into dairy base and stir until no lumps appear, being careful not to create air bubbles. Using a ladle, fill 4 individual flex pan molds about 3/4 of the way full. Cover and refrigerate until set. Bloom gelatin in reserved water. In a small saucepan, bring orange juice to a boil then remove it from the heat. Remove gelatin sheets from water and squeeze out excess liquid. Stir into the hot orange juice. Cool orange juice mixture to about room temperature. Once cooled, ladle on top of set panna cotta to fill the flex molds all the way. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Using a sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut 4 (1/16-inch thick) slices from the middle of the apple, ensuring slices are even in thickness and are large enough to accommodate a leaf cutter; pieces on outer edges of apple (which will not accommodate cutter) must be reserved in lemon juice for further use in apple raisin cranberry compote. Using a leaf cutter, center the cutter on each apple slice and press firmly to ensure sharp cutout. Dip cutout apple leaf in simple syrup and place dipped cutout onto a silicone baking mat. Bake for approximately 30 to 45 minutes until golden brown (to insure even cooking, rotate pan as needed). Heat apple cider in a saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to 1/4 cup. Cool and transfer to a squeeze bottle. Heat cranberry juice in a saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to 1/4 cup. Cool and transfer to a squeeze bottle. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Toast oats on a baking sheet in the oven until slightly brown. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Combine remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add toasted oats to mixture and blend well. Press oat mixture into fluted molds (about same size as panna cotta molds) and bake for approximately 5 minutes until browning occurs. Let rest a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes and then transfer for use as base in assembling dessert. Using a chef&#39;s knife, cut reserved, already peeled apple into precise 1/4-inch dice, avoiding any peelings, core, or seeds. Reserve. In small saute pan, combine cider, orange juice, honey, and cinnamon. Over medium-high heat, bring mixture to a boil and reduce by half. Add the reserved diced apples, raisins, and cranberries. Bring compote to a simmer and cook until apples are tender. Adjust seasoning with salt, to taste. Using bain-marie set-up, slowly heat 4 ounces chocolate until melted smooth. Using seeding method, add remaining chocolate and stir until smooth. Make a parchment piping bag. Fill piping bag 3/4 full with chocolate, folding opening to avoid spilling. Cut a small opening at the tip of the piping bag. Pipe a triangular shape onto a clean, dry, dessert plate, being sure to start and end where panna cotta will rest. Pipe second line, interweaving between first line. Once chocolate cools, carefully fill with apple cider reduction and cranberry reduction, alternating sauces. Repeat process for remaining 3 plates. If any undesired results occur, wash and dry plate, and repeat process. Simmer both ingredients in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook until slightly golden brown and caramelized. Remove from heat and cool until slightly thickened. Using a large spoon, drizzle even lines onto a silicone baking mat. While caramel lines are still warm, mold around handle of wooden spoon, into even spirals. Let cool, and remove from spoon. Using kitchen shears, cut spiral to desired length ensuring clean edges. Repeat the above steps until you have 4 uniform spirals. To serve: Carefully pipe the chocolate onto the plate in a ribbon design (start the piping at the 10 o&#39;clock position). Place the granola base onto the plate in the 10 o&#39;clock position covering the starting point of the chocolate. Dip a round cutter into warm water and use it to cut out the panna cottas, making sure not to break them. Once they are cut, unmold them from the flex pans and place on top of the granola base with orange side down. Top the panna cotta with about 1 tablespoon of the fruit compote. Using squeeze bottles with very thin tips, pipe sauces into piped ribbon, alternating sauces. Lastly garnish the panna cotta with the sugar spirals. Stick it straight through the compote and into the top of the panna cotta, being careful not to break the sugar. Rest apple chip upright against panna cotta and serve. Place sugar and water in saucepan. Over medium-high heat, bring to boil. Remove from heat when boiling. Use 1/4 cup for apple chip production. Leave remaining mixture in saucepan and set aside for further use in sugar garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24189,&quot;Strawberry Crepes 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 whole egg plus 1 yolk Pinch salt 1 1/4 cups milk 1/4 cup butter 3/8 cup sugar 3 dozen strawberries, hulled 1/4 cup strawberry syrup (you can use syrup from canned or frozen strawberries) 2 tablespoons Pernod 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier 2 tablespoons cognac 2 tablespoons heavy cream Instructions: Combine the flour, egg and egg yolk.

Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with butter. Add the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt to a medium bowl and stir to combine. Set aside. Cream together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer. Add the egg and mix until combined. Mix in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture and milk alternately and mix until totally incorporated. Do not over-beat. Stir in the blueberries until evenly distributed. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

Add the gin, Simple Syrup, bitters and ice and shake. Pour the contents into a glass and top with club soda. Combine the sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Keep covered in the refrigerator up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Gin, Vodka, Rum]&quot; 24200,&quot;Espresso Caramel Sauce 1 1/3 cups sugar 1/3 cup water 1 cup heavy cream 1 shot espresso (about 2 tablespoons) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature Instructions: Place the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking occasionally until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. After the sugar is dissolved, raise the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil, undisturbed, until the syrup turns a deep golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. If you see the sugar caramelizing only in one corner you can gently tilt or rotate the pan to distribute the color evenly, but do not whisk. When the syrup has colored nicely, remove the pan from the heat and immediately add the cream. Be careful and stand back because the mixture will sputter. Do not stir until the mixture settles. Return the pan to low heat and stir with a wooden spoon until the strands of caramel melt. Remove from the heat and stir in the espresso and the butter. Serve warm. Note: Tom likes to caramelize the sugar dry (without adding the 1/3 cup water to dissolve it) in a heavy pan over high heat, but many people find it easier to dissolve the sugar in a little water first. This caramel sauce is also delicious without the espresso. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 24201,&quot;Taralli Dolci di Pasqua 6 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks 1 2/3 cups granulated sugar 2 sticks (1/2 pound) unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 6 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting 2 tablespoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup milk 1 cup colored sanding sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. In a mixer, beat the eggs and yolks until pale and fluffy. Slowly stream in the granulated sugar, melted butter and vanilla, and continue to mix until smooth.<br> Add the flour, baking powder and salt, and continue to mix on low until everything comes together in a firm dough.<br> On a lightly floured wooden board, briefly knead the dough to make a smooth ball, then pat into a rectangle and cut into 4 equal pieces. Split the pieces in half again to make 8 pieces, then repeat to make 16 equal dough balls. Set aside to make room to roll them. Use your fingers to gently roll out each dough ball into a 12-inch rope; if the dough is excessively sticky, dust your hands very lightly with flour, then knead the dough for about 20 seconds. (If you use too much flour the dough will become brittle, so go easy on it.) Cut each rope into three 4-inch sections, pinch the ends together to make rings, and place on the prepared baking sheets about 3 inches apart. Brush the tops with milk and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Bake the cookies, rotating halfway through, 16 to 18 minutes. Let cool on racks, 20 minutes. The cookies will last for 10 days in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Barbaresco, Valpolicella]&quot; 24202,&quot;Harold McGee&#39;s Chocolate-Cheese Truffles 4 ounces (weight without rind) ripe Camembert, fresh goat&#39;s milk cheese, or Stilton or Gorgonzola, at room temperature 1 tablespoon superfine sugar 1 to 2 ounces Scharffen Berger dark chocolate (70 percent cacao), finely chopped 6 ounces Scharffen Berger dark chocolate (70 percent cacao), finely chopped Instructions: Trim any rind from the cheese and bring it to room temperature. In a mixing bowl, combine the cheese and sugar and mix until the sugar has dissolved. Melt the filling chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Use 1 ounce chocolate for Camembert and goat cheese fillings; use 2 ounces for blue cheese fillings. Make sure the cheese you use is at room temperature and very soft. If it is too firm, microwave it briefly to soften it.<br> Combine the melted chocolate, superfine sugar, and cheese, and work together with a wooden spoon or flexible spatula until the mixture is homogenous. (This may be easier if you add a few drops of water or a little butter.) If the mixture is too soft to shape, refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes. Roll portions of the mixture into 1/2-inch balls and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes. Melt and temper the coating chocolate. Dip the cheese balls in the tempered chocolate, letting the excess drain off. Allow to set at room temperature. Keep in a cool place and serve on the same day. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 24203,&quot;Buttermilk Biscuits 4 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons salt 1 tablespoon baking powder 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 cup vegetable shortening, cold, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 1/2 to 2 cups buttermilk, plus additional for brushing Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.

Use a shallow roasting pan or baking sheet with a fitted rack. Elevating the lamb slightly off the bottom of the roasting pan allows the hot air to better circulate around the meat as it cooks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toast the spices: In a medium bowl, combine the cayenne, fennel seeds, dry mustard, paprika, red pepper flakes and cinnamon. Mix the spices and pour them out onto a baking sheet. Place the tray inside the oven for 1 minute to warm the spices and allow them to toast slightly. This will awaken their flavors. Remove the tray from the oven. Make the paste to coat the leg of lamb: In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, molasses and salt. Add the toasted spices and mix together to create a paste. Coat all sides of the leg in the seasoning paste. If you have time, allow the lamb to sit out for about an hour and come closer to room temperature. Alternatively, you can marinate the lamb like this for several hours (or overnight) in the refrigerator before cooking. Cook the lamb: Place the lamb leg in the center of the fitted rack on the roasting pan and place it in the center of the oven. Cook, undisturbed, for 30 minutes. Use an instant-read meat thermometer and take the temperature of the thickest part of the leg meat. Your meat thermometer should read about 85 degrees F. Cook for an additional 30 minutes. Ideally, the thickest part of the leg should come to about 118 degrees F. Remove the lamb from the roasting pan to a flat surface to rest. Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together vinegar and mustard. Place the fresh chiles on a flat surface and, with a small knife, cut them both into thin rounds, ribs, seeds and all. Pour off some of the drippings from the bottom of the roasting pan. Put the pan on top of a burner on your stove. Start a low heat under the pan and when the drippings begin to sizzle, add in the mustard, vinegar and fresh chiles. Taste for seasoning. Pour over the leg of lamb. Carve the meat: Begin carving at the loin end of the leg; you want to carve at a right-angle relative to the grain of the meat. Observe that this meat has lines almost like a piece of wood, aim the blade of your knife at a right-angle to the grain and slice thin pieces. Arrange the slices on a platter with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 24242,&quot;Waffle Cones 2 large eggs 1 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Nonstick cooking spray, to coat the waffle cone iron Instructions: Whisk the eggs, heavy cream and vanilla extract in a bowl until well combined, about 1 minute. In another bowl, sift the flour, sugar and salt. Stir the dry ingredients into the cream mixture until the batter is smooth. Heat up a waffle iron and spray it with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter towards the back of the iron and close the lid. Bake until golden brown, 3 1/2 minutes, depending on waffle cone maker. Open the iron and carefully remove the browned batter with a small offset spatula. Mold as desired. After a few minutes, the waffle cup/cone will take its shape. Allow to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 24243,&quot;Salsa Verde: Green Tomatillo Salsa 8 ounces (5 to 6 medium) tomatillos, husked and rinsed Fresh hot green chiles, to taste (roughly 2 serranos or 1 jalapeno), stemmed 5 or 6 sprigs fresh cilantro (thick stems removed), roughly chopped Scant 1/4 cup finely chopped onion Salt Instructions: Whether you choose the verdant, slushy, herby freshness of the all-raw tomatillo salsa or the oil-colored, voluptuous, sweet-sour richness of the roasted version, tomatillos are about brightening tang. The buzz of the fresh hot green cl adds thrill, all of which adds up to a condiment most of us simply don&#39;t want to live without. For the All-Raw version: Roughly chop the tomatillos and the chiles. In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatillos, chiles, cilantro and 1/4 cup water. Process to a coarse puree, then scrape into a serving dish. Rinse the onion under cold water, then shake to remove excess moisture. Stir into the salsa and season with salt, usually a generous 1/4 teaspoon. For the Roasted version: Preheat a broiler. Roast the tomatillos and chiles on a baking sheet 4 inches below a very hot broiler until darkly roasted, even blackened in spots, about 5 minutes. Flip them over and roast the other side, 4 to 5 minutes more will give you splotchy-black and blistered tomatillos and chiles. In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatillos and chiles, including all the delicious juice that has run onto the baking sheet. Add the cilantro and 1/4 cup water, blend to a coarse puree, and scrape into a serving dish. Rinse the onion under cold water, then shake to remove the excess moisture.

Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 24246,&quot;Mixed Fruit Tart 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sugar 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces and slightly softened at room temperature 1 egg yolk 6 ounces almonds, toasted, and cooled 2/3 cup sugar 8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 2 eggs 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour 1/4 cup plus 3/4 cup apricot preserves Assorted fresh fruit, including strawberries, kiwi, mango, blackberries, fig, blueberries, and star fruit, sliced 2 tablespoons water Instructions: To make the crust, put the flour in a large bowl. Add the sugar and mix. Using your hands, make a well in the center. Place the butter pieces and egg yolk in the well. Using your fingers, work the butter and egg yolk together until well combined then work the butter-egg mixture into the flour mixture until combined. The dough will be crumbly, but when you squeeze a handful in your hand, it should hold together. Sprinkle into a 10-inch pie or tart pan. Press the dough firmly and evenly onto the bottom of the pan. Make ropes of the dough and press them onto the walls, making sure not to let the crust thicken at the corners. It should make a clean right angle where the sides meet the bottom. Chill the crust at least 30 minutes or, covered, up to 3 days. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To make the frangipane filling, in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, pulse the almonds and sugar just until sandy. Do not over-process, or the mixture will become pasty. Add the butter and process just until blended. Add the eggs and process until blended. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the vanilla and flour, and process until smooth (you have just made a frangipane). Spoon the frangipane into the unbaked tart shell. Bake until the frangipane is golden brown and puffy and the crust is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool. Spread 3/4 cup apricot preserves or a little leftover custard on the surface of the baked tart to act as a bed for the fruit. Slice fruit and arrange it decoratively. Heat the remaining 1/4 cup apricot preserves with water until boiling and smooth. Brush the fruit with the apricot preserves to protect the fruit from drying out and make it glisten. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 24247,&quot;Classic Shrimp Gobernador Tacos 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 small white onion, minced 2 tomatoes, chopped* 1 green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined, chopped 1 cup canned tomato puree 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 corn tortillas 1/2 cup shredded Oaxaca or mozzarella cheese Lime wedges, for serving Hot sauce, for serving (recommended: Tapatio) Instructions: In a large heavy saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato puree, oregano, bay leaf, and smoked paprika. Cook for another 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Remove the bay leaf and discard. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Lay 2 tortillas, flat on the bottom of the pan, side by side. Put a small mound of cheese on 1 side of each tortilla. Wait until the cheese melts slightly, about 1 minute, and then add about 2 tablespoons of the shrimp mixture to each tortilla. Fold the tortillas over into half-moon shapes and cook to melt the cheese completely, another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a platter and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, cheese, and shrimp mixture. Arrange the tacos on a serving platter and serve with lime wedges and hot sauce on the side. *Cook&#39;s Note: Use only the outer part of the tomatoes without seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 24248,&quot;Lemon, Garlic, and Cilantro Baked Stuffed Tomatoes 2 beefsteak tomatoes Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese 1 large lemon, zested, about 2 tablespoons 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves 3/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 scallions, finely chopped 1/3 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 egg yolk Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Instructions: Preheat oven 450 degrees F. For the baked stuffed tomatoes you need to make 4 tomato cups out of your 2 tomatoes. To do so, cut a very thin slice off both ends of each of the 2 tomatoes, this is to create 4 flat bottoms. Then cut each tomato in half across its circumference. You should have 4 cup shapes, using the thinly sliced side as the bottom of the cups. To create a cavity, use a melon ball scoop to remove the seeds and pulp from the wide, fleshy side of each tomato cup. You don&#39;t have to be too fussy about this. You are just trying to create enough room to hold the filling. When scooping take some care not to puncture through the bottoms of the cups. If you do puncture it, don&#39;t worry, it is not the end of the world, just keep moving forward. Season the inside of the tomato cavities with salt and pepper. Reserve the seasoned tomato cups while you make the filling. In a small mixing bowl combine the ricotta cheese, lemon zest, cilantro, parsley, garlic, scallions, Parmigiano and season with salt and pepper. Taste the mixture. This is your last chance to adjust the seasoning. Once you&#39;re happy with the flavor, add the egg yolk and mix thoroughly. Divide the filling between the 4 tomato cup cavities, pushing it into the cavity with a rubber spatula or spoon. Drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil into a baking dish. Arrange your stuffed tomatoes in the dish, transfer to the hot oven, and bake for 15 to 17 minutes. The stuffing and the tomatoes should be fully cooked and the top should be lightly brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 24249,&quot;Pea and Bacon Salad with French Dressing 1/2 cup ketchup 1/2 cup full-fat Greek yogurt 1/3 cup white wine vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 teaspoon paprika<br> 1/2 small onion, coarsely chopped<br> Kosher salt 4 slices bacon 6 ounces sugar snap peas, stringed and cut on the bias (about 3 cups)<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 head butter lettuce, torn into leaves<br> 1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley leaves, chopped<br> Wedge of Parmesan, for grating<br> Instructions: For the French dressing: Plop the ketchup, yogurt, vinegar, mustard, sugar, paprika, onion and salt to taste into a high-speed blender.

Heat the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat until it foams and browns. Remove from the heat. Tilt the skillet and carefully spoon off the foam, saving it in a small bowl. Pour the clear butter into another bowl, and pour the dark dregs at the bottom of the skillet into the bowl with the foam. Add the clear butter to a larger heavy skillet. (Discard the butter foam and dregs.) Heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Fry the onions, flipping them now and then, until they&#39;re dark on the edges, even black and crispy in spots, about 10 minutes. Add the honey and garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add the vermouth, bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid thickens, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Put the sour cream and cream cheese in a mixing bowl and mix with a rubber spatula until smooth. Finely chop the fried onions on a cutting board and add them, along with their pan juices, to the cream cheese mixture. Stir in the chives. Add the cayenne and season with salt. Transfer to a small bowl and garnish with more chives. (This can be made ahead of time and refrigerated.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 24256,&quot;Double Dipped Fried Chicken 3 1/2 pound frying chicken, cut into 8 serving pieces 2 cups buttermilk 1/4 cup water 2 teaspoons red pepper sauce 3 cups flour 1 tablespoon kosher salt Fresh cracked black pepper, to taste 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon cayenne 4 cups peanut oil, for frying Instructions: Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels. In a shallow platter, combine the buttermilk, water, and red pepper sauce. Soak the chicken pieces, turn to coat, then cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. If time allows, marinate the chicken for up to 24 hours because the buttermilk promotes tenderness. Place flour in a shallow platter. Season it by mixing in salt, pepper, oregano, garlic, paprika, and cayenne. Roll the marinated chicken pieces in the flour, a few at a time, until well coated. Then, dip chicken in the buttermilk bath again followed by another coat of seasoned flour. Allow the chicken to sit in the flour and dry out while preparing the oil, this will help the coating stay on better. The buttermilk will keep absorbing the seasoned flour, which then fries up to form a crunchy crust. Heat oil in a large electric skillet to 350 degrees F. There should be about 1-inch of fat in the pan. Carefully add the chicken pieces in a single layer, skin side down. Do not crowd the pan or the temperature will plummet; make sure the fat continues to bubble around the chicken. Fry for 5 minutes, then turn the pieces over and fry the other side 5 minutes. Turn again, frying a total of 15 minutes. The turning will produce a golden-crisp skin with even color. Remove chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Do not put hot chicken directly in a bowl or container, the air can not circulate and the steam will cause the crust to fall off. Serve immediately or cool to room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 24257,&quot;Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Orange Essence 4 medium sweet potatoes (about 8 ounces each), peeled and cut into a large dice 1/4 cup buttermilk, warmed slightly 1/4 cup orange juice 2 teaspoons orange zest 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, optional Instructions: Steam the potatoes in a large covered pan fitted with a steamer basket until they are tender, about 8 minutes.

Add the Gorgonzola, brandy and salt and beat 1 more minute. Take care not to overbeat or it won&#39;t set properly. Spray a 1 quart loaf pan with cooking spray and line the inside with plastic wrap. Spoon half of the cheese mixture into the pan and spread it evenly, making sure to get into the corners. Scatter the figs, pecans and chopped parsley on top evenly and cover with the remaining cheese. Give the pan a few sharp raps on a flat surface to settle the terrine, cover the top with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours. To remove the terrine from the pan, turn upside down on a flat surface and pull 1 end of the plastic wrap down. The terrine will slip out of the pan onto the top piece of plastic wrap. Slice and fan out on a platter garnished with greens. Garnish with the remaining 1/2 cup of figs, pecans and thyme. Serve with crackers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Ribera del Duero, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 24266,&quot;Orange Almond Biscotti 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 3 large eggs, plus 1 egg, beaten, for egg wash Zest of 1 orange, peeled with a vegetable peeler, no pith, finely chopped 1 teaspoon almond extract 1 cup chopped dry roasted unsalted almonds Sanding sugar, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt with an electric mixer in a medium bowl. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Add the extract, orange zest and almonds, mixing to make a somewhat sticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead just until it comes together. Halve the dough and shape into 2 logs, approximately 12 by 2 inches. Transfer the logs the prepared pan, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Brush the dough all over with the beaten egg and sprinkle with sanding sugar, if desired. Bake until they are firm and golden in color, about 45 minutes. Transfer the logs with a metal spatula to a cutting board and cool for a few minutes. Cut the logs with a serrated knife on an angle into 1/2-inch slices. Lay them cut side down on the pan. Return to the oven and bake until golden brown on 1 side, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven, flip biscotti and continue to bake until golden, about 10 minutes more. Transfer to a rack to cool. Store biscotti for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container. Cook&#39;s Note: These biscotti are traditional and very crunchy. They are made for dunking.

In a 9 to 10-inch pot that is at least 4 inches deep, bring 1/4 cup cooking oil to smoking temperature. Season the meat with salt and black pepper. Over high heat, brown the meat in the pot in 2 or 3 separate batches and set aside. Reduce the heat, add the bacon to the pot and cook it until it begins to brown. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and sweat approximately 10 minutes over medium heat while stirring often. Add the tomato paste and allow it to brown and cook about 5 minutes. Add the flour while stirring constantly. Slowly incorporate the red wine into the pot, stirring constantly so that no lumps form. Add the stock and meat to the pot and bring to a simmer. Secure the thyme and bay leaves together with the butcher&#39;s twine and place it in the pot. Place a lid on top of the pot and put it into the oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until the meat is fork tender. Remove the lid and skim the top of any excess fat. The onions and mushrooms should be added right before serving. For the potato gratin: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss the sliced potatoes with salt and black pepper. Arrange them in layers in a greased 8 by 6-inch flameproof baking dish. Pour the heavy cream over the layered potatoes. Place the dish on top of a sheet pan and then into the oven for 45 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oven and turn the oven temperature to broil.

If the center slice is very seedy, discard it. Arrange the slices on a paper towel-lined pan and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt, turning so you get both sides. Cover with another paper towel and set aside about 1 hour, letting the excess liquid weep from the zucchini.<br> Meanwhile, dice, halve or chunk the tomatoes, depending on their size and your whim. Put in a bowl with the olive oil, vinegar and garlic. Tear the basil into pieces and add to the bowl. Season well with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate.<br> Mix together the panko, Parmesan, thyme and oregano and season with 1 tablespoon salt and some pepper in a broad, flat bowl or pan. Put the flour in a lipped plate or bowl. In a third bowl, whisk the milk and eggs together. (Have a bowl of water for dipping your fingers to keep them clean while breading.)<br> Blot the zucchini very dry with paper towels.

Combine the salt, granulated sugar and 1 1/4 cups of the flour in the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times. Add the butter and pulse until there are pea-size pieces. Add the ice water, a few tablespoons at a time, and pulse until the mixture barely comes together. Turn it out onto a piece of parchment paper and press into a disc. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Roll out the dough on a lightly-dusted surface so it is large enough to fit into a 9-inch pie pan with a slight overhang. A little trick to make sure the pie crust is round: Roll out the dough from the center outward, like the rays of the sun. Place the dough in the pie pan and fold over the overhang to create a nice crust ? no need to cut off scraps. Pierce the base all over with a fork, line with foil and fill with baking weights or beans. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 12 minutes. Remove the foil and pie weights. Return the pie crust to the oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes to ensure the crust will be crisp. Allow to cool, about 30 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Beat the brown sugar and eggs in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the coconut oil and remaining 2 tablespoons of flour and mix for another 2 minutes. Add the sorghum and bourbon and mix until combined. Finish by stirring in half of the pecans. Sprinkle the bottom of the crust with the chocolate chips and remaining pecans. Gently pour in the pie filling. Bake until the top is firm but the center is slightly gooey, 35 to 45 minutes.

Add the meat and cook until browned, breaking up large pieces as it cooks. Strain off excess fat from the skillet. Add the parsley and cook, about 3 minutes. Add the thyme, oregano, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, cayenne and red pepper flakes. Taste and add more seasoning if needed. Keep in mind that rice and cheese contain salt so be careful not to over salt the meat mixture. Let the meat mixture cool a bit. Add the tomato sauce. Combine the rice with the cheese but be careful not to mash the rice. Add the rice mixture to the meat mixture and stir gently to combine. Check the seasonings. Add additional salt and pepper if necessary. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a small to medium ice cream scoop (number 10) to shape the balls so they are a consistent size, and then hand roll the balls as tightly as you can. Pour enough canola oil into a deep skillet or Dutch oven to reach 5 inches. Heat the oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F; use a deep-fry thermometer to check the oil temperature. Whisk the eggs in a small baking dish. Place the breadcrumbs in another baking dish. Roll the rice balls lightly in the eggs and then immediately roll in the breadcrumbs to form a coating. Shake off the excess breadcrumbs. Place them on the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate or freeze until you are ready to fry. To fry, carefully drop the rice balls into the hot oil, a few at a time, taking care not to overcrowd and lower the oil temperature. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes per batch. Bring the oil back up to 350 degrees F before cooking each batch. Drain the rice balls on paper towels before serving. Serve with Marinara Sauce for dipping. Garnish with the basil. This recipe was created by a contestant during a cooking competition. The Food Network Kitchens have not tested it for home use, therefore, we cannot make any representation as to the results. Heat the olive oil in the bottom of a large pot. Add the onions and cook until translucent and softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Use some of the liquid from the tomatoes to deglaze the pan, and then add the tomatoes, basil, oregano, thyme, salt and pepper. Use an immersion blender to puree, taking care to leave the tomatoes slightly chunky. (If you don&#39;t have an immersion blender, you can add everything to a blender or food processor.) Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently to keep from burning on the bottom. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 hour or longer so that the marinara thickens as some of the liquid cooks out. Check seasoning prior to serving.

Sift the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, salt and pepper through a wire sieve into a medium bowl. Set aside. In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer at high speed, beat the butter and vegetable shortening until well-combined, about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar and beat until the mixture is light in texture and color, about 2 minutes. Beat in the molasses and egg. Using a wooden spoon, gradually mix in the flour mixture to make a stiff dough. Divide the dough into two thick disks and wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled, about 3 hours. (The dough can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.) To roll out the cookies, work with one disk at a time, keeping the other disk refrigerated. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature until just warm enough to roll out without cracking, about 10 minutes. (If the dough has been chilled for longer than 3 hours, it may need a few more minutes.) Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and sprinkle the top of the dough with flour. Roll out the dough 1/8 inch thick, being sure that the dough isn&#39;t sticking to the work surface (run a long meal spatula or knife under the dough occasionally just to be sure, and dust the surface with more flour, if needed). For softer cookies, roll out slightly thicker. Using cookie cutters, cut out the cookies and transfer to nonstick cookie sheets, placing the cookies 1 inch apart. Gently knead the scraps together and form into another disk. Wrap and chill for 5 minutes before rolling out again to cut out more cookies. Bake, switching the positions of the cookies from top to bottom and back to front halfway through baking, until the edges of the cookies are set and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire cake racks to cool completely. Decorate with Royal Icing. (The cookies can be prepared up to 1 week ahead, stored in airtight containers at room temperature.) Make ahead: The icing can prepared up to 2 days ahead, stored in an airtight container with a moist paper towel pressed directly on the icing surface, and refrigerated. This icing hardens into shiny white lines, and is used for piping decorations on gingerbread people or other cookies. Traditional royal icing uses raw egg whites, but I prefer dried egg-white powder, available at most supermarkets, to avoid any concern about uncooked egg whites. When using a pastry bag, practice your decorating skills before you ice the cookies. Just do a few trial runs to get the feel of the icing and the bag, piping the icing onto aluminum foil or wax paper. If you work quickly, you can use a metal spatula to scrape the test icing back into the batch. Dried egg-white powder is also available by mail order from The Baker&#39;s Catalogue, 1-800-827-6836. Meringue powder, which is dehydrated egg whites with sugar already added, also makes excellent royal icing; just follow the directions on the package. However, the plain unsweetened dried egg whites are more versatile, as they can be used in savory dishes, too. Meringue powder is available from Adventures in Cooking (1-800-305-1114) and The Baker&#39;s Catalogue. In a medium bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer at low speed, beat the confectioners&#39; sugar, egg-white powder and water until combined. Increase the speed to high and beat, scraping down the sides of the bowl often, until very stiff, shiny and thick enough to pipe; 3 to 5 minutes. (The icing can be prepared up to 2 days ahead, stored in an airtight container with a moist paper towel pressed directly on the icing surface, and refrigerated.) To pipe line decorations, use a pastry bag fitted with a tube with a small writing tip about 1/8-inch wide, such as Ateco No. 7; it may be too difficult to squeeze the icing out of smaller tips. If necessary, thin the icing with a little warm water. To fill the pastry bag, fit it with the tube. Fold the top of the bag back to form a cuff and hold it in one hand. (Or, place the bag in a tall glass and fold the top back to form a cuff.) Using a rubber spatula, scoop the icing into the bag. Unfold the cuff and twist the top of the bag closed. Squeeze the icing down to fill the tube. Always practice first on a sheet of wax paper or aluminum foil to check the flow and consistency of the icing. Traditional Royal Icing: Substitute 3 large egg whites for the powder and water. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24293,&quot;Painted Chocolate Palette 32 ounces white chocolate, tempered 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered Cocoa butter Powdered food coloring 40 bonbons, optional Instructions: Using the palette template provided, trace the shape onto a piece of cardboard and cut it out, creating a stencil. Spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of the white chocolate onto a sheet of parchment paper or acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly, about 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate will be firm enough to cut but it will not be hard. Place the cardboard stencil on top of the chocolate, and with the tip of a sharp paring knife, cut all the way through the chocolate, working quickly before the chocolate becomes too hard. Peel off the paper or acetate from what is now the top. Remove the cut palette and set aside for assembly. To make the paintbrushes, use a cornet half filled with bittersweet chocolate. Pipe a 1/8-inch-thick 4-inch-long line onto a clean sheet of parchment paper or acetate. Pipe an extra 1/2-inch teardrop at one end of the chocolate line. To make the paints, mix the cocoa butter and a small amount of powdered food coloring together (it will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints). Using a paintbrush, create paint spots on the palette, applying as many colors as you are inspired to do. To assemble, set the palette on a plate. Rest the ends of the paintbrush in the finger hold. Place chocolate bonbons on the palette near each paint color. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 24294,&quot;Apple Juniper Sausage 3 pounds freshly ground pork butt 90 grams finely diced dehydrated apple rings 28 grams kosher salt, plus more as needed 10 grams light brown sugar, plus more as needed 6 grams garlic powder 4 grams ground juniper berries 4 grams ground black pepper, plus more as needed 4 grams ground white pepper 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce 1/2 cup ice water 1 large egg 10 feet natural hog casings, rinsed and soaked Instructions: Place the pork, dehydrated apples, salt, brown sugar, garlic powder, juniper, black pepper, white pepper, applesauce, ice water and egg in a large enough mixing bowl to hold everything. Work the mixture by hand until the sausage comes together. You can tell it is ready to be stuffed when you can grab a chunk of it and turn your hand over, and it doesn\\u2019t fall off your hand. (It should take a couple of minutes.) Cook a little of the sausage mixture in a small frying pan until cooked through, then check for taste and to make sure it holds together. If the cooked sausage falls apart, then more mixing is required. If the taste doesn\\u2019t suit you, adjust as you see fit. Using a sausage stuffer, stuff the sausage into the casings and twist into 6-inch links. Cook fresh sausage links until an internal temperature of 160 degrees F is reached.

Sweat the garlic cloves in olive oil to infuse garlic flavor. Deglaze with muscat, verjuice and chicken stock. Add the fennel, thyme, salt, sugar, and peppercorns. Cover with parchment paper and braise until tender. Drain, cool and reserve juice (use to poach fish, if desired). While the fennel is cooling, place 1/2 tablespoon of butter in each of the cast iron pans. Put 1 tablespoon of sugar on top of the butter and sprinkle in a pinch of salt. Place 1 piece of fennel in each pan and cook over direct heat until caramel forms. Place a piece of semi-cooked tart pastry on top of each fennel and finish in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 5 minutes. Turn upside down and serve warm. Sift flour, sugar and salt together, cut in the butter. Using the well method, add the egg. Allow at least 30 minutes to rest. Roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thick and cut with a round cookie cutter, which would be the same size as the cast iron pans. Place the dough in between 2 sheets of parchment on a tray and chill.

Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl with the chocolate over, but not touching, the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue to heat until completely melted, about 1 minute more.) Meanwhile, bring the cream and honey to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat (or in the microwave). Gradually whisk the cream into the chocolate until smooth and shiny. Whisk in the butter until very smooth. If possible, switch to an immersion blender and blend for about 1 minute for a satiny texture. Cover the surface of the chocolate with plastic wrap; chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour. Transfer 2 tablespoons of the chocolate mixture to a small resealable plastic bag and snip a tiny piece off one corner. Twist the top of the bag to push the chocolate mixture down to the cut corner. Set the prepared bag aside.<br> Line a 13-by-9-inch baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop slightly rounded tablespoon-size portions from the remaining chilled chocolate mixture. With gloved hands, roll each portion into a ball. Refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes. Decorate the truffles: Let the truffles soften slightly at room temperature for about 10 minutes to make it easier to insert the almond slices. Using a tweezers if desired, gently insert a row of 8 almond slices pointed-ends down in the back of each truffle to make a fanned turkey tail. Press a candy corn, pointy-end facing toward you, on the top of each truffle to make the turkey&#39;s face and beak. Press an almond slice underneath each candy corn beak to make the turkey&#39;s waddle. Place two almond slices underneath each truffle to make the turkey&#39;s feet. Warm the reserved bag of chocolate mixture in the microwave until soft, 5 to 8 seconds. Squeeze the bag to pipe eyes onto the candy corn faces, and pipe decorative striped lines across the almond tails. Let set at room temperature for 30 minutes. Once set, the truffles can be held in a cool spot, out of the refrigerator, for up to 2 hours. Otherwise, refrigerate, covered, for up to 5 days. The truffles taste best if served at room temperature, not straight from the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24300,&quot;Monkfish Crazy Water Style 2 pounds monkfish fillet, skin removed and cut into chunks Salt Freshly ground white pepper 1 bottle dry white wine 4 cloves garlic, sliced 20 white pearl onions, peeled Olive oil 2 heads fennel, fronds removed, bulbs thinly sliced 1 pound fresh bay scallops 10 cherry tomatoes 1 bunch marjoram, picked leaves, roughly chopped Instructions: Begin by seasoning the monkfish chunks with salt and pepper. Pour the bottle of white wine into a large pot and cook over medium heat until the alcohol is cooked out. Turn the heat to medium-low, and add the sliced garlic. In a medium sized pan over high heat, saute the pearl onions in a small amount of olive oil until they begin to brown. Add these to the wine pot. Next, saute the sliced fennel over high heat with some olive oil until they brown, add these to the wine pot. Wait for the onions and fennel to become soft. In a medium pan over high heat, saute the monkfish chunks with olive oil until they begin to brown as well, add these to the wine pot. Repeat the same process with the bay scallops and add them to the wine pot. While all ingredients are in the wine pot, add salt and pepper, to taste. Finally add the tomatoes and marjoram to the pot and cover for 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 24301,&quot;Rainbow Sprinkles Layer Cake Flour-based baking spray, for the cake pans 6 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, sifted 3 tablespoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt 2 1/4 cups whole milk 2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups (3 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar 10 large egg whites, at room temperature Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet gel food colors 12 large egg whites 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt 2 1/2 pounds (10 sticks) unsalted butter, cubed, at room temperature 1 tablespoon clear vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups rainbow sprinkles 24 round rainbow candy-coated chocolates 1 tablespoon rainbow nonpareils 2 2/3 cups mini marshmallows 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted, plus more for kneading 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet gel food colors Instructions: For the cake layers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat six 8-inch round cake pans with flour-based baking spray (or grease and flour pans). Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Combine the milk and vanilla in a large liquid measure with a pour spout. Beat the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. With the mixer running, gradually add the granulated sugar and beat until the mixture turns pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the milk mixture. Begin and end with the flour. Mix until just combined. Beat the egg whites in a spotlessly clean bowl on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter in 3 additions. Place 2 cups of the cake batter in 6 separate bowls. Tint each bowl of batter with a different gel food color, so that you have a bowl of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet batter. Fold the color in well with a rubber spatula until no streaks of white cake batter remain. Spread the batter into the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Turn the cakes out onto wire racks to cool completely. When the cakes are cool, level the tops with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. For the Swiss meringue buttercream: Set a saucepan filled one-third full of water over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Whisk together the egg whites, granulated sugar and salt in a large heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over the simmering water and whisk until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar has dissolved (120 to 140 degrees F on a candy thermometer). Transfer the mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Increase to medium high until stiff peaks form. Continue beating at medium-high speed until the mixture is fluffy and has cooled (the mixing bowl should feel cool to the touch). Turn the mixer off and switch from the whisk attachment to the paddle. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed and add the butter a few cubes at a time, beating until well incorporated before the next addition (see Cook&#39;s Note). Add the vanilla extract. Beat on high speed until the frosting is thick and completely smooth.<br> Frost the cake: Transfer 1 cup of frosting to a piping bag fitted with a small star tip; set aside. Top each cake layer with a small amount of frosting. Begin with the violet cake layer on the bottom, followed by the blue, green, yellow, orange and red. Cover the entire cake with frosting using an offset spatula and smooth the frosting with a bench scraper or frosting smoother. Place the cake in a large dish and use a cupped hand to press on the rainbow sprinkles, allowing the excess to fall back into the dish. Repeat until the bottom two-thirds of the cake is covered with the sprinkles. Using the reserved frosting in the piping bag, pipe stars around the top edge and center of the cake, and around the bottom edge of the cake. Decorate each star on the top edge of the cake with alternating colors of the round candies. Scatter rainbow nonpareils over the bottom edge. Add more rainbow sprinkles to the top center of the cake. For the marshmallow fondant bunting: Combine the marshmallows and 1 1/2 teaspoons water in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30-second intervals at 100% power, stirring in between each, until melted and smooth, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup of sifted confectioners&#39; sugar to the melted marshmallow and stir to combine. When the first cup is thoroughly mixed in, add the second cup of confectioners&#39; sugar. Stir well until stiff. Grease a work surface with the vegetable shortening and transfer the fondant from the bowl to the greased area. Knead well until smooth and pliable. The fondant should not be sticky and it should hold its shape firmly when rolled into a ball. If the ball relaxes and loses its shape, knead in more confectioners&#39; sugar a little at a time. Roll the fondant into a ball and cut into 6 even pieces. Tint each ball with the food colors so that you have one of each: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. (Wear gloves during kneading to avoid staining hands.) Roll out each piece of fondant to 1/8 inch thickness on a piece of parchment paper. Use a 1 1/2-inch triangle cutter to stamp shapes from each piece of fondant. Place the triangles end-to-end in a swag design around the top edge of the cake, in rainbow color order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet). If the pieces do not naturally stick to the frosting, add a small dot of water to the backs of the triangles to adhere them to the cake. Serve eye-popping slices of rainbow cake to delighted guests. If there are leftovers, cover the cake loosely with plastic wrap and store at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24302,&quot;Banana Crunch Muffins 3 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 pound unsalted butter, melted and cooled 2 extra-large eggs 3/4 cup whole milk 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 cup mashed ripe bananas (2 bananas) 1 cup medium-diced ripe bananas (1 banana) 1 cup small-diced walnuts 1 cup granola 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut Dried banana chips, granola, or shredded coconut, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Put the potato sticks in a large bowl, cover with cold water and swish them around to get off the extra starch. Pour off the starchy water and add fresh water. Continue washing the potatoes until the water runs clear. Cover with water again and allow them to soak for 2 or 3 hours. (You can also stick them in the fridge and let them soak for up to 3 days.) When you&#39;re ready to make the fries, drain off the water and lay the potatoes sticks on baking sheets lined with paper towels. Blot them with more paper towels to dry them. Heat a few inches of oil in a heavy pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 300 degrees F. In 3 or 4 batches, cook the potatoes until soft, about 1 minute per batch. They should not be brown at all at this point! You just want to start the cooking process. Remove each batch and drain them on new/dry paper towels. When all the potatoes have been fried once, turn up the heat until the oil reaches 400 degrees F. Start frying the potatoes in batches again, cooking until the fries are golden and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle the fries with sea salt and dive in! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 24322,&quot;Wild Mushroom Custard with Asparagus-Truffle Sauce 2 to 4 ounces of butter 2 sliced white onions 2 cloves of garlic, sliced 2 cups of water 2 cups asparagus, top part only from naturally breaking.

Season with salt and pepper. Wrap each piece tightly in prosciutto. Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat until hot. Add the zucchini and saute until the prosciutto is crispy but the zucchini is still nearly raw, about 5 minutes. Drizzle drops of Mango Sauce and Caramelized Onion Sauce alternately on the zucchini batons. Serve about 4 batons per person. Serve immediately. Heat a dry saute pan on the stove over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, tilt the pan and add the extra-virgin olive oil. Add the onions, gray salt, and a twist of pepper. Lower the heat to medium and saute, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the onions are caramelized. Add 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme, if using, at end of cooking. Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender** (see Chef&#39;s Tip). Cover the blender tightly. Place a towel over the top of the blender and hold down. Pureeing hot liquids can be dangerous as they can burst from the blender and scald you. Puree the onions until smooth, adding a little water if the sauce is too thick. Whatever the finished volume is of onions, add 25 percent Champagne vinegar and puree until smooth. Caramelized Onion sauce can be stored in refrigerator up to a month. *Chef&#39;s Tip: you can replace vinegar with lemon juice. **When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. *Chef&#39;s Tip: this is a ratio, not a recipe. Whatever finished volume is, vinegar is 25 percent (Example: 2 cups mangoes takes 1/2 cup of vinegar) In a blender, puree the mangoes, sugar syrup, and salt. Add vinegar and taste for balance. Add more vinegar and thin with water, if necessary. Strain through a fine strainer into a bowl. Mango vinegar can be stored in refrigerator up to a month. Chef&#39;s tip: you can use any kind of fruit and vinegar \\u2013 you can replace vinegar with lemon juice. Herb vinegars don&#39;t work in this method.

Add the lemon zest and olives and cook for 1 more minute. Add the white wine, deglaze the pan, and let it reduce for a 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the stock, canned tomatoes, sugar, red pepper flakes, and cinnamon, and simmer to blend flavors, about 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. To make the Meatballs: In a medium bowl, add the egg and tomato paste and stir until smooth. Add the cilantro, ginger, cumin, and cinnamon and mix until well blended. Stir in the ground beef and oats, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and combine gently after each addition. Do not overmix. Rolling with your hands, make about 32 meatballs, about 1-inch in diameter. In a large saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium heat, and brown the meatballs in batches until golden on all sides. Add more oil, as needed. Transfer the meatballs to the pan with the sauce and let simmer for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve over the Couscous with Dried Dates. Couscous with Dried Dates: Bring the water, stock, and oil to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the dates followed by the couscous. Cover the pan tightly with a lid, remove from the heat, and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve.

Then add the onions and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the carrots and celery, and then stir and cook for a couple more minutes. Throw in the cauliflower. Then stir it around, cover and cook over very low heat for 15 minutes. Add the parsley, and then add the chicken broth and simmer for 10 minutes. Meantime, make a simple white sauce: Melt the remaining 1/2stick butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Then whisk in the flour. Cook for a couple of minutes, and then pour in the milk, whisking to combine. Remove the white sauce from the heat and pour in the half-and-half. Then pour this creamy mixture into the pot. Add 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste, and allow the soup to simmer for another 20 to 30 minutes. The soup will thicken slightly but shouldn&#39;t be overly thick. Give it a taste and add more salt if needed. Now, this is the fun part: To serve the soup, place the room temperature sour cream in the bottom of a soup tureen (a very large serving bowl). Then add the whole pot of hot soup to the tureen.<br> Stir gently to combine, and then serve immediately with warm rolls and an appetite for something wonderful.

Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper. Add half the beef to the pot and cook until browned on at least 2 sides, about 6 minutes total. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining beef, leaving it in the pot after it\\u2019s browned. Add the beef from the plate and any accumulated juices back to the pot and cover with 6 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and gently simmer, occasionally skimming off any scum and fat, until tender but not falling apart, about 1 1/2 hours.<br> Transfer the cooked beef to a plate and set aside. Measure out 4 cups of the broth, leaving any sediment in the pot, and set aside. (If you don\\u2019t have enough broth, make up the difference with water. If you have extra broth, reserve it for thinning the curry later, if needed.)<br> Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and sweat, stirring occasionally, until just softened, about 6 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring often, for about 1 minute.<br> Add the flour and cook, stirring often and breaking up any clumps of onion and flour, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the curry powder, garam masala and cayenne pepper and cook, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute.<br> Slowly whisk in the 4 cups reserved broth and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Add the carrots, potatoes and grated apple and simmer, adjusting the heat as needed and stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are almost tender, about 15 minutes.<br> Add the cooked beef and any accumulated juices and simmer, stirring often so the curry doesn\\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot, until the vegetables are completely tender, about 10 minutes more. Let sit for about 15 minutes for the flavors to meld.<br> If the curry looks too thick, thin with a little of the extra broth or water. Add salt and/or more cayenne, if needed.<br> Serve in shallow bowls or deep plates alongside the white rice and fukujinzuke or beni shoga.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 24346,&quot;Carnitas Tacos with Spicy Slaw 1 (1 1/2-pound) pork tenderloin 3 teaspoon Mexican taco seasoning 1/4 cup enchilada sauce 1/3 cup chopped onions 2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped 1/4 cup sour cream 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons Chipotle hot sauce 2 teaspoons chili lime seasoning 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 (16-ounce) bag coleslaw mix 8 (6-inch) white corn tortillas 1 lime, cut into wedges for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Remove pork roast from package. Season with 2 teaspoons Mexican taco seasoning. Place on a preheated oiled grill pan and sear all sides, about 2 minutes per side. While pork is searing in a 9 by 13-inch baking dish, combine enchilada sauce, onions, cilantro, and remaining Mexican taco seasoning. Add pork roast cover with foil, place in oven and roast for 25 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 155 to 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. In a small bowl combined the sour cream, mayonnaise, chipotle sauce, chili lime seasoning, and lime juice. Mix well until blended. In a large bowl add the coleslaw and pour the sour cream mayonnaise mixture over top and toss well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Place tortillas on a microwave-safe plate, cover with moist paper towel and heat in microwave on HIGH for 45 seconds. Slice pork and divide between heated tortillas, top with some of the sauce from the baking dish, the spicy slaw and garnish with lime wedge. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 24347,&quot;Moravian Molasses Cookies 1 quart unsulfured molasses 1 pound light brown sugar 12 oz (3/4 lb) lard 4 oz (1 stick) margarine<br> About 4 pounds all-purpose flour<br> 4 tablespoons fresh ground cloves 4 tablespoons fresh cinnamon 2 tablespoons fresh ground ginger 3 level tablespoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Melt the margarine and lard together and set aside to cool to lukewarm. Put the molasses in a very large and heavy smooth-bottomed pot. Stir in the cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and the brown sugar. Turn to medium-high and start stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture is warm, the sugar has dissolved, and all the spices are incorporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Do NOT bring it to a boil. Put the salt and soda in a cup or small bowl and mix it with about 3 tablespoons flour in a cup. Add that to the molasses mixture. Stir until completely dissolved, mashing any particles of soda against the side of the pot so that every bit is incorporated.<br> Pour in the cooled margarine and lard, and beat with a wooden spoon until completely blended. Allow the whole mixture to cool before adding the flour, or the dough will absorb more flour. Add about one-third of the flour mixture and stir well with a wooden spoon. Add the second third of flour and continue to mix. Take the remaining third of flour and sprinkle a work surface thickly with some of it. Scrape all the dough out onto the floured surface, and begin to knead, flouring your hands frequently while you incorporate the remaining flour.<br> When the dough has become stiff and firm and far less sticky, roll it into a long tube and cut it into eight pieces, which will weigh roughly one pound each. Shape each ball into a disk, slapping the surface with your hands to smooth it (you&#39;ll see the lard rise to the surface, making each disk kind of shiny). Put four disks of dough in each of two large plastic bags and seal. Allow to sit overnight on the countertop. The dough will swell some and the spice flavors will mellow and blend.<br> When you&#39;re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Cover a pastry or rolling board (or a square piece of plywood) with bleached muslin that&#39;s been washed several times, tacking it tightly around the edges. Flour the muslin and rub the flour into the cloth to coat it deeply. Roll the cookies as thin as possible, 1/16 to 1/32 of an inch. Cut with any cookie cutter you like, using tiny cutters such as hearts or circles to cut out little cookies in the spaces between larger cookies. (You can also gather the scraps and reroll, but these cookies won&#39;t be as tender.) Lift the cookies onto an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Watch them, and don&#39;t let the cookies brown around the edges. Allow to cool on the pan for several minutes before lifting them onto cooling racks. As soon as they&#39;re completely cool, pack and store in an airtight container. If you&#39;re using cookie tins, seal the lid of the tin with masking tape. Any air creeping in will cause the cookies to soften. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 24348,&quot;Vermont Cheddar and Ale Soup 2 tablespoons butter 1 large onion, diced 2 carrots, diced 2 ribs celery, diced 1 red bell pepper, diced 2 tablespoons thyme 1 chef potato, peeled, diced 8 cups chicken stock 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup flour 12 ounces Otter Creek Copper Ale 4 cups milk 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 3 dashes Worcestershire sauce 2 dashes hot pepper sauce 1 tablespoon Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 cups plus 1 cup Grafton Vermont cheddar cheese Chopped parsley Instructions: In butter sweat onion, carrots, celery and pepper over medium heat for 15 minutes, until soft.

Butter a 9 or 10-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Flour the sides of the pan with sifted matzo cake meal. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add 1/2 cup of the sugar and continue whipping just until stiff and glossy, about 30 seconds more. In another bowl, whip the egg yolks with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Fold in the egg whites. Gently fold in the ground almonds, chopped almonds, matzo meal, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until dry and spongy in the center, about 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes in the pan, then remove the sides of the pan and let cool completely on a wire rack. The cake will fall somewhat. Make the glaze: In a small bowl, stir the ingredients together until smooth, adding lemon juice as needed until the glaze is pour-able. Set the wire rack holding the cake on a sheet pan. Drizzle the glaze generously over the top of the cake, letting it trickle down the sides. Using a flexible spatula or pastry brush, gently spread the glaze over the sides of the cake, reusing any glaze that drips onto the baking sheet. Let set for at least 30 minutes before serving, or until the glaze is hardened. Transfer the cake to a serving platter, removing the pan bottom and parchment paper if desired. In a medium saucepan, bring the jam and water to a boil, stirring to break up any lumps. Working quickly, add the strawberries all at once and fold together with a spatula until evenly coated. Pour into the sunken center of the cake and gently spread into a circle on the surface, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border all around. Let cool until set, about 30 minutes. Use a very sharp knife for slicing the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 24353,&quot;Falafel 1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight 2 cloves garlic 1 bay leaf 1 carrot, peeled 1 rib celery 1 bundle fresh thyme 1/2 Spanish onion Kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh Italian parsley 1/4 cup breadcrumbs 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped 2 to 3 grates lemon zest 1/2 Spanish onion, small diced Flour, for dusting Kosher salt Pita bread Chopped lettuce Diced tomatoes Peeled, diced cucumbers Tahini Sauce, recipe follows 1 cup tahini 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro 2 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped Pinch cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt Instructions: Peanut or other neutrally flavored oil, for frying To cook the chickpeas: Drain the chickpeas from the soaking water and place in a medium saucepan. Toss in the garlic, bay leaf, carrot, celery, thyme and onion. Add water to the pan until it covers the chickpeas by about 2 inches of water. Put the pan on a high heat and bring the water to a boil, reduce to a simmer and simmer until the chickpeas are very soft and tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Turn the heat off. Season the water generously with salt and let sit for 15 minutes. Drain the chickpeas from the cooking liquid and remove the veggies, bay leaf and thyme and discard. To make the falafel: In a food processor, pulse the chickpeas until they look coarse and grainy but are NOT a puree. In a dry saute pan, toast the coriander and cumin seeds over medium heat until they are very aromatic, 3 to 4 minutes. Pulverize in a spice grinder until they are a powder. Transfer the pulsed chickpeas to a mixing bowl and add the cilantro, parsley, breadcrumbs, cayenne, garlic, lemon zest, onions and ground spices. Gently stir to combine. Taste the mixture to see if the mix needs seasoning, season with salt if needed. Form the mixture into balls the size of walnuts and gently press to make patties. Lightly dust with flour on both sides and pat off excess. Place the patties on a sheet tray and let hang out in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Add oil to a large straight-sided saute pan until the oil is about 1/2-inch deep. Bring the oil to a medium-high heat. Add the falafel to the pan and fry them on both sides until they are brown and crispy. Remove the falafel from the pan and dry on paper towels. Serve the falafel in pitas with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and Tahini Sauce. In the food processor, combine the tahini, lemon juice, cilantro, garlic and cayenne. Puree until smooth.

Grease 2 9-inch round cake pans. Mix all the ingredients together in the bowl of a standing mixer with a paddle attachment. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Divide batter between the prepared pans and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pan a few minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Place 1 cooled cake onto a cake platter. Ice just the top half with the Crusting Buttercream Icing. Place the second cake on top. Lightly ice the sides and top of cake. Gently place your hands on top of the iced cake and press down softly. Doing this helps to mold the cake to the pressure of when the fondant goes onto the cake. It will deter the cake from getting a visible ring that will show through when fondant covers the cake. After the fondant has sat in the fridge it will be hard. When ready to use, place in the microwave for a few seconds, maybe 10 seconds at a time, as to soften but not melt. Once it&#39;s a little softer it will be ready to work with. Start kneading away on a powdered sugar covered surface just to wake it up a little. Flour the surface and the rolling pin with powdered sugar. Roll the fondant to a thickness of about 1/4-inch. Roll the fondant around the rolling pin to transfer it to the top of the cake. Use your fingers to position the fondant gently on top of the cake, smooth out the top and sides. Cut away the excess with a knife, using the bottom of the cake as the guide. With the extra fondant, cut out designs either by hand or using a cookie cutter. Place the designs onto the cake. Use a dab of water to act as the glue to adhere the designs to cake. A viewer, who may not be a professional cook, provided this recipe. The Food Network Kitchens chefs have not tested this recipe and therefore, we cannot make representation as to the results. Cream the shortening in the bowl of a standing mixer with a paddle attachment. Add the vanilla and butter flavorings. Add the powdered coffee creamer to the water and stir. Once the coffee creamer is dissolved, add this mixture to the shortening and mix on low until the water is incorporated into the shortening. Slowly add the powdered sugar into the shortening, mixing on low speed. Cook&#39;s Note: Once the powdered sugar is added, you may need to add a little more water depending on what consistency you want your icing. Combine the powdered sugar and salt and spread out on the counter to make a 12-inch circle. Coat the inside of a large microwave-safe bowl with shortening. Place the marshmallows, flavorings, and water and/or colorings in the bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute (the marshmallows should be puffy). Stir the mixture with a rubber spatula and place back in the microwave for 30 second intervals, or until the marshmallows are melted and smooth when stirred. (While this mixture is in the microwave, coat your hands with shortening as the fondant is sticky and messy.) Once the marshmallows are melted and smooth, transfer the contents of the bowl onto the powdered sugar. Start working the sugar into the melted mixture, kneading it like you would bread dough. Continue kneading until the mixture loses its stickiness; you may have to add more powdered sugar. You&#39;ll know when it&#39;s ready if the fondant forms into a ball. Coat the fondant ball well with shortening and wrap in plastic wrap. Place the fondant in refrigerator for at least 6 to 8 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 24358,&quot;Seven-Layer Dip Cake Cooking spray 1 16- to 18-ounce box yellow cake mix (plus required ingredients) 1 3.4-ounce box instant vanilla pudding (plus required ingredients) 1 to 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1 1/2 pounds strawberries 2 cups coconut flakes Yellow, green, black and red food coloring 1 cup yellow candy melts 1/4 cup orange candy melts 8 maraschino cherries 1 1/2 cups whipped cream 1 16-ounce tub vanilla frosting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

For the refried beans, make the pudding as the label directs; fold in the cocoa powder until combined. Transfer to a large resealable plastic bag and refrigerate until ready to use. For the salsa, hull the strawberries and finely chop. Mash with a fork until juicy; set aside. For the lettuce, combine the coconut, 2 drops yellow food coloring, 1 drop green food coloring and 2 teaspoons water in a resealable plastic bag; shake and massage to distribute the color. For the cheese, melt the yellow and orange candy melts together in the microwave, stirring, until smooth. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip a small corner. Make lines back and forth on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets; let set. For the olives, thinly slice the cherries; combine with 3 to 4 drops black food coloring in a resealable plastic bag and shake to distribute the color. Transfer to a paper towel?lined plate; blot dry. Stack the cakes and trim with a paring knife so that they are about 1 1/2 inches smaller in diameter than your serving bowl. Transfer 1 cake to the bowl. Pipe the pudding around the cake and up against the glass bowl; stop when the pudding is about three-quarters of the way up the side of the cake. For the sour cream, put the whipped cream in a resealable plastic bag. Pipe on top of the pudding and cake. Place the second cake on top. For the guacamole, tint the frosting with yellow and green food coloring, plus a few drops of red. Transfer to another resealable plastic bag; pipe around the second cake layer.
