Set aside. Combine the butter, shortening, brown sugar and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the molasses, vanilla and egg and beat on medium until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the sifted flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined into a smooth dough, about 1 minute. Form the dough into a flat square, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until just firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Meanwhile, make templates for the gingerbread house. Gather 3 sheets of stiff paper or 2 manila folders (split at the seam), scissors, a ruler and a pencil. For the side panels, draw and cut out a rectangle that measures 4 by 7 inches. For the front and back panels of a house with a peaked roof, draw and cut out a template that is 6 inches wide at the base, 4 inches to the roofline and 4 1/2 inches slanted to a peak. The template for the roof panels should measure 4 1/2 by 8 inches. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment paper.<br> Unwrap the dough and cut into 3 equal pieces (a pizza wheel is handy for this). Working with 1 piece of dough at a time and keeping the other pieces refrigerated, roll the dough into a rectangle 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Using the template, cut out the side panels and remove the scraps around the cutouts. Repeat with the remaining 2 pieces of dough, cutting out the front and back panels and 2 roof panels. If the dough gets too soft while rolling, return it to the refrigerator for 15 minutes before proceeding. (Discard the dough scraps or reroll to make cookies.) Chill the dough pieces on the prepared baking sheets for 15 minutes. Bake the dough pieces until crisp almost all the way through (the very center will still be a little soft), 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans 10 minutes on a rack, then remove the house pieces to the rack to cool completely.<br> For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add the vanilla extract, peppermint extract and 5 tablespoons water and beat on medium-high speed with an electric mixer, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, about 2 minutes, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water if needed. Divide the icing between the 2 prepared piping bags (one fitted with a small plain tip and the other fitted with a large plain tip).<br> Decorate the side panels: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe icing to draw 2 windows on 1 of the side panels. Pipe icing onto the backs of 4 of the pieces of peppermint gummy candy and attach them to the sides of the windows for shutters. Create a decorative trim by piping 12 dots along the top of the panel; attach 6 of the candy-coated chocolates by pressing them onto every other dot. Repeat with the second side panel. Let the panels rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Decorate the front panel: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe a double line of icing across the front panel where the roof starts to incline; press on half of the white jelly beans. Pipe a large dot of icing onto the back of 1 of the green gumdrops and attach it to the panel just above the line of jelly beans; pipe a small dot of icing in the center of the gumdrop and add a red cinnamon candy. Pipe icing to draw a door; attach a red cinnamon candy with a dot of icing to make a doorknob. Pipe icing to draw 2 windows and press a red cinnamon candy into each corner of each window. Pipe icing onto the backs of 6 of the gummy bears and attach 3 on either side of the door. Let the panel rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Decorate the back panel: Using the piping bag fitted with the small tip, pipe a double line of icing across the back panel where the roof starts to incline; press on the remaining white jelly beans. Pipe a large dot of icing onto the back of the remaining green gumdrop and attach it to the back panel just above the line of jelly beans; pipe a small dot of icing in the center of the gumdrop and add a red cinnamon candy. Pipe icing to draw 2 windows and press a red cinnamon candy into each corner of each window. Pipe icing onto the backs of the remaining 9 gummy bears and attach them along the bottom of the panel in a row. Let the panel rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Decorate the roof panels: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe dots of icing onto the backs of 8 of the white chocolate melting wafers and attach them to the bottom edge of 1 of the roof panels to create a row of roof tiles. To lay down the \\glue\\ for the next row of wafers, pipe short lines (about 1/2 inch each), starting on the roof panel above each wafer and finishing in the center of each wafer. For the second row of tiles, place a wafer on top of each icing line to affix it to the roof, partially overlapping the wafers in the first row. Continue piping lines and adding wafers in overlapping rows until the entire panel is covered. You should have about 6 rows, depending on the size of your wafers. Repeat with the second roof panel. Using a fine mesh strainer, dust the panels with confectioners&#39; sugar. Let the panels rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Assemble the walls: Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe a 6-inch line of icing onto the foil-wrapped base (this will be for the front of the house). Press the front panel into the icing and pipe a line of icing along the inside of the panel at the base to reinforce it. Prop up the front panel with a can. Pipe a 7-inch line of icing perpendicular to the front panel. Pipe icing up the edge of 1 of the side panels. Press the side panel into the icing on the base and against the edge of the front panel, creating a corner. Pipe a line of icing along the inside of the side panel on the base to reinforce it. Prop up the side with a can. Repeat the process with the remaining side panel and the back panel. Let the house rest until the icing is firmly set, at least 1 hour. Attach the roof: Gently test the walls to make sure the icing is set. If they give, let the house rest until firm. (If you add the roof too soon, the house will collapse.) Once the walls are set, remove the cans. Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe icing along the angled roof edges on 1 side of the house. Pipe icing onto the unfrosted side of 1 of the roof panels along the 2 short edges (where the roof will attach to the slanted edges of the house). Press the panel onto the house and hold it in place until the icing sets, about 5 minutes. Repeat with the other side and the remaining roof panel. Let the roof set until completely dry, 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br> Landscape the yard: Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe a rectangular walkway in front of the house; line the edges with white sprinkle-coated gummy candies and pave the middle with crushed rock candy. Use the piping bag fitted with a large tip to pipe icing snowdrifts around the walkway and the base of the house. While the snowdrifts are still wet, sprinkle them with pearl sugar. Attach a row of sprinkle-coated gummies along the bottom of each side panel by pressing them into the snowdrifts. Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe icing along the top seam of the house where the roof panels connect; line with a row of the mini marshmallows. Dust the house with confectioners&#39; sugar and let rest until dry. &quot;,&quot;The wine types that would pair well with this recipe are Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, and Grenache. These wines have flavors that complement the sweet and spicy notes in the gingerbread and peppermint flavors without overpowering them. Pinot Noir has light and fruity flavors that will enhance the sweetness of the gingerbread, while Beaujolais has a hint of fruit&quot; 4323,&quot;Vegetable Gateau 2 medium eggplant 5 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound spinach, wash and remove stems 1 large onion, peeled and sliced thin 6 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed 1 medium fennel, core removed and sliced thin 2 bay leaves 1/4 teaspoon each of dried or fresh chopped thyme and oregano 6 large ripe tomatoes, large dice 10 basil leaves, washed and sliced thin Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Remove stems and peel eggplants. Slice each lengthwise 1/4 inch thick. Lay out on a baking tray, slightly overlapping each other. Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil over them and season with salt and pepper. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes, until fairly soft. Bring 2 ounces lightly salted water and 1 tablespoon olive oil to boil. Add spinach and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and drain. Later squeeze out all water. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium sized pot, add onion, garlic, fennel, bay leaves, thyme, and oregano. Saute a few minutes then add fresh tomatoes and basil and season to taste. Simmer uncovered for 15 minutes and strain tomato compote, reserve juices. In a lightly oiled baking dish cover the bottom with half of the eggplant, slightly overlapped, then all of the spinach. Add the tomato compote. Cover with the remaining half of the eggplant. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Serve hot. Top with reduced juices of tomato compote &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 4324,&quot;Hearts of Romaine, Palm and Artichoke with Citrus Dijon Dressing 2 hearts romaine lettuce, chopped 1 (15-ounce) can hearts of palm, drained and sliced 1-inch thick on a bias 1 (15-ounce) can artichoke hearts in water, drained and quartered 1/4 cup orange marmalade 1 lemon, juiced 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted Instructions: Arrange romaine lettuce, hearts of palm and artichokes on large platter. Combine the marmalade with lemon juice, mustard, season with salt and pepper and whisk in the olive oil slowly. Pour dressing evenly over salad when ready to serve. Garnish with toasted sliced almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 4325,&quot;Orange Marmalade 1 3/4 pounds oranges, 4 to 5 medium 1 lemon, zest finely grated and juiced 6 cups water 3 pounds plus 12 ounces sugar Instructions: Wash the oranges and lemon thoroughly. Cut the oranges into 1/8-inch slices using a mandoline, removing the seeds as you go. Stack the orange slices and cut them into quarters. Place the oranges into an 8-quart stainless steel pot. Add the lemon zest and juice and the water to the pot, set over high heat and bring to a boil, approximately 10 minutes. Once boiling, reduce the heat to maintain a rapid simmer and cook, stirring frequently, for 40 minutes or until the fruit is very soft. While the fruit is cooking, fill a large pot (at least 12-quart) 3/4 full with water, set over high heat and bring to a boil. Place 10 (8-ounce) jars and rings, canning funnel, ladle, and tongs into the boiling water and make sure the water covers the jars by at least an inch. Boil for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, add the lids and leave everything in the pot until the marmalade is ready. Meanwhile, place a small plate in the freezer. Increase the heat under the orange mixture to return to full boil. Add the sugar and stir the mixture continually, until it reaches 222 to 223 degrees F on a deep-fry or candy thermometer, and darkens in color, approximately 15 to 20 minutes. You may need to adjust the heat in order to prevent boil over. Test the readiness of the marmalade by placing a teaspoon of the mixture onto the chilled plate and allowing it to sit for 30 seconds. Tilt the plate. The mixture should be a soft gel that moves slightly. If mixture is thin and runs easily, it is not ready. Remove jars from the water and drain on a clean towel. Place a canning funnel onto the top of 1 of the jars and ladle in the marmalade just to below the bottom of the threads of the jar. Repeat until all of the mixture has been used. The amount of marmalade may vary by 1 to 2 jars. Wipe the rims and threads of the jars with a moist paper towel and top each with a lid. Place a ring on each jar and tighten. Return the jars to the pot with boiling water, being certain that they don&#39;t touch the bottom of the pot or each other. (If you don&#39;t have a jar rack, try a round cake rack, or metal mesh basket. Even a folded kitchen towel on the pot bottom will do in a pinch.) Add additional water if necessary to cover the jars by at least an inch. Boil for 10 minutes. Using canning tongs, carefully remove the jars from the water, place in a cool dry place and allow to sit at room temperature for at least 24 hours before opening. Once open, store in the refrigerator. Unopened marmalade will last for up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4326,&quot;Mango Ginger Martini Ice 2 shots mango rum 2 shots mango nectar 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger Champagne Instructions: To a martini shaker filled with ice, add all ingredients except Champagne.

In a large bowl, toss the wings with the salt mixture to evenly coat. Preheat a gas grill to medium heat (about 350 degrees F). Place the wings on the grill, crowding them together so that they are all touching (this goes against the conventional wisdom of giving meat room so it doesn&#39;t steam; you want them to steam so that they stay moist). Grill, flipping the wings every 5 minutes, for a total of 20 minutes of cooking. In the meantime, heat the butter, hot sauce, vinegar and honey in a saucepan over low heat and whisk to combine. In a clean large bowl, toss the wings with the sauce. Turn the heat up on the grill to medium high. Use tongs to remove the wings from the sauce and put them back on the grill until the skins crisp, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow the peppers to steam about 10 minutes. Once cool to the touch, remove the peppers from the bowl and pull off the charred skin and stems and remove the seeds. Slice and set aside until ready to use. Set a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, then the shallots and garlic; season with salt and pepper and cook until the garlic is fragrant and the shallots are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and wine and cook until most of the wine has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add both cans of tomatoes and the roasted red peppers. Mix well and bring to a steady boil, then reduce the heat so the sauce simmers. Meanwhile, prepare the kale by removing and discarding the stems; tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. Fold the kale into the tomato sauce along with the chicken and toss to combine. Cover and cook until the kale has wilted, about 5 minutes. If the sauce seems dry, add the chicken stock 1/2 cup at a time. Continue cooking, covered, until the kale is tender, all the flavors have come together and the sauce is thick, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve about 1 cup cooking water, then drain the pasta and add it directly to the Dutch oven with the finished sauce. Drizzle in some olive oil. Cook over low heat, tossing to coat everything, 2 to 3 minutes. (This allows the last cooking of the pasta to be done in the sauce.) Add a little of the reserved pasta water if needed. Serve the pasta in large bowls and top with spoonfuls of parmesan, more red pepper flakes and another drizzle of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 4363,&quot;Meyer Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with Macerated Strawberry Coulis 1 quart strawberries, topped and quartered 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup orange juice 2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus a pinch for egg whites 1 heaping teaspoon baking powder 4 eggs, separated 1 heaping cup ricotta cheese 3/4 cup milk 2 Meyer lemons, zested and juiced Butter, for cooking the pancakes Powdered sugar, for dusting Instructions: Toss the strawberries with the sugar and orange juice. Cover and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. After the berries and sugar have macerated and become very juicy, remove 1/2 of the berry mixture, put it in a food processor and puree until smooth. Return it to the rest of the berries and reserve until ready to use. Sift together all of the dry ingredients in a large bowl. In another bowl, combine the egg yolks, ricotta, milk and lemon zest and juice, and mix until it becomes homogeneous. Make a well in the dry ingredients, add the wet ingredients to the well and whisk until combined. Preheat a griddle. In another bowl, using a whisk or electric mixer, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt to stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the flour mixture in thirds. Do this quickly and gently so the pancakes will be light and fluffy. Melt small pats of butter onto the preheated griddle, and spread it around with a paper towel to remove any excess butter. Spoon or ladle the pancake batter onto the prepared griddle to desired size of the pancake. When the top of the pancake is full of holes, like bubbles have risen to the surface and burst, the pancake is ready to flip. Flip the cakes and cook until the bottom is golden brown. Remove the pancakes from the grill to serving plates. Top with the macerated strawberry coulis and garnish with powdered sugar.

Refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours and up to 8 hours. For the sauce: Heat the butter in a large nonreactive skillet. Add the onion and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until coppery brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the ground coriander and the thyme, and stir to combine. Add the pureed tomatoes, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, the bay leaf and the lemon zest. Cook, uncovered, over medium-low heat until the sauce thickens, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the lemon juice, horseradish, cayenne and sugar, and taste for seasoning. Pour the sauce into a small bowl and let cool to room temperature before serving. (You can make the cocktail sauce up to 3 days ahead and keep refrigerated.) For the shrimp: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. When hot, place a heavy sheet pan in the oven to preheat for a couple of minutes. Add the marinated shrimp to the hot pan in a single, well-spaced layer. Roast the shrimp until curled into a \\C\\ shape and pearly-white throughout, about 10 minutes. To serve: Arrange the lettuce leaves and the shrimp on separate platters, with the cocktail sauce on the side. Have guests assemble their own wraps: one shrimp per lettuce leaf, with a healthy dollop of cocktail sauce on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4367,&quot;\\Miss\\ Mickey&#39;s Peanut Butter Balls 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup dark corn syrup 1/2 cup white corn syrup 2 cups crunchy peanut butter 4 cups rice cereal Instructions: In a large saucepan, stir the sugar and the syrups together over medium heat.

Add the onions and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, harissa, smoked paprika, red pepper flakes, another good pinch of salt and a few turns of black pepper. Cook until it&#39;s all dreamy-smelly, another 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, followed by the chopped tomatoes and sugar, and simmer until slightly thickened, 10 minutes more. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings. Make 8 little wells in the sauce and crack in the eggs. Simmer until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny, about 10 minutes. (You can either baste the eggs with sauce during cooking or just let them be in a sunny-side-up situation.) Off the heat, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle the eggs with a little salt and pepper.

In a small saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups of the milk, the sugar, and vanilla. Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat. Sprinkle the gelatin over the remaining 1/2 cup cold milk and let dissolve for 2 minutes. Combine the cold milk and gelatin with the hot milk and sugar. Stir to dissolve the gelatin, about 5 minutes. (Heat the milk gently if the gelatin is not dissolving easily.) When the gelatin is dissolved combine the eggs with the warm milk, whisking constantly to avoid scrambling the eggs. Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a large measuring cup or small pitcher. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate over a double boiler. When the chocolate is melted gradually combine the milk and egg mixture with the melted chocolate, stirring between each addition to create a smooth chocolate mixture. Pour the mixture into a buttered 2-quart casserole dish. Sprinkle the top with the almonds. Place the casserole dish in a larger dish or roasting pan. Add hot water to the outer pan until the water comes halfway up the sides of the baking dish. Bake until the sides are firm and the center is jiggles slightly, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 30 minutes. Just before serving, whip the cream to soft peaks in a medium bowl using a whisk or electric hand mixer. Add the sugar and almond liqueur and whip to combine. Spoon the sformato into individual serving bowls and dollop the top with the almond liqueur whip cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 4370,&quot;Crunchy Parmesan Chicken Tenders 4 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup buttermilk 1 1/2 pounds chicken tenders (about 18) 3 large garlic cloves, minced 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar Freshly ground black pepper 1 1/4 cups freshly grated Parmesan 3/4 cup Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Brush 1 tablespoon of oil over each of 2 heavy large lined baking sheets. Place the buttermilk in a large bowl. Add the chicken tenders and stir to coat. Let stand at least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mash the garlic with the salt in a medium bowl. Whisk in the vinegar and then the remaining 1/2 cup of oil. Season the vinaigrette, to taste, with pepper. Transfer the vinaigrette to a small serving bowl. Stir the Parmesan and bread crumbs in a pie dish. Remove the chicken tenders from the buttermilk and dredge them in the bread crumb mixture to coat completely, pressing to adhere. Arrange the coated chicken tenders on the prepared baking sheets, spacing evenly. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over the chicken tenders and bake until they are cooked through and golden brown, about 12 minutes. Transfer the chicken tenders to a platter and serve the vinaigrette alongside for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 4371,&quot;French Toast Casserole with Marmalade Syrup 2 boxes (12.5 ounces each) frozen cinnamon-swirl French toast, Krusteaz 4 eggs 3 cups milk 2 cups pure maple syrup 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, McCormick 1/3 cup marmalade, Smuckers 1 banana, sliced Instructions: Spray two 9x13-inch baking pans with cooking spray.

Place the tomatoes and jalapeno cut-side down on a foil-lined broiler pan. Add the onion and garlic and broil until blackened, 7 to 10 minutes. Peel the garlic. Meanwhile, heat about 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Fry the tortillas in batches until light brown, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels; season lightly with salt while still hot. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sesame seeds and toast until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a blender along with the broiled vegetables, oregano, cl powder, 1 teaspoon salt and the cilantro stems. Puree until smooth. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the same skillet over high heat. Add the puree and cook, stirring often, until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. (Partially cover the skillet if the sauce starts to splatter.) Reduce the heat to medium. Add the chicken and broth and heat through, 3 to 4 minutes. Fold in the tortillas and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Keep warm while you fry the eggs. Divide the chilaquiles among plates. Top with the eggs, cheese, radishes and cilantro leaves. Drizzle with crema, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 4375,&quot;Lemon and Lime Cream Tart 1 tart shell, baked blind 8 large free-range eggs 12 ounces caster sugar 12 ounces double cream 7 1/2 ounces lime juice 3 3/4 ounces lemon juice Instructions: With this particular tart, as it has a moist filling, it&#39;s important to egg-wash the uncooked tart shell before adding the filling. This adds a sort of waterproof layer and keeps the pastry crisp and short for longer. Whisk together the sugar and eggs in a bowl. When they are well mixed, slowly stir in the cream and the juices. Put the cooked tart shell back into the oven and then pour the filling into it -- I find this reduces spillage. Bake for around 40 to 45 minutes at 180C/350F/Gas 4 or until the filling is set, but still semi-wobbly in the middle (obviously different ovens will cook at different rate so it is good for you to try this tart a couple of times to gauge exactly when you should take it out of the oven). After cooling for an hour, the semi-wobbly filling will have firmed up to the perfect consistency; soft and smooth. If you cut it before it has had time to rest it will pour out or be extremely gooey. You can dust it with a little icing sugar, if you wish. Serve with a huge pile of fresh raspberries or strawberries. Whatever you decide to serve it with should be quite simple so that you let the tart do the talking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 4376,&quot;Steamed Vegetable Spring Rolls 2 teaspoons peanut or olive oil 2 cups shredded coleslaw mix 1/2 cup Thai Peanut Sauce, recipe follows 8 spring roll wrappers (sold in the refrigerated section of the produce aisle) 1 (6-ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained and chopped 1 (11-ounce) can asparagus, drained and cut into 1-inch pieces 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce 3 cups reduced-sodium beef broth 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 1 teaspoon hot sauce Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the coleslaw mix and cook, stirring, until the cabbage wilts, about 3 minutes. Add the peanut sauce and mix well to combine. Remove from the heat. Place 2 inches of water in the bottom of a steamer or large saucepan and set over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, arrange the spring roll wrappers on a flat surface. Top each wrapper with an equal amount of the coleslaw mixture, water chestnuts, and asparagus, making an even layer down the center. Roll up the wrappers, tuck in the ends and place side by side in steamer basket or large colander. Set the steamer basket (or colander) over the now simmering water, cover, and steam until the wrappers are translucent, about 5 minutes. Serve the spring rolls with soy sauce on the side for dipping. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sauce ingredients until well blended and set the pan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and let simmer for 10 minutes.

Add the butter and continue blending at low speed until the mixture is coarse and sandy-looking. Add the beaten egg and blend just until the mixture comes together. Form into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. On a floured surface, roll the dough out to a rough circle, about 8 inches in diameter. The dough may seem crumbly but you can just push it back together and make patches if necessary. Transfer to the prepared pan. All around the circle, fold in the outer 1/2-inch of the pastry to form a naturally raised, \\rustic\\ edge to the tart. Don&#39;t press the edge down. Using your fingers, break the goat cheese into small pieces, sprinkling it over the bottom of the tart (not the edges). Arrange the fig halves in concentric circles over the goat cheese and drizzle the figs with honey.

Place water, sugar and cream of tartar in pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a whisk. As the syrup comes to a boil, any impurities in the sugar will rise to the surface; remove these using a small stainless steel sieve or strainer. Using a clean brush dipped in clean water, wash the sides of the pan down to ensure that no crystals form around the edge of the pan. Add the black food coloring. Continue boiling, washing the pan sides down regularly until the syrup reaches 340 degrees F, and then place the pan into a bowl of cold water to stop further cooking. For casting: Allow mixture to reach a honey-like consistency and pour into the center of a mold, allowing the sugar to run slowly to the sides. Let cool, tap sides of mold, and remove. For pulling: After cooking sugar to 340 degrees F and then cooling briefly in the bowl of cold water, pour out onto an oiled marble or silpat mat. Allow to cool around the edges and carefully fold into the center, repeating until a soft pliable mass is formed. Incorporate air to create shine by pulling and folding the sugar until cool. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 4383,&quot;Online Round 2 Recipe - Ceviche 1 tilapia fillet reserved from Fish Taco Recipe 1 small onion, chopped 1 Roma tomato, chopped 1 small jalapeno, thinly sliced 1 small orange, juiced 1 lime, juiced Cooking spray 4 corn tortillas Kosher salt 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves Instructions: Cut the reserved tilapia into 1/2-inch chunks and put them into a glass bowl.

Spoon a generous tablespoon of the banana filling on the empanada pastry circles and stick a piece of chocolate on top. Form and bake the empanadas as directed in the recipe. Dust with confectioners? sugar and serve hot. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, masa harina, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the melted butter. Gradually add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of water, working it in with your hands to incorporate; the dough should be easy to handle and not sticky. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic, and chill for 30 minutes. Lightly flour your rolling pin and counter. Divide the dough in 1/2 so it will be easier to work with and roll it out to 1/8-inch thickness. Using a 4-inch cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 10 circles of dough; repeat with the other 1/2. Spoon 2 generous tablespoons of filling into the center of each pastry circle, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Brush the edges with the egg wash and then fold the dough over in 1/2 to enclose the filling and form a semi-circle. Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork. Chill at least 30 minutes before baking. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the empanadas on a buttered baking sheet and brush the tops with additional egg wash.

Meanwhile, whisk the flour, baking powder and fine salt in a large bowl. Add the butter to the flour mixture and work it in with your fingertips until the butter is in pea-size pieces. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yeast mixture and milk. Stir with a wooden spoon until the flour is completely moistened and the dough looks like a shaggy ball, switching to your hands and gently kneading to bring the dough together, if necessary. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br> When the dough is almost ready, make the filling: Combine the cheese, chiles, parsley, thyme and lemon zest in a small bowl. Mash and stir together with a small rubber spatula until smooth and spreadable. Set aside.<br> Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and briefly knead until smooth, three or four times. Pat until about 1 inch thick, then fold into thirds like a letter and pat until 1 inch thick again. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and repeat folding and patting two more times. Divide into 2 equal pieces.<br> Lightly butter an upside-down rimmed baking sheet (or a rimless baking sheet). Roll out 1 piece of dough into an 11-inch round on a floured surface and transfer to the pan. Spread with the filling, stopping about 3/4 inch from the edge. Roll out the second piece of dough into an 11-inch round and place on top of the first. Pinch and press the edges of the dough together to seal. Center the rim of a drinking glass (about 3 inches in diameter) in the middle of the dough; gently press to mark the center. At the 12 o\\u2019clock mark, cut through the dough with a very sharp knife from the glass to the edge, leaving the center circle uncut. Repeat at the 3 o\\u2019clock, 6 o\\u2019clock and 9 o\\u2019clock points on the circle to make 4 quarters. Halve each quarter to make 8 equal wedges; halve those to make 16 wedges. Lift the edges of 2 wedges that are next to each other and twist them away from each other twice. Pinch the ends together to make a pointed tip. Repeat with the remaining pairs of wedges. Remove the glass and cover the dough with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until the filling is firm and the dough has puffed and risen slightly, 45 minutes to 1 hour.<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400? F. Uncover the dough and re-pinch any ends that came apart. Brush all over with the beaten egg and sprinkle with flaky salt.

When the butter starts to foam up, drop the heat to low and cook until it reaches 300 degrees F. Fry the parsley, rosemary and sage until bright green and crisp, about 60 seconds. (Be careful: when you add the herbs, there will be splattering.) Strain the butter through a fine-mesh sieve into a heat-safe container and transfer the herbs to a paper towel-lined plate. When cool enough to handle, roughly chop. Carefully remove the skin from the turkey breast and lay flat on a piece of parchment paper set inside a sheet pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Debone the breast, remove the tenderloins and place the breast smooth-side down. Make a shallow diagonal cut in the thickest part of each lobe to open them up and then score the breast. Cover a half sheet pan with plastic wrap, allowing 8 inches of overhang in both directions. Sprinkle the center with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt and 1 teaspoon of maple sugar and place the two breasts, flush together, directly in the center. Cover with plastic wrap and lightly pound to an even thickness. Remove the plastic wrap, realign the breasts if they&#39;ve separated and brush the scored side with 3 tablespoons of the herb butter. Massage in the chopped herbs and season with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt and 1 tablespoon of maple sugar. Roll the breast into a cylinder and wrap tightly with the plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 450 degrees F. Remove the plastic from both the skin and the roll. Carefully position the roll on the bottom of the skin. Roll up as tightly as possible, tucking the skin&#39;s edges in as you go: we&#39;re looking for full coverage here. With the seam-side down, truss the roll with twine at 1-to-2-inch intervals. Place the roll on a rack set inside a half sheet pan, brush with 2 tablespoons of the herb butter and season with the remaining teaspoon of salt. Insert a remote probe thermometer into the center of the roll at a 45-degree angle. Roast the turkey until the thermometer reads 100 degrees F, about 40 minutes, then baste with an additional 2 tablespoons of herb butter and rotate the pan 180 degrees. Continue to roast until the thermometer hits 150 degrees F, about 20 minutes more.

Using a vegetable peeler, remove the squash&#39;s hard shell. Trim about 1/2-inch off the top and bottom ends so you can set each section of the squash flat on a cutting board. Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop the seeds out with a spoon, and coarsely chop the squash into 1/2-inch chunks. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. In a bowl, toss the squash with the oil, sage, spice blend, and 1 teaspoon salt and fresh ground pepper. Spread the squash in a single layer on the baking sheet. Roast the squash in the oven until very soft and beginning to brown, 40 to 50 minutes, stirring once or twice. Remove the squash from the oven and puree in a food processor with fresh nutmeg. In a large bowl, mix the squash puree, ricotta, Parmesan, eggs, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cover and refrigerate the mixture until ready to use. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the lasagna sheets until al dente. Drain the sheets and spread them on a baking sheet. Drizzle them lightly with oil and set aside. Prepare the sauce: In a large saucepan, bring the milk to a slow simmer over medium heat. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the sage and garlic to the butter, cook for 30 seconds, then add the flour and stir. Add about 3 cups of the milk, and whisk vigorously to prevent lumps. Bring to a boil, while whisking continuously. Add the remaining milk and whisk again. Add the salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Adjust the heat to low to maintain a slow simmer, and cook until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes, whisking frequently. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Makes about 8 cups. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 9 by 13-inch baking dish. Spoon a ladle of bechamel into the dish and spread to coat the bottom. Place a single layer of lasagna sheets on top of the bechamel. Spread some of the squash mixture evenly over the lasagna sheets and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan on top. Repeat this step until all ingredients are used, starting with 2 to 3 ladles of bechamel for each layer. Keep building the layers until the pan is full to about 1/4-inch from the top. Finish with cheese and sauce directly over the noodles. Bake in the middle of the oven for about 1 hour. Remove the cover, and continue cooking for another 15 minutes until golden brown and bubbling. Allow lasagna to rest before slicing. Serve warm. Grind fennel with mortar and pestle. Add the cinnamon and salt and continue grinding. Or grind in spice grinder for a rough grind. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 4427,&quot;Individual Chocolate Souffles 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus softened butter, for the ramekins 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more for the ramekins<br> 8 ounces finely chopped bittersweet chocolate<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 large egg yolks plus 6 egg whites, at room temperature 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> Triple Raspberry Sauce, recipe follows Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting 1/2 pint raspberries, plus more for garnish 1 cup raspberry sorbet<br> 2 tablespoons seedless raspberry jam<br> 1 teaspoon lemon zest<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> Instructions: Set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Brush six 6-ounce ramekins with softened butter, then coat with granulated sugar. Refrigerate until ready to use. Put the chocolate and butter in a large heatproof bowl. Fill a saucepan with about an inch of water and bring to a low simmer; set the bowl over--but not touching--the water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Set aside. Combine the egg yolks and 2 tablespoons warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl using a hand mixer) and beat until frothy. Gradually add 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar and continue beating until very thick ribbons form, about 5 minutes. Very lightly fold the yolk mixture into the chocolate mixture. Put the egg whites in a clean bowl of a standing mixer (or in a large bowl using a hand mixer) and add the cream of tartar. Beat on medium speed until frothy; increase the speed to high and gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Beat until the whites hold a stiff but not dry peak, about 3 minutes. Working quickly, fold about a third of the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture to lighten; then fold in the remaining whites until blended. Gently spoon the souffle mixture into the prepared ramekins and place on a baking sheet. Lightly smooth the tops of the souffles. Immediately bake until the souffles rise about 1 1/2 inches from the ramekins, about 18 minutes. In the meantime, make the Triple Raspberry Sauce. Remove the souffles from the oven, pour some of the sauce over the center of each, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve immediately. In a small saucepan, add the raspberries, sorbet, raspberry jam and lemon zest and set over medium heat. Stir, breaking up the raspberries while it comes to a simmer, then cook until the foam subsides and the mixture becomes thick and syrupy, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and swirl in the butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Cava]&quot; 4428,&quot;Clementine Cosmo 1/2 cup fresh squeezed clementine juice 4 ounces vodka 2 ounces Triple Sec 1/2 lime, juiced 4 slices clementine, for garnish Instructions: Chill 4 martini glasses by filling each with ice and cold water.

Place the pizza dough in the center and spread evenly towards the bottom edge and 1 1/2 inches up the sides.<br> The order of topping layers is very important to achieving a crisp bottom pizza crust. Begin with the sausage. Evenly lay the sausage on the dough, followed by the mozzarella and marinara. Sprinkle the garlic and oregano on top. Finish with the Parmesan and drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place the skillet pizza on the bottom rack of the oven and cook until the edge of the crust is golden brown and crusty, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove and let rest for 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 4431,&quot;Grilled Tuna Pan Bagnat 2 tuna steaks, 8 ounces each 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus 1/2 cup Salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 small red onion, finely chopped 1/2 cup chopped Sweet 100 tomatoes, or very small grape tomatoes 1 tablespoon anchovy paste 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 3 to 4 tablespoons Dijon mustard Pinch red pepper 3 tablespoons capers, drained 12 basil leaves, cut into chiffonade 1 French baguette Instructions: Heat grill to high. Brush the tuna steaks with the 1 tablespoon of oil and season and salt and pepper. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes on both sides or until just cooked through. Let rest for 5 minutes then flake with a fork. Transfer to a bowl with the red onion and tomatoes. Whisk together the anchovy paste, lemon juice, mustard, red pepper, and 1/2 cup olive oil in a small bowl. Add the capers and then season with salt, to taste, if necessary. Pour the dressing over the tuna, add the basil, and gently mix to combine. Place the baguette on the grill, close the cover and let heat through, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the grill and slice lengthwise. Remove some of the inside of the bread. Spread the tuna mixture evenly over the bottom half of the bread, place the top bread on, and press down firmly on the sandwich. Wrap the sandwich in foil and place a heavy pan on top. Let stand 30 minutes before serving and then cut into 4 pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 4432,&quot;Grilled Pimento Cheese Sandwiches 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons mayonnaise<br> 8 ounces sharp Cheddar, shredded<br> 8 ounces aged Gouda, shredded<br> 1 roasted red pepper, diced (about 1/2 cup) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 slices cracked wheat bread 3 tablespoons mayonnaise or softened unsalted butter Instructions: For the pimento cheese: Combine the cream cheese and mayonnaise in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the Cheddar and Gouda and mix to combine on low, about 1 minute. Stir in the roasted red peppers by hand. Taste and season with salt and pepper, but go heavy on the pepper; start with 1/2 teaspoon and go from there. For the sandwiches: On low heat, warm a cast-iron skillet. Put a heaping 1/2 cup of the pimento cheese between 2 slices of bread. Don&#39;t spread the mixture all the way to the crust because it will soften and spread as it heats in the skillet. Repeat with the remaining bread and cheese. Smear one side of each sandwich with mayonnaise, and place the sandwiches in the skillet mayonnaise-side down. Smear the top pieces of bread with mayonnaise. Cook until golden brown and the cheese has just started to melt, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until golden, another 3 minutes. Slice into halves or quarters and serve immediately. Reserve any remaining pimento cheese in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 4433,&quot;Apple-Bacon Galette 6 slices bacon 1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup sugar 5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 4 assorted apples (such as McIntosh and Granny Smith) 4 assorted apples (such as McIntosh and Granny Smith)<br> 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 large egg, beaten Maple syrup, for brushing Instructions: Make the crust: Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until golden but still soft, about 6 minutes; remove to paper towels. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the drippings in a small bowl; refrigerate until cold, about 15 minutes. Pulse 2 slices of the bacon in a food processor until finely ground. Add 1 1/2 cups flour and 2 tablespoons sugar and pulse to combine. Add the chilled bacon drippings and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal with some pea-size pieces. Drizzle in 4 tablespoons cold water and pulse until the dough just comes together. Turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap; use the plastic to help form the dough into a disk. Wrap and chill until firm, at least 1 hour. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out the dough into a 13-inch round between 2 sheets of lightly floured parchment. Peel off the top sheet of parchment, then invert the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Peel off the sheet of parchment. Refrigerate the dough until ready to use. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Make the filling: Peel the apples and slice 1/4 inch thick. Toss with the lemon juice, cinnamon, 3 tablespoons sugar and the remaining 1 tablespoon flour in a large bowl. Arrange the apples in the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the edge of the dough over the filling, pleating as needed. Cut the remaining 4 slices bacon into bite-size pieces and sprinkle over the filling.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together squash, salad dressing, melted butter, brown sugar, and cayenne pepper until well combined. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes or just until tender. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Garnacha]&quot; 4453,&quot;Mamo&#39;s Apple Strudel 10 to 12 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into thin strips Juice of 1 lemon 1 large can pineapple, drained and diced 3/4 cup sugar Pinch salt 1/2 cup finely chopped nuts 2 sticks unsalted butter 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 pound package phyllo dough Mixture of 1 large freshly ground cinnamon stick, 1/3 cup sugar and 1 cup plain breadcrumbs Instructions: As you peel and dice the apples, sprinkle with lemon juice and mix frequently to prevent browning, or toss in iced water with some lemon juice. Place the apples into a large pot on the stove over medium-high heat. Add the pineapple, sugar, 1 cup water and salt. Cook until the moisture evaporates and consistency of the remaining fruit is thicker than preserves, 30 to 35 minutes. Stir often to prevent burning on the bottom. Cool, then stir in nuts. Refrigerate the apple filling at least overnight. Filling will last in the refrigerator for up to a week in an airtight container. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a pot, melt the butter over very low heat. A white foam will form as the top layer. Skim off the foam with a spoon. Once the foam is removed, add the oil. Stir and remove from the heat. On a sheet of waxed paper, lay out the first layer of phyllo dough. (Dough dries out quickly, so keep other layers not in use covered with a damp cloth over a sheet of waxed paper.) Using a pastry brush, gently brush the butter/oil mixture onto the entire sheet of dough. Sprinkle with the breadcrumb mixture over the entire surface. Repeat for an additional 4 layers so each roll has a total of 5 layers of phyllo dough. Using a spoon, add a row of the apple filling an inch or two from the bottom of the dough. Do not overstuff or the strudel will burst when baking. Lift the bottom edge of the waxed paper with both hands, each about a third of the way in from the outer edges to support the phyllo as you roll up the dough, jellyroll style. As you roll, fold the sides inwards to form sealed edges as you continue to the end. End with the seam-side down. Coat a baking pan with the butter/oil mixture and place the first rolled dough onto the pan with the seam facing down. Then brush the roll all over with the butter/oil mixture. Repeat the steps above until you have filled the cookie pan with the rolls but keep at least a roll&#39;s width between each. Keep at least 2 to 3 inches between the rolls on the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Bake until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes, depending on your oven. During baking, baste 4 to 5 times with the butter/oil mixture. Cut into pieces while still hot so the crust won&#39;t break. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4454,&quot;Gingerbread Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the baking pans 1 tablespoon ground ginger 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 cup unsulphured molasses 1 cup boiling water 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 4 cups (1 pound) confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Milk, as needed for thinning 1/2 cup white chocolate chips 20 to 24 mini gingerbread men cookies, depending on size Red, green and white nonpareils, for sprinkling Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottom of each with a parchment round. Stir together the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt in a large bowl and set aside.<br> Combine the brown sugar and butter in another large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on high speed, scraping down sides of bowl with a rubber spatula as needed, until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat until combined (it&#39;s fine if the mixture looks a little curdled).<br> Stir the molasses into the boiling water in a large spouted measuring cup. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the molasses mixture, beginning and ending with the flour. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, increase the speed to medium and beat just until smooth.<br> Divide the batter between the prepared pans and bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out with just a few crumbs attached, 22 to 27 minutes. Let the cakes cool completely in the pans on a wire rack. Once cool, invert the cakes onto the rack, then peel off and discard the parchment.<br> For the frosting: Combine the butter and cream cheese in a clean mixer bowl. Beat on high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the confectioner&#39;s&#39; sugar, beating until combined. Add the vanilla and gradually increase the speed to high. Beat until the frosting is light and fluffy, adding up to 1 tablespoon of milk if needed so the frosting is spreadable.<br> Place one cake layer flat-side down on a cake stand or platter. Top with about 3/4 cup of the frosting, spreading almost to the edges using an offset spatula. Place the remaining cake layer on top, flat-side up. Spread the remaining frosting on the entire cake and smooth the top and sides with the offset spatula. Refrigerate the cake while you decorate the gingerbread cookies.<br> For the decorations: Meanwhile, microwave the white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl until just melted. (Alternatively, melt the chips in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water; do not let bowl touch the water.) Let cool slightly and put into a piping bag fitted with a small plain tip (or use a plastic ziptop bag with the corner snipped off). Pipe eyes and smiles on the gingerbread cookie faces. Arrange the merry gingerbread men side by side around the bottom edge of the cake, pressing in slightly to adhere. Sprinkle the top of the cake with the nonpareils.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 4455,&quot;Apple Tart Runway Classic Puff Pastry, store bought 2 large egg yolks 1 large egg Whole milk 1/4 cup chunky applesauce 4 to 5 Granny Smith apples Apricot Glaze, recipe follows 1/4 cup apricot jam 1 tablespoon water Instructions: For the filling: Prepare the puff pastry as directed in the recipe and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). When the puff pastry is ready to roll, place it on a lightly floured work surface and use a rolling pin to roll it into an 8 by 18-inch rectangle. Place the rectangle on the work surface with the long side facing you. Use a sharp paring knife to cut 2 (1 by 18-inch) strips from the top of the dough. Place the remaining rectangle on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Egg wash: Combine the egg yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small mixing bowl and whip with a hand whisk until well combined. Use a pastry brush to brush a 1-inch border of egg wash along each long side of the rectangle on the baking sheet. Place 1 of the thin strips on each side of the rectangle, over the egg wash. Try to keep the strips straight and even. These edges will keep the filling inside the tart shell, as they rise slightly higher than the rest of the tart. Brush the tops of the 2 strips with egg wash. Use an offset spatula to spread the applesauce down the center of the tart shell. Filling: Peel, core, and halve the apples. Slice each half into 1/4-inch-thick slices and lay them lengthwise on the tart, overlapping the slices slightly. Use a pastry brush to brush egg wash over the tops of the apple slices. Sometimes I make a decoration along the edge of the dough on the long sides of the tart. To do this, I gently press the tips of my first and second fingers into the dough, right at the edge. Then I use the back of a paring knife to mark the spot between my 2 fingers by pushing the dough in 1/4-inch. I repeat this all along the long sides to give the tart a scalloped edge. Place the tart in the oven and bake until the sides have risen slightly and the tart is golden brown, about 25 minutes. Check the bottom of the tart by lifting it slightly off the parchment paper using an offset spatula. You want to be sure the bottom is fully baked or the tart will be soggy. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack. Use a pastry brush to glaze the tart with the apricot glaze. This will add shine and sweetness to the baked tart. It is best to serve this tart within a few hours of removing it from the oven. VARIATION: If you blind bake the dough, you can cover it with fresh raspberry jam and top with fresh raspberries as another alternative. Mix the apricot jam with the water in a small microwaveable bowl and heat on high power or in a non-reactive 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until liquid. Brush it on with a pastry brush. The glaze can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4456,&quot;Spicy Sausage and Broccolini Panini 1/4 cup olive oil 4 ounces spicy Italian sausage, loose<br> 1 bunch broccolini, trimmed and chopped<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 cups shredded aged provolone<br> 8 slices white bread<br> Instructions: Place a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the sausage to the skillet and cook, stirring often and breaking the sausage apart with the back of a wooden spoon, until the sausage is cooked and beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add the broccolini and salt and continue to cook until the broccolini is tender, an additional 6 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool. In a medium bowl, mix together the sausage mixture and provolone until combined. Place 4 slices of bread on a cutting board and divide the mixture evenly among the slices. Top with the remaining slices of bread. Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Brush with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the remaining oil and place 2 sandwiches in the skillet. Cook until lightly browned and crispy on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip the sandwiches and cook until crispy on the bottom and the cheese is melted, an additional 3 minutes. Continue with the remaining oil and sandwiches.

Saute lobster meat in oil until it is no longer translucent, and set aside. Cook the pasta until al dente and drain well so that you don&#39;t have excess cooking water which will dilute the flavor. While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and add the onion and garlic, cooking until translucent, being careful not to burn it. Add the flour a little at a time to make a roux. Do this gradually because some batches of flour absorb more than others and you may not need as much. Add the bay leaves, and then incorporate the vegetable or fish stock a little at a time to form a smooth sauce. Simmer for a least 10 minutes to allow the flour to \\cook out,\\ then remove the bay leaves. Add the heavy cream and Cheddar, then season with salt and white pepper. Stir the lobster meat into the cheese mixture, then fold in as much pasta as you need to acquire the right consistency for macaroni and cheese.

Gather up the ends of the towel and squeeze until almost all of the juice is removed. Discard juice. Return the onion to the food processor and add the lamb, garlic, marjoram, rosemary, salt, and pepper and process until it is a fine paste, approximately 1 minute. Stop the processor as needed to scrape down sides of bowl. To cook in the oven as a meatloaf, proceed as follows: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the mixture into a loaf pan, making sure to press into the sides of the pan. Place the loaf pan into a water bath and bake for 60 to 75 minutes or until the mixture reaches 165 to 170 degrees F. Remove from the oven and drain off any fat. Place the loaf pan on a cooling rack and place a brick wrapped in aluminum foil directly on the surface of the meat and allow to sit for 15 to 20 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 175 degrees F. Slice and serve on pita bread with tzatziki sauce, chopped onion, tomatoes and feta cheese. To cook on a rotisserie, proceed as follows: Form the meat mixture into a loaf shape and place on top of 2 overlapping pieces of plastic wrap that are at least 18 inches long. Roll the mixture in the plastic wrap tightly, making sure to remove any air pockets. Once the meat is completely rolled in the wrap, twist the ends of the plastic wrap until the surface of the wrap is tight. Store in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to overnight, to allow the mixture to firm up. Preheat the grill to high. Place the meat onto the rotisserie skewer. Place a double-thick piece of aluminum foil folded into a tray directly under the meat to catch any drippings. Cook on high for 15 minutes. Decrease the heat to medium and continue to cook for another 20 to 30 minutes or until the internal temperature of the meat reaches 165 degrees F. Turn off the heat and allow to continue to spin for another 10 to 15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 175 degrees.

Butter an 8-inch-square baking pan. Line with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Lightly butter the paper. Prepare the streusel: Pulse the butter, sugar, peanuts, orange zest and vanilla in a food processor just until the nuts are coarsely chopped. Make the cake: Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt through a fine sieve into a large bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a separate bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs, scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat on medium speed until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce the speed to low. Add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Scrape down the bowl and finish mixing by hand (do not overmix). Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle with half of the streusel and dollop with half of the jam. Spread the remaining batter on top. Sprinkle with the remaining streusel and top with the remaining jam. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer the pan to a rack and let the cake cool completely, then lift out the cake by the parchment paper and cut into squares. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 4468,&quot;Chiles en Nogada 12 Poblano chiles, roasted and peeled 1 cup ground veal 1 cup ground pork (with 30 percent fat content) 1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped 1/2 cup almonds, chopped and toasted 1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted 2 cups chopped cactus 1/2 cup raisins 1 bunch epazote, chopped 1 1/2 cups fresh walnuts, skinned 1 cup milk 1 cup cream Seeds from two ripe pomegranates 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped Instructions: Make a vertical slit down the side of each cl and carefully remove the seeds, leaving the stem intact.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Whisk the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg and beat until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the pumpkin puree, scraping the bowl as needed. Beat in the flour mixture until just combined, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Scoop mounds of batter (about 1 1/2 tablespoons each) about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets; shape into rounds with damp fingers. (Or you can transfer the batter to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch round tip and pipe into 1 1/2-inch rounds.) Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are golden and the tops spring back when gently pressed, 14 to 16 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the pans, then carefully transfer to racks to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining batter. Meanwhile, make the filling: Stir the milk and instant coffee in a small bowl until the coffee dissolves. Beat the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on low speed until combined, then increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until light and smooth, about 3 minutes.

On a work surface, roll out the puff pastry to a 10-by-15-inch rectangle. Cut into six 5-inch squares. Top each of the squares with a schmear of scallion cream cheese, then a bit of the bacon and finally a spoonful of the scrambled eggs, distributing them evenly and leaving a 3/4-inch border around the edges.<br> Beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl to make an egg wash. Brush the edges of the puff pastry squares with the egg wash, fold them in half to make rectangles and pinch the edges to seal them well. Transfer them to the prepared baking sheet, placing them 1 inch apart. Brush the tops with the egg wash and top with the Everything Bagel Topping. Bake until golden brown; begin checking for doneness at 30 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve with ketchup. Leftovers can be refrigerated and reheated in a toaster oven.

Line 2 (12 portion) muffin tins with paper cupcake liners and set aside. In a bowl, using an electric mixer, mix the cake mix, water, oil, eggs, and coconut extract on medium speed until moistened and smooth. Stir in the chopped coconut. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin tins. The batter will nearly fill each liner to the top. Bake until the muffins spring back when lightly touched, or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. When cool, put the icing out with spoons or small spatulas along with bowls of the cupcake toppings for the kids to decorate their own cupcakes. In the bowl of a large electric mixer, using the paddle attachment, whip the butter on high speed until very soft. Meanwhile, place a large sheet of parchment paper on a work surface. Using a large sifter, sift a pound of confectioners&#39; sugar onto the parchment. This helps prevent clumping, and makes the mixing easier. Lower the speed of the mixer, and, using the parchment as a funnel, pour the sugar into the bowl and mix slowly until combined. Add the milk and mix until combined. Sift the second pound of sugar onto the parchment sheet. Again at low speed, add the sugar and mix well. Once combined, sift the remaining sugar and add it with the vanilla and mix. Once it is combined, turn the mixer speed up and beat the icing until very light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. If desired, divide the icing into smaller batches and color with food coloring. Spread the icing on cooled cupcakes while at room temperature. Refrigerate any leftover icing, but be sure to let it come back to room temperature before using. Re-whip the icing to make it fluffy again.

Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Put a cast-iron pan over high heat until hot. Coat the pan with olive oil, add the chicken skin-side down and cook until the skin is crispy, about 7 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a baking sheet fitted with a rack. Roast until cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes depending on size. For the red wine balsamic demi: In a saucepan over high heat, add a little olive oil. Add the thyme, bay leaves, carrots, celery and onions and sweat the vegetables about 5 minutes. Deglaze with the red wine, then add the balsamic and dark chicken stock. Bring to a boil. Add the tomato paste and reduce to a simmer. Add the sugar and simmer to reduce the sauce to a glaze consistency, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain and reserve. For the stinky polenta: Bring the dark chicken stock to a boil in a saucepan. Using a whisk, slowly incorporate the polenta into the stock, stirring vigorously. When fully incorporated, lower the heat to simmer. Cook, stirring frequently to make sure the polenta doesn&#39;t burn, until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. For the crispy kale: Pour enough canola oil into a large heavy-bottomed saucepan to come about a third of the way up. Heat the oil until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 325 degrees F. Add the julienned kale to the oil and fry about 2 minutes; the kale should still be very green and crisp, not brown at all. Drain on paper towels and set aside for garnish. To finish the polenta: Add the butter, Gorgonzola, Parmigiano-Reggiano, mascarpone and additional water or the chicken cooking juices if needed. Finish with the white truffle oil and add salt and pepper to taste. To plate, spoon about 3 tablespoons of the glaze into 5 wide bowls. Put some polenta on top. Slice each chicken breast and put on top of the polenta. Garnish with crispy kale and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 4499,&quot;New England Pot Roast and Gravy 2 Fresh raw Briskets** (about 22 pounds) preferably Certified Black Angus Beef (they come about 11 pounds each) 2 1/2 pounds onions 2 1/2 pounds carrots 2 pounds celery 3 gallons beef stock, approximately 2 teaspoons herb de Provence, seasoning blend 1 teaspoon dry thyme, or fresh if available 3 bay leaves Salt and black pepper (sprinkle generously unless using some form of bouillon for stock that is already salty) 1 gallon pot roast stock 1 cup beef fat 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup cornstarch, for shine Garnish: Julienne carrots, celery and onion (just a few for presentation) Instructions: With a hot broiler, grill or frying pan, sear the briskets until they&#39;re well browned and crispy. Wash and cut the vegetables into a large, rough dice and place in the bottom of a large covered pan (squarehead). Add the beef, seasonings and stock. Cover and place in a preheated 375 to 400 degree oven and bake for about 6 hours. Check the meat with a meat fork. The briskets should be extremely fork tender (practically falling apart). When done lift from the stock with a fork and a spatula underneath to a holding pan to cool slightly. Meanwhile -- into a large plastic food bucket, strain the vegetables and stock through a medium hole china cap (sieve). Using a mallet or ladle squeeze some of the vegetable pulp through into the stock for flavor and texture. Discard the squeezed veggies. Cool the stock so the fat will rise to the top.<br> While the meat is still warm cut out the large pieces of meat separating it from the fat layer in the middle. Scrape off any excess soft fat and discard it. Keep the meat pieces (pot roast) to eat soon or refrigerate them. To Make Gravy: Heat the Pot Roast Stock separately. In a large heavy saucepan heat the beef fat, boiling out any water particles (takes a couple minutes). Make a roux by whisking in the flour and cornstarch stirring constantly -- cooking a few minutes. Continue stirring (it could burn) browning slightly is okay. It adds color to the gravy. Add some of the hot stock gradually. Stir swiftly to break up lumps and make a smooth paste. Add more stock to thin to the desired consistency. Let simmer 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Check for color, taste and thickness. Adjust color if desired with a few drops of Gravy Master or Kitchen Bouquet. Add salt and pepper and more stock if needed.<br> Garnish: Simmer carrots, celery and onion in a little stock to soften slightly. Cool until needed. Dip in stock to reheat and arrange on top of gravy on the meat. Slowly reheat Pot Roast in hot stock. Remove from stock to a cutting board. Slice the meat thinly on the bias against the grain of the meat. Arrange on the plate, ladle on the gravy and garnish with the julienne vegetables, if desired. Serve with fresh mashed potatoes and a vegetable. This is a meal to enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 4500,&quot;Poached Salmon with Lemon Crisps and Meyer Lemon Cream 2 celery stalks 2 onions 2 carrots 3 bay leaves 2 cups white wine 12 cups water 1 teaspoon peppercorns 1 (4-pound) salmon fillet, skin-off, cut into 12 to 13 portions (approximately 5 ounces each) 5 garlic cloves 2 shallots, sliced 1 Meyer lemon, peel removed and juiced 4 cups white wine 4 cups heavy cream 1 tablespoon turmeric Salt 4 cups vegetable oil 2 lemons 1 1/2 cups rice flour Watercress, for garnish Instructions: For the court boullion: Place all ingredients in a large stock pot and let simmer for 30 to 40 minutes.

Salt the water until it tastes salty. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain in a colander, shaking off the excess water. Return the potatoes to the pot. Combine the clarified butter and garlic in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Gently roast until the garlic is soft and lightly golden, taking care not to let the cloves brown too much, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the milk, bring to a simmer over medium heat and then remove the pan from the heat. With a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic cloves to the drained potatoes. Break down the potatoes and roasted garlic slightly using a potato masher. Pour in the hot milk-butter mixture and mash until combined and smooth. Season to taste. Heat 1 inch of oil to 350 degrees F in a high-sided pan. In a small bowl, soak the sliced shallots in the buttermilk. Place the rice flour in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Using tongs, transfer the shallots from the buttermilk to the rice flour and toss to coat. Fry the shallots in batches until just golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon or spider, remove to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. To serve, mound the mashed potatoes in a serving bowl and sprinkle with the fried shallots. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 4506,&quot;Homemade Green Bean Casserole Salt and pepper 1 1/2 pounds green beans, trimmed<br> 3 tablespoons butter<br> 2 shallots, chopped<br> 1/2 pound button mushrooms, chopped<br> 3 tablespoons flour<br> 1 cup chicken stock<br> 1 cup half-and-half<br> 1 can fried onions<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Grease three 12-inch round cake pans, three 8-inch round cake pans and three 6-inch round cake pans with butter and line with parchment. Set aside. In 2 batches, using half of the ingredients for each batch (see Cook&#39;s Note), whisk together the milk, vanilla and egg whites in a bowl and set aside. Mix the cake flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in the bowl of stand mixer. Add the butter cubes and continue beating on low for 1 to 2 minutes. Add about half of the milk mixture and beat at medium speed for 1 1/2 minutes. Add the remaining milk mixture and beat for about 1 minute. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake until the cakes are light golden brown and bounce back when lightly pressed in the center, 12 to 15 minutes for the 6-inch pans, 15 to 20 minutes for the 8-inch pans and 25 to 30 minutes for the 12-inch pans. Let the cakes cool for about 5 minutes in the pans, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely before assembling, 25 to 30 minutes. For the coconut-rum syrup: Combine the cream of coconut and rum in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. For the passionfruit buttercream: Cream together the powdered sugar, butter, passionfruit puree and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Continue beating until thick and creamy. For the American buttercream: Cream together the powdered sugar, butter, cream cheese, heavy cream and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Continue beating until thick and creamy. For the gum paste flowers: Lightly sprinkle cornstarch on a wood board and roll the gum paste out very thinly. Using a flower cutter, cut out flower shapes. Place the flowers in the cups of a mini muffin tin that has been lightly dusted with cornstarch. Let dry for at least 2 hours or overnight. Mix each gel food color with about 1 tablespoon of vodka until the desired color is achieved. Paint the dry flowers with the food-coloring paint, then let dry completely. Cake Assembly: For the 12-inch tier: Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the top of one 12-inch layer with the coconut-rum syrup. Spread the first layer with enough passionfruit buttercream to achieve a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Top with a second cake layer and repeat with the coconut-rum syrup and passionfruit buttercream. Top with the third layer and brush with the syrup. Stabilize the tier with straws or dowels. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or longer if possible. For the 8-inch tier: Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the top of one 8-inch layer with the coconut-rum syrup. Spread the first layer with enough passionfruit buttercream to achieve a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Top with a second cake layer and repeat with the coconut-rum syrup and passionfruit buttercream. Top with the third layer and brush with the syrup. Stabilize the tier with straws or dowels. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or longer if possible. For the 6-inch tier: Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the top of one 6-inch layer with the coconut-rum syrup. Spread the first layer with enough passionfruit buttercream to achieve a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Top with a second cake layer and repeat with the coconut-rum syrup and passionfruit buttercream. Top with the third layer and brush with the syrup. Stabilize the tier with straws or dowels. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or longer if possible. Once the cakes are chilled, crumb-coat each tier with the American buttercream frosting. Chill each tier for at least 1 hour. After chilling, apply a final coating of the American buttercream frosting using a decorative technique or by completely smoothing the top and sides of the cakes. Chill the completely frosted tiers again. Place the 12-inch tier on a 14-inch cake drum. Gently place and center the 8-inch tier on top of the 12-inch tier. Repeat with the 6-inch tier. Using more buttercream placed in a pastry bag with a round number 10 tip, pipe a decorative bead border along the bottom of each tier. Once the cake is assembled, use buttercream frosting to affix the gum paste flowers to the cake in a cascading arrangement (or as desired). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>These wines will complement the flavors and textures of the Hawaiian Lei Wedding Cake nicely.

Tear the chiles into large pieces and place them in a medium bowl. Carefully pour 4 cups boiling water over chiles and set aside until softened, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place the coriander and cumin seeds in a small skillet and cook over medium heat, swirling the pan often, until the spices are fragrant and lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the spices into a blender, add the oil, salt, garlic and lemon juice, and puree until smooth. Drain the chiles, reserving 1 cup of the soaking liquid (discard remaining liquid). Add the chiles and reserved liquid to the blender and puree on high until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Season the harissa with pepper and transfer to an airtight container. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 4550,&quot;Sophia Loren&#39;s Chicken Cacciatora 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1, 3 to 3 1/2 pound chicken, cut into 8 serving pieces (2 wings, 2 legs, 2 thighs, and each breast cut in half crosswise) 1 medium onion, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced 1 large red pepper, sliced into 1/2-inch strips 1/2 cup dry white wine 3/4 teaspoon salt Big pinch hot red pepper flakes 2 cups canned plum tomatoes, well drained and coarsely chopped 1/3 cup torn basil leaves Instructions: In a 10 to 12 inch saute pan with cover, heat the oil over medium high heat, and when it is hot, brown the chicken on the skin side first, then the underside. Do not crowd the pan. Brown the chicken in batches if necessary, setting aside the browned chicken on a plate until the rest is done. When the first few pieces of chicken are almost browned and still in the pan, add the onion red pepper, saute until tender. Arrange all the browned chicken in the pan, skin side up, and add the white wine. Season with salt and hot pepper flakes, then let the wine cook until it has almost entirely evaporated, just a couple of minutes. While it is reducing, turn the chicken in the liquid once or twice, but leave it skin side up at the end. Add the tomatoes. Cover the pan, lower the heat, and let cook at a gentle simmer, without turning, for about 30 minutes, or until the chicken is done. Remove the chicken to a serving platter, add the basil to the pan and increase the heat to high, letting the sauce reduce for about 2 minutes. In the end, the sauce will be creamy pink. Pour the sauce over the chicken or use it to dress pasta (reserving some for the chicken) and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 4551,&quot;Grilled Chicken Salad With Parmesan Breadcrumbs 1 plum tomato, halved 4 sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, plus 2 tablespoons oil from the jar 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 clove garlic 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 bunch fresh basil, torn 1/3 cup grated parmesan Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1 pound) 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup breadcrumbs 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 8 cups Italian-blend salad greens or baby arugula 8 ounces bocconcini (small mozzarella balls), quartered Instructions: Preheat a grill to high.

Add the pears and saute until slightly tender and juicy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1/2 cup sugar and the cloves. Toss and remove from the heat to cool. Combine the remaining 1 cup sugar, the lemon juice, syrup and orange zest and mix. Add the cranberries and toss to coat the fruit. Heat a medium saute pan and add the cranberry mixture. Saute quickly, 3 to 5 minutes. Combine the pear and cranberry mixtures in a bowl and set aside to cool. Make the topping: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger and salt. Mix to blend. Work the butter in with your fingers until the mixture is coarse and somewhat moist. The butter should not be fully integrated but there should not be any large chunks either. At the last minute, gently blend in the almonds. Assemble the crumble: Arrange the fruit in the baking dish and spread the topping evenly over the fruit. Place the dish in the center of the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. The fruit should be tender and yielding when pierced with the tip of a knife. Allow to cool slightly before serving. Grate a little zest from the lemon on top of the crumble. Serve with scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with Orange Garnish if desired. Bring 2 small pots of water to a boil. Using a small knife, peel one single piece of skin from around the \\equator\\ (center) of each orange. Trim any thick pith off the inside of each peel, taking care they stay in one piece. Drop the zests into the first pot and boil for 1 minute. Strain and drop them into the second pot. Cook for 1 minute, strain and set them aside. In a third small pot, bring the sugar, 2 cups water and turmeric to a boil. Submerge the orange zests and cook over high heat until the liquid boils. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the zests are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the zests to a baking sheet and allow them to cool flat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 4554,&quot;Chocolate Whoopie Pies with Fresh Strawberries and Bruleed Marshmallows 1 stick butter, softened 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup Dutch process cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup sour cream 25 strawberries, hulled and sliced 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 bag large marshmallows Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with silicon mats or parchment paper and set aside. For the cookies: Beat the butter and sugar with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla until just incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt and baking powder. In a third bowl, combine the milk and sour cream. Add half of the milk mixture to butter mixture while mixing on low speed. Then add half of the flour mixture and mix until incorporated. Repeat the process. With a measured scoop, portion out the batter into small rounds on the prepared baking sheets, spaced at least an inch apart. You can make the cookies whatever size you like; I like mine a bit big so I use a 4-ounce ice cream scoop. Bake until the tops lightly spring back when touched, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. For the filling: Add the sliced strawberries to a bowl and sprinkle with the granulated sugar and let sit for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to a broil and set a rack 6 inches from the broiler. When the cookies are cooled, place them round-side down and then top half of them with sliced strawberries. Press 3 marshmallows together using the palm of your hand, until mostly flattened, and then place them on the other half of the cookies. Place the marshmallow-covered cookies back on the baking sheets and place under the broiler to let the marshmallows char and soften until lightly golden on top, 1 to 4 minutes. Keep an eye on them as they can burn quickly. For assembly: Top the strawberry side of the cookie with one of the marshmallow cookies, gently press together and then stand back and marvel at your creation. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 4555,&quot;Salad Nicoise 6 very fresh eggs 6 to 8 red-skinned or yukon gold potatoes, of a uniform, medium size (2-inch diameter) 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 pound very fresh, crisp, young, string-less green beans 2 tablespoons salt 1 tablespoon finely minced shallots or scallions 1/3 cup dry white wine 1/3 cup cold water Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 to 4 tablespoons excellent olive oil 1 large head Boston lettuce Oil and Lemon Dressing, recipe follows 3 to 4 ripe red tomatoes quartered through the stem or 12 to 16 ripe full-flavored cherry tomatoes halved through the stem 1 (2-ounce) can or bottle anchovy fillets packed in olive oil 1 (8-ounce) can oil-packed chunk white tuna, drained Fresh lemon juice 1 cup good mayonnaise 2 tablespoons capers (fine fat ones if possible) 1/2 cup small Italian or French black olives, pits in, and packed in brine Fresh parsley sprigs 1/2 lemon, zested and juiced (at least 1 tablespoon) 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/2 tablespoon finely minced shallots or scallions 1/2 cup excellent olive oil Instructions: With a push pin, pierce the large ends of eggs to release the air bubble, which otherwise can expand during cooking, cracking the egg shell. Into a 3-quart sauce pan place the eggs. Pour in 2 1/2 quarts of cold water. Bring just to the rolling boil, remove from heat, cover the pan closely, and set the timer for 17 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice cubes and water, and let cool for 2 minutes (to shrink the egg body from the shell) while you bring the egg water back to the boil. Then transfer the eggs back into the boiling water and let boil for exactly 10 seconds (to expand the shell from the egg body). At once, and 1 by 1, tap an egg gently all over on a hard surface to crack the shell and starting at the large end, peel under a thin stream of cold water. Return it to the iced water, and continue with the rest. Let them chill a good 20 minutes in the iced water?rapid cooling helps prevent the dark line between yolk and white. Always store hard-boiled eggs in the refrigerator, submerged in ice water in an uncovered container, where they will keep perfectly 3 to 4 days. Scrub the potatoes under running water with a vegetable brush, and place in a steamer basket over a saucepan containing 2 inches of water. Bring to the boil, lower heat to moderate, cover closely, and steam about 20 minutes or until cooked through?be sure they are really cooked through, cut one in half and taste carefully. Peel while still hot, halve them, cut into slices 1/4-inch thick. In a 2-quart bowl, combine salt, shallots, wine, and water. Lift the potatoes gently into a the 2-quart bowl. Using a bulb baster, so as not to break the slices, baste the potatoes with the liquid. Taste for seasoning adding more salt, if needed, grinds of pepper, and several spoonfuls of the olive oil. Baste several times as the potatoes cool. In a large kettle, set over moderately high heat, bring 6 quarts of water to the boil. Wash and drain the green beans, then snap off both ends. Add 2 tablespoons of salt to the boiling water and drop the beans into the kettle. Cover the kettle for a moment, just until it boils again. Uncover at once and boil slowly (moderate bubbles) for 3 to 4 minutes. The beans are done when just cooked through?taste one to be sure?just tender with the slightest crunch. Drain immediately. At once return the beans to the kettle and run cold water into it to cool the beans rapidly, adding a tray or two of ice cubes if you have them. When chilled, in 5 minutes or so, drain again, dry in a clean towel, and refrigerate in a covered bowl until ready to assemble salad. Separate the lettuce leaves, wash, and spin dry. Shortly before serving so that all elements will remain at their freshest, toss the lettuce leaves in a large bowl with just enough dressing to coat them. Taste the potatoes, adding a little more seasoning if necessary. Halve the eggs. Toss the green beans with a spoonful of the dressing. Lightly salt the cut surfaces of the tomatoes and dribble over a little dressing. Open and drain the anchovies, separating them with a form. Drain the canned tuna, flake gently, and season with lemon juice and pepper. Arrange the largest lettuce leaves nicely around the sides of the serving bowl or platter, and make a bed of the remaining leaves in the center, where you will pile the potatoes. Place the egg yolks against the lower part of the potatoes, spoon a dollop of mayonnaise over each yolk, and decorate with crossed strips of anchovies and a sprinkling of capers. Divide the beans, tomatoes, and tuna into 6 portions, and place at strategic intervals around the potatoes. Survey the platter, scattering black olives and tucking parsley springs wherever needed. Serve as soon as possible. Grate the lemon peel into a screw-top jar, add the salt, several grinds of pepper, mustard, minced shallots, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Shake well to blend, then pour in the oil and shake vigorously again. Taste for seasoning, adding more lemon, salt and pepper if needed.

Using the paddle attachment, start the mixer on low and mix until the dough just comes together, forming a ball. Lube the hook attachment with cooking spray. Attach the hook to the mixer and knead for 15 minutes on medium speed. Tear off a small piece of dough and flatten into a disc. Stretch the dough until thin. Hold it up to the light and look to see if the baker&#39;s windowpane, or taut membrane, has formed. If the dough tears before it forms, knead the dough for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Roll the pizza dough into a smooth ball on the countertop. Place into a stainless steel or glass bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil to the bowl and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours. Place the pizza stone or tile onto the bottom of a cold oven and turn the oven to its highest temperature, about 500 degrees F. If the oven has coils on the oven floor, place the tile onto the lowest rack of the oven. Split the pizza dough into 2 equal parts using a knife or a dough scraper. Flatten into a disk onto the countertop and then fold the dough into a ball. Wet hands barely with water and rub them onto the countertop to dampen the surface. Roll the dough on the surface until it tightens. Cover one ball with a tea towel and rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the steps with the other piece of dough. If not baking the remaining pizza immediately, spray the inside of a ziptop bag with cooking spray and place the dough ball into the bag. Refrigerate for up to 6 days. Sprinkle the flour onto the peel and place the dough onto the peel. Using your hands, form a lip around the edges of the pizza. Stretch the dough into a round disc, rotating after each stretch. Toss the dough in the air if you dare. Shake the pizza on the peel to be sure that it will slide onto the pizza stone or tile. (Dress and bake the pizza immediately for a crisp crust or rest the dough for 30 minutes if you want a chewy texture.) Brush the rim of the pizza with olive oil. Spread the pizza sauce evenly onto the pizza. Sprinkle the herbs onto the pizza and top with the cheese. Slide the pizza onto the tile and bake for 7 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown. Rest for 3 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 4564,&quot;Emeril&#39;s Gulfcoast Fishhouse Restaurant Baked Oysters 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1 tablespoon minced shallots 1 tablespoon minced parsley leaves, plus more for garnishing 1 pint shucked raw oysters, drained well and patted dry on paper towels 1 pint shucked raw oysters, drained well and patted dry on paper towels<br> 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/4 pound crabmeat, picked over for shells and cartilage 1/2 lemon, juiced, plus lemon wedges, for serving 1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan, plus 2 tablespoons, for garnish 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: In a small bowl combine the butter with the garlic, shallots, and 1 tablespoon of the parsley. Stir to blend thoroughly, and then transfer to the refrigerator while you prepare the oysters. Set the oven to the broil setting or preheated to 500 degrees F. Position the top oven rack in the upper third of the oven. Season the oysters with salt and pepper. Divide the oysters evenly between 6 individual gratin dishes just large enough to hold the oysters in 1 layer. Shallow gratin dishes approximately 4 by 6 by 1-inch that have a volume capacity of about 8 ounces work well. Sprinkle the crabmeat evenly over the oysters in the ramekins. Using a small spoon, place dabs of the compound butter over the tops of the dishes, dividing the entire amount of butter evenly among the 6 dishes. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top. In a small bowl combine the bread crumbs, grated cheese and olive oil. Sprinkle evenly over the oysters and transfer the gratin dishes to a large baking sheet and place in the oven. Broil until the crumbs are golden brown and the oysters are just cooked through and curled around the edges. While the oysters are baking, in a small bowl combine the bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan, and the olive oil. Stir until thoroughly combined. Remove the oysters from the oven and sprinkle the crumb mixture evenly over the tops of the oysters in the dishes. Return to the oven and bake until the crumbs are golden brown and the oysters are just cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes longer. Remove the oysters from the oven, garnish with the remaining Parmesan and parsley, and serve immediately, with lemon wedges for guests to use according to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 4565,&quot;Memphis Banana Bites 1/4 cup creamy natural peanut butter 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 1 1/2 cups dried banana chips, about 72 chips Instructions: Put the peanut butter and chocolate into a heatproof bowl and set over a bowl of barely simmering water, being sure the bowl does not touch the water. Heat the peanut butter and chocolate until just melted; stir until very smooth. Remove from the heat and cool until room temperature and the mixture has thickened. Transfer the chocolate mixture to a quart-sized resealable plastic bag or disposable pastry bag without a tip. Snip 1 corner with scissors to create a piping bag. Squeeze about 1/2 teaspoon of the chocolate mixture onto a banana chip and top with a second. Continue making banana chip sandwiches until the chocolate is used. Let the chocolate set completely at room temperature. Mini sandwiches can be stored covered at room temperature or refrigerated. They won&#39;t last long, though! Cook&#39;s Note: If the chocolate mixture gets too firm to pipe, warm it briefly over the simmering water in the bowl to loosen. If you have already transferred it to a piping bag, simply wrap your hands around the bag and hold it for a few minutes. The residual heat from your hands will soften the chocolate until it is easy to pipe. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 4566,&quot;Mojo Marinated Chicken with Grilled Purple Potatoes and Charred Corn and Black Bean Salsa with Grilled Flour Tortilla 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 medium purple potatoes, sliced Olive oil 1 ear corn, kernels cut from cob 1 small white onion, chopped 6 cloves garlic, minced 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed 1 small green pepper, cored, seeded and sliced<br> 1 jalapeno, seeded and sliced<br> 4 Roma tomatoes, chopped 1 bunch cilantro, leaves roughly chopped 1 lemon, halved 1 lime, halved 4 flour tortillas Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan on medium heat.<br> Season the chicken with salt and pepper, to taste, and grill until golden brown on each side and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side.

Mound on a work surface and make a well in the center. Pour 1/2 cup cold water into the well. Using a fork and working your way around the well, gradually mix the flour into the water. Continue mixing until the dough is crumbly. If the dough is too dry to come together, add up to 1/4 cup more water, a little at a time. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature,30 minutes. (The dough can be made a day ahead and refrigerated; bring it to room temperature before rolling.) Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time (and keeping the other pieces wrapped), roll the dough on the counter with your hands into a 1/2-inch-thick log. With a knife or bench scraper, cut the log into 1/2-inch pieces; roll each piece into a small ball. With floured hands, press your thumb into a dough ball and drag it toward you to form a bowl shape; put the dough on the tip of your index finger and turn it inside out.

Butter a 9-inch cake pan, line bottom with parchment paper and brush the paper with butter. Caramel peaches: Combine the sugar, corn syrup, allspice and water in a medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to high, and continue to cook, without stirring, until the mixture becomes an amber caramel, about 5 minutes. Pour the caramel into the prepared pan and set aside to cool. Halve and pit the peaches, but leave their skins on. Cut each half into 3 wedges. Arrange the wedges in concentric circles in the pan. Set aside while you make the cake batter. Cake: Whisk the all-purpose flour, white corn flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Slowly mix the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a hand-held electric mixer. Increase the speed to high, and continue beating until the butter is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at time, waiting for each to be fully incorporated before adding the next. While mixing at a low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the sour cream in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the flour. Increase the speed to medium and mix briefly to make a smooth batter. Pour the batter over the peaches and smooth over. Bake the cake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 to 45 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack, about 20 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan to release the cake. Carefully invert the cake onto a serving plate and remove the parchment paper.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly coat with cooking spray; set aside. With a serrated knife, cut the top quarter off the garlic head to expose the tops of the cloves. Place the garlic, cut side up, on a sheet of foil large enough to enclose it; drizzle with olive oil. Close the foil completely around garlic, crimping the sides and top so no steam can escape. Roast the garlic in the oven until softened and cooked through, about 30 minutes. Carefully remove the garlic from the foil and, squeezing from the bottom, release the roasted cloves into a medium bowl. Add the eggs and milk, stir to combine, and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk to combine the flour, baking powder, pepper and salt. Use a pastry blender, two knives or your fingers to combine the butter to make the mixture crumbly. Add the wet garlic mixture to the dry flour mixture and gently stir. Add the scallions; gently combine to evenly distribute. If the dough seems too dry, add more milk, a tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface. With your hands, pat into a 6-by-9-inch rectangle. Cut into 6 squares and then cut the squares in half diagonally.

Let stand 1 hour. To the couscous add the olive oil, parsley, mint, preserved lemon rind, pine nuts, salt and pepper. Mound the couscous in the center of a serving platter. Top with diced tomato. Surround the base with endive leaves. Serve at room temperature. Scrub the lemons under running water and pat dry. Cut a thin slice from each end of a lemon. Set on end and make a vertical cut 3/4 of the way through the fruit, leaving the 2 halves attached. Turn the lemon upside down, rotate 90 degrees, and make a second vertical cut, again 3/4 of the way through the fruit. Fill each cut with as much salt as it will hold. Place the lemon in a sterilized, 1-quart size, wide-mouth canning jar. Proceed in this manner for the remaining lemons, pressing as many into the jar as possible. Seal and set aside at room temperature. Add additional lemons over the next few days as the rinds of the first lemons begin to soften. By this time, the juices should have risen to cover the lemons. If not, add 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice mixed with 1 teaspoon of salt. This will prevent the top lemons from darkening. Store at room temperature until the rinds become tender, and the pulp acquires the consistency of jam, 3 to 4 weeks. Refrigerate. Use within 6 months.

Tap out the excess flour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt into a bowl and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the eggs and sugar and whisk on medium speed until well combined and lightened in color, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, slowly drizzle in the oil, and whisk until combined, then whisk on high speed for 1 minute to emulsify. Switch to the paddle attachment. Add the pumpkin puree to the egg mixture and mix on medium speed just until combined. Add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, mixing just until combined after each addition, approximately 5 seconds each time. Remove the bowl from the mixer and scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. Fold in the walnuts by hand. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until the cake springs back when touched and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Run an offset spatula around the edges of the pans, then invert the cakes onto the racks and let cool for about 20 minutes longer. Serve right away, or wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to serve and up to 3 days. To freeze, wrap tightly in a second layer of plastic wrap and store in the freezer for up to 2 months. Serve at room temperature. Note: To make your own pumpkin puree, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Scrub a small (about 4 pounds) sugar pumpkin well and wipe dry. Cut the pumpkin in half and place the halves, flesh-side down, on a greased cookie sheet and bake until very soft, about 1 hour. Let the pumpkin cool. Scrape out the seeds and stringy fibers and discard. Scoop out the flesh of the pumpkin and process until smooth in a food processor or pass through a food mill to make a puree.

Makes about 3 cups 10 ounces 62 percent cacao chocolate, chopped 2/3 cup (2 1/2 ounces) sifted powdered sugar 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream 2 large egg yolks 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature Combine the chocolate and powdered sugar in a heatproof bowl. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream to a gentle simmer. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Nest the bowl over a pan of simmering water to make a bain-marie. Heat, stirring, until all of the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat. Whisk the egg yolks together in a small heatproof bowl. Pour about 1/2 cup of the melted chocolate mixture into the yolks while whisking, to temper them. Pour the tempered mixture back into the pan of chocolate and whisk to combine. Add the butter and stir until smooth. Pour the hot ganache through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean heatproof bowl. Use the ganache immediately, or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Ganache does not freeze well. Next, microwave on 50 percent power for 10-second intervals, stirring between each, until the ganache reaches the desired consistency. You will usually need to add 1 or 2 tablespoons of hot water to loosen a cold ganache. For a glossy shine, it needs to return to the mixer for beating.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sift the already sifted cake flour with the baking soda, baking powder and salt. Cream the butter in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until soft, then add the sugar and mix. Add the yolk, the egg and the vanilla and whip at medium-high speed until light and fluffy. With the mixer running at low speed, add a third of the flour mixture and mix. Then add half of the sour cream and mix. Add another third of the flour and mix. Add the remaining sour cream and mix, then the remaining flour. Give it one last mix to make sure everything is blended in. Pour the batter into the muffin cups, filling them 3/4 full. Bake until firm to the touch in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Set the pan on a wire rack and let cool. To make the butterflies, spread a thick layer of rainbow sprinkles on a plate. Cut off the top rounded \\cap\\ (like the cap of a mushroom or a muffin) of each cupcake. Spread the flat top of each \\beheaded\\ cupcake with frosting. Cut a \\V\\ shape wedges out of the center of each cap, creating 2 semicircles that will serve as the butterfly wings. Spread the flat cut side of the 2 semicircles with frosting, then dip in rainbow sprinkles to coat. Place the 2 wings on top of each cupcake, sprinkles side up, so that the curved sides meet in the middle. Lay 3 strands of red licorice down the center of each one to make the body. Use two pieces of black licorice to make the antennae. Pipe 2 black dots for the eyes, placing one white sprinkle in the center of each eye. Over medium heat, cook the flour and milk until thickened. Let cool. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Beat in the flour mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 4633,&quot;Turkey and Poblano Red Eye Stew 6 poblano peppers 4 cups turkey or chicken stock<br> 2 tablespoons olive or canola oil<br> 2 large starchy potatoes, peeled and cut to 1-inch dice Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons ancho cl powder or mild chili powder blend<br> 4 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 2 onions, chopped<br> 1 cup strong coffee<br> About 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 tablespoons light brown sugar<br> 1 large fresh bay leaf<br> 1 small cinnamon stick<br> 1 cup boiling water 1/2 cup masa or corn meal<br> 1 to 1 1/2 pounds Buttermilk Brined Turkey Breast, recipe below, or roast turkey breast, cut to 1-inch dice Sour cream, for passing 4 cups buttermilk 1/4 cup Sriracha or other hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s Red Hot<br> 2 round tablespoons kosher salt<br> 6 to 8 peppercorns<br> 2 to 3 cloves garlic, crushed<br> 1 lemon, sliced<br> A few sprigs chives, coarsely chopped<br> A few sprigs dill, coarsely chopped<br> A few sprigs parsley, coarsely chopped<br> 3 boneless turkey breasts (about 2 1/2 pounds)<br> Olive or canola oil<br> Poultry seasoning<br> Instructions: Over an open flame or under the broiler, char the peppers all over. Cover and cool enough to handle. Peel and seed the peppers, then puree 3 of them with 1 cup of the stock in a food processor. Dice the remaining 2 peppers into bite-size pieces and reserve for later use. Heat the oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat, add the potatoes and cl powder, and then season with salt and pepper. Cook until the potatoes start to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Then add the garlic and onions, and cook to tender, 7 to 8 minutes more. Add the coffee, Worcestershire, sugar, bay leaf, cinnamon, the remaining 3 cups stock, the pureed peppers and the chopped peppers. Pour the boiling water over the masa and stir, then add to stew.

Remove turkey breasts from the brine and pat them dry. Arrange the breasts on the prepared baking rack and coat the skin with a little oil, sprinkle with poultry seasoning and cook until a thermometer reads 165 degrees F and the skin is light to medium golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 4634,&quot;Crudites Wreath 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 large shallots, finely chopped (about 1 cup) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 1 cup 2-percent Greek yogurt 1/4 cup whole milk 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives 6 cups broccoli florets and/or broccolini stalks 3 cups green beans, ends trimmed (about 12 ounces) 2 heads Romanesco cauliflower cut into florets (about 6 1/2 cups) 12 shishito peppers 9 red cherry or grape tomatoes Kosher salt 1 teaspoon olive oil Instructions: Make the dip: Heat the olive oil in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and 1/2 teaspoon of salt and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent and soft, about 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup of water and the balsamic vinegar, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots are soft and caramelized, 12 to 15 minutes; let cool slightly. Combine the shallots, yogurt, milk, chives, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl and stir until well blended. Cover and chill for 30 minutes before serving. The dip will keep, refrigerated, overnight if you want to make ahead of time. While the dip chills, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and season generously with salt. Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water. Set aside. Carefully place the broccoli or broccolini into the boiling water, and cook just until the florets turn bright green and are crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the broccoli to the ice-water bath to stop the cooking and to preserve the bright green color. Once cool, transfer the broccoli to a paper towel-lined plate to dry. Place the green beans in the boiling water and cook just until the beans turn bright green, about 1 minute. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer the green beans to the ice-water bath to stop the cooking and to preserve the bright green color. Once cool, transfer the green beans to a paper towel-lined plate to dry. Add the Romanesco cauliflower to the boiling water and cook just until the cauliflower turns bright green and is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer the cauliflower to the ice-water bath to cool, then to a paper towel-lined plate to dry. Heat a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the olive oil, shishito peppers and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, tossing, until they begin to blister in spots, about 2 minutes. (Do not overcook the peppers or they will lose their color and become too soft.) Remove the peppers from the pan and set aside to cool. On a round platter 18 inches in diameter, arrange the broccoli, green beans, cauliflower and shishito peppers into a large ring with a hole in the center to create a ?wreath? shape, making sure to alternate the vegetables throughout. Add three clusters of cherry tomatoes (three tomatoes per cluster) to create accent \\ornaments.\\ Serve with the onion dip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 4635,&quot;Chocolate Malt Sandwiches 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder, plus more for dusting (optional) 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup malted milk powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 12 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, at room temperature 4 ounces white chocolate, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons malted milk powder Pinch of salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: Make the cookies: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, malted milk powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. With a mixer on medium-high speed, add the vanilla and then the butter, a few pieces at a time, and mix until the dough looks like wet sand and holds together when pinched, about 5 minutes. Scrape the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper and pat into a 1/2-inch-thick round. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and refrigerate until the dough is slightly firm, about 10 minutes. Roll out the dough between the parchment sheets to 1/4 inch thick. Peel off the top sheet and cut the dough into squares or rounds using 1 1/2-to-2-inch cookie cutters. Reroll the scraps and repeat. (Refrigerate the dough if it gets too soft.) Place the cookies 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the cookies are set and no longer shiny, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Prepare the filling: Combine the white chocolate, malted milk powder, salt and vanilla in a large bowl. Bring the cream to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat, then pour over the white chocolate mixture and stir until smooth. Refrigerate until cold, about 25 minutes. Beat with a mixer until thick and spreadable, about 1 minute. Spread about 2 teaspoons of the filling on the underside of half of the cookies, then sandwich with the remaining cookies. Dust with cocoa powder, if desired. Store in the refrigerator up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 4636,&quot;Curried Potatoes and Chickpeas 1 1/2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch chunks Kosher salt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed 2 cups fried onions (one 2.8-ounce can) 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus leaves for topping 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced (remove seeds for less heat) Instructions: Put the potatoes, 2 teaspoons salt and enough cold water to cover in a medium saucepan.

Grate 3 to 4 tablespoons of the onion directly into the food processor so the juice falls into the tomatoes. Add the sugar, basil, garlic and a liberal drizzle of EVOO (about 1 tablespoon), and season with sea salt and pepper. Whizz the mixture up until it&#39;s pureed, then transfer it to a small pot. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook 20 to 30 minutes. (If you&#39;re not serving the sauce immediately, cool and then refrigerate it. Any leftovers are delicious on spaghetti with butter and cheese for a more simple supper another night. It also freezes well if you want to make a double or triple batch.) Rinse out the food processor and return the bowl to the base. For the cl paste: Finely chop the chiles (remove the seeds if you want to curb their heat a little). Sprinkle some sea salt over the chiles on the cutting board, then mash in the garlic to form a paste. Mix with the harissa in a small container. Cover and store in the refrigerator. For the pesto: Lightly toast the pine nuts in a small skillet. Let cool completely. Combine the pine nuts, basil, parsley, EVOO, cheese and garlic in the food processor. Season with salt, pepper and a few grates of nutmeg. Pulse until the mixture is well blended, then transfer to a small container. Cover and store in the refrigerator. (The pesto freezes well, so double or triple the batch if you like.) To serve, bring the sauces to room temperature. Reserve one-third of the cl for other uses. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, then cook the spaghetti until al dente. Reserve 1 cup cooking liquid, then drain the pasta. Meanwhile, reheat the tomato sauce in a small pot over medium-low heat. Put the pasta in a serving bowl, douse with the reserved cooking water and stir in all of the tomato sauce and half of the pesto. Drizzle with EVOO and add 1 tablespoon of the cl sauce at a time, adjusting it to your preferred level of heat. Toss vigorously to combine. Serve with lots of cheese and the remaining cl paste and pesto sauce for stirring in to each person&#39;s taste.

Put the tomatoes in the center of a large sheet of foil, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, gather the edges up to the center and fold over to form a purse. Grill for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat, and, being careful of the steam, open the pouch. Pour the tomatoes and their juices into a medium bowl, mash with a fork to make a chunky sauce and stir in the vinegar, basil, 1 teaspoon of the brown sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. While the tomatoes are cooking, combine 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil, the remaining 2 teaspoons brown sugar, the paprika, cloves, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a small bowl to make a paste. Coat the pork generously with the paste. Oil the grill grates, and grill the pork over direct heat for 6 minutes, turning occasionally. Move the pork to indirect heat, cover and cook until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of each piece registers 145 degrees F, about 10 minutes more. Transfer the pork to a baking sheet, and let rest for 10 minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch chunks. Toss the broccoli with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl. Place a grill basket on the grill, add the broccoli and grill, turning frequently, until the edges are charred and the insides are tender, about 6 minutes; transfer to the baking sheet. Brush the pineapple slices with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and grill until lightly charred, about 3 minutes on each side. Cut into 1/2-inch chunks, and transfer to the baking sheet. Brush both sides of the pitas with oil, and grill until marked, about 1 minute per side. Top the pitas with about 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce, then top with the pork, broccoli, pineapple and Cheddar, dividing evenly among them.

Add the broth, olive oil, fennel fronds, thyme, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then add enough water to cover the chicken and turn the heat to medium low. Poach the chicken, turning occasionally and keeping the liquid just below a simmer, until just cooked through, about 30 minutes (a thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken breast should register 155 degrees F to 160 degrees F). Remove the chicken to a plate with a slotted spoon and let cool to room temperature. Increase the heat to medium high and simmer the cooking liquid until the garlic is tender, about 5 more minutes; remove the garlic and set aside. Strain the cooking liquid; reserve 1/4 cup and set aside. While the chicken is cooking, place the red peppers directly on a stovetop gas burner over high heat and char on all sides, turning with tongs, about 10 minutes. (If you don&#39;t have a gas stove, char the peppers on a baking sheet under the broiler, turning occasionally, about 12 minutes.) Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside, 20 minutes. Peel the skin off the peppers with your fingers; discard the stems and seeds and chop. Make the aioli: Puree about three-quarters of the roasted red peppers in a blender with the mayonnaise, reserved garlic and 1 tablespoon lemon juice until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Make the salad: Thinly slice the fennel bulbs (use a mandoline if you have one) and transfer to a large bowl. Finely chop the remaining roasted red peppers, then add to the bowl along with the parsley, the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and the reserved 1/4 cup cooking liquid; toss. Season with salt and pepper. Slice the chicken; top with the aioli and serve with the fennel salad.

Whisk together the whiskey, brown sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the oil and the garlic. Add the steaks, turn a few times to coat with the marinade and let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, quarter each potato lengthwise to form wedges and put in a medium pot. Cover with cold water to cover by 1-inch and add salt until the water tastes like sea water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until tender (but not falling apart), about 15 minutes. Drain well. Toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil.<br> Remove the steaks from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Pour the marinade into a small pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes until slightly reduced, making sure the sugar does not burn, to make a glaze and sauce for the steak.<br> Grill the steaks until an internal temperature on an instant-read thermometer reads about 130 degrees F, 3 to 4 minutes per side, brushing with the boiled marinade several times in the last few minutes of grilling time. (If you are cooking the filet mignon steaks, you will need to increase this time to 8 to 10 minutes per side to account for the thicker cut). Transfer to a large plate to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. While the steaks grill, add the potatoes to the grill and grill until well-marked and crispy, turning to grill all sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer the potato wedges to a bowl.<br> Toss the grilled potatoes with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, chives, vinegar and salt and pepper to taste.

In a small bowl, beat one of the eggs with a fork and pour it into the flour mixture. Add the cold water, sugar, white vinegar and salt. Stir gently to combine. Form the dough into 2 evenly sized balls and place each ball into a gallon resealable plastic bag. Using a rolling pin, slightly flatten each ball of dough (to about 1/2 inch thick) to make rolling easier later. Seal the bags and place them in the freezer until you need them. (If you will be using them immediately, it&#39;s still a good idea to put them in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes to chill.) For the filling: Combine the cherries and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook until the juices release and are hot and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Stir in the balsamic vinegar and cook for 1 minute. Stir together the cornstarch and lemon juice in a small bowl until combined and add to the cherry mixture. Continue to cook until glossy and thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. When you are ready to make the crust, remove the dough from the freezer and let thaw for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a floured surface, roll out one piece of dough starting at the center and working your way out. (Sprinkle some flour over top of the dough if it&#39;s a bit too moist.) If the dough is sticking to the countertop, use a metal spatula and carefully scrape it up and flip it over, then continue rolling until it&#39;s about 1/2 inch larger in diameter than your pie pan. With a spatula, lift the dough into the pie pan. Gently press the dough against the edges of the pan. Go around the pie pan pinching and tucking the dough to make a clean edge. Fill with the cooled cherry mixture. Roll out the second dough the same size and place it over the pie. Trim off the edges and crimp the top and bottom crusts together to seal them. Cut a few vent holes in the top. Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl for the egg wash. Brush the top with the egg wash and sprinkle with sugar Put the pie onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil and bake until the filling is bubbling and the crust is browned, about 50 minutes. If the crust is getting too brown before the pie is finished, cover with foil and continue baking.

Press the back of a mold or shape of your choice (like a tablespoon measuring spoon) firmly into the sugar to create an impression as the mold for your lollipops The impression should be at least 1/4-inch deep. Make sure none of the sheet tray shows through the sugar in your mold, otherwise the lollipops will stick to it. Place a lollipop stick with 1/4-inch of the stick inside the impression. Make a dam with the powdered sugar to close the opening in the mold that the stick made, so no sugar syrup can escape. Repeat the process to make 4 rows of 3 molds each.<br> Reduce the pomegranate juice in a small saucepot over high heat until it&#39;s thick and syrupy and there are about 2 tablespoons left, 2 to 3 minutes. (You will only use half of this, but reducing further will not allow for enough liquid enough to pour.)<br> Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup and 1/4 cup water in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.

Bring the pan to medium heat swirling occasionally. When most of the water has reduced and the mixture seems homogenous, removed the garlic and add the carrots and stir until they are coated. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes or until the carrots are completely coated and hot.

Make the coleslaw: Whisk the mayonnaise, sour cream, vinegar, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Add the cabbage and toss to coat. Refrigerate while you fry the chicken. Fry the chicken, turning halfway through, until golden brown and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Spread the buns with chipotle mayonnaise. Sandwich the fried chicken and coleslaw in the buns. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, 1 hour to infuse the flavor. Whisk 3 cups buttermilk, the hot sauce and mustard in a large bowl. Stir in the garlic and onion slices, then the chicken. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours. Whisk the flour, baking powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper in a large bowl. Drizzle in the remaining 1/3 cup buttermilk and whisk to form small shaggy clumps. One piece at a time, remove the chicken from the buttermilk, letting any excess drip off, and coat in the flour mixture, pressing with your hands to coat well. Transfer to a rack set on a baking sheet. Fill a large cast-iron skillet with 1 inch vegetable oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Carefully add 4 to 5 pieces chicken to the hot oil. The oil temperature will drop; adjust the heat as needed to maintain a temperature of 325 degrees F. Fry the chicken, without turning, until the crust starts browning, about 2 minutes. Flip the chicken and fry, turning occasionally, until browned and crisp all over and a thermometer inserted into the breasts registers 160 degrees F and the thighs 170 degrees F, 12 to 16 minutes. Remove with tongs to a clean rack set on a baking sheet; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let the oil temperature return to 350 degrees F before frying the remaining chicken. After all the chicken is cooked, fry the onions, if desired: Drain the onions, separate the rings, then coat with the flour mixture. Fry, turning once, until crisp and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. We used a big spoonful of baking powder in the coating for this Nashville-style chicken. It draws out moisture, so the skin gets extra crisp before it?s dipped in fiery cayenne-spiced butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 4699,&quot;Lowest Fat Chocolate and Grand Marnier Souffle Butter or margarine Granulated sugar 4 egg yolks 5 egg whites 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa 1/4 cup all purpose flour 1/8 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup no-fat (skim) milk 1/4 cup Grand Marnier 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 1 tablespoon grated orange peel Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Bring to a boil and allow to simmer until it has reduced by half. Strain and keep on the heat at a low simmer until ready to use. Add the olive oil, fennel, onions, a pinch of salt and crushed red pepper flakes in a saute pan over medium heat. Let the fennel and onions cook until translucent. Then add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano and white wine. Let it reduce until there is about 1/4 cup of liquid left. Then add the squid, shrimp and 1/2 cup of the shrimp stock. Stir in the parsley. Cook the fresh squid ink pasta in salted boiling water until tender, but still has a bite. Add the cooked pasta to the saute pan and toss to coat. Garnish the pasta with fennel fronds, a drizzle of olive oil and grated Parmesan. Mound the flour on a clean, dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely is better here). Crack the eggs into the hole and add the egg yolk, olive oil, squid ink and some salt. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, squid ink and salt; then begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture, being careful not to break the sides of the well or else the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together into a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading, it is VERY important to put your body weight into it; get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader, or 10 to 15 minutes for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it; you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let it rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes. If using immediately, do not refrigerate. Roll and cut the pasta into the desired shape. How smooth and supple! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 4713,&quot;Super-Stuffed Baked Potatoes 4 russet potatoes (about 8 ounces each) 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 12-ounce package kielbasa, cut into 4 pieces and halved lengthwise 2 leeks (white and light green parts only), halved and thinly sliced 1/2 small head Savoy or green cabbage, thinly sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese (about 4 ounces) 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Spicy brown or whole-grain mustard, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the red pepper flakes and garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic is slightly softened, about 1 minute. Add the crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened and the flavors are melded together, about 15 minutes. Discard the basil and let cool while you make the dough. For the dough: Add the flour and 1 teaspoon salt to a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the oil and 1 cup of lukewarm water and mix until a sticky dough forms. If the dough doesn&#39;t hold together when squeezed, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until smooth and springy, 5 to 7 minutes. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Put a pizza stone or large inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat to 400 degrees F.

To prepare the chicken, lift the skin gently with a knife and insert some small pieces of butter and slices of lemon under the breast. Make a ball of the stuffing and place in the cavity. Tie the chicken together with a string. Lay 6 pieces of streaky smoked bacon over the chicken. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Rub salt and butter into the skin. Heat oil in roasting pan and put the chicken and the onion into it. Cook for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Baste the chicken thoroughly every 20 minutes. After 1 hour and 10 minutes remove the crispy bacon slices and place them on a dish for serving. Return the chicken to the oven for another 20 minutes. While the Chicken is cooking, start the gravy: To make stock, combine the giblets with a bay leaf and an onion in a saucepan. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Add carrot and peppercorns. When the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a plate and keep warm. Put the roasting tin on heat and drain off fat with a spoon. Add 2 tablespoons of flour to the juice. Keep stirring. When the juice is brown add the stock. Sieve the gravy to remove any lumps. Add a splash of white wine if desired. In a medium saucepan melt the butter and sweat the onions until translucent.

This will make it much easier to handle. Line the guttering with heavy-duty aluminum foil. To assemble, place a layer of Dark Chocolate Brownie Bites in the bottom of the guttering. Top with the ice cream scoops and scatter over more brownie bites. Drizzle with Strawberry Sauce and Hot Fudge Sauce. Sprinkle with rainbow sprinkles. Squirt mounds of whipped cream across the sundae and top each mound with a cherry. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 18-by-13-inch pan (half sheet pan) with cooking spray. In a medium-large saucepan, heat the butter and unsweetened chocolate over low heat, whisking occasionally, until smooth and melted. Sprinkle in the cocoa powder and whisk to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool for about 5 minutes. Stir the sugar and vanilla into the chocolate mixture until just combined. One at a time, stir in the eggs. Gently stir in the flour until halfway incorporated. Add the chocolate chips and stir just until combined. Pour the batter (it will be very thick!) into the prepared pan, spreading to even out the top. Bake for 30 minutes, then check the brownies with a toothpick. If they are overly gooey/messy, return to the oven for 5 to 10 more minutes (just be careful not to burn the edges). Allow to cool completely (important!), then cut into small squares. Place the strawberries, sugar, vanilla and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly, and cook until the strawberries are very soft, a good 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and use a potato masher to completely smush them to smithereens. Pour the mixture into a fine-mesh strainer placed over a bowl. Use a spoon to stir the fruit so the liquid is forced through. Continue until almost all of the liquid is in the bowl. Set the pulp aside. Skim as much foam off the sauce as you can. Pour the skimmed sauce back into the same saucepan, add 1/4 cup of the pulp back in and boil again for 3 minutes over medium-high heat. Skim off any more foam that has formed on the surface, then allow the sauce to cool slightly before pouring it into a pitcher or jar. Refrigerate it to thicken and serve it cold.<br> Combine the sugar, cream, cocoa and butter in a small saucepot over medium heat and cook, stirring, until the butter melts and everything is combined, a few minutes. Transfer to a mason jar and store in the refrigerator. It will harden as it cools so when ready to use, simply reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 4781,&quot;Chocolate Pretzel Crisps Nachos 1 bag Original Pretzel Crisps?

Brush the sides, but not the bottom lightly with butter and sprinkle the pumpkin seeds in the bottom. Whisk the maple syrup, brown sugar, cream, corn syrup, pie spice, lemon juice, and salt together in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Brush down the sides on the saucepan with water to remove every grain of sugar. Set the candy thermometer into the sugar. Cook the mixture over medium heat, without stirring, until the mixture reaches the firm ball stage, 248 degrees F, about 18 to 20 minutes. Carefully stir in the pumpkin puree. Return to the heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the caramel reaches the soft ball stage, 240 degrees F, about 15 minutes more. Remove from the heat and stir in butter and vanilla. Pour the caramel over the pumpkin seeds in the prepared pan. Smooth to an even layer. Cool to room temperature. When fully cooled peel from the waxed paper or foil and cut into 24 (1-inch) squares.

Set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season with salt. Using a rolling pin and pasta machine, roll out the Fresh Pasta Dough into a long sheet about 1/16 inch thick. Use flour as necessary to keep the surfaces from sticking. With a knife, cut the long sheet into 2 equal sheets. Cut each sheet into 4 equal squares, about 4 inches per side (don&#39;t worry if they&#39;re slightly rectangular). Divide the meat mixture among 4 of the pasta squares; the filling should come 1/2 inch from the edges. On each raviolo, press a small hole into the center of the filling and top with an egg yolk. Brush the edges of the pasta with a small amount of water, and top each with another square of pasta. Carefully seal the edges, making sure no air pockets are present. Blanch the raviolo in the boiling water for 2 minutes, just to cook the pasta and warm the filling through. Transfer to a large saute pan and add the butter, a small amount of the pasta water, the Parmigiano-Reggiano and lemon zest and juice. Reduce the liquid until the pasta is glazed. Serve hot. In a mixer with a paddle attachment, combine the flour, egg yolks, milk, olive oil and salt and mix until the dough begins to clump. Empty the contents of the bowl onto a clean surface and knead until the pasta dough is a smooth yellow and has become elastic, about 2 minutes. If the dough is under-kneaded it will crack when you are rolling it out. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes before rolling out. One day before cooking, season the short ribs liberally with salt. Allow the meat to marinate in the refrigerator, uncovered, overnight. The next day, preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Pat the short ribs dry with a paper towel. Heat a cast-iron Dutch oven over medium-high to high heat. Add enough canola oil to coat the bottom of the pot and sear the short ribs until they are brown and crusty. Remove the short ribs from the pot and let them rest. Drain the scorched oil from the pot and add a thin film of fresh canola oil. Add the carrots, celery, garlic, ginger and onions. Reduce the heat to medium and sweat the vegetables until they&#39;re translucent. Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen the brown bits. Add the tomatoes and continue to saute until the tomatoes begin to soften and break down. Add the star anise and cinnamon. Add the red wine and let it reduce by half. Add the short ribs back to the pot and add enough cold water to just cover the ribs. Bring the liquid to a simmer; skim off the scum and then cover the pot. Transfer to the oven and let the short ribs braise until they&#39;re nearly falling apart, perhaps 3 hours. Remove the short ribs from the liquid and let them rest. Strain the braising liquid and then return it to the pot. Discard the solids, except the garlic. Reduce the braising liquid over medium-high heat until it starts to thicken. Remove the bones and excess fat from the ribs and pull the meat. Add enough of the liquid to the shredded meat to moisten the mixture. Add the braised garlic cloves, mashing them with a fork. Season with salt and pepper as needed.

For the coconut rice: Add the rice into a pot (one you have a matching lid for!). Spoon in the coconut oil and mix with the rice; this creates a nice fat barrier to ensure well-separated grains of rice. Add the well-shaken can of coconut milk, water, salt and sugar to the pot. Give it a good stir and cover with a lid. Bring to a boil and then immediately bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Bring it off the heat with the cover still on and let the rice rest for 15 minutes. For the curry: Place the unsweetened shredded coconut onto a small sheet tray. Place into the oven to toast for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Melt the coconut oil in a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the green curry paste and stir to combine. Toast it in the coconut oil for 5 minutes, until fragrant to bloom the spices, whisking frequently. Add the coconut milk, brown sugar and fish sauce and stir to combine. Add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes. Add the snap peas, bell pepper and kale and continue to cook for another 2 to 3 minutes.

Add the broth, 4 cups of water, chicken breasts and cannellini beans, bring to a high simmer and cook until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Carefully remove the cooked chicken and set aside until cool enough to handle. Add the quinoa to the pot and cook until translucent and tender and the threadlike germ wraps around each kernel, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, remove and discard the chicken skin and bones. Shred the meat into bite-size pieces and add back to the soup. Add the frozen beans. Make the dumplings . Stir together the flour, parsley, eggs, milk, baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Put half the batter into a perforated colander; holding the colander just over the simmering soup, scrape and work the batter through the holes with a rubber spatula, letting the tiny dumplings drop into the soup. Cook until the dumplings float, stirring to break up any large clumps, about 1 minute. Repeat with the remaining batter.

Shape each piece of pizza dough into a ball. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on each of 2 rimmed baking sheets, place 1 dough ball on each baking sheet and turn to coat in the oil. Place a metal cooling rack upside down on the grill perpendicular to the grill grates (or use a grill basket); brush the rack with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Working in batches, grill the pineapple, scallions and ham, turning as needed, until lightly charred, 5 to 8 minutes per batch; transfer to a plate as each batch is done. Cut the ham slices in half, if desired. Using tongs, remove the cooling rack from the grill. Pat and stretch or roll each dough ball into an approximately 8-by-12-inch oval. Carefully place each piece of dough directly on the grill and cook until marked and golden, about 5 minutes. Flip the crusts and top evenly with the cheese, ham, scallions and pineapple. Continue grilling until the cheese melts and the crust is cooked through, about 6 more minutes. (If the crust is browning too quickly, slide the pizzas to the outer edge of the grill.) Transfer the pizzas to a cutting board and cut into pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 4803,&quot;Spicy Chicken Empanadas 2 1/2 kilograms (5.51 pounds) all-purpose flour 5 large eggs<br> 2 ounces salt<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 1/2 cups water<br> 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter 10 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast 1 cup canola oil 5 1/2 pounds chopped onions<br> 1 pound green bell peppers, chopped in food processor 1 pound red bell peppers, chopped in food processor 2 ounces salt<br> 2 ounces freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 ounce paprika<br> 1 ounce garlic powder 1 ounce crushed red pepper flakes 1 ounce dried oregano 1 ounce basil 400 milliliters chipotle sauce<br> 1 liter tomato Large eggs, whisked with 1 tablespoon water per egg, for the egg wash Instructions: For the empanada dough: Mix all empanada ingredients in a mixer. Let dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. For the filling: Bake the chicken breast until fully cooked. Put breast meat in a food processor and pulse until chopped (you don&#39;t want very small pieces). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil. Add onions, green and red bell peppers, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, red pepper, oregano and basil. Cook until onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Pour in chipotle sauce and stir. Finally add tomato sauce. Allow filling to cool. To form the empanadas, knead the dough. Roll the dough out by hand or with a commercial sheeter. Cut out circles of dough. Place a dough circle in an empanada mold if you have one, but it&#39;s not necessary; fill with chicken mixture. Wet the edges of the dough with your fingers. Close the mold to seal, or fold dough over filling and use the tines of a fork to seal the edges. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Use a pastry brush to paint empanadas with an even coat of egg wash. Preheat a convection oven to 450 degrees F, or regular oven to 400 degrees F. Place empanadas on greased baking sheets.

Use a rubber spatula to fold the almond mixture into the French meringue in two additions, being careful not to deflate the batter. Gently fold in the melted butter, then the sifted flour, just until incorporated. Using an offset spatula, spread about two-thirds of the batter onto a parchment lined sheet pan. Spread the remaining batter onto half of another parchment lined sheet pan. Lightly rest the edge of the spatula on the batter and gently push the excess toward the edges of both baking sheets. Dust the tops of the cake layers with powdered sugar for a nicer crust. Bake until lightly and evenly browned on top, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the cake layers from the oven and immediately unmold onto a wire rack to keep the heat of the baking sheet from continuing to bake them. To unmold, invert your cooling rack and place it on top of the cake layer then flip it over. Remove the parchment paper when the layers are completely cool. Set aside until ready to use. For the Ganache: Pour the heavy cream into a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, and cook over medium-high heat until bubbles begin to form around the edges. Place the bittersweet chocolate into a medium-sized bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let it sit for about 30 seconds to disperse the heat and melt the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth and homogenous. Set aside until ready to use. Do not refrigerate. To assemble the cake, cut the large layer in half. You should now have three equally sized pieces of cake. Place 1 layer on a parchment lined sheet pan. Over the top, spread half of the ganache to the edges in an even layer. Cover with another cake layer, then evenly spread the raspberry jam over the top all the way to the edges. Top with the third layer of cake and spread the remaining ganache evenly to the edges. It is very important for this layer to be even as it is the top of the cake. Place the assembled cake in the refrigerator for 1 hour. To serve, decorate with fresh raspberries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4844,&quot;Sea Bass with Cranberry Pineapple Pepper Relish 2 cups fresh or frozen chopped cranberries 1/2 cup finely diced pineapple 1 tablespoon sugar 2 small serrano peppers, seeded and finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon roasted habanero pepper paste 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon apple cider 1/4 cup peach Schnapps Salt 4 (6-ounce) sea bass fillets 1/2 cup teriyaki 1 teaspoon grated ginger 2 tablespoons sesame oil 1 green onion, finely chopped 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: To prepare the relish, wash, rinse, and remove bad cranberries.

Arrange the sweet potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place in the center of the oven and bake until fully cooked, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. To check for doneness, pierce one with the tip of a small knife; it should slide in and out easily. Set the potatoes aside until cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, place the chicken stock, ham hock and 1 cup water in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, adding more water if the liquid runs low, until the tough skin of the ham hock softens, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the ham hock and transfer to a flat surface. Peel away or use a knife to cut off the tough skin. Discard the skin and cut the meat beneath it into smaller pieces. Put the meat back into the stock and simmer gently over low heat so the meat flakes and flavors the liquid. You want to end up with 1 to 1 1/2 cups meaty, flavorful liquid. Keep warm. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat until it turns a light brown color, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon, orange zest and juice and stir to combine. Set aside.

Coat both sides of the tri-tips with half of the seasoning mixture, rubbing it in as you would a dry rub. Let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Place the tri-tips over a low temperature fire, 1 with fat side up, and the other with fat side down. Turn as the first side gets crispy, approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Be careful of flare-ups, as the dripping fat will fuel the fire. Turn the tri-tips before the heat pushes juices out the top, and continue to turn using this timing method throughout the cooking process. After turning, baste with sauce and season lightly, 4 times per side. Continue turning until the tri-tips are cooked to your liking. Remove from fire and let rest for 10 minutes before cutting into 1/2-inch slices against the grain. Mix together all ingredients in a small bowl. Whisk together vinegar and oil in a small bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 4866,&quot;Taleggio Fondue 1 clove garlic 1 whole clove<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 1 cup chicken stock<br> 1 1/2 cups white wine 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 pound Taleggio cheese with rind, diced<br> 3/4 pound white Cheddar, grated<br> 3/4 pound Gruyere, grated<br> 2 teaspoons vodka<br> Dipper suggestions: baguette cut into bite-size pieces, cauliflower florets, grilled chicken cut into bite-size pieces, cherry tomatoes Instructions: Rub the bottom and sides of a medium heavy pot with the garlic.

Wash mussel shells and add to boiling water. Cover and cook until mussels open. Discard any mussels that have not opened. Drain the mussels and let cool enough to handle. Pull them out of the shells and snip off the beard with a pair of scissors. Set mussels aside and keep warm. Discard half of the shells and reserve the others. Clean the spinach, trim off any large stems and plunge into a fresh pot of boiling water 3 to 4 minutes. Drain well. When cool enough to handle, chop spinach coarsely. Keep warm. In a small skillet, combine shallots, wine and lemon juice. Reduce over low heat until liquid is nearly gone (watch carefully as the reduction will scorch easily at this point). Remove pan from heat and add one or two pieces of butter. Stir steadily with a whisk until the butter is no longer in a solid form, yet not liquid either. It should resemble the consistency of a thin mayonnaise. Incorporate the rest of the butter, one or two pieces at a time, returning the pan to a low heat as necessary, retaining the same consistency. If butter separates, the heat is too high; remove it from the heat and whisk rapidly to re-emulsify. Set sauce aside and cover to keep warm. To serve, place about 1 teaspoon of the warm spinach in each reserved half -shell and top with mussel. Pour 2 teaspoons warm sauce over each. If desired, garnish with slivers of red pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 4869,&quot;Horchata 1 cup basmati rice 2 cups blanched almonds 2 cinnamon sticks 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 cup sugar Instructions: Combine the ground rice, blanched almonds, cinnamon and vanilla bean and seeds with 3 1/2 cups water and let sit overnight, covered, in the refrigerator.

Set aside. If making more than 2 hours ahead reserve in the refrigerator but let come to room temperature before serving. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the cherries, remaining 3/4 cup sugar, lemon zest and juice and a splash of water. Cook until the cherries have let off their juice and the flavor has concentrated, about 10 to 12 minutes. When done the cherries should be very sweet and the juice should be syrupy.<br> To assemble:<br> Schmear some of the mascarpone/chocolate mixture, about 1/4-inch thick, onto the lower half of a crepe. Fold the top half over the bottom to create a perfect half circle and press to secure. Fold the crepe in half again, to create a loose triangle. Repeat this process with remaining 7 crepes. To serve, arrange 2 triangles on each serving plate and spoon the stewed cherries over the tops.<br> Batter: In a mixing bowl, add the flour and salt and make a well in the center. Add the eggs, milk, club soda and 3 tablespoons of melted butter into the center of the well and whisk together until just combined. The mixture should be like VERY loose pancake batter. If the mixture is a little thick, whisk in a little more milk. Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes before using.<br> Crepes:<br> Melt about a 1/2 teaspoon of butter in a small nonstick saute pan. The butter should coat the bottom of the pan, if there is a lot of excess, wipe it out with a paper towel. Keep the paper towel handy in case you need it again (you will).<br> Put the pan over medium heat. Fill a 2-ounce ladle, almost to the top, with batter and pour it into the preheated pan, tipping and rolling the pan, as you ladle the batter, to evenly cover the bottom. This will take a little practice, even when you are an experienced crepe maker the first couple always get wasted. Accept it and move on.<br> When the edges of the crepe begin to pull away from the edges of the pan and the bottom begins to brown a little, turn the crepe over and cook it for about 1 minute on the other side. Remove the crepe from the pan to a plate and let cool. Stack the crepes as they are cooked between parchment paper squares. Repeat this process, until all the batter is used, wiping the pan with your paper towel or melting a little more butter to the pan, as needed.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4876,&quot;Peanut Butter Filled Chocolate Cupcake 10 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 6 ounces peanut butter<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 eggs<br> 2 1/4 cups cake flour 1/2 cup cocoa powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1/2 cup vegetable oil<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 3 eggs, separated<br> 1 1/3 cups whole milk<br> 4 cups (1 quart) heavy cream 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line cupcake pans with cupcake liners (for a total of 24 cupcakes). For the peanut butter filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and peanut butter until smooth and fluffy. Beat in the granulated sugar. Beat in the vanilla and eggs, scrape down the sides of the bowl and continue to mix until smooth. Set aside. For the chocolate cupcake batter: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, sift together the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream 1 cup of the granulated sugar with the oil. Slowly add the vanilla extract and egg yolks to the creamed sugar while mixing, and beat until incorporated.<br> In a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar until firm peaks form. Do not over-whip.<br> Turn the stand mixer on the lowest speed. Add the dry ingredients and milk, alternating between the two and scraping down the sides after each addition. Mix on medium for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the whipped egg whites into the chocolate batter in three parts.<br> Scoop one scoop of the chocolate cupcake batter into each cupcake liner. Top with one scoop of the peanut butter filling. The liners will be about two-thirds full. Bake until the cupcakes are nicely domed and the chocolate bounces back from gentle pressure, about 22 minutes; the peanut butter filling will not be firm. Remove from the pans and cool. For the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over-whip the cream. Ice the cooled cupcakes with the frosting using a pastry bag fitted with the desired tip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 4877,&quot;Curried Chervil Eggs 6 hard boiled eggs, cooled and peeled 1 teaspoon butter 2 teaspoons curry powder 1 teaspoon finely minced chives 2 teaspoons finely minced chervil leaves 1 teaspoon finely minced curly parsley leaves 2 tablespoons lowfat mayonnaise 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard Parsley, dill sprigs, violas or borage flowers, for garnish Instructions: Cut the eggs in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks and place in a bowl. Mash the yolks thoroughly with a fork. Heat the butter in a small skillet and add the curry powder, stirring frequently. Cook over low heat for several minutes until very fragrant. (Curry, like cumin, requires heat to release the full intensity of its flavor. In uncooked recipes like this one, the extra time to toast the curry powder makes an incredible difference in the final flavor.) Add the curry powder with the remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Using a spoon or a pastry bag, fill the egg whites with the mixture.

Add the capicola, red onion and minced garlic. Cook, stirring, until the onion softens, about 2 minutes. Add the carrots and celery. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add the beans, tomatoes, 2 cups water, the parmesan rind, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook until the vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the parmesan rind. Meanwhile, lightly toast the bread; rub both sides with the whole garlic clove and sprinkle with grated parmesan. Stir the escarole into the soup and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 5 minutes. Top each serving of soup with a piece of toast. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 4881,&quot;Fresh Coriander, Ginger, and cl Breads 2 cups semolina flour 1 cup plain yogurt 1 fresh red cl (seeds and veins discarded), finely chopped (or 1 jalapeno) 1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger 1 tablespoon curry leaves (if using dried, rehydrate by soaking before using) 2 tablespoons coriander leaves, roughly chopped 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 cups warm water Oil for griddle surface Instructions: You will need a medium-sized mixing bowl, a large castiron or other heavy griddle, a paper towel, a flat wooden spoon or rubber spatula, and a metal spatula. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the semolina, yogurt, cl, gingerroot, curry leaves, coriander leaves, and salt. Add the water a little at a time, stirring while you pour. When all the water has been added and the batter is smooth, cover the bowl and let the batter rest for approximately one hour. To cook the breads, heat a large castiron griddle over medium high heat. Lightly oil the surface of the griddle using a paper towel, and reserve the towel for use between each dosa. When the griddle is hot, pour on one-half cup of the batter. As you pour, move in a circle out from the middle, trying to distribute the batter in as large a circle as possible. Immediately after, use the flat back side of a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to move the batter to cover the gaps, trying again to increase the diameter of the dosa. Try to make a circle 9 to 10 inches in diameter. Over a medium high heat, the dosa will cook on its first side for one minute and a half. After it has been cooking for one minute, begin to loosen it from the griddle with a sharp-edged spatula. Coax the dosa, don&#39;t force it, as it will come off easily from the griddle when it is ready. When ready, flip to the other side. The second side will cook in one and a half to two minutes, depending on the thickness of the dosa and the heat of the griddle. You can check the dosa by simply lifting a corner with your spatula. It should have nicely browned spots, but not nearly as uniformly brown as the first side. When ready, remove to a plate. Before starting the second dosa, rub the surface of the griddle with the oily paper towel, or if it&#39;s particularly dry, add a little more oil. Continue cooking until all the dosas have been made (they can be stacked one on top of the other when they finish cooking), or serve immediately as they are made, flapjack-style. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 4882,&quot;Cauliflower \\Potato\\ Salad (Low-Carb Potato Salad) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound cauliflower florets (from about 1 small head cauliflower) 2 tablespoons sour cream 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 2 stalks celery, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the cauliflower florets and cook until the cauliflower is soft and releases easily when pierced with a knife, about 8 minutes. Drain in a colander and spread out on a baking sheet. Pat the cauliflower dry with a clean kitchen towel or a paper towel, then set aside and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

Trim and reserve the stalks for plating and for cooking the fish in the Mackerel recipe. If the outer layer of any of the bulbs is bruised or seems somewhat dried out, remove and discard a layer. Cut the bulbs in half, lengthwise, and put them on a flat surface. Cut each half into 3 equal pieces so they look somewhat like sections of an orange wedge.<br> Heat a large pan and add the olive oil. When the oil slightly hot, remove the pan from the heat. Arrange the fennel in a single layer in the bottom of the pan and season with the salt, and red pepper flakes. Return the pan to the heat and cook, undisturbed, until the fennel turns light brown on the first side, 3 to 5 minutes. Use a spatula or tongs to turn the fennel on its other side. When it browns on the second side, remove the pan from the heat and add the white wine. Season with salt, to taste, and return the pan to the heat. Cook over a low flame until all of the wine has reduced. How will you know? You will hear the sizzle of the fennel in the oil when the wine dries up. Insert a knife into a few of the fennel pieces. They should be tender and yielding. If not, add 1/2 cup of the water. Cook until the water evaporates. If necessary, add up to another cup (or maybe more if the fennel bulbs were unusually large), in small increments, to cook the fennel until it is tender. Taste a tiny piece for seasoning. Ideally, there should be very little liquid remaining at the end of the process. Remove the fennel from the pan and set aside to cool to room temperature.<br> Use a mortar and pestle to grind the walnuts. Alternatively, chop them with a large knife. In a small bowl whisk together the walnuts with the lemon juice, a pinch of sea salt, the hazelnut oil and the orange liqueur. Taste for seasoning.

Make the potatoes: Put the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water, then drain and place the potatoes in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Combine the sour cream and egg, then add to the potatoes; season with a pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Whip, adding 1/4 cup of the reserved cooking water at a time, until smooth and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Fold in all but 1 tablespoon of the scallions and set aside. Make the filling: Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery, onion and beef substitute and saute until tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the top and saute to cook off the flour flavor, about 1 minute. Whisk in the beer and stock until combined. Stir in the corn, edamame, steak sauce, garlic powder and red pepper flakes until combined. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook to reduce the liquid by one-third, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Fill six 4-inch cast-iron skillets (or ramekins) halfway with the filling. Divide the mashed potatoes among the pans. Place the skillets on a baking sheet and bake until the mashed potatoes start to brown and the sauce is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.

Line a broiler pan with foil. Halve the peppers through the stem, and remove the seeds and stems. Lay the peppers, cut side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Broil the peppers, moving as needed, so the skins char evenly, about 8 minutes. Put the peppers in a large bowl, cover, and set aside until just cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. (Don&#39;t leave them for too long, or the peppers will get muddy-looking from the charred skins.) Rub the skins off the peppers with your fingers and lightly rinse with cool water, if necessary, to remove any remaining charred skin. Dice the peppers. Toast the coriander in a dry skillet, and then coarsely crack. Toss the peppers in a bowl along with the olive oil, vinegar, garlic, coriander, thyme and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside for at least 1 hour to let the flavors come together. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the pork: Combine the ginger and 2 teaspoons of the olive oil to make paste. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with the rest of the olive oil. Season pork with salt and pepper, and sear the meat on all sides until golden brown, about 2 minutes.

When the oil just starts to smoke, add the eggplant in 1 layer and cook just until golden brown on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. You might need to do this in batches. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Blot the top with additional paper towels. In the same pan, add more olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil just starts to smoke, add the zucchini in 1 layer and saute until just browned on each side, about 1 minute per side. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. In a shallow roasting pan or baking dish, spread half of the tomato sauce evenly over the bottom. Begin layering the eggplant and zucchini along the outside of the baking dish so they are overlapping slightly. Continue until the pan is full and the eggplant and zucchini is used. Cover the top with the remaining tomato sauce, spreading evenly. Sprinkle the mozzarella and Parmesan evenly over the top, covering completely. Place the baking dish inside a large baking dish. Pour hot water into the larger baking dish about half way up the sides to make a water bath. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly.

Keep in an airtight container. For Jackie&#39;s sausage: Combine pork, breadcrumbs, syrup, salt, ginger, sage and pepper together in a bowl and knead for 3 minutes. For the sausage gravy: Brown 250 grams (8.8 ounces) Jackie&#39;s sausage in a skillet (save remainder for another use), then set aside. Place stock and milk in a small saucepan and bring up to a simmer. Add pork fat to a skillet over medium heat, along with onions, garlic and thyme and cook until onions go translucent. Add flour to fat along with salt and pepper and stir well to combine, then cook for 2 minutes. (Do not leave it alone or it will burn.) Add hot stock and whisk well until mixture comes to a simmer and thickens. (If too thick, add a bit more milk.) Add cooked sausage and adjust seasoning. For the wake &#39;n&#39; bake chicken: Sprinkle dry rub evenly on chicken. Rub gently. Cover chicken with wet marinade and refrigerate for 1 hour. Place 2 cups wake &#39;n&#39; bake crust in a medium paper bag. Take one piece of chicken at a time out of the marinade, letting excess marinade drip off, and shake well in the bag to coat chicken. Place on a sheet pan lined with parchment and let rest for at least another 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Drizzle a small amount of oil over the chicken. Bake 6 to 7 minutes, then flip and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of a breast registers 160 degrees F, another 6 to 7 minutes. Top with sausage gravy and serve. I like to sprinkle a few cornflakes on top and a small amount of fresh parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 4928,&quot;Chocolate Sheet Cake 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs 2 sticks butter 4 heaping tablespoons cocoa powder 1 3/4 sticks butter 4 heaping tablespoons cocoa powder 6 tablespoons milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 pound powdered sugar 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans, optional Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Stir together and set aside. In another bowl, mix the buttermilk, baking soda, vanilla and eggs. Mix with a fork and set aside. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter and add the cocoa. Whisk together to combine. Meanwhile, bring 1 cup water to a boil. When the butter is melted, pour the boiling water in the pan. Allow to bubble for a moment, then turn off the heat. Pour the chocolate mixture into the flour mixture. Stir together for a moment to cool the chocolate, then pour in the egg mixture. Stir together until smooth, then pour into an ungreased jelly roll pan (or rimmed baking sheet) and bake for 20 minutes. While the cake is baking, make the icing: Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the cocoa powder and stir until smooth. Add the milk, vanilla and powdered sugar. Stir together. Dump in the pecans and stir until well combined. Immediately after removing the cake from the oven, pour the warm icing over the top. You&#39;ll want to avoid doing much spreading, so try to distribute it evenly as you pour. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 4929,&quot;Boston Brown Bread 1/2 cup rye flour 1/2 cup stone-ground cornmeal 1/4 cup whole wheat flour 1/4 cup white bread flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 cup dark molasses 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 large egg, beaten<br> Instructions: Place a rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 300 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the rye flour, cornmeal, whole wheat flour, white bread flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In a medium bowl, whisk together the molasses, buttermilk, and egg. Pour the molasses mixture into the flour mixture and mix until a thick batter is just formed. Transfer the batter to the prepared coffee can. Cover tightly with the foil, buttered-side down. Place the coffee can in a pot that is twice the height of the can. Pour enough hot water in the pot to reach halfway up the sides of the can. Bring the water to a boil on top of the stove, before transferring to the oven. Bake the bread, in the water bath, until spongy and a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 3 hours. Remove can from the water bath and set aside to cool completely.

Arrange the waffle wedges standing up in rows, alternating every other piece so the curved side faces the opposite direction to create an organized but random top with curved peaks. In a blender, add the chocolate milk, peanut butter, brown sugar and bananas. Add a pinch of salt and blend to taste; it should not be salty, just taste like a hint of salt. Add the egg and blend until smooth. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Slowly pour the custard over the prepared dish of waffle wedges and let rest 10 to 15 minutes to allow it to soak into the waffles. The waffles will crest above the custard line; gently press down to encourage absorption. Bake until the tops are golden and the custard feels set, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove and sprinkle the marshmallows, chips and bacon over the top. Put back in the oven and bake until the chocolate is shiny and the marshmallows soften, 5 to 10 minutes more. Serve with warm maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 4931,&quot;Salmon Medallions 4 (3/4-inch thick) salmon steaks, boned and securely tied with butcher&#39;s string Alder planks (green or soaked in water for 24 hours) 1 bunch fresh baby dill 8 ounces cream cheese 1 lemon, zested and cut into wedges I pinch paprika Salt Fresh cracked black pepper Fresh herbs, for garnish Instructions: Preheat grill to high.
