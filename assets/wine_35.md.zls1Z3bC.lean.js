Best in a trattoria setting.","designation":""},{"country":"nz","description":"Lifted floral aromas include a hint of white pepper and green apples.

The '98 version of Colvecchio, an offering from a hot year, is leaner than might be expected and short on dimension.

It's hardly the deepest, most complex wine you'll find, but not all good wines have to be complicated.","designation":"Le Cris"},{"country":"it","description":"This is a new kitchen-sink offering from Banfi, featuring Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah. It goes full bore on the red fruit and oak, with spicy berry aromas and cherry flavors. The tannins are pretty hard, and with ample acids, this young wine currently starches the cheeks. But in three years it should become a good to very good table wine.","designation":"Cum Laude"},{"country":"it","description":"This Sangiovese has a lot going for it: a sweet maple-tinged aroma, a pretty ruby color, round but snappy plum and raspberry flavors, and a long, layered finish.

Green apple, pineapple and some orange rind define the flavors, while the weight of the wine seems heavy due to lower than ideal acidity. Then again, such weight might be welcomed by the Chardonnay-drinking crowd.","designation":""},{"country":"nz","description":"A big style that manages to avoid tasting rustic or heavy.

Applesauce and lemon meringue pie aromas lead the way toward a palate full of lemon, pineapple, tangerine and vanilla. The finish is stony and leaves a custard-like impression.

For others, however, it will feel overoaked and ponderous on the tongue.","designation":"Redwood Ranch"},{"country":"US","description":"A touch of the veggies, particularly asparagus and bell pepper, mix with citrus in this fuller-bodied white. While it isn't exactly a heavyweight, the ample body is weighed down by lower than average acidity.

If given time, this wine will certainly open up more than it does currently.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"au","description":"The bouquet starts off snappy and clean, but with time some pungent sea foam and green-bean aromas arise.

Beyond the wood, however, are notes of root beer and smoked meat. The palate has some hard tannins and the oak is once again strong; it literally takes on a buttery flavor. The finish is the best part: It's all about thick black fruit.","designation":"Modus"},{"country":"US","description":"Very grassy and citrusy, with hints of garden-fresh vegetables and a slight floral note. It's light and almost airy on the tongue, finishing crisp and clean. A refreshing burst of anise caps things off.","designation":"SLD"},{"country":"nz","description":"A classic NZ Riesling that's all about fruit: apples, pears and limes on the nose, with more of the same in the mouth.

There's ample black fruit to the palate and a full blast of espresso on the smooth finish. It's young now, but already it's opening up. Maybe the funky aromatics will subside with additional bottle age.","designation":"Dulcamara"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a quaffable (about 10% alcohol), off, dry white wine, with intense, clean, lovely floral flavors. Citrus and citrus blossom mingle, making it almost like a still version of Prosecco. There is a surprisingly long finish with spicy floral flavors, intense and flavorful.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"About 15,000 cases were made of this simple, stainless-fermented, very clean and fruity wine.

It's a little tight now, and will be better in a year or two.","designation":""},{"country":"nz","description":"Aromas of toast, apricot, mint, honey and field dust make for a complex bouquet. The honeyed palate yields a trace of green herbs along with lemon rind and white pepper. Obviously there's a lot going on here, and for some it may be too  out there.  For others it will be a spot-on Kiwi offering with lots of individuality and character.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This big-bodied wine is full of smoke, toast and custard in the nose, sure signs of barrel fermentation or aging. The mouth is packed with thick, custardy citrus fruit, which renders it a bit like orange-tinged flan. Fortunately, it retains its acids, which keeps it well balanced despite the heavy oaking it went through.","designation":""},{"country":"nz","description":"In time, this may surpass the regular bottling, but for now it trails by a nose, thanks to some mushroom, bracken and lima bean scents that dampen the cola and beet flavors. As always, it's big, rich and full-bodied.

Lemon and mineral qualities are strong on the nose and in the mouth, while driving acids create a mouth-watering feel.

Far better than pedestrian, this is a sturdy, well-made Tuscan red.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Jacopo Biondi Santi's Maremma estate is open-knit and sweet.

The tangy lemon finish has a chalky grip to it, which only adds to the overall complexity of this unique Napa white.","designation":"Unfiltered"},{"country":"it","description":"As an expression of pure power, this wine is hard to beat. It has the classic Brunello color red with edges of brick. The aromas are of bitter coffee, herbs and mature, ripe fruit. On the palate, the concentration is enormous, the tannins pack a serious punch and the supermature fruit is black and bright. All this gives it a one-dimensional, if impressive quality.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"In contrast to many of the other wines, this one starts off tight, with only faint lime and mineral notes on the nose.

The only noticeable fault here is a candied sweetness at the tail end","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"This is a complex bruiser that will appeal to those willing to give it at least three years in the cellar; it's that tight and young now. Oak is a big player on the nose and in the mouth, and the acids are very alive, so as a result some might find it aggressive (all the more reason to lay it down until 2006). There is plenty of earth and minerals throughout, and it's tight as nails on the finish.","designation":"Asinone"},{"country":"US","description":"From the get-go it's a big, full grapefruit-driven wine that's laced with smoke and vanilla. Citrus, mostly lemon, is the taste profile, while good lively acids power the tight, lemony finish.

Unfortunately there will be no Stefani in 2000, but the Chiotti is very good.

It closes out firm, round and full, and with elegance.","designation":"Les Caillottes"},{"country":"it","description":"Fans of full-bodied reds should like this Cabernet/Merlot blend for its pure berry and mint aromas, its ruby luster, and dry, clean raspberry and chocolate flavors.

Its SB mixes healthy doses of green pepper and snap peas with requisite citrus characteristics, and then underneath the surface there are notes of peach, melon and cream.

But in due time things will settle and integrate","designation":"Ghiaie Della Furba"},{"country":"nz","description":"The undesignated Pinot from Felton Road is normally a pretty approachable bottling, but in 2000, it's a big, brooding wine that needs time to unwind.

Initial earth, black plum, tomato and smoke aromas air out nicely with a bit of time, exposing a complex connoisseur's wine that is the perfect candidate for three to five years in the cellar.

Merli is the plural of  blackbirds,  and this wine is 100% Merlot. But it isn't for the birds. Black as night in the glass, with a brooding power that's confirmed on the palate.

The forward fruit is appealing, but the wine falls off in the middle and finishes quickly.","designation":"La Cave Rouge"},{"country":"US","description":"From this well-known Carneros vineyard comes this lighter lemon-lime SB with mixed citrus flavors and intense acidity. It's a medium-weight wine with a rather short pineapple finish. It has some creaminess to the mouthfeel, but overall it just doesn't ring the right bells to rate higher. Made by Mia Klein of Etude fame.","designation":"Hyde Vineyards"},{"country":"US","description":"Very different from this winery's Temperance bottling. Starts with sour cherry aromas along with sumptuous smoke, vanilla and spice notes. Drinks very soft and gentle, with melted tannins framing generous cherry-berry fruit. This is a supple, easy-drinking wine for early consumption.","designation":"Croft-Bailey"},{"country":"US","description":"If one word could sum up this wine it would be  safe.  It's a Sauvignon Blanc that tastes like Sauvignon Blanc, but avoids any aggressive vegetal notes. Gooseberry and pink grapefruit aromas and flavors, with a slight creaminess to the texture, make it easy to drink.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Very tart, with a deep, tannic, earthy mineral streak. There's an iron/earth streak running through all Abacela wines; here it comes across as iron and slightly bitter licorice. This is still very young and green; the score might well improve with more time in the bottle.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"There's a hint of saline or wet dog in the nose, and that keeps the wine from really taking off from the runway. Beyond that, citrus mixes with creamy notes to make up the mouth, and then it ends in a lemony, lush way. It's not a very complex wine, but it has enough zip to keep it going.","designation":"Single Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Hailing from an emerging region northeast of Napa Valley, this SB is heavily oaked, and thus features big batches of butter and toast. Yellow apples and cantaloupe flavors are barely detectable under the veneer of thick oak. It's surely full-bodied, bordering on over the top. But it has positive qualities, including a rich and pleasant mouthfeel.","designation":"Dorn Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Any SB boasting 14.5% alcohol is going to come across as being real big, and this one does for sure. But beyond its heft, it offers underripe melon, pear and butter flavors and an odd cheesy quality. There's also a forest's worth of oak here, which makes it heavy rather than balanced.","designation":"Fum  II The Deuce"},{"country":"US","description":"This is assembled from ten different vineyards, and is the winery's flagship wine. It's a blend of 44% Cabernet Franc, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 9% Malbec. This wine has a good focus to the mid-palate, a decent amount of sweet cassis fruit, and a soft and lingering, though tannic, finish.","designation":"Quartet Red Wine"},{"country":"fr","description":"Honey, orange blossom and a little mustard make up the nose of this classic Loire Valley SB. Tangerine and bitter greens play a duet on the palate, and the finish is more or less a reduced version of those primary flavors.

Hearty buttery aromas give way to some mineral and banana notes underneath; toasty apple flavors in a rich, full mouthfeel are thankfully devoid of cloying creaminess. Oak is good, but still overshadows the fruit.","designation":"Visiterra"},{"country":"nz","description":"The bouquet here is confounding. It has some green vegetable and cat-pee qualities as well as white stone fruits, sulfur and popcorn. In a word, it's complicated. In the mouth, grapefrut and celery flavors mingle with green grapes, while on the back end it's chalky and rather tart. The overall acidity is high, and there's one important thing missing here: balance.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Wipe away all Pinot preconceptions based on Burgundy, Oregon or elsewhere. This is the Tuscan version, and it has its own character, which is ripe, forward, hot and spicy, and overall much closer in style to the native Sangiovese than to typical Pinot. Racy acids pump loads of cranberry fruit, backed by a forest of spice-laden vanilla oak.","designation":"Marchesi Pancrazi"},{"country":"it","description":"Here's a country-style, rustic blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Cabernet from the Maremma, and it fits the bill perfectly as an everyday red with some character. It's dry, full of cherry and plum fruit, and it finishes warm. Nothing too complex, but plenty to sink your teeth into.","designation":"Aulo"},{"country":"US","description":"Wheat grass and hot peppers make for an intriguing if odd bouquet. A fair amount of vegetal flavor carries onto the palate mostly green beans and some pickle. Fortunately, there is also a light tropical fruit background to the flavor profile, something reminiscent of papaya.

There is a boatload of asparagus and green pepper to the nose, and in the mouth the fruit element, meaning papaya and mild citrus, gets gobbled up by a potent blast of green flavors.

Not likely to improve with age, so drink up with big, rich foods.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Earthy, with dusty tannins, there's some pretty blackberry fruit.  But it's a light wine that turns thin in the middle palate.  Not a keeper, but it's polished for near term consumption.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Mature, with anise and bark-like aromas.  Medium to full-bodied, it has a melange of subdued fruit flavors and modest effervescence.  The citrus- and peach- tinged finish is medium length.","designation":"Reserve Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"Just the faintest rosy tinge shows in the glass of this round appley sparkler.  There's a definite Golden Delicious quality to the aromas and flavors, with an earthy edge providing interest and complexity.

Tartly elegant, this is a crisp wine that's a little rough, yet flatters with it's clean, yeasty finish.","designation":"Brut Rose"},{"country":"US","description":"From a reliable producer, an adequate Cab and a relative success for the vintage.  Oak contribute flashy spice, vanilla and sweet tannins, and it's surprisingly ripe and fruity given the 43,000 case production.  This is a nice, dry wine that satisfies and offers some complexity.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Rich and textured, this wine brims with peach, tropical fruit and smoky oak aromas, and drinks fruity and crisp.  In fact, the acidity gives it a burn in the middle palate and finish, pushed along by leesy notes.  This structured wine demands food.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Round, silky and polished, this clean wine is streamline and almost austere in terms of fruit.  Beyond the crisp acids and dusty tannins, the main influence is lees, although some figgy, peach flavors develop in the finish.

Sweet oak accents, blackberry, currant, vanilla and smoky notes.  The flavors suggest blackberry liqueur, and there's noticeable sugar.  Velvety smooth tannins and soft acidity complete this wine.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"One of the more austere examples of the vintage, this is a terrifically lemony wine, dry as dust, with high acidity that makes it tart and just this side of sour.  It's a very clean wine, one that scours the palate and prepares the taste buds for food: Goat cheese comes immediately to mind.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Dominated by oak, with cedar, vanilla, clove, smoke and mint aromas and flavors, this wine does the best it can with rather sharpley flavored grapes.  It's pretty acidic, tart and tannic, so the question is whether or not it's got the fruit to age.  Probably not.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"From Napa Valley's heart, this Cab shows blackberry, cassis and new oak aromas, good Cabernet flavors, and the very best barrels make it classy.

Full, yet soft on the palate, with plenty of cherry and vanilla flavor, it's an interesting step off the well-beaten path of mainstream sparklers. The dry cherry and mineral finish shows good length, but this is a somewhat acquired taste.","designation":"Rouge"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells luscious, with tangerine cream, camomile, orange popsickle, smoke, vanilla custard, lees and spicy aromatics.  This round, full, fruity wine is very clean and refreshing, with finely etched fruit and a smooth, lemony finish.","designation":"Bien Nacido Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Size defines this well-oaked full-bodied wine, which starts with creamy, leesy aromas and turns richly oaky and fruity in the mouth.

In the mouth, it's deeply flavored, with a solid core of plum and blackberry fruit.  Fairly substantial tannins make the palate scoury now, and the finish is tannic, too.  Try it with barbecue or a rich lasagna.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"DSM delivers the most reliable, attractive and downright cheap bubbly in the Northwest, and this is their best bottle.

The scoury finish is clean and refreshing.","designation":"Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"Tight, lemony and leesy, this wine strides off in it's own direction, away from pronounced oak superripe fruit, more in the direction of mineral and stone.  It's austere, sleek and steely, softened by lees creaminess, but angular.  Call it Chablisian.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This is straightforward and likeable; dry, but with plenty of fruit.

It's dry and rich, with a long delicious finish.","designation":"Toni Stockhausen Signature Series"},{"country":"US","description":"Could fool you as a Pauillac, with pencil lead and cassis aromas that suggest the best French oak.  It's elegantly dry and perfectly structured, with a lacy, intricate feeling in the mouth.  It is, however a victim of it's vintage, suffering a paucity of fruity concentration, which makes it a delicate wine for early consumption.","designation":"Signature"},{"country":"US","description":"Made with the best intentions, but this wine can't get beyond it's vintage.  The fruit is light and earthy,  and not even lovely oak can change that.  Nonetheless, it's a dry, elegant wine filled with harmony and chewey tannins.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Dry and tannic, with good grip on the palate, this austere wine screams for olive oil, butter, gorgonzola cheese or beef.  The red berry flavors are not particularly ripe, but there is sweetness hidden deep down in the core.  The wine needs food to wake it up.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This is certainly one of the oldest domestic sparkling wines still in current release.  As expected. it is very dry and somewhat oxidized with woody, Sherry- cask scents and flavors.

There were 1,011 six-bottle cases produced.","designation":"Extended Tirage Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine open with aromas of anise, green apples and white peaches, plus plenty of leesy and oaky notes, including vanilla, smoke and buttered toast.

The finish picks up the tannic theme again.","designation":"Artist Collection"},{"country":"US","description":"Very forward in the nose, with spicy rasberry and lime aromas accompanied with yeasty, baked-bread notes.

Dry and robust, it's a bit rough on the peppery finish.","designation":"Wedding Cuvee"},{"country":"US","description":"This flavorful sparkler comes from one of upstate New York's most respected producers.  Pear, floral and mild spice aromas open on to herbs and flowers on the palate.  The bead is steady, though not terribly fine, and the finish long, with bread and lemon-lime notes. Good for dining as well as toasting.","designation":"Blanc de Noirs"},{"country":"US","description":"Redolent of strawberries and raspberries, this slightly sweet, very fruity sparkler is made of Freisa, a little-known Piedmontese grape. From veteran envelope-pusher Randall Grahm, it's overtly juicy so much so you'd swear it was infused with berries but downright delicious. The soft mouthfeel makes it eminently drinkable. Believe the label, which warns of the potential for uninhibited behavior after drinking.","designation":"Freisa (Frizzante)"},{"country":"US","description":"Vanilla and butterscotch aromas call forth in this surprisingly bright-textured Chardonnay.  Zingy lemon notes leave a searingly clean finish, marked by hints of minerals and herbs.","designation":"Island Block Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Starts with smoky, black cherry aromas and a hint of stewed tomato and tobacco. Drinks soft, gentle and complex. There's a chewy meatiness to the flavors and textures that's appealing. It finishes nicely: dry, elegant and clean.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"US","description":"A controversial wine among our panelists, with some praising its  elegant and complex aromas of baked bread  while others called it  woody  and  dull.  There are citrus, apple and toast flavors and a clean finish. Your best bet is to try a bottle for yourself.","designation":"Reserve Le Premier"},{"country":"US","description":"Chocolate, cedar, plum and black cherries come to mind in this firm-textured wine.  Powdery tannins are slightly drying on the palate, though the wine shows good structure in general.  The finish is moderate, hinting at sage and blackberry.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Aromas of wildflowers, especially honeysuckle and jasmine, ride next to sweet butter, peach, smoke and spice.

On the dry side, but round, mellow and fat.","designation":"Creek Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark cherry fruit and herb flavors with chocolate/cocoa accents mark this mid-weight red. Not as deep or rich as the 1997 and somewhat backward, it has good Merlot character but can use a year or two to smooth and perhaps flesh out a bit. Finishes dry with even tannins and decent length.","designation":""},{"country":"es","description":"Looking for a mature reserva at a reasonable price? This one boasts aromas of damp soil, cedar, clove and wood, followed by rich flavors of sweet cherries and sauna cedar.

There's some glyceriney sweetness in the finish of this pretty, expressive wine.","designation":"Ripkin Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine recalls the glory days of a decade ago, when there were dozens of delicious California Chardonnays available for under $8.  Today this sort of forward, fruity, ripe, round wine is more likely to cost you twice that.  Yet here is a creamy, cleanly made wine, showing plump, fresh fruit flavors and a lingering finish.  Just 1.9 million cases made.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"The High Eden's jammy blackberry and vanilla flavors are at the same time tart and sweet; its equally fruity grape and blackberry aromas, though, are complicated a bit by caramel and leather undertones. it's a \\"jamfest\\" and a \\"fleshpot\\" that may not have much depth, but has plenty of drink-me-now appeal.","designation":"High-Eden"},{"country":"US","description":"Deep raspberry and cherry fruit buttressed by creamy vanillin oak and an earthy, animal element opens this dark, tangy wine. More of the same follows in the mouth where licorice, cocoa and espresso accents add interest. Rich and burly, it closes with full but supple tannins.","designation":"Grand Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Stylish and decidedly dry, this medium-weight wine shows a gentle pear-vanilla-chamomile nose. Mineral notes and a spicy tang accent the mild pear fruit. Evenly textured, but not at all bland, the mineral and spice elements carry through the clean finish.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Continues the CDB tradition of ripe, full-flavored Chards at a good price. Flavors of pear, apple, vanilla, smoke and dusty spices cascade off the palate, in a richly textured wine that's oaky-sweet.

This tangy and refreshing wine would be a great match for briny oysters or other seafood.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Medium-weight and brisk, this Sonoma wine has a blackberry, herb and cocoa profile, accented by ginger-snap and cedar notes. Bitter chocolate and black coffee play on the slightly short, tart and tangy, mildly tannic finish. Has appeal, even a bit of depth, but not a great deal of nuance.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"American oak seems overly aggressive on the nose, with dominating aromas of clove and vanilla-tinged wood sap. Once you get past the bouquet, the wine is limpid, silky smooth, and utterly dry, with berry flavors.","designation":"Alegr a Vineyards"},{"country":"US","description":"Toasty oak and bright citrus flavors form the core of this snappy wine.  Clean and fresh on the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"es","description":"Starts well, with mouthwatering aromas of smoke, cedar, cured meat, tobacco and bright cherries. Simpler on the palate and a bit hollow, with cherry and cedar dominating, before perking up again on the finish, with notes of cigar tobacco and smoke.","designation":"Cosecha"},{"country":"es","description":"Unlike many crianzas, this one's oak is understated on the nose instead, you get lots of delicate cherry aromas. That all changes in the mouth, with a healthy whack of vanilla. Spicy, creamy-oak finish.","designation":"Crianza"},{"country":"US","description":"Smells like sweetened lemonade, a combination of honey and citrus fruits with a sprinkling of cinnamon and vanilla. Tastes like lemonade, too the unsweetened variety with refreshing acidity. The finish is clean and zesty. An ap ritif-type wine.","designation":""},{"country":"ar","description":"Though almost fading, with a brick edge in the glass, there is still style in this wine's pruney fruit, tobacco-leather accents, and earthy shadings. Thin but smooth-bodied, the fig and wood elements will appeal to lovers of mature wines, but fans of youthful fruit should take a pass here. Drink now.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Ripely fruity and polished, the apple and peach flavors stand out in the mouth, framed by adequate acidity. The finish is clean and peppery. This is a light, supple wine; it's very easy to drink. Seems best suited for fresh fruits, with a nice grilled trout, or all by itself.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Juicy peach and spicy lime fruit is joined by herbal notes and a whiff of lees in this dry, fairly tart wine. A burn of acidity piques the middle palate, and then the citrus flavors kick in on the crisp, clean finish.","designation":"Coastal Selection"},{"country":"fr","description":"Eye-opening lemon, green herb and mineral aromas lead into a palate that's sweetened by nectarine, and powdered sugar flavors don't worry, there's enough citrus in the mouth to keep the sweetness in check. Angular and somewhat steely in the mouth, it ends on a similarly metallic note. It's dry-what you'd expect from Bordeaux-and should be consumed with food. I had it with (and, well,   in) cheese fondue, but it would be just as good with fish or pasta.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"This straightforward Cotes-du-Rhone, about 70% Grenache, offers ripe, even roasted, fruit aromas, earth and leather accents.

Closes with modest length and dusty cocoa notes.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"From Lodi grapes, here's a rich, fruity, powerfully spicy wine, with aromas of fruit cocktail, butter cream and honey.

This is a candy of a wine, fruity and tart and frankly delicious.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Pinot Gris has really caught on with consumers, because it can be delicious with so many different foods, but particularly with Pacific Northwest halibut and salmon. This is a well-crafted, straightforward version, with the characteristic pear fruit and a certain  graininess  in the mouth. The price seems a little ambitious, given the competition.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"It's lean, and some say it's a bit green. Leather, tobacco and an herb-menthol note open onto a mouthful of tart cranberry, oak and fresh vegetal flavors. Finishes with bitter espresso flavors.","designation":"Spartacus Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"The herbal and briny notes in this wine divided our panel, with some tasters relishing its near-vegetal complexities layered over syrupy blackberry fruit, while others condemned it for the same. Try it yourself.","designation":"Peacock Blue Ltd.

If you like Moscato d'Asti, (minus the bubbles) try this.","designation":"Tardio"},{"country":"US","description":"Nice aromas here, of wild berries, smoke and earth, and strong, ripe berry, fruit and spice flavors. But it's very light in body and substance, almost airy. I longed for some tannins, some flesh.","designation":"Old Vine"},{"country":"fr","description":"If this Syrah could sing, its song would probably be \\"It Isn't Easy Being Green.\\" (We'd probably want it to add a verse about loads of black pepper, through and through, too.)

It's tart, lean and needs time but, as one reviewer noted, it will probably \\"always be hard.\\" Finishes long, with dry tannins.","designation":"R serv "},{"country":"US","description":"Sprightly, with floral, grapefruit flavors and a rich honeyed streak that makes it just off-dry. Very clean, refreshing and zesty.

Sweet caramel, cherries and beets are counterbalanced by lemony acidity and an herbal edge that's strikingly similar to green tea.  Finishes with cinnamon and chocolate notes, buoyed by bright cranberries.","designation":"Coastal"},{"country":"US","description":"Lean, with a dried fruit and cedar-sandalwood-pine profile offset by earthy accents. A mineral note adds interest to the dark cherry fruit. More weight could move it up to the next level of quality, but it has appeal as a lighter, almost Burgundian-style Syrah.","designation":"Estate Grown"},{"country":"US","description":"Grape, blueberry and blackberry aromas, wrapped in a creamy-butter coating, waft from the bouquet. The palate shows less fruity flavors--instead, it's chock-full of charcoal, smoke and wood flavors, with some dark berry fruit buried underneath.

It's a solid delivery at an affordable price.","designation":"Five Rivers Ranch"},{"country":"US","description":"Smoky, slightly herbaceous notes over raspberry and cherry fruit give this California wine a decidedly Rh?nish cast. The mouthfeel is lean and structured, the tart flavors are strawberry and rhubarb. Finishes with drying tannins. A hard, angular wine that needs time to come around.","designation":"Roasted Slope Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"After a few minutes in the glass, the wine's citrusy-pineapple aromas take on a grassy dimension. Green-apple and banana flavors brighten an even, creamy mouthfeel. Finishes a little chewy, with mango flavor and a slight metallic tanginess on the very end. An easy quaff.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Pinot Blanc grows well in Oregon, but it doesn't often translate in the bottle into a distinctive style that one could call its own.

It's fat, and closes long with dense fruit and black pepper accents. It's also over the top overripe, highly extracted, densely wooded; if you love that style, you'll enjoy this much more than our tasters did. This has potential as a Port, though, consumed at the end of a meal with cheeses and nuts.","designation":"The Lisa"},{"country":"US","description":"Aggressive stuff here, not for the faint-hearted.

It all made for a lot of confusion, but Oregonian Melon is an interesting wine, which has a lot of fat tropical fruit when it's young, and can be quite appealing. The wine does not age; in fact, it falls apart. So drink it young, when the ripe fruit suggests mangoes and papayas and swaying palms.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"There is a solid, firm, substantive feel to this wine, and it shows nice black cherry fruit, with an underpinning of tar, leather and licorice.

The bouquet of apple cider, anise, and fragrant jasmine-like notes opens to a trim palate of green apple and toast flavors, and a taut mouthfeel. Tart apple and oak, plus a flinty, mineral element play on the finish. Notoriously tight when young, this wine often opens incredibly with cellaring.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Some very appealing apple, asian pear, mint, smoke and toast notes mark the nose of this even, medium-weight wine.

The straight-ahead flavor profile is appealing, with solid apple, clove and butterscotch offset by the attractive anise streak.

Pineapple, banana and caramel flavors are cloaked in sweetness that may be a bit heavy for some.","designation":"Goodchild Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Lavishly oaked from the first whiff on the nose and palate, dense toasty notes envelope the pineapple and tropical fruit. Plenty of vanilla and both a tangy nuttiness and a creaminess from the oak, provide a nice mouthfeel tension.

Strange, but true we can't make this stuff up.","designation":"Reserve Lucas Select"},{"country":"US","description":"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet.

Richly viscous in the mouth, much like a good Alsatian vendages tardives.","designation":"Reka"},{"country":"nz","description":"The blend of this proprietary wine can vary from year to year, but in 1999 it's all Chardonnay.

They didn't go for enough extract to choke a horse, so the wine is light and airy on the palate, but by no means simple. There's plenty of currant and blackberry fruit and oak.

The cherry, tart-berry and chocolate aromas pick up vibrant licorice accents as they blossom into full flavors on the palate.

Anticipated maturity: 2003-2015.","designation":"EV"},{"country":"nz","description":"Smokier and toastier than Kumeu's regular Chardonnay, the fruit is also dialed up, with ripe pears, peaches and even orange blossoms. The long, citrusy finish leaves you searching for another pour. Should be long-lived as well.","designation":"Mate's Vineyard"},{"country":"nz","description":"Intense dried-apricot aromas and flavors indicate a high degree of botrytis, which would be overwhelming except for the trademark nz acidity.

It has a low price going for it, but most wine enthusiasts won't find much to like here.","designation":"Extra Dry"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a sweet, simple sparkling wine made from 60% Chenin Blanc and 40% Chardonnay. It has a lemon/citrus nose, with some soapy scents that carry through in the flavor. The big bubbles and sugary mouthfeel suggest that it was made by the charmat process; in any event, it's a bubbly best suited for mixing with orange juice or something tart like cranberry juice, and served as a Sunday morning spirit-lifter.","designation":"Spumante"},{"country":"fr","description":"Big, fat rather clumsy wine, heavy and brash. The wine lacks structure and goes for broad strokes.

This lightweight Merlot has some simple, tomato-flavored fruit, watery acids and a quick finish. It's clean and correct, but rather dull.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"You get mostly cedar and charred oak at first, with hints of cherries and mocha. This is one affordable Merlot that doesn't lack for structure it's just that the structure seems largely wood-derived, leaving insufficient fruit flesh to fill in the gaps.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The candied aromas here smell like fruity Jello, with a dusting of cocoa.

There is little fruit on the nose, and mouth-searing tannins that just don't let up dominate the palate and finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Though labeled Champagne, it is in fact a sparkling wine made in the Champagne method (fermented in the bottle).

It's light and a bit lean but flavorful, and the price is right.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"au","description":"Apple, pear and oak aromas and flavors prevail in this simple but not unattractive blend from several regions. Good acidity and a round mouthfeel help it along. Good for poolside or hors d'oeuvres.","designation":"Nottage Hill"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a wine that just cannot overcome the limitations of the vintage. They tried for extract and gave it some pretty oak but nonetheless herbal, bell pepper characteristics overshadow its modest berry fruit.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"This light- to medium-weight wine features a bouquet of berry and earth aromas and mature Cabernet flavors.

Good, but a lighter hand letting the fruit shine more would be even better.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A heavy cloak of oak can't hide the high alcohol level (15%). Sure, the alcohol provides weight and texture, but also heat on the finish.

Beautiful price, too.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"it","description":"The Trebbiano grapes for this delicious dessert white are hung in the attic for three months in the traditional manner.

The tannins are light, the acidity soft, and that's about it.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Rough, earthy and young, with the sharp acidity of youth and ripe, jammy fruit flavors.

The right foods (perhaps roast pork) will coax out its inherent sweetness.","designation":"Reserve Coastal"},{"country":"US","description":"A fresh, fruity wine.

Rich and earthy on the palate, this bottling emphasizes spice, mineral and loam flavors, not the bright fruit of so many other Ontario products.","designation":"Select Late Harvest"},{"country":"fr","description":"Dark earth and tobacco spice the aromas of this grand cru, followed by flavors of black cherries and herbs. The Cabernet Franc portion shines clearly through as a distinctive weediness, but it's somewhat balanced by roasted black cherries and only a hint of espresso-like oak.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Interesting cedar, game and leather notes accent this wine's blackberry and chocolate aromas and flavors. There's an almost Rh?ne-like quality to this full-bodied, well-balanced wine. Produced from a certified organic vineyard, the finish displays dark cherry and chocolate flavors with peppery accents.","designation":"Upper Weise Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Smooth style, with lots of vanilla cream and ripe berry fruit. Forward, inviting style of wine, with light tannins and a clean, focused finish. It's well balanced and professionally made, but ultimately unexciting.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Clean and fresh, this Piedmontese white offers lively almond, pear and grapefruit aromas.  Light and even melon and pear flavors with herb accents grace the paalte and the fairly extended finish shows an attractive, slight spiciness.","designation":"Le Lune"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine, from a newly acquired property, is tart and young, grapy almost, with the fruit a little reduced. The wine seems to be in hiding. It falls off in the middle and finishes with tannin and little else. This may just need more time in bottle to blossom.","designation":"Mustang Springs"},{"country":"fr","description":"A n gociant bottling from the ubiquitous Yvon Mau, this wine proudly boasts  lev  en futs du chene on the label. You can certainly notice it in the cedary aromas and flavors, but it's adequately balanced by cassis and tobacco flavors. The fruit tastes a touch overripe, but it seems to work well here.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This solid, mainstream Zinfandel displays blackberry fruit and some creamy notes on the nose. Well-defined, dark berry flavors with white pepper and leather accents mark the palate. The mouthfeel is even and the finish here is brisk, tart and juicy. A touch less oak might let the fruit shine a bit more.","designation":"Jack London Vineyard"},{"country":"za","description":"Nicely balanced from nose to finish, this medium weight Cabernet is more French than New World in style, with tart berry and tobacco elements prevailing. Very smooth on the palate, it finishes with fine tannins and a lingering tobacco note.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Cortina refers to the soil type. The wine shows forward, pretty fruit, mixing berries and cherries, and follows up with bright, clean, mouth-friendly flavors. Falls off in the finish, with some dry tannins.","designation":"Cortina"},{"country":"US","description":"Tannic, alcoholic nose, with a softer, rosier color tending toward brick. Old vines, soft, sweet, ancient flavors. The wine feels a little bit pushed   the alcohol is too high, and the finish is harsh, tannic and hot.","designation":"Zeni"},{"country":"fr","description":"Built along traditional lines, this claret features soft plummy Merlot fruit accented by leafy tobacco and cassis. Its cedary leanness makes it an ideal foil for rich meat dishes.","designation":"R serve Mouton Cadet"},{"country":"US","description":"Somewhat closed, the nose of this offering shows some red berry, currants and anise. An evenly textures palate, more of the fruits evidenced on the nose with slight pepperiness mark a classic Zinfandel profile. The finish is moderately tannic, and the wine has the potential to evolve for a year or two.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Forward, fruity and clean, with a jokey label showing a moose, an elk and a sheep playing pool. This wine would make a great house Zin if the price were just a tad lower.","designation":"Eighth Rack"},{"country":"za","description":"This medium weight example shows Pinotage fruit in a forward, correct manner. Tart plum and berry, cherry, and leather aromas abound. Earth and dried plum flavors on the palate are kept lively by decent acidity; touches of tart red berry, rhubarb and anise show on the moderately long finish.","designation":"Bayview"},{"country":"US","description":"Honeyed mango and papaya flavors are accented by a citrus streak that provides much-needed verve, while the aromas are more along the lines of pear and lemon. A solid effort, with only a hint of the musky or foxy quality that can sometimes dominate wines from hybrid grapes.","designation":"Late Harvest"},{"country":"US","description":"Firm, fruity, with tropical flavors and lots of alcohol. The flavors are tight and contained, the fruit tends to strawberry, and the finish is tannic.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"A solid claret, with cherry and plum fruit accented by dried herbs and a touch of vanilla. This is a basic Saint-Emilion that stays true to its appellation and doesn't try to be more than it is: a user-friendly wine that goes down easy.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A lot of wood, still pretty rough, surrounds a thick, tannic, muscular, ripe, rustic, Old World-style Zin. There's nothing elegant about this wine, but it packs a lot of flavor into a sturdy frame.","designation":"Tollini Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Red berry, rhubarb, herb and smoke aromas show in this lighter, claret-styled Zin. Good acidity supports its tart cherry flavors, and the herb note in the bouquet reprises on the finish, accompanied by an attractive pepperiness. Balanced and attractive, it will pair well with many foods.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The fruit is on the tart side, cranberries and raspberries, but the wine is fleshed out with plenty of vanilla oak, and fills the mouth with soft, seductive flavors. Well made and approachable, with some added interest from Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mourv dre in the blend.","designation":"Old Vines"},{"country":"US","description":"This attractive wine opens with a nicely nuanced bouquet of berry, spice and earth accented by positive gamy and slightly barnyardy notes. The textured palate offers attractive dark fruit and a touch of tar and licorice. Ends with an even, dry, long finish of pepper, earth and leather.","designation":"Wirth Ranch Vineyard"},{"country":"za","description":"This well-balanced Merlot displays a deep ruby/purple color and plenty of plum flavors. Coffee and herb notes add a touch of complexity and the texture is smooth and even. The finish has good length for a modestly priced red.","designation":"Bay View"},{"country":"US","description":"A fair amount of the cuvee is from the 130-year-old Grandp re vineyard, which lends a soft, herbal, grassy undertone to the wine. From elsewhere comes bright cherry fruit, and the wine seems a little disjointed, though it may come together in time. Some nail polish in the nose carries through to the finish.","designation":"La Grande Folie Old Vine"},{"country":"fr","description":"With its bold, jammy blackberries and a hint of black pepper on the nose, this wine is all about delivering a flavor punch. Straightforward berry fruit is tinged with licorice in a bulky but satisfying package.","designation":"Estate Bottled"},{"country":"US","description":"Tar and cherries in the nose, and the follow-through shows thick, ripe, sweet cherry fruit with some dark, tarry underpinnings. Good concentration and a long finish. There is 11% Petite Sirah, which adds color and depth.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"Canada","description":"Peaches and pears, lemons and grapefruits come together in this harmonious late harvest wine that shows little evidence of botrytis. The high acidity gives it balance and makes it a great foil for fruit-garnished foie gras.","designation":"Select Late Harvest"},{"country":"US","description":"Full, forward, fleshy nose shows lots of bright, spicy fruit. Unlike a lot of lower cost Zins, this wine has a lot of sweet fruit, and enough body and weight to carry through past the nose into a big, satisfying finish. Nice toast, plenty of acid, a bit hot in the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Impressive dark purple in color, this powerful vin carries lots of toasted-oak aromas: menthol and cedar in particular. There's some promising dark fruit underneath it all that should emerge in a couple years' time. Less exciting than this winery's 1996, which leads to the question: could the creation of a luxury cuv e have had an effect on the quality of this wine?","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Tight as a drum, but a little cherry fruit escapes from the nose. It opens up into a sweet, lovely bottle of wine, with a bit of cocoa and coffee in the finish. Well-balanced, with sweet, clean fruit.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"There's a lively gaminess to the nose; a wild, Rh?nish note, perhaps from the Carignane, Mourv dre and Petit Sirah blended in.

Well-balanced with good persistence, this is an easy, pleasing glass of red that's ready to drink now.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Smoke and oak dominate the nose, with some fairly light, pretty fruit underneath. The oak seems mismatched for the weight of the fruit, which is sweet and charming, like cherry lifesavers.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"za","description":"Restrained and refined, this lighter-weight Cab satisfies with dark cherry/berry aromas and flavors offset by earth and tobacco elements. Possessed of flavor and texture that should pair very well with a wide range of foods, think of this as an attractive zan claret. Drink now through 2004.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Full dark berry aromas and flavors and classic pepper accents mark this very likeable wine. Cocoa and meaty elements add a bit of complexity not necessarily expected at this price. Kept lively by its brisk, but not sharp acidity, it finishes peppery with a tart-sweet profile.  This straightforward, delicious wine exemplifies how competitive California can still be, despite the trend to priciness.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"High toned, alcoholic nose, with cherry nail-polish scents. Cherries and plums fill the mouth, along with tongue-lashing tannins. The blend includes 6% Grenache and 4% Mourv dre, which gives it a nice, peppery edge. Lots of flavor for this price.","designation":"Special Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Some of Seghesio's plantings are over a century old, and the wine has a classic, briary quality to it. Supple and inviting, it drinks well now but has the balance and structure to age for a few years.","designation":"Old Vine"},{"country":"US","description":"This is bright and smooth, with forward berry fruit and just the right amount of chocolaty oak. Supple and tangy, with a lip-smacking finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Even and smooth, this Paso Robles contender comes on strong with round, jammy red berry and rhubarb fruit offset by pepper and dusty rose accents. A green note does show early and persists, but the wine still has very good feel, and the silky finish displays a long pepper and red berry fade.","designation":"James Gang Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Pronounced mint and menthol in the nose, with good, ripe cherry fruit underneath. It's like a mint chocolate covered cherry in the mouth, distinctive and delicious.","designation":"Tres Condados"},{"country":"US","description":"Blueberry, spices, fruitcake, even a maple syrup note mark the nose of this fairly sweet Zinfandel. The somewhat candied quality to the berry fruit was not favored by all tasters, but the plush yet structured mouthfeel has significant appeal. Dark sweet-tart fruit and moderate, even tannins work together to provide a positive finish.","designation":"Rustridge Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows off the exotic musky-spicy side of this grape in its peppery, leathery aromas. Turns tropical in the mouth: papaya and mango are joined by zippy citrus-tinged acidity. Finishes long, with some of the peppery notes returning.","designation":"Ice Wine"},{"country":"US","description":"Good, thick, black cherry fruit, dense tannins, with a dark, dense, chalky finish. This is manly Zin muscular, balanced and heavy. Great for outdoor grilling.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Cocoa and cedar aromas dominate the bouquet, but then some dark fruit emerges on the palate. It's dense, rich and flavorful, but lacks the elegance and finesse to score higher.","designation":"Cuv e Prestige"},{"country":"za","description":"Plum, chocolate and herbaceous notes make for  an attractive flavor package. A smooth mouthfeel, medium body and a long finish add further positive notes. You won't go wrong with this one.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Lots of sharp-edged oak around a soft, plummy, chocolate-covered cherry of a wine. Smooth and easy-drinking, up to a fairly tannic finish. The acids keep everything in balance.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Cherry-scented, clean and fruity. Good concentration mid-palate, with no discernable new oak, just a balanced, firm attack and a strong, chewy finish. Only 123 cases made.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Raspberries, strawberries and blackberries, with smooth coffee and cream flavors streaking through the finish. Nicely made in a clean, classic Napa Zin style.","designation":""},{"country":"za","description":"This well-oaked Chardonnay has a full apple and caramel bouquet, flavors that follow in suit, and a pleasing, round mouthfeel. There are no surprises here, but no letdowns either. A middle-of-the-road pleaser with nice toast and butterscotch notes on the back end.","designation":""},{"country":"za","description":"This well-balanced Merlot displays a deep ruby/purple color and plenty of plum flavors. Coffee and herb notes add a touch of complexity, and the texture is smooth and even. The finish has good length for a modestly priced red.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Old vines from Russian River and Alexander valleys go into this spicy, briary, gamy Zin. There's a dark undercurrent of tar, pipe tobacco and smoke that runs through the finish. The fruit is subsumed to clove and tobacco flavors; best with strongly spiced grilled foods.","designation":"Old Vines"},{"country":"Canada","description":"Vidal has a peculiar bouquet that I have a hard time describing. This one boasts muskmelon, litchi and kumquat aromas, backed by a honeyed sweetness and grapefruit-like acids. Intense verging on overblown this is a fine example of what this French-American hybrid is capable of producing.","designation":"Special Select Late Harvest"},{"country":"US","description":"Spicy, ripe fruit, with an edge to it. Well-defined wine, which shows briar, toast, berry and coffee flavors sprinkled throughout. Well-built, sturdy, a little hot, but balanced and long.","designation":"Catfish Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"The blackberry fruit is wrapped in very deeply toasted oak. Aromas and flavors of cassis, vanilla, coffee and licorice mingle to display a dark flavor profile but positive tart-sweetness. Full and even on the tongue, this black beauty finishes with lingering spice and espresso notes.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Sure it's oaky, but it tastes good, with the subtle menthol and bold vanilla flavors serving to highlight bright cherries. The silky texture is a highlight, then the finish shows off juicy fruit and fine tannins.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"A round, ripe pear and lemon nose opens this medium-weight, full flavored white. Grapefruit, spice and green apple coat the palate, the texture is fairly rich maybe even fat for Riesling but there's good acidity to support the fruit. Finishes long with white peach and mineral notes.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"za","description":"Barrel fermented in French oak, this wine is made in a full style with plenty of nut, herb and fig aromas and flavors. Big, even fat on the palate, it offers considerable weight and texture. The lengthy finish with herb and mineral accents is particularly appealing.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"The dark color tells you right away this is no ordinary vin de pays. Then you sniff it and get cedar, black currants and blackberries. The finish has juicy acidity and dusty tannins, suggesting a couple years' cellaring may be warranted. Impressive.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Lovely attack, plummy and evolved, with no rough edges. The fruit is soft and sweet, layered and full, and the overall palate impression is of elegance and balance. This is a terrific drink-me-now bottle with nicely aged flavors.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The ripe berry flavors wear a veil of deeply toasted oak in this smooth and supple wine, but does it with finesse. Flavorful, smooth and not weighty, it has a pleasing, even texture on the tongue and displays good persistence with berry, pepper and dark toast flavors lingering on the back end. Perhaps over-oaked, but suavely so.","designation":"Rhodes Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Sweet, spicy fruit, with nicely matched toasty oak framing it. Everything balances out; this actually has the best balance and most seductive fruit of the three Lolonis bottlings, and certainly represents the best value.","designation":""},{"country":"Canada","description":"Wow, is this sweet tooth-achingly sweet. The aromas and flavors are relatively pure and free of botrytis; instead you get boatloads of ripe pear and melon flavors, huge thickness and weight, and decent acidity. Almost too rich and sweet for its own good.","designation":"Ice Wine"},{"country":"za","description":"The earth, smoke, saddle-leather aromas and flavors are powerful and distinctive but probably not to all tastes. The lavish high-toast oak is nearly over-the-top, but a creamy mouthfeel and long finish tip the scales to the pleasure side. Complex and challenging   but not for those averse to the elements mentioned.","designation":"Kevin Arnold"},{"country":"US","description":"Big, ripe, chocolaty wine, with lots of forward, smooth, oaky flavors. Easy to like, with a plush, creamy mouthfeel, and tons of new oak flavor.","designation":"Bismark Ranch"},{"country":"fr","description":"A delightful blend of cracked black pepper, blackberries and hung game aromas lead into a surprisingly plush mouthfeel that's laden with cherry and berry fruit. The finish blends in some dark coffee flavors for extra complexity.","designation":"Cuv e Sommelongue"},{"country":"US","description":"Inky, opaque and tight, this wine offers a bouquet of black fruits and toast. Though the mouthfeel is full and supple, it is presently very closed and yields scant flavor definition beyond the presence of a very good depth of dark fruits and well-charred oak. Finishes dry, with somewhat more discernable blackberry and vanilla notes and moderately puckering tannins. Best for keeping; try in two-plus years.","designation":"St. Peter's Church Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Lots of mushrooms in the nose, giving it a lively, gamy, forest floor quality. The fruit is there as well, wild berries and cherries, and the finish lingers through layers of complex, interesting flavors.","designation":"Vintner's Cuvee XXI"},{"country":"US","description":"Good, tangy red fruit, with youthful vigor and zest. Nuances of citrus rind, cranberry and toast; it's compact and sleek, still young and tight, but perfectly balanced and precision-tuned.","designation":""},{"country":"Canada","description":"Shows ample evidence of botrytis on the apricot-scented nose, with less-dominant aromas of ultraripe pears and peaches blending in. It's very juicy and fruity, with some lime-like acidity that keeps it fresh. Best with fresh fruits, or try with a foie gras appetizer.","designation":"Botrytis Affected"},{"country":"Canada","description":"Inniskillin continues to push the boundaries of icewine, as evidenced by this wood-aged Vidal. The vanilla and spice of oak barrels partially masks some of the stranger Vidal aromas, allowing the apricot and peach scents to come to the fore. There are some creamy lactic notes on the finish that detract slightly, but this is a very good effort at an entirely different genre.","designation":"Oak Aged Ice Wine"},{"country":"au","description":"Made for almost 40 years since 1962 this edition of 389 sports lots of spicy American oak, and displays black fruit and tobacco aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is big, the texture rich and the full, spicy finish is long and tannic. It's drinkable now, but really needs a few years to unwrap a bit, and the oak mantle will probably always be heavy. Satisfying, though somewhat one-dimensional.","designation":"Bin 389"},{"country":"US","description":"Fleshy, sweet, ripe, jammy fruit tastes like spicy strawberry preserves. This is a big, briary, vanilla-laced Zin, with firm acids and a fat finish. Best Buy.","designation":"Duarte Old Vine"},{"country":"US","description":"Big, toothsome wine, chewy and assertive. Cline fans will recognize the style: brambly, peppery, with enormous vitality and punch. Bright, spicy fruit backed with good acids and just enough toast.","designation":"Ancient Vines"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a slightly more intense version of the regular Castoro bottling, with an extra punch to the berries and a little more zip in the finish. A clean, bright, focused wine, precise and polished, with a natural elegance. Good balance throughout.","designation":"Vineyard Tribute"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine strikes a perfect balance, showing the jammy, slightly raisiny ripeness of Paso Robles fruit, but keeping enough acid in the mix to buoy it up. Plump and ripe, it gives a lot of flavor for the price, with interesting layers of fruit and earth through the finish.","designation":"Westside"},{"country":"US","description":"Nice cherry fruit, in a big, bold, forward, friendly style. The fruit is perfectly ripened, balanced, full and nicely handled, with nothing obscuring the clean, ripe flavors. Well-made wine, with no unnecessary frills.","designation":"Potter Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Herbs and spices dominate the nose, and the wine has an intriguing blend of 9% Petite Sirah, 2% Grenache and 2% Mourv dre in it. Interesting and flavorful, though not entirely varietal in character. The mix of spices tastes a bit like a Proven?al wine, and it's delicious for the price.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"There's some old-vine juice included in the blend, and it shows. The nose is lushly scented with plums, raisins, pie cherries and ripe red fruits, with some of that distinctive new mown hay quality that old vines send up. A little barnyard aroma too, in a good way. Very extracted and intense.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This is 100% Zinfandel, unlike the regular bottling, from specially selected barrels. 300 cases made.
