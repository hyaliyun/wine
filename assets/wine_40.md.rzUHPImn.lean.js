The immaturity lies in the primary fruit, acidic character, like a big gulp of fruity cola. But the wine's awesome future is in its vast complexity and balance, and the way it dominates the palate and lasts and lasts. A blend of several vineyards, it's high in acidity, with massive cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb preserve, licorice, earthy mushroom and cedar flavors.

Grown in a 5-acre Stags Leap District vineyard, it shows stunning levels of blackberry and chocolate fruit enhanced with waves of smoky oak. Yet somehow, for all the opulence and power, there's an almost weightless elegance to the wine. Sometimes cult Cabs can lack restraint, be too obvious.

From a St. Helena vineyard.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"au","description":"De Bortoli's top wines come off their estate vineyards in the Yarra Valley, and this Chardonnay is a hit, balancing the lead-pencil scents of French oak barrels against layers of honeyed apple and pear fruit and a zippy note of citrus.

Drink now.","designation":"Estate Grown"},{"country":"US","description":"A 50-50 blend of two top vineyards Ciel du Cheval and Champoux, this is Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cab Franc blended in.

It's a chewy little devil, more herbal than funky, but fascinating and complex.","designation":"Soleil"},{"country":"US","description":"Not as immediately obvious as the beautiful '04, this is a more tannic, structured wine, yet it shows the pedigree of the vineyard.

The tannins will be the perfect foil for lamb or veal.","designation":"Brown Ranch"},{"country":"US","description":"This is 100% Cab Franc. Chandler Reach has made another terrific example, saturated and lush with sweet, ripe black cherry fruit.

It's muscular without steroids, a fine follow up to the excellent 2002.","designation":"Parris"},{"country":"US","description":"Partially barrel-fermented, this Chard is a blend of Bien Nacido and Solomon Hills. It's a heavyweight, so full-bodied, in fact, that it's one of the rare California Chardonnays that will benefit from bottle age. It has a candied, English dessert trifle flavor of apricots, peaches, citrons and green apples, baked into a custardy pudding, and the caramelized taste of charred oak. You'll even find a dusting of tannins. Best after 2007, and for another five to seven years.","designation":"Fang Blanc"},{"country":"US","description":"This is Brian Carter's southern Rh?ne blend, two-thirds Syrah and one third Grenache. A lovely, dark, plummy purple, intensely fragrant with fresh berries, plums, whiffs of cocoa and sandalwood, a wine to sniff with contemplative pleasure.

Carter keeps the alcohol at 13.3% without sacrificing a bit of flavor or ripeness.","designation":"Byzance"},{"country":"cl","description":"It took a few years for Odfjell to get its Aliara blend right. For starters, it's not an easy wine, as it's based on Carmen re and has Cabernet Sauvignon, Franc, Carignan and Malbec in the mix.

It's one part savory and one part sweet; overall it's 100% impressive. 368 cases made.","designation":"Aliara"},{"country":"it","description":"I served this wine with endive salad and smoked salmon and it was absolutely divine.

About 45% comes from Boushey in the Yakima Valley, another 45% from Artz on Red Mountain, and the rest from Destiny Ridge in the Horse Heaven Hills. It is the most fruit-driven and forward of the three, and the well-matched vineyard blend puts the focus on the varietal character of the grape, using the different terroirs to create a complete wine. Very sophisticated handling of the different lots creates a whole that is worthy of its parts.","designation":""},{"country":"at","description":"The Wenzel family continue to make small quantities of finely crafted wines, like this intensely flavored Sauvignon Blanc.

Flavors of toasted wood add dimension and the wine closes with a soft and feminine touch of melted lavender honey.","designation":"Vin Santo"},{"country":"US","description":"Pinots from this vineyard have been variable, but the '05 is one of the best in years. The long, cool vintage yielded exceptionally ripe grapes, rich in cherries, pomegranates, cola and root beer flavor, yet the wine maintains a delicately dry, crisp silkiness. With quite a bit of new oak, this is a delicious Pinot best enjoyed in the next few years.","designation":"Mitsuko's Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a dark, young Pinot that needs a little time to come around.

The fruit is firm and tart, showing a mix of pineapple and green citrus and berry. An underlying minerality adds texture and more firmness; the wine does not show excessive flesh, but is loaded with lovely acid and fruit, and a hint of toastiness in the finish. About one third comes from 25-year-old vines, some of the state's oldest S millon.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Tight, elegant and showing less of the Merlot's broad, up front fruit flavor, but it's very well structured.

Better in 2008.","designation":"Caro"},{"country":"nz","description":"This wine was a big award winner back in nz, and it's easy to see why.

The wine is compact and tannic, but not over-built or chalky.

This is a wine that should continue to evolve nicely in bottle for up to a decade.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Amarone enthusiasts will be delighted by the resin, cola, menthol and pressed raisin notes that this gorgeous wine delivers.

But I know people who would call this Chard toothpicky.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"The talent at St. Sup ry is evident in this lush, balanced Merlot. It has the famously ripe, forward fruit of a great Napa red, but shows the balance, harmony and complexity you expect when you fork over forty bucks. Smooth and polished, this low-production red is gorgeous now, and should hold and soften for another eight years. Available exclusively from the winery.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A very good followup to the excellent '02, the '03 is plush and ripe and ageable. With forward cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors, it offers plenty of opulence now, but has the tannic backbone to peak and then gradually fade for 10 years. Signorello's estate Cab is really one of the more dependable bottlings in the valley.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"US","description":"If you're looking for a Cabernet that has all the hallmarks of California cool-climate ripeness and balance, without demanding to be noticed for itself, try this one. It's dry, elegant and juicy, teasing the palate with fruit, yet wisely pulls back at the last moment, so the food can star. The black currants and smoky oak will perfectly match a charred steak.","designation":"Heritage Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a new winery for me, and one to keep an eye on. They say the vineyard is 11 miles from Tomales Bay, which would put it close enough to the Pacific to get chilly winds and fog.

It's colorful and wrapped in a cloak of classy oak. The palate is juicy and balanced to a tee, with dark berry flavors busting free.

A wonderful red wine regardless of variety. 300 cases made.","designation":"Single Vineyard"},{"country":"es","description":"With 14% Cabernet and Merlot added to prime Tempranillo, this wine jabs early with toasty oak, forest floor and roasted berry aromas, and then follows it up with full-bodied blackberry fruit accented by tobacco, leather and warm earth.

Already drinking well but will improve over the next two to five years.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Made in a consistent style, this already delivers lush berry, plum, cherry and currant fruit, wrapped in generous new oak (90% of the wine was aged in small French oak barrels).

This is really classic Napa Cabernet, so elegant, and a great food wine.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Again winemaker Dave Larsen has made a classic Ciel du Cheval Cabernet, an austere mix of mineral and green tea flavors, hard and tight and densely compacted.

The alcohol is a moderate 14.1%.","designation":"Ciel du Cheval"},{"country":"US","description":"From a 1,700-foot vineyard high above the valley comes this compellingly delicious Zinfandel. A word of caution: The alcohol is 16.6%. But the wine isn't at all hot, and high alcohol is the price you pay for the lush, ripe fruitiness achieved in this scorching vintage.

Inky, vivid, saturated and loaded with appealing scents of meat, smoke, cedar, pencil shavings, blackberry, black cherry and much more, this is Washington's answer to Barossa Shiraz. Yet the alcohol remains a sensible 14.3%, and the wine has impeccable balance.","designation":"Block 17"},{"country":"US","description":"Mixed tart and racy fruit flavors of blueberry and plum, pie cherry and more are softly coddled with spicy, chocolaty oak.

This is a very good example of a wine in which flirty and focused elements marry successfully.","designation":"Professor Black"},{"country":"fr","description":"A blend of 85% Merlot and 15% Cab Franc, here is a wine that seduces with its spice and fresh, smooth fruits.

The firm acids that carry through the finish promise a long life ahead.","designation":"Nysa"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows typical Diamond Mountain youthful tannins that are tough and hard, and in this good vintage a dense, vibrant core of cassis and cherry fruit that's jamlike in its richness.

It's round and lush in the mouth, finishing spicy and long, with mouthwatering persistence. Drink nowC2012.","designation":"Hanenhof"},{"country":"US","description":"Of the scores of Pinots I tasted during my last trip to this region, this was the most exotic yet puzzling one. It's quite pale in color, with a ruby-orange hue, and has a baked fruit, yeast and spice aroma not unlike Madeira.

High acidity adds the perfect finishing touch, making all this richness bright.","designation":"Mt. Carmel"},{"country":"US","description":"This is among my favorites of the '05 B-C Pinots. The stems make the wine earthier and more tannic than most other SRH Pinot Noirs, in a way, more old-fashioned. The wine needs time, but the massive heart of cola, black cherry, plum and coffee flavors, not to mention the brisk acidity, suggests greater drinkability by 2008. This is a classy, exotic and complex young wine.","designation":"Cargasacchi"},{"country":"US","description":"It's herbal, spicy, slightly animal and scented with rosemary.

An interesting, complex wine; a natural beauty to pair with food.","designation":"Justification"},{"country":"au","description":"A marvelous effort, this features a gorgeously seductive bouquet of herbs, spice, blueberries and stone fruit, all framed by a touch of cedary oak.

The wine is as fine as coastal California Pinot gets, with ripe cherry pie, cola and chocolate macaroon flavors that are captivating in their youthful ebulience.

Best 2008C2012.","designation":"Rancho Santa Rosa Clone 115"},{"country":"US","description":"The wine is amazing, although if you don't like Chenin Blanc, it's not for you. It's high in acid, almost sour, which makes it a beautiful wine for food, a connoisseur's wine, a sommelier's dream. The flavors run toward lemon drop, wild flowers and elemental things like wax and steel. Should do all sorts of interesting things as it ages. Editors' Choice.","designation":"Old Vines Home Vineyard Dry"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is Amirault's top wine from St-Nicolas.

There are dense, dusty tannins, layers of blackberry jelly flavors and rich wood tastes that balance with the fruit.","designation":"Les Malgagnes"},{"country":"US","description":"The vineyard is the farthest west in the appellation, and the resulting wine is a high-acid thriller.

Give it four years in the bottle.","designation":"Rancho Santa Rosa Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the sort of Pinot that most Oregon vintners would kill for; forward, tart and spicy with scents and flavors of black cherry cola right out front. The tangy red fruit is lifted with light citrus, buttressed with well-modulated tannins, and enhanced with beautiful undertones of moist earth, leaf and spice. Great structure, acidity and persistence.","designation":"Canary Hill"},{"country":"US","description":"This is absolutely classic Santa Rita Pinot, dry, minerally, high in acidity, and ripe in cherries, cola, pomegranates and mocha, offering waves of complexity and interest.

It will be best after 2008, and should drink well for at least another five years.","designation":"Mt. Carmel"},{"country":"US","description":"Pretty much as flashy as California Chard gets.

Compared to Diatom's Clos Pepe bottling, this one's more citrusy, and certainly more acidic, which helps balance the alcohol. The lemon drop flavor detonates on the palate with an almost searing intensity that stimulates the salivary glands, and while the finish is bone dry, it has a honey-rich opulence.","designation":"Huber"},{"country":"US","description":"A finely structured Chard. It has the citrusy acidity you get only from the coolest areas, providing a bracing, steely quality to the green apple, quince and oaky flavors.

This is not an overweight, overly tannic wine, but a supremely balanced rendition of Shiraz that should age gracefully for up to 15 years.","designation":"Warner Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"The winery's flagship white wine is among the greatest California PBs I've ever tasted. Made Alsatian-style, it's tremendous in tangerine, kumquat, apricot, honeysuckle, buttercream, cinnamon-clove and vanilla aromas.

Editors' Choice.","designation":"Gaia Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine is a blend of Dijon clones, which bring pure, jammy fruit. Paired with the older Pommard, the result is a meaty, full-bodied Pinot. There's an earthiness to the cherries and berries, and the wine is complex and probably ageworthy for six to eight years.

In sum, this is a vibrant, sharp, juicy, lingering, delicious white wine.","designation":"Doyenne M tier Blanc"},{"country":"US","description":"At first this Chard struck me as austere, but as it aired and warmed in the glass, all kinds of minerally complexities emerged.

Both together make the wine young, immature, gritty, but they enable the wine to age. There's a terrific core of cherries, rhubarb, cola and pomegranates.

A blend of Syrah, Aragonez and Touriga Nacional.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"US","description":"Champoux and DuBrul vineyards supplied the excellent fruit, roughly half each. This is Washington Syrah at its most dark, dense and deeply extracted. Beautifully structured, this exceptional wine is laced with roasted, toasty streaks of espresso and smoke.

The 14.8% alcohol is in no way over the top.","designation":"River Beauty"},{"country":"US","description":"From the exceptional Klipsun vineyard, this blend of two thirds Merlot and one third Cabernet Sauvignon delivers beautifully softened and ripened tannins. This is a great effort; it clearly shows why Washington is the place for that grape, and the Cabernet filling in the spine.

The Syrah is up front, toasty and peppery, and the Bordeaux grapes lay back, adding weight to the tannins and a sense, more than a flavor, of herb. But there's a disconnect between the two components. As with previous vintages, this wine opens with breathing time, adding smoke and spice to the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This is tasty stuff, with plenty of coffee and toast wrapped over and around the medium-weight, sappy red fruit flavors.

Yet despite the obvious effort to craft a vinous all-star, to me it remains somewhat amorphous and a bit over-driven by the barrels.

The tension between the creamy texture and the high acidity is really interesting.","designation":"Royal Cuv e Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"There aren't a lot of wines coming off this appellation, and most of them are red.

A bottle-full of thick, black juice, sappy and saturated both in color and pure fruit flavor, this massive Syrah matches its brawn with brio peppery spice, delicate herb and toasty cracker.

Just 288 cases were made.","designation":"The Bully"},{"country":"US","description":"Continuing its string of outstanding Rieslings, J.

The '03 is huge, showing masses of forward, classic Cabernet fruit. Just erupts with dark berry-cherry, plum, boysenberry and coffee flavors with a rich, butterscotchy, gingersnap cookie note.

Keeps its focus thanks to acrobatic balance and simply beautiful fruit.","designation":"RiverBend"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the real deal when it comes to Zin. It's a big, impressive wine, ripe and opulent in briary berry, cherry, chocolate, coffee and peppery spice flavors, with a touch of raisiny cassis, and it leaves a powerful impression through the finish. Yet for all that, it somehow maintains elegance and balance, despite the ridiculously high alcohol.","designation":"Lancel Creek Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Soft, ripe and dry, this wine, with a little Merlot and Cab Franc, is largely from Beckstoffer's Tokalon Vineyard, with a dollop from the winery's Spring Mountain estate.

A wonderful wine, crisply acidic and deeply flavored. Candied citrus zest, peach pie, pink grapefruit, buttery honeysuckle, apricot, nectarine, and no oak because it doesn't need any. A spectacular food wine or just cocktail. Shows the promise of this variety in the right climate.","designation":"Clover Creek Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a wine to age, or at least to decant. Opened young it shows a hard steely character, even a tannic toughness, that only hints at what's to come. But older examples prove its ageability.

Open through 2010, and don't serve it too cold.","designation":"Vineyard 8 Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"More tannic than Rockledge's regular '03 Cab, this wine is also more concentrated in black currant fruit, and seems oakier, too.

Chocolate and baking spices add more flavors; the wine is seamless, smooth and long; the oak beautifully integrated.","designation":"Ethos"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a new reserve-style bottling, produced at less than 50 cases.

And that's not a criticism; the wine is toasty, with alluring charcoal and smoke aromas. The palate is up to it as well, as it exhibits bright, elevated dark-fruit flavors. Nicely balanced for the most part, with plenty of cassis, berry and plum character.","designation":"Special Barrel"},{"country":"fr","description":"This small cooperative, based in Mardeuil, always seems to punch above its station, thanks to good quality fruit.

Among the exceptions is this Pinot Grigio (75 percent) and Verduzzo blend. Thanks to its thicker skins, Verduzzo undergoes extra ripening on drying racks after a late harvest for further concentration of flavors and mouth texture. The Pinot Grigio component reinforces the wine's citrus freshness and peach-like aromas. This is an easy-to-drink white winewith a charis-matic and sophisticated edge.","designation":"Masianco"},{"country":"za","description":"Matured in 100% new French oak, and it shows on the palate with tight wood tannins.

Drink now.","designation":"Marqu s de Borba"},{"country":"fr","description":"High acidity shows both that this is a young wine, and that 2000 is not a particularly ripe vintage. There is some attractive tannic structure here, but this will always be a relatively austere wine.","designation":"Brut Ros "},{"country":"fr","description":"From 70-year-old vines, a majority of which (60%) are Syrah (the rest Grenache).

Supple and creamy enough to drink now, but should also hold a few years.","designation":"Boundary"},{"country":"de","description":"Given the steep slopes of the region and resulting high production costs, it's a mystery to me how proprietor Nik Weis has managed to keep his wines so affordable. The least expensive of his 2005s is a great introduction to the wines of the Mosel, with surprising minerality and precision for a wine that savvy shoppers can find for as little as $10. It's crisp and clean, lightly sweet, but balanced by fine acidity. It's delicate, yet full of flavor.","designation":"QbA"},{"country":"fr","description":"All of the Jaume wines emphasize mouthfeel and texture, and this offering is no exception.

Peach, honeydew and honeysuckle strike a harmonious chord and accent the sparkler's residual sugar.","designation":"Monti Furchi"},{"country":"za","description":"A very herbal wine, with sage and thyme flavors.

This is a wine that obviously needs time to develop, promising a serious, tannin-layered style.","designation":"Private Collection"},{"country":"es","description":"There's no shortage of barrel-driven hickory, coffee and chocolate on this modern-style Rioja, but there's also a spike of green on the nose and at the core of the flavor profile.

It's just a stylistic difference, not a qualitative one.","designation":"L'Argenti re"},{"country":"fr","description":"Aged entirely in vat, this old-vines cuv e from selected parcels features a rich, creamy texture but also great peppery spice.

Winemaker David Lake pioneered Syrah in Washington state almost two decades ago, and still makes one of the most balanced and restrained versions.
