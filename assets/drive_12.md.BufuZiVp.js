slender body. blueberries follow later while soft tannins make this a versatile player on the table.","designation":"Hoch√§cker"},{"country":"it","description":"concentrated and structured, this wine also manages to be sleek and glossy but by no means weightless. it opens with aromas of blue flowers, cedar, black currant and herb while the dense palate doles out black currants, blackberries and

tough to crack at this early age, with pressed olallieberry, menthol and a forest floor tartness on the nose as well. the palate is quite tight, with espresso, underripe elderberry and plum-skin
