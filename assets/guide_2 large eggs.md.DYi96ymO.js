Walnut Halves, lightly chopped 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/8 teaspoon cayenne 2 tablespoons lemon juice Instructions:</p><ol><li>Fill a large bowl halfway with ice cubes and add some cold water. Place a colander squarely inside the ice bath. The colander will keep you from having to pick the asparagus out from amongst the ice cubes in the ice bath.</li><li>Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Add the asparagus and cook for 1 to 1½ minutes. You want them to be crunchy. If the asparagus are thicker, cook for 1½ to 2 minutes.</li><li>Remove the asparagus from the water using a slotted spoon and transfer them to the colander inside the ice bath. Move them around gently so the ice water penetrates the asparagus and accelerates the cooling process. Vegetables take longer than you think to cool so allow them to sit a few minutes in the ice water. Hold a piece of the asparagus in your hand for a few seconds to assure that it&#39;s really cool (even in the center). If the piece still feels warm, allow them to cool longer in the ice bath. Place them on a kitchen towel to drain any excess moisture.</li><li>Heat oil a medium skillet until hot (but not smoking), add the walnuts and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt. They should bubble and fry slightly in the oil. When you can smell the walnuts, add the paprika and cayenne and lower the heat to medium. Cook for about 30 seconds, stirring constantly, and transfer the mixture to a bowl. Set aside.</li><li>Toss the asparagus in the bowl with the walnuts and the oil. Let this mixture sit in the refrigerator for a few hours or a few minutes. When ready to serve, stir in the lemon juice.

Stir together and set aside. Cream together the butter with the brown and granulated sugar, scraping the bowl once while mixing. Add the eggs, mixing one at a time, and then the vanilla. Add the chocolate-hazelnut spread and peanut butter and mix. Add the dry ingredients in increments, mixing gently after each addition. Scrape the bowl once and mix again. Add the chopped chocolate candies and pecans and mix gently to combine. Add more of either ingredient if needed. Spoon the dough on a long piece (or 2 shorter pieces) of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Carefully roll the dough inside the wrap, pressing gently to get it to form into a firm cylinder. Refrigerate for at least 3 to 4 hours, or place in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Slice off as many cookies as you&#39;d like and lay the slices on a baking sheet.

Mix the vegetables together with the garlic. Take half of the diced vegetables and mix with the ground chicken. Season with the salt and pepper, bread crumbs and egg. Mix thoroughly. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Spread the chicken farce on 1 side of the flattened bottom round and add the pickles lengthwise, directly down the middle of the meat. Carefully roll the beef into a tight roll, being sure not to press too hard or squeeze the chicken farce out of the sides. Season the outside of the beef roulade with salt and pepper. Tie with butcher&#39;s string in 5 or 6 sections along the length of the roll. Tie them fairly tight, because when the beef cooks it will shrink and the string will fall off. Sear the beef in a smoking hot saute pan in olive oil until all sides are a dark brown color. Remove from the pan and keep in a warm place. In the same pan, add the other half of the vegetables and cook for 3 minutes, when the vegetables are golden brown deglaze with wines and add the fresh thyme. Bring this mixture to a boil, add the beef, and reduce the heat. Cover with either the lid or foil and cook for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and add the veal stock and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and turn the meat, so that the other side of the meat is in the liquid. Cook for 10 more minutes on a medium flame. Cook this mixture until the internal temperature reads 165-degrees F. The chicken must read 165-degrees F or you risk the chance of possible bacteria. If too much of the liquid evaporates, add a little more chicken stock. Remove the meat from the pan and let rest for 10 minutes prior to slicing. Remove the string from the beef with a small knife. Slice the beef into 1/2-inch portions and transfer to a serving platter. Add butter to the vegetable mixture and swirl to melt. Spoon the vegetable mixture over the meat and serve with chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 62459,&quot;Baklava Cups 1/2 cup pistachios 1/2 cup walnuts 1/2 cup almonds 1 lemon, zested 1/4 cup, plus 3 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons butter, melted 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 boxes mini filo shells, 15 shells each 1/2 cup water 1/4 cup honey Special equipment: 2 (12-cup) mini cupcake pans, food processor Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Fill the bowl with cold water and agitate the shredded potatoes and rinse with water until the water runs clear from the colander. Strain the potatoes and pour into a clean kitchen towel, gather the edges and twist the towel around to squeeze the excess water out of the potatoes. Do this as hard as possible, changing towels if needed to remove the most moisture. Transfer the dried potato shreds to a large bowl. Add the garlic powder, onion powder, Hungarian paprika, 2 teaspoons of salt, and a grind or two of pepper. Toss with your hands to combine. In a large nonstick saute pan on medium heat, add the olive oil and shredded potatoes. Spread the potatoes evenly and allow a bottom crust to build before tossing to cook some more. Continue to cook while tossing until most of the hash browns are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour into a serving plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62470,&quot;Deep-Dish Apple Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/3 cup cold vegetable shortening 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons ice water 3 tablespoons cold vodka (or more ice water) Coarse sugar, for sprinkling 4 pounds mixed apples (such as Rome, Gala and McIntosh) 2/3 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons heavy cream, plus more for brushing 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon or apple pie spice 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Make the crust: Pulse the flour, 4 tablespoons butter, the shortening, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor until it resembles fine meal. Add the remaining 8 tablespoons butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Drizzle in ice water and vodka and pulse until the dough just comes together (it should hold together when pinched). Divide the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; use the plastic to form each half into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. (The dough can be frozen for up to 2 months; thaw at room temperature.) Make the filling: Peel the apples and slice 1/2 inch thick; add to a bowl and toss with the granulated sugar and lemon juice. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until softened, 15 to 18 minutes. Add the flour, heavy cream, cinnamon and salt; stir until the juices thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. (The filling can be made up to 2 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 13-inch round on a floured surface. Transfer to a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie plate by rolling the dough back around the rolling pin and unrolling it over the pie plate; gently press into the pan. Add the filling, mounding it in the center; dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface. Lay the dough over the filling and press the edges together. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp. Brush with heavy cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Cut a few slits in the top crust to let steam escape. Chill at least 1 hour. Set a baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 425? F. Set the pie on the hot baking sheet, reduce the oven to 375? F and bake until golden, rotating as needed for even browning, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. (Tent the edges with foil if browning too quickly.) Let cool on a rack until set, about 3 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62471,&quot;Stuffed Artichokes 4 cups plain breadcrumbs 1 cup grated Parmesan/Romano cheese blend 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 5 cloves garlic, minced 2 lemons, plus 4 lemon slices 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 4 large artichokes Instructions: Mix the breadcrumbs, cheese, olive oil, parsley, garlic, the juice from 1 1/2 lemons and the salt and pepper in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. The mixture should be slightly moist. If it appears very dry, add a small amount of additional lemon juice.<br> Cut off the stem of each artichoke, and then trim the tips of the leaves with kitchen shears. Open the leaves with your fingertips and rinse with cold water, holding the leaves open. Working with one at a time, place each artichoke in the center of the bowl of breadcrumb mixture and stuff the mixture into the leaves, holding the leaves open. You may have leftover stuffing, depending on the size of the artichokes. Sprinkle the tops of the artichokes with the juice from the remaining lemon half. Place a lemon slice on top of each artichoke.<br> Wrap each artichoke in foil and place in a large pot with 3 cups cold water. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer until the leaves are tender, about 2 hours, depending on the size of the artichokes.

Toss the peppers with some oil, place on a baking sheet, and roast in the oven until blackened. Turn them over, blacken on the second side, and remove to cool. Alternatively, blacken on a grill in the same manner. Gently remove the skins and seeds; do not rinse with water. Place in a food processor bowl and pulse to puree. Scrape down sides and pulse a few more times. Add to the processor bowl 1 egg, 2 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, and salt; pulse to combine. Add in 12 ounces of the semolina and pulse to combine. A dough ball should start to form after 6 to 7 pulses. If the mixture is too wet, add more semolina until a dough ball forms. Process for 1 minute and turn the dough out onto a lightly semolina-floured cutting board. Sprinkle with a little more semolina and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes. Prepare a work area for rolling out the pasta: a large cutting board, all-purpose bench flour, large sheets of plastic wrap, dough blade or knife, small amount of water, and a pastry brush. Cut a 1/2-inch thick piece of the dough from the ball and shape into an oval, making sure that the dough isn&#39;t wider than the width of the pasta roller. Process through the pasta machine by folding the dough into thirds, feed through the rollers on level 1, and repeat until the dough is smooth, elastic, and in an even shape. Add more flour or a sprinkle of water, if necessary, to adjust the consistency of the dough. Continue rolling out through level 9, without folding, and cutting the sheets into 12 to 14-inch long pieces as needed. Wrap carefully and individually in plastic wrap; it&#39;s okay to layer. Repeat until the dough is used up. Combine the cheeses with the pepper and whisk in 2 eggs. On a clean, lightly semolina-floured surface lay out a sheet of pasta. With a round tablespoon measure, lightly press some cheese mixture into the measuring spoon and \\thonk\\ with your finger gently onto the sheet, spacing them 1 1/2 inches apart. Lightly brush beaten eggs around the cheese. If the dough is wide enough you can fold it over the cheese, or if it&#39;s thinner in width, center the cheese spacing and add a top sheet. Start at the center and gently compress around the cheese to push out any air. Cut between the raviolis with a bench scraper, knife, or pizza cutter. Dust raviolis lightly with semolina flour and set on a cookie rack; repeat until all the raviolis have been made. Reserve the extra cheese for garnish. Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat and add 1 tablespoon kosher salt. When ready, add the raviolis gently into boiling water, pressing into the water as needed, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the water, drain, and add to the Chardonnay Cream Sauce. Place into a serving dish and drizzle some of the Basil Oil. Sprinkle with a bit of the remaining cheese, the minced parsley, and serve immediately. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, add the butter and when foamy, add the shallots and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Add the chardonnay and the salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Allow to simmer for 10 minutes. Add the cream and combine well. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes; the mixture will thicken slightly. Hold warm until service. Adjust seasonings as needed.; Prepare an ice bath of ice and water. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat, add the basil leaves, and cook for 10 seconds. Remove immediately to the ice bath. When cool, transfer to a salad spinner or strainer and remove water. Add the leaves and oil into a blender and pulse to puree. Scrape down the sides and pulse a few more times. Strain the mixture through 4 layers of rinsed cheesecloth into a sterile canning jar (16-ounce size is good). This process will take about an hour. Refrigerate unused portion for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo]&quot; 62475,&quot;Artichoke and Tomato Panzanella 3 cups 1 1/2-inch-cubed whole-wheat bread One 10-ounce package frozen artichoke hearts, thawed (about 2 cups) 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning 3 large red tomatoes, cut into wedges (about 2 pounds) 1 cup pitted black olives, halved 3/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves (about 1 bunch) 1/4 cup white wine vinegar Instructions: Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill.

Choose between a 10 by 3-inch round or a rectangular shaped baking pan and spray it with baking grease or butter and then line the bottom with parchment paper. Combine the oil and the sugar in mixer until well blended. Add the eggs and the vanilla extract and continue to mix until well blended. Add the milk and the coffee. Sift all of the dry ingredients and then add them to the wet ingredients in three batches allowing each batch to be thoroughly absorbed. Pour the batter in prepared pans and bake for approximately 25 minutes or until a skewer is clean when removed. Allow to cool before unmolding. Once chocolate cake has cooled, unmold, and refrigerate overnight to allow it to cool thoroughly. To make the ice cream cake: Cut the chocolate cake horizontally to make 2 layers out of the 1 layer and slide 1 of the layers onto a plate or cake board attempting not to break the layers. Line the same pan used to bake the chocolate cake in plastic wrap (the plastic will help you remove the ice cream cake from the pan once it is set, so make sure to use a large enough piece and slide 1 of the half layers of chocolate cake into the pan). Make sure that it rests firmly in the bottom of the pan and if the plastic wrap has slipped in, adjust so that it spills over the sides of the pan. Empty a pint of chocolate ice cream, or your favorite brand, into a mixer and soften until it is easily spread, do not let it become runny. Pour the ice cream into mold over chocolate layer and spread evenly with a spatula or the back of a spoon. Return to freezer until set, approximately 2 hours. Soften 2 cups of creamy peanut butter in the microwave without letting it get runny, approximately 2 minutes. Then pour the peanut butter over the chocolate ice cream. Using a spatula or the back of a spoon, spread the peanut butter evenly over the chocolate ice cream. Place the second half of the chocolate cake layer over the peanut butter and pat down firmly. Return to freezer until set, approximately 2 hours. Empty a pint of vanilla ice cream or your favorite brand, into a mixer and soften it until it can be easily spread. Pour into mold over chocolate layer and spread evenly with a spatula or the back of a spoon. Return to freezer and allow to set overnight. To unmold, simply invert over cake board or plate, place a warm towel over the pan for a couple of minutes. The cake should slide out without any problems, grab a hold of the ends of the plastic wrap, and give it a tug if it is stubborn. Invert back so that vanilla ice cream is on top. Decorate with melted chocolate or whipped cream. If you chose a rectangular shaped mold, cut lengthwise and stack on top of each other for a dramatic presentation. Drizzle with melted chocolate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 62480,&quot;Cauliflower, Leek and Ginger Soup 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup sliced leeks, white and light green parts only 1 cup chopped peeled potato 1 tablespoon peeled chopped fresh ginger 1 sprig fresh rosemary Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth 2 1/2 cups cauliflower florets 1/2 cup garlic cloves 1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for serving Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Beat the butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer (or using a stand mixer fitter with the paddle attachment) on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the egg and yolk, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the dry ingredients and beat until well combined, about 1 minute. Fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts, then fold in the rhubarb. Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with reusable nonstick mats (or parchment). Use a 1-ounce ice cream scoop to scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart (you should have about 10 cookies, roughly 1 1/2 ounces each, per baking sheet). Sprinkle the sea salt on top of the dough balls. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until the cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the middle, 14 to 16 minutes. Let cookies cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.

Lay the tomato quarters out on a baking sheet and sprinkle generously with salt. Drizzle with olive oil. Roast until golden brown around the edges, about 15 minutes. Set aside until serving. Meanwhile, for the bacon and black pudding: Add the bacon to a large skillet and turn the heat to medium. Cook on both sides until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crispy, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Set aside on paper towel-lined plate to drain. Add the black pudding links to the skillet and cook, turning as needed, until heated through and brown on all sides, about 7 minutes. Add to the bacon and reserve until serving. Reserve the skillet with the fat. For the mushrooms: Heat the skillet with the fat over medium heat. Add the shallot and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms in one layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn the mushrooms and add the butter to the skillet. Cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the chives and toss to combine. Reserve until serving. For the poached eggs: Fill a large, wide pot halfway with water and bring to a boil. Add the vinegar and reduce the heat until the water in the pot has no more bubbles. Very close to the surface of the water, crack the eggs and gently drop each egg into the water. Cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon. (If making ahead of time, transfer the poached eggs to a bowl of cold water to store. When ready to serve, reheat the poaching liquid and warm the eggs through, taking care not to overcook them.) To serve: Divide the tomato slices, bacon, black pudding, mushrooms, eggs and toast between two plates.

(It should feel warm but not too hot.) Sprinkle the yeast and 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar over the top and stir to dissolve. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, milk powder, salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Whisk the melted butter and egg yolks into the yeast mixture, then pour into the well and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together into a shaggy ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, dust with more flour and knead, adding more flour as needed, until smooth but still slightly sticky, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a buttered bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br> Make the filling: Mix the granulated sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface, pat and roll out into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Spread the butter over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on one long side. Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar and lightly press into the butter. Brush the clean edge with water, then tightly roll up the dough into a log, starting with a long side and rolling toward the clean edge; pinch the seam to seal. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and lightly sprinkle with granulated sugar. Slice the dough log into 12 pieces and arrange cut-side up in the dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour, or you can refrigerate overnight, then in the morning let stand at room temperature 2 hours before baking.

Let sit until softened, about 20 minutes. Remove the mushrooms with a slotted spoon so any grit stays at the bottom of the bowl; finely chop the mushrooms. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add the cremini and porcini mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the water cooks off and the mushrooms start to brown around the edges, about 10 minutes. Stir in the shallots, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper and cook until the shallots soften and the mushrooms turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and spread in a thin layer to cool to room temperature.<br> Meanwhile, melt 2 more tablespoons of the butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Add the spinach and cook, stirring often, until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir to combine. Transfer the spinach to a colander set in a bowl to drain any excess moisture. Let cool to room temperature.<br> While the spinach cools, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the brioche cubes and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.<br> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> With a sharp boning knife, cut the meat and fat away from the rib bones about 1 1/2 inches down from the top, scraping the bones as clean as you can. Trim any excess fat so there&#39;s no more than 1/4-inch covering the meat. (You can also ask your butcher to do this for you.)<br> Put the roast on a large cutting board with the bones upright. Holding a large, sharp knife parallel to the bones and about 1 inch from the back of the bones, cut straight down until you are about 1 inch from the bottom of the roast. Gently pull the meat away from the bone so that the bones are upright and the meat is on the cutting board. Position the knife so it is parallel to the cutting board and, starting where you left off with your last cut, continue to cut into the meat about 1 inch up from the board, slowly unrolling the meat as you cut. You will have a long rectangular piece of meat attached to the bone that is about 1-inch thick.<br> Once the meat is in an even layer, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Spread the mushroom mixture in an even layer on the meat. Top with the brioche and then layer on the spinach. Dot with the truffle butter if using. Starting at the boneless end, tightly roll the meat back up and secure tightly with butcher twine (tie it all the way around the roast between each rib). Sprinkle the outside with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.<br> Place bone-side down on a roasting rack set in a roasting pan and transfer to the oven. Roast for 20 minutes, then turn the heat to 350 degrees F and continue to roast until the meat registers 125 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare, about 2 1/2 hours.<br> Transfer the roast to a cutting board and let rest for 30 minutes before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 62640,&quot;Skillet Chicken Tortellini Alfredo 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg 1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan Kosher salt<br> 18 ounces frozen cheese tortellini 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1 1/4 pounds) 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Warm up the steak and spinach in a saute pan or in the microwave. Place all ingredients, except butter, leftovers and cheese in a blender and process on high speed for about 10 seconds to incorporate air into the mix; the club soda and baking powder will help the omelet to rise. (You may also use a hand-held blender with a deep cup). Melt the butter in a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Pour in the egg mixture, and using a rubber spatula, slowly push the cooked egg from 1 side of the bottom of the pan to the other to allow new raw egg to reach the bottom of the pan and cook (this creates height and keeps the bottom from burning). When the omelet is cooked on the bottom and the top is still runny, you can either flip the omelet in the pan to finish, or to make the \\Tallest\\ omelet possible, place the pan just below the broiler with the oven door open and the handle sticking out (it could melt otherwise) for about 30 seconds until the omelet rises and lightly browns. Remove from heat, add warmed leftover filling and the cheese, and fold in half. To serve, slice into pieces.

Combine sugar and water and bring to a boil on a medium saucepan. Boil until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F. Whip egg yolks until light and fluffy and carefully pour the sugar water mixture into the yolks while the mixer is running at a moderate speed. Continue whipping until cooled. Add softened butter in small batches, stopping after each addition. Remove the 9-inch round cake from the pan, and cut a 5-inch and a 3-inch circle of cake from the 9-inch square pan. Cover them with butter cream and freeze. Dye fondant pastel pink, blue and yellow by kneading food coloring into it. Roll out on a powdered sugared surface and cut 1 circle out of each color to cover 1 layer of the cake, leaving 2 extra inches to hang over sides. Lay the fondant over the cake layers and with your hands, mold the fondant over the cake to fit. Trim the edge and tuck it slightly under the cake. On a large cake platter, stack the layers and run a long skewer down the center. Whip together powdered sugar and 3 to 4 tablespoons of the egg whites so it&#39;s pipe-able but not too thin that it runs on the cake.

Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until creamy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low, then gradually add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated, about 2 minutes more. Place a sheet of parchment on a work surface. Transfer the dough to the parchment and cover with another sheet of parchment. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into an even layer that reaches the edges of the parchment. Slide the parchment and dough onto a 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Remove the top parchment from the dough and bake until firm and no longer shiny, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack and cool completely. For the peppermint bark: Put all but 1 cup of the white chocolate in a large heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) and stir until one-third of the chocolate is melted. Remove the bowl from the saucepan; keep the saucepan over low heat. Gradually stir the reserved 1 cup white chocolate into the bowl, a few pieces at a time, until all of the chocolate is melted; return the bowl to the saucepan for 5 to 10 seconds at a time as needed. Do not rush this step: It may take up to 10 minutes to melt all the chocolate. Wipe off any moisture from the bottom of the bowl. Stir the peppermint extract into the chocolate, then quickly pour over the cooled cookie base and spread in an even layer with a rubber spatula or small offset spatula. Sprinkle immediately with the peppermint candies, gently pressing the pieces into the white chocolate. Set aside at room temperature until firm, about 2 hours. Lift the bark cookie out of the baking sheet using the parchment and break it into pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62686,&quot;Fried Sweet Potato Hashbrowns 2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and grated 1/2 pound diced bacon 1 cup chopped onions Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped garlic Instructions: In a large skillet, render the bacon until crispy, about 8 minutes.

Add the shallots and sweat until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Deglaze with the white wine. Bring to a gentle simmer and add 1/2 stick of the butter. Stir until melted. Add the basil, parsley and tarragon. Add the lobster pieces and poach in the liquid until almost cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest and lemon juice. Remove from the heat, transfer the lobster to a dish and set aside to cool. Reserve the liquid.<br> Bring a medium saute pan to medium-low heat. Add the flour and toast gently for about a minute. Add the salt and pepper and the remaining 1/2 stick butter, stirring constantly. Cook until the starch begins to dissipate, about 3 minutes; be careful to not allow the roux to darken. Whisk the reserved poaching liquid into the roux until smooth. Simmer until the starch is completely cooked out and the sauce is thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, transfer to a medium mixing bowl and cool completely.<br> Gently fold the lobster into the thickened poaching liquid. Lay out the wonton wrappers, working in small batches so they don&#39;t dry out. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling into the center of each, brush the edges with water to moisten, place a second wonton over top and press to adhere. Use an inverted 2-inch cookie cutter (the smooth side) to gently seal the filling into the middle (this ensures a snug fit and no air bubbles which will make the ravioli burst when poached). Use a 3-inch cookie cutter (the sharp side) to cut out and create round raviolis.<br> Bring 2 quarts well-salted water to a simmer in a large pot. Working in batches, simmer the ravioli until they are al dente, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.<br> Meanwhile, make the brown butter sage sauce: Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and cook, stirring until it melts and becomes foamy. Once the butter turns golden brown and has a nutty aroma, about 3 minutes, add the capers, sage and garlic. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Once the sage is fragrant, remove the skillet from the heat and fold in the parsley, tarragon and lemon juice. Stir to incorporate and warm up the herbs and lemon -- this will release their aroma but they&#39;ll maintain their bright vibrant color.<br> To heat and serve: Working in batches to not overcrowd the pan, gently toss the poached ravioli in the brown butter in a large saute pan for 1 to 2 minutes over medium heat to coat the pasta evenly. Place the ravioli on plates and spoon over sauce from the pan. Top with shaved Parmesan, garnish with basil buds and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barolo]&quot; 62688,&quot;Pecan Pie 1 piece refrigerated pie dough 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2 cups pecan halves, 1 cup chopped and 1 cup left whole 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 2 tablespoons whole milk 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease the dough into a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie plate; fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edges. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the brown sugar, granulated sugar and eggs until creamy. Add the chopped pecans, melted butter, milk, flour and vanilla extract and stir to combine. Pour the mixture into the pie shell. Arrange the pecan halves on top of the pie in a circular pattern. Bake the pie for about 55 minutes.

Using a 2 1/4-inch biscuit cutter cut 12 rounds from each dough. Gently press the rounds into each of the mini muffin tins to form mini crusts. In a large measuring cup, whisk the cream and eggs with the pumpkin pie spice and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Fill each muffin cup with 1 teaspoon of the cooled leeks and top with 1 teaspoon of the cheese. Cover the filling with the egg and cream mixture. Place the muffin tins onto cookie sheets and put them into the oven. Bake until the egg mixture has set and the quiches are lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62694,&quot;Salt Cured Cod and Roasted Garlic Croutons 2 pounds/1kg center-cut skinless cod fillet, bones removed 2 bunches fresh dill, chopped, plus an extra handful 1/2 cup/125ml coarse salt 1/4 cup/60ml brown sugar 1 tablespoon/15ml plus 1 teaspoon/5ml black peppercorns, crushed 6 cups milk (1 1/2 liters) 2 shallots, quartered 1 head garlic, plus 1 smashed garlic clove 1/3 cup/80ml plus 1 tablespoon/15ml extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper A handful chopped fresh chives A handful chopped fresh dill A handful chopped fresh parsley 1/4 cup/60ml olive oil 2 cloves garlic, smashed 4 slices country bread Salt and freshly ground black pepper Lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: For the cod and roasted garlic spread: Remove any brown parts from the cod. With a mortar and pestle, crush 2 bunches dill and mix with the coarse salt, brown sugar and 1 tablespoon peppercorns. Rub the salt mixture on the cod. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. Bring the milk to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon peppercorns, the shallots and 1 smashed garlic clove. Rinse the cod to remove the excess salt mixture, then add to the saucepan and cook until flaky, about 10 minutes. Transfer the cod to a bowl and discard the milk mixture. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Cut the garlic head in half horizontally. Drizzle the cut sides with 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt and pepper. Wrap in foil and roast for 30 minutes. Flake the fish into the bowl with a fork or your fingers. Add the remaining 1/3 cup oil and the roasted garlic, squeezing the pulp from the skins, and mash until combined and creamy. Add the remaining handfuls chives, dill and parsley. Season with pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve. For the croutons: Heat the oil in a skillet over low heat. Add the garlic and let it infuse the oil. Add the bread and toast on both sides. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, spread the cod mixture on the toast. Serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 62695,&quot;Pulled Pork 1 (5 to 7-pound) Boston pork butt, bone in 3/4 cup seasoning rub (recommended: Butch&#39;s Smack Your Lips Magic Dust) Instructions: Preheat the oven or smoker to 225 degrees F. Score the fat cap of the butt, cutting through the fat only and not into the meat. Rub liberally with the seasoning rub. Cook the meat about 8 to 10 hours or until the internal temperature, using an instant-read meat thermometer, reaches 165 degrees F for slicing or 175 degrees F for pulling. If you wish to use the meat later, wrap the butt in double foil to retain the juices and refrigerate or freeze. If you are using the meat immediately, remove the bone by twisting it, it should easily come out. Then slice it or use 2 forks to shred the meat apart. To serve, use a 4-ounce portion of meat on a bun and top with BBQ sauce. For North Carolina style add 2 tablespoons of coleslaw. Savor and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 62696,&quot;City Chicken 2 pounds cleaned pork tenderloin, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 2 cups plain breadcrumbs 2 large eggs, beaten Olive oil, for cooking Instructions: Set up a grill for cooking with indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Thread the pork cubes onto eight 6-inch skewers, dividing evenly. Set aside. In a bowl, whisk together the flour and 1 teaspoon paprika. Season with salt and pepper, then set aside. In another bowl, whisk together the breadcrumbs and 1 teaspoon paprika. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and remaining 1/2 teaspoon paprika. Season with salt and pepper, then set aside. Dredge the skewers in the flour, then egg, then breadcrumb mixture, shaking off any excess in between. Place a large cast-iron pan on the direct-heat side of the grill. Add enough olive oil to come 1 to 1 1/2 inches up the side of the pan. Once the oil is hot, add the pork skewers in batches. Do not overcrowd the pan! Cook, allowing to deeply brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Once all the skewers are browned, return them all to the pan, then move the pan to the indirect-heat side of the grill and finish cooking until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F, 15 to 20 minutes more.

Heat a small skillet over medium heat, add the bacon, cook until the fat renders but is short of being crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions; form each into a ball. Roll a portion into a 12-inch round on a floured surface (cover the other piece with a kitchen towel). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour and put the dough on the peel, drizzle lightly with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Slip the dough onto the preheated stone and cook until just set, about 4 minutes. Using the peel, remove the dough from the oven and spread half of the mashed potatoes over the top, leaving about a 1-inch border around the side. Season with salt and pepper. Then sprinkle half of the cheese on top and top with half of the bacon, leek and garlic. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Return the pizza to the stone and cook until the crust is golden and the cheese melts, about 5 to 7 minutes more.

Combine the flour, cornstarch and baking powder in a large bowl, then whisk in the beer. Let the batter sit in the fridge for 15 minutes to set. Dip the halloumi cubes into the batter and drain off any excess. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, then transfer to a sheet tray lined with a wire rack so they don\\u2019t get soggy. For the pickled crudit: Bring the vinegar and water to a boil in a pot, then reduce to a simmer.

Pulse them together until the flour is fluffy and aerated.<br> Add the butter. Pulse ten times. The flour and butter should look like a sandy mixture with chunks of butter still visible. Pour in 1/2 cup of the water. Pulse five times. The dough should look moistened but not wet, and gathering but not collected into a ball. If there are any dry patches of flour remaining, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. The final dough should look a bit like cheese curds.<br> Form the dough into discs: Dump the curds of dough onto a clean, cool surface. (A piece of parchment paper works well here.) Gather them loosely into a pile. Put the heel of your hand on the top portion of the pile and press down and away from you. Repeat this with the entire pile until you have a smooth pie dough.<br> Cut the pie dough in half. Take one half and press the dough onto itself, as though you are closing the page of a book; repeat with the other side. Form the pie dough into a smooth disc and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the other half of the dough. Let the discs of dough rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.<br> Roll out the dough: Take the pie dough disks out of the refrigerator and let them sit out until they have come to a chilly room temperature, about 15 minutes or so. Put one disc of dough between two lightly greased pieces of parchment paper. Pat down the disk and put the rolling pin on top of it. Now, imagine that the dough is the face of a clock. Roll out once at 12 o&#39;clock. Then, lift the pin and roll at 12:10. Moving in \\ten-minute\\ increments, roll out the dough to slightly larger than your pie pan.<br> Lift the top paper, put a 9-inch pie pan on top of the pie dough, and flip it over. Carefully, strip away the parchment paper. Go slowly. Voila! Pat the dough down into the pan. If some of the pie dough has stuck onto the parchment, no need to worry. Simply peel it off and pat into the rest of the pie dough.<br> Roll out the second disc of pie dough in a similar fashion. Put the pie pan and the top piece of dough in the freezer while you make the chicken filling.<br> Sear the chicken: Set a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil. Put half of the chicken into the hot oil. Let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then stir it up and cook until it is evenly browned. Remove the cooked chicken from the oil and repeat with the remaining chicken.<br> Cook the vegetables: Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in the Dutch oven. Add the mushrooms, carrot, onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is soft and translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the thyme and cook until it is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the potato. Make the gravy: Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in the chicken stock, stirring it into the vegetables. Bring the stock to a boil and then turn the heat down to simmer. Simmer the stock, stirring occasionally, until it begins to thicken, about 15 minutes.<br> Finish the filling: Add the asparagus and edamame to the vegetable mixture. Stir until they are fully incorporated. Taste the filling and season with salt and pepper if needed.<br> Fill the pie: Let the filling cool to room temperature. Pour it into the prepared pie pan. Allow the remaining piece of pie dough too come to a chilly room temperature.<br> Top the pie: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Flip the pie dough on top of the pie. If the dough sticks and breaks, just pat the pieces together. Working with slightly wet fingers, crimp the edges of the pie dough together.<br> Bake the pie: Put the pot pie onto a parchment-lined sheet pan to catch the drippings during baking. Bake the pot pie until the crust is golden brown and the filling is piping hot and starting to ooze out of the pie crust, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.<br> Cool the pie: Allow the pie to cool to room temperature. Serve! Pour all the flours into a large container. (Restaurant supply stores sell large plastic containers that fit this purpose well. You could also use a large glass jar.) Shake and shake and shake harder until all the flours have become one color. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62711,&quot;Three-Pound Beef Burger for Six on Country Bread Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing 3 1/2 pounds ground beef 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt, preferably gray salt, plus more for sprinkling 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for sprinkling 6 ounces soft, fresh goat cheese, at room temperature, such as Laura Chenel&#39;s Nonstick spray, for spritzing One 16-ounce round loaf country bread Grilled Bing Cherry-White Balsamic Sauce, recipe follows 2 cups whole Bing cherries, stemmed 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 6 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt, preferably gray salt Pinch freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat a gas grill to high or ignite the charcoal. When the grill is hot, clean your grill rack. Decrease the temperature to medium-high (for a gas grill only) and brush or wipe a little oil on the grill rack.<br> Divide the ground beef into two equal portions. Line a 9-inch-round cake tin with plastic wrap. Gently push half the beef into the tin. Don&#39;t press too hard. Place another sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface and invert the tin so the shaped beef patty pops out onto the plastic wrap. Line the cake tin with plastic wrap again. Gently push the remaining half the beef into the tin and keep it in the tin for the moment.<br> Sprinkle the top of each patty with the salt and pepper. Spoon the cheese onto the patty still in the tin. Spread the cheese to cover the meat, but leave about 1/2-inch margin uncovered around the edge. Use the plastic wrap-lining to remove the patty from the tin and flip it onto the non-cheese patty. You want the seasoned sides of the meat facing together, with the cheese sandwiched between. Lightly press the 2 patties together all around the edge. Sprinkle the top of the burger with salt and pepper.<br> Wipe a pizza peel with a little oil and transfer the burger to the grill using the peel. Close the grill lid and cook until the bottom of the patty shows grill marks, 8 to 9 minutes. Spritz a little nonstick spray on top of the burger, then flip and cook, 8 to 9 minutes. Gently transfer the cooked burger to a large platter and let rest, about 15 minutes.<br> Halve the bread straight across horizontally so it forms a bun. If you like, you can toast both halves lightly on the grill. Transfer the burger onto the bottom half of the bread. Spoon on the Grilled Bing Cherry-White Balsamic Sauce and close the burger with the top half of the bread. Slice the burger into 6 wedges, as if you were cutting a pizza, and serve. A fresh grind is just as important. Choose chuck steaks from your butchers and ask them to grind the meat while you wait, the same day you plan to cook them if possible. Even your local supermarket butcher will be happy to do this for you. Summer fruit, when given a quick turn on the grill, gets a smoky, sultry tang that works well with goat cheese on a burger. This also works well as a topping for a turkey burger, chicken breast or a grilled pork chop or pork loin.<br> Dark red Bing cherries are beautiful in this sauce but you can also use a combination of cherries with apricots, peaches or any stone fruit. I like to grill cherries and then pit them; you lose less juice that way. For stone fruit, cut the fruit in half, remove the pit, give the fruit a light rub of olive oil on both sides and then grill, about 2 minutes each side.<br> Preheat a gas grill or charcoal grill to medium-hot heat. A charcoal grill will glow red under gray ash when at this temperature. (Alternatively, grill the cherries in a hot grill pan over high heat on the stove.) Pour the cherries into a fine-mesh grill basket or all-metal strainer, and place the basket over the grill. Cook until bright and smoky, but not charred, about 4 minutes. Give the basket a good shake every 20 to 30 seconds, so the cherries heat through. After 3 minutes, taste a cherry to see if it&#39;s smoky enough. Take the basket off the heat and let the cherries cool, about 5 minutes.<br> Halve the cherries over a bowl, reserving all the cherry juice you can. Discard the pits. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large saucepan or skillet, either on the grill or the stove. When the butter is foaming, add the shallots and stir.

Set aside for about 5 minutes, until the mixture starts to thicken and bubble slightly. (If the mixture does not start to thicken and bubble slightly, the yeast is not working. Check the expiration date on the yeast and start over.) In a large bowl, stir together 1/2 cup sugar, the egg, oil and salt. Mix in the cold water and then the boiling water. Add this to the yeast mixture and stir until well blended. With the machine on low speed, slowly add in 4 cups of flour until incorporated. Knead in the mixer on low speed for about 5 minutes until smooth, adding in the extra 1/2 cup flour or more as needed so the dough isn&#39;t too sticky. Put the dough into a clean large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until doubled in size, about 3 hours. Meanwhile, combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar with the cinnamon in a small bowl. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with about 1 tablespoon of the melted butter using a pastry brush. Punch down the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll it into a rectangle about 20 by 10 inches, with the long edge facing you. Using the pastry brush, spread 1/4 cup of the melted butter over the top of the dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the dough. Roll up the dough, starting with the long edge facing you, into a tight cylinder. Gently squeeze the cylinder to seal it. Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even rounds. Place the rounds, cut-side down, into the prepared baking dish. There will be some space in between the rounds. Brush the tops of the rolls with the remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter. Cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the rolls until golden, 40 to 45 minutes. For the icing: Meanwhile, mix the confectioners&#39; sugar with the milk in a small bowl. When the rolls come out of the oven, drizzle the icing over the hot rolls. Serve while warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62716,&quot;Salvadorian White Corn Cakes with Pork, Beans, and Cheese: Pupusas 1 pound corn flour, ground for tortillas 1 cup water 1/3 cup melted butter 2 tablespoons lard 1 onion, cut into small dice 8 ounces roasted pork, diced 8 ounces queso blanco, grated Salt Instructions: In a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine corn flour, water, and butter.

Drizzle the mustard on a slice of bread. Top with the Smoked Meat and the remaining slice of bread. Cut crosswise and serve with the pickle. Score the brisket 3 to 4 times in a diamond pattern, making sure to cut through the fat. Line a large roasting pan with foil. Place the brisket inside. Combine the allspice, pickling salt, sugar, garlic powder, sodium nitrate and cinnamon in a small bowl. Rub the seasoning mix over the entire brisket so it can soak into the meat. Cover the pan tightly with foil so it is airtight and refrigerate for 5 days. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Roast the brisket, covered, for 6 hours. Remove the foil, scrape off any excess dry rub from the brisket and transfer the meat to a large sheet of foil. Wrap the hot meat tightly and refrigerate for 2 days. Slice the brisket very thin and divide into 6 ounce portions for smoked meat sandwiches. The brisket will keep, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 62736,&quot;Maple Baked Beans 1 pound dry red kidney beans 2 quarts water 1 large yellow onion, cut in eighths 1 bay leaf 6 whole black peppercorns 3/4 cup medium amber pure maple syrup 1/2 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed 1/2 cup ketchup 1 tablespoon Chinese chili paste 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger 1 teaspoon kosher salt 5 ounces thick-cut smoked bacon, cubed Instructions: Place the beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water by 1-inch and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. Drain and rinse the beans and then drain again. Place the beans in large pot with 2 quarts water, the onion, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 50 minutes, or until tender. A good test is to scoop up several beans in a spoon and blow on them: if the skin starts to peel off, they&#39;re done. Drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. In a small saucepan, whisk together the maple syrup, brown sugar, ketchup, chili paste, ginger, salt, and 1 1/2 cups of the cooking liquid, still reserving the remaining liquid. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium heat for 6 minutes. Transfer the beans to a medium Dutch oven or a bean pot. Push half the bacon into the beans and place the rest on the top. Pour the maple syrup sauce over the beans. Place the lid on top and bake for 6 to 8 hours. Check occasionally; if the beans are too dry, add 1/2 cup more of the cooking liquid. If you like, you can remove the lid for the last 30 minutes to thicken the sauce. Discard the bay leaf. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Tempranillo]&quot; 62737,&quot;Maple-Mustard Chicken Thighs 4 large bone-in chicken thighs, skins removed (about 1 1/2 pounds) 2 tablespoons grainy French mustard 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 clove minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram 2 tablespoons maple syrup Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

The pit is shaped similar to an obelisk, so you&#39;ll end up with 2 large pieces and 2 smaller pieces from each mango. Roughly chop the flesh. In a saute pan heat the oil and add the cl flakes. Be careful not to burn the cl, just toast to flavor the oil. Add the onions and sweat until soft. Add the ginger and bell pepper and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Finally add the mango and cook for 1 more minute. In a separate bowl, combine the pineapple juice, vinegar, sugar, and curry powder. Add this mixture to the pan. Stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a bare simmer and reduce for about 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper. Add the raisins and the nuts and transfer to another container over an ice bath.

Rub the mixture all over the chicken, place in a resealable bag or a covered bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. Add the canola oil to a large Dutch oven and heat over medium-high heat. Add the chicken skin-side down in batches and cook until the skin is crispy and brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Using tongs, turn the chicken and continue to cook and turn until the skin is well browned on all sides, about 5 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a large plate and reserve. Add the onion to the chicken drippings in the pot and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, bell pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have released most of their juices, 5 to 7 minutes. Return the chicken to the pot and add the broth, lemon zest, Meyer lemon slices and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the chicken to a cutting board or plate. When cool enough to handle, shred the meat off the bones and return it to the pot. Meanwhile, make the tiritas de totopos (alternatively, you can use store-bought tortilla chips). Add the peanut oil to a small saucepan and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in 4 batches, fry the tortilla strips in 4 batches until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer each batch to a bowl using a slotted spoon or a spider and season with salt, about 1/4 teaspoon per batch, tossing to coat.

Using either the largest holes of a hand-grater or the shredding blade of a food processor, grate the potatoes, onion, and carrot. Place the mixture in a sieve and press to remove as much liquid as possible. Combine the potato mixture in a large bowl with the eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper. Using your hands or a wooden spoon mix well. Stir in 1/2 of the bread crumbs, then add the remainder slowly, stopping when the mixture is just thick enough to hold its shape, but not so loose that it dribbles off a spoon. Pour oil to a depth of 1/4-inch into a large, heavy skillet and heat over medium heat until a tiny drop of the batter sizzles upon contact. Using a 1/3-cup metal measure as a scoop, ladle the batter into the hot oil in the skillet, pressing each mound of batter into a small flat pancake: do not crowd the skillet. Fry the pancakes until nicely browned on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer the pancakes to a platter and keep warm in the oven while you fry the remaining pancakes.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the tequila, cumin, paprika, cayenne, garlic, lime juice and a little canola oil. Add the shrimp and toss well to coat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Take the skewers and thread 4 shrimp per skewer.<br> Heat up a grill, grill pan or flat top. Place the shrimp skewers on the grill and cook until pink, well-marked and nicely charred, 40 to 50 seconds. Remove from the grill and set on a large platter. Add the cilantro and finish by squeezing the lime wedges for some fresh lime juice all over (while the shrimp are warm they will soak up the lime flavor).<br> For the spicy pink mayo: Combine the mayonnaise, Mexican crema, lime juice, agave, chipotle and adobo sauce and some salt in a mixing bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve.<br> For the tacos: Take a large nonstick saute pan (or on a flat grill top) and spray lightly with some nonstick cooking spray. Warm a tortilla for about 30 seconds on both sides, and then lightly coat one side with a sprinkle of Parmesan. Warm through, and then flip so it toasts cheese side down. Allow the cheese to cook and brown about 15 seconds, and then remove from pan. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.<br> To assemble: Place a skewer of shrimp on a doubled-up tortilla (cheese side up) and remove the skewer to leave the shrimp lined up in a row. Top with the diced tomato, iceberg, Cotija cheese, spicy pink mayo, lime and cilantro. Serve with beans. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 62782,&quot;Pommes Chef Anne with Parmesan 3 russet potatoes, scrubbed clean Extra-virgin olive oil, for the pan and potatoes 3/4 cup grated Parmigiano Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Working 1 potato at a time, slice very thinly on a mandoline. It is important to work with purpose here (quickly) because the potatoes will discolor. Do not put the potatoes in water because this will wash the starch off of them. Coat an 8-inch ovenproof nonstick saute pan with olive oil. Starting from the center of the pan, make concentric circles of potato slices. Remember that eventually the bottom will be the top, so it is important for the first circles of potatoes to look pretty. Brush each layer with olive oil and sprinkle every 2nd or 3rd layer liberally with grated Parmigiano and salt. After every layer of potatoes, press the potatoes so they are very compact. Repeat this process with the remaining potatoes. Place the pan over medium heat and cook until the olive oil begins to sizzle and the potatoes begin to brown on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Place a tight-fitting lid on the pan. Drain the excess oil out the side of the pan. THIS STEP IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!! After the excess oil has been drained, completely flip the pan so the cake is turned out onto the bottom of the lid, then slide the cake off the lid back into the pan so the brown side of the cake is now up and the top becomes the bottom. We see now why draining the excess oil is important: if you attempt this without draining the oil, it will drain out on your wrist and burn you. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the cake is fork-tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 62783,&quot;Matcha Icing 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon matcha green tea powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 12 homemade or store-bought shortbread or sugar cookies, optional, for dipping Instructions: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, lemon juice, matcha green tea powder, vanilla and 2 tablespoons water until the mixture is a smooth consistency.

In a large pot, over medium heat, add the tomatoes (our canned tomatoes had basil in them already), and oregano and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the garlic mixture, lower the heat and simmer for 2 to 3 hours. Set aside until ready to use. For the cioppino: In a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the garlic and chili flakes and stir to combine, but do not brown the garlic. Raise the heat to high and add the fish fillets, shrimp, mussels and clams and cook until the mussel and clam shells open. Pour in the marinara sauce and the white wine. Stir in the calamari and crab legs and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Make sure the sauce is not too thick or thin. Transfer the cioppino to a large bowl and garnish with shredded crabmeat, Parmesan and parsley. Serve with a portion with a single slice of fugasa bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 62785,&quot;Cola-Braised Pot Roast 4 1/2 pound boneless chuck roast 3 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons minced garlic 2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary leaves 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 cups beef stock or low-sodium canned beef broth 12 ounces cola soda 2 tablespoons tomato paste 2 1/2 tablespoons flour Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Season the roast well on all sides with 2 teaspoons of the salt and the pepper. On a cutting board combine the remaining salt, minced garlic and rosemary and, using the side of a knife, mash against the board repeatedly to form a paste. Using a small paring knife, make thin slits into the roast on all sides, about 2 inches apart, and fill the holes with the garlic-rosemary paste. Repeat until you have used all of the paste. Heat a Dutch oven over high heat and add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the roast and cook until very well browned on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the beef stock and cola and bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. Add the tomato paste and stir to blend. The liquid should be about 1/2 way up the sides of the roast. Cover the Dutch oven, place in oven, and roast until the meat is fork-tender, about 3 1/2 hours, turning the meat every hour and adding extra water if necessary to keep the liquid level at about 1/3 up the sides of the roast. When the meat is fork-tender, remove the roast from the oven and carefully transfer the roast to a serving platter. Cover loosely to keep warm. Skim off as much of the fat from the surface of the cooking liquid as possible. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the fat in a small bowl and add the flour. Stir to make a smooth paste. Add 1/2 cup of the hot cooking liquid to the bowl and whisk to combine. Slowly whisk this mixture into the hot cooking liquid that remains in the Dutch oven and place over high heat on the stovetop. Cook, whisking frequently, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens. Continue to cook for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and any floury taste is gone. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Serve the roast with the hot gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 62786,&quot;Zucchini Chips Small zucchini 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick Instructions: Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat; coat generously with cooking spray.

Grease three 6-inch cake pans with the butter. Combine the flour, granulated sugar, dry milk and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix well with a whisk until the dry ingredients are combined. While mixing on low with an electric mixer, add the oil, sour cream, vanilla extract and eggs. Lastly, add the instant pudding while simultaneously adding the warm water. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Divide the batter among the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature before moving on. For the buttercream frosting: Beat the butter for a few minutes on medium speed, preferably using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. On slow speed, gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar 1 to 2 cups at a time, allowing each batch of sugar to incorporate with the butter before adding the next. (Use less confectioners&#39; sugar for a slightly more buttery, looser frosting, or more confectioners&#39; sugar for a slightly sweeter, stiffer frosting.) Increase the speed to medium and add the vanilla extract, cream and salt. Beat for an additional 3 minutes. To decorate: Before you start, fill a plastic piping bag with frosting. If you have a multi-opening decorating tip, insert that into the end of the piping bag before adding the frosting. If not, just cut a very small hole at the end of the bag to allow the air to escape as you fill it. Tie the bag with a rubber band to close. Add the leftover frosting to a bowl. Since you will need only 2 of your 3 cakes to start, set 1 cake aside for later. Step 1: Cut 2 of the cakes in half from top to bottom to make 4 half-circles. Leave 2 of the half-circle pieces as is and carve the rounded top off the other 2 pieces using a serrated knife to make them level. Step 2: Set the pieces together on a cake plate cut-sides down with the 2 level pieces in the center and the rounded pieces at each end with the rounded sides facing outward. With a spatula, add a light layer of frosting in between each piece. Step 3: Next, frost the entire cake. Don&#39;t worry about frosting it perfectly, as this layer will be covered up with more frosting later. Place the cake in the fridge to allow the frosting to set for at least 15 minutes. Step 4: While your cake is setting, use a serrated knife to carve off the darker thin exterior layer from the reserved third cake so that the cake is an even lighter color all around. Put the cake in a bowl and mix with a fork until it turns into fine crumbs. Add 2 to 3 large spoonfuls of frosting to the crumbs and continue to mix. Make sure you add enough frosting so that the mixture is pliable and able to be molded without crumbling. To test this, form a ball with the mixture in your hands. If it cracks, you need to add more frosting. Step 5: With your hands, mold the following: 1 large, rounded oval shape (the head), 2 small, pointed oval pieces (the ears) and 4 small oval pieces (the legs). Step 6: Attach the leg pieces to the body of the lamb, 2 at the front and 1 at each side. Use a small dab of frosting to secure the pieces in place. Next, add a dollop of frosting to the back of the head and place it atop the cake, positioning the head at an angle. Add 2 toothpicks to the head piece to help hold it in place. Add a small dab of frosting on each side of the head for the ear pieces. If your head doesn&#39;t feel stable atop the body, add a thin layer of frosting around the side of the head for extra reinforcement. Place the cake back in the fridge for at least 10 minutes to allow the molded pieces to set into the frosting. Step 7: Next, pipe the frosting for the hair onto the cake, covering the body of the lamb and adding frosting around the top of the head. Use short, quick motions to pipe 1/4-inch-long sections of frosting onto the cake. You want your frosting to be semi-stiff. If the frosting becomes too warm, it can start to appear a bit runny. If this happens, just place your piping bag back in the fridge for a few minutes to allow it to cool. Step 8: Use a toothpick to add facial details. Use a black edible marker or 2 small black candies for the eyes. If you have it, use just a touch of edible pink luster dust for the cheeks and any other accents you&#39;d like. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62797,&quot;Muffaletta 1 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup sherry vinegar 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon honey 1 red onion, diced 2 cups each pitted picholine and cerignola olives, coarsely chopped 1 cup roughly chopped piquillo peppers 1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves roughly chopped 1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano leaves Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 muffaletta or small round Italian loaf 2 ounces each thinly sliced Genoa salami, hot soppresata, Salchicon de vic or other dry salami, and serrano ham 2 ounces thinly sliced aged Manchego cheese Instructions: Whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard and honey in a large bowl. Add the onion, olives, peppers, parsley and oregano; toss, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Slice the bread in half and pull some of interior from the top half.

Whisk the sugar and cocoa together in a medium saucepan. Whisk in the milk until smooth. Set the pot over medium heat, stirring to keep the mixture smooth, and bring to boil. Continue to boil, stirring the edges to keep from burning, until the mixture reaches 220 degrees F, about 60 seconds. (The mixture should be thick, smooth and glossy, not crystallized.) Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla and salt, beating until smooth. Add the peanut butter and stir in, leaving pockets of peanut buttery goodness intact if desired. Let cool until warm but still stirrable, about 5 minutes. (You want the mixture to be soft enough that you can stir in the walnuts and marshmallows, but not so hot that the marshmallows melt entirely.) Stir in the marshmallows and walnuts. Spread the mixture in the prepared pan and add the flakey salt and sprinkles. Let cool completely, about 1 hour. Cut into squares to serve. (To store, refrigerate in a covered container with parchment between the layers.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 62800,&quot;The World-Famous Tarte Tatin Plain flour, for dusting 18 ounces/500 g puff pastry, if frozen, thawed 5 small eating apples (approximately 28 ounces (1 3/4 pounds)/800 g), a mixture of sweet and acidic varieties 3 1/2 ounces/100 g golden caster sugar 3 1/2 fluid ounces/100 ml Calvados (apple-flavored brandy) 1 vanilla pod, halved lengthways, seeds scraped out 1 1/2 tablespoons/50 g butter, cubed Instructions: Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F/190 degrees C/gas 5. Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour and roll out your puff pastry until it&#39;s just over 1/4-inch/0.5cm thick. This will be enough to cover the ovenproof frying pan you&#39;ll be cooking the tarte Tatin in, leaving about 2 inches/5 cm extra around the edge. Put the pastry to one side for now. Peel your apples, then halve them horizontally and use a teaspoon to get rid of the seeds and core. Put the ovenproof pan on a medium heat and add the sugar, Calvados, vanilla seeds, and pod. Let the sugar dissolve and cook until the mixture forms a light caramel. Once the caramel looks and smells delicious - it should be a lovely chestnut brown - add your halved apples. Carefully stir everything in the pan and cook for about 5 minutes or until the apples start to soften and you get a toffee apple vibe happening. Add the cubed butter, then lay the pastry over the top. Quickly and carefully tuck the pastry down right into the edges - it&#39;s best to use a wooden spoon so you don&#39;t touch the caramel. Bake the tarte Tatin for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden, with crispy caramelly pieces bubbling up from under the edges. Take it out of the oven. To make it look like a tarte Tatin you need to turn it out, which isn&#39;t hard - but you do need to be careful with that hot caramel. So get a serving plate or board larger than your pan and put an oven glove on to protect the arm holding the board. Put the board or plate on top of the pan, then quickly, carefully and confidently turn it out (remember you can go to www.jamieoliver.com/how-to and see a video of how to do this safely). Put it to one side for a few minutes, so the caramel can cool down, then divide it up and serve with a spoonful of creme fraiche or ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 62801,&quot;Shrimp Caesar Pasta Salad Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 teaspoon finely grated garlic 8 ounces dried penne 1 tablespoon olive oil 8 ounces peeled, deveined medium shrimp 1 1/2 cups shredded romaine lettuce 1/4 cup finely chopped celery 2 medium vine-ripened tomatoes, chopped Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Let stand for 3 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture and the cool water. Using your fingers, mix the dough into a sticky mass. When all of the flour is incorporated, move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for 4 minutes. The dough should be sticky and will not look smooth. If the dough feels stiff or dry, knead in additional cool water, a tablespoon at a time. Put the dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover, and let rest for 20 minutes. Return the dough to the lightly floured surface and knead it for 7 to 8 minutes. The dough will go from being sticky to smooth and will become supple but not too firm. Place the dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not spring back.) Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough and pat it into a rectangle. The short sides should be the top and bottom edges. Fold the top edge down and the bottom edge up, overlapping them slightly, then turn the dough a quarter turn and fold the top down and the bottom up again to form an envelope. Shape the dough into a log shape by rolling the loaf down two to three times and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Roll the loaf back and forth on the table to smooth out. Place the loaf seam side down in a lightly oiled 9 by 5 inch loaf pan. Gently press down on the loaf to spread it to fill the corners of the pan, and cover it with oiled plastic wrap. Let the loaf rise at 75 degrees to 77 degrees for about 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until it has doubled and risen about 1-inch above the edge of the pan. Meanwhile preheat oven to 425 degrees. Gently place the loaf pan on the center rack of the oven. Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaf with water 6 to 8 times, then shut the oven door. After 3 minutes, mist the loaf again. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees and bake for 30 minutes longer, or until the top is a deep golden brown. Remove the loaf from the pan it should come out with ease. The bread should sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom, and the sides of the loaf should be brown. Immediately place the loaf from the pan on a wire rack to cool. Serve slightly warm, with butter and lots of homemade jam! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 62862,&quot;Chicken Tarragon Salad 1/2 cup non-fat mayonnaise (recommended: Best Foods) 1/4 cup non-fat plain yogurt (recommended: Horizon) 1 teaspoon poppy seeds (recommended: McCormick) 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh tarragon leaves 2 (7-ounce) cans cooked chunk chicken breast meat, rinsed and drained (recommended: Tyson) 1 cup red seedless grapes, cut in 1/2 2 ribs celery, chopped 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and/or pecans (recommended: Planters) 6 cups spring mix lettuce (recommended: Ready Pac) Instructions: In a small mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, yogurt, poppy seeds, and tarragon to make dressing; set aside.

Pour a glug of olive oil into a casserole type pan and put it on the heat. Add the onion, carrots, rutabaga, rosemary, thyme and bay leaves and cook gently for 10 minutes. Stir in the meat and the flour, pour in the wine and add a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Pour in the stock, there should be enough to just cover the meat. Bring to a gentle boil, put a lid on and place in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, until the meat falls apart easily. When the stew looks good, bring a very large pan of salted water to the boil and stir in the pappardelle. Cook according to the package instructions. While the pasta&#39;s cooking, you can get your ragu sauce rockin&#39; and rollin&#39;! Remove the bay leaves from the sauce and add the butter to it. Beat in half the Parmesan and half the orange zest, just a hint will make all the difference. Place the lid on top. Pick and chop your parsley leaves now, you want them to be nice and fresh, with as much color and flavor as possible, so don&#39;t do this any earlier. Drain the pasta in a colander, reserving some of the cooking water. Get everyone around the table, then toss the pasta with the sauce and the chopped parsley (you may have to do this in batches), adding some of the reserved cooking water if need be, to make the sauce silky and loose - very important for good texture.

Lay the turkey flat on a rimmed baking sheet, skin-side down, and then pat it dry with paper towels. Generously sprinkle the inside of the turkey with half of the seasoning mixture, being sure the hit the thick parts a bit heavier than the thin parts. Flip the turkey and sprinkle the skin side with the remaining seasoning. Cover the turkey with a piece of loose parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Rest the turkey at room temperature for 30 minutes before roasting. On a clean, rimmed baking sheet, scatter the thyme sprigs, celery, carrots, rosemary and onions. Pat the turkey dry one more time and place on the bed of vegetables skin-side up. Tuck the wings under the shoulders. Mix together the truffle butter and oil in a small bowl. Pour the butter mixture over the bird and brush evenly on the skin. Roast until an instant-read thermometer reads 155 degrees F in both the thigh and the thickest part of the breast, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Place the turkey on a cutting board to rest for 20 minutes before carving. Strain any juices from the bottom of the baking sheet and skim off any fat that may rise to the surface. Carve the turkey. For the gravy: In a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat, heat the chicken broth, thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. In a small bowl, whisk the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water until smooth and no lumps remain. Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering broth. Continue to whisk until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the reserved turkey drippings, the kosher salt and truffle salt. Remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaf and serve the gravy with the carved turkey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62867,&quot;Chocolate Coconut Truffles 2 pounds highquality semisweet chocolate, preferably Belgian or French 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 stick (8 tablespoons) softened unsalted butter, cut into chunks 1 teaspoon vanilla 3/4 cup shredded coconut, toasted in an oven for 2 to 3 minutes Instructions: Melt 1 pound of chocolate, slowly stirring, in a double boiler. Warm the cream in a large saucepan but do not scorch. Remove the chocolate from the heat, cool slightly, then combine with the heavy cream. Stir the butter into the chocolate cream mixture and refrigerate until firm but still pliable, about 20 minutes. Transfer the chocolate to a pastry bag fitted with a large straight tip and pipe into teaspoonsize mounds onto a waxed paper covered cookie sheet, or use a spoon to dole out teaspoonsize mounds. Refrigerate the entire pan until the chocolate is hard to the touch. When the chocolate is sufficiently firm (this can be done a day or 2 ahead) remove the chocolate from the refrigerator and, working quickly to prevent melting, roll the chocolate mounds into balls, then chill the balls again until firm. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, pulse the coconut briefly to make it a little finer so that it will adhere better to the truffles. When firm, roll each truffle in the coconut, pressing firmly to make sure the coconut sticks. At this point you can refrigerate the truffles for as much as a day, until you are ready to dip them. Melt the remaining chocolate in the double boiler. Remove the double boiler from the heat and using a wire dipping spoon, or a regular teaspoon and your hands in latex gloves, dip each coconut covered truffle briefly into the melted chocolate. Place on a cake rack set over a cookie sheet until dry, and refrigerate until firm. You may scrape up any chocolate that has dripped on the cookie sheet and return it to the dipping pot for more dipping. The truffles will keep for several weeks if refrigerated in a covered container. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 62868,&quot;Strawberry and Mango Guacamole 3 ripe Hass avocados 2 limes, juiced<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1/2 cup fresh strawberries, diced small<br> 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, minced<br> 2 tablespoons minced red onions 1/4 teaspoon cumin<br> 1 ripe mango, peeled and diced<br> 1 jalapeno, diced (ribs and seeds removed to your liking)<br> Instructions: Scoop the flesh of 2 of the avocados into a bowl and mash with a fork. Stir in the lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Dice the remaining avocado. Stir it into the mashed avocado along with the strawberries, cilantro, onions, cumin, mangos and jalapenos. Season again with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Ros]&quot; 62869,&quot;Mushroom Empanadas 1/2 cup canola oil, plus more for oiling the sheet pan 1 pound chopped onions<br> 1 1/2 pounds mushrooms, sliced<br> 1 tablespoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 2 teaspoons minced garlic 7 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella<br> Empanada Dough, recipe follows Egg yolk for glazing, optional 3 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 6 ounces unsalted butter<br> 1 egg<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives Instructions: Add the canola oil to a pan and heat on medium heat until hot. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms, salt and pepper. Cook until mushrooms are tender, then add garlic. Cook, stirring well, for 1 minute, then remove from heat. Strain the mixture and let it cool. Add parsley and mozzarella. Use a tablespoon to drop a generous portion of filling in the center of a dough disc and fold so that it looks like a half-moon. Make sure the edges are completely sealed to prevent the filling from coming out while baking. (This is very important because the cheese will otherwise run out of the empanada.) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place empanadas on a lightly oiled sheet pan; brush with egg yolk if using, Bake until dough is nicely browned, about 15 minutes. Make sure to put them on a beautiful plate and enjoy with a glass of wine or a beer. Oh, and eat them with your hands, with friends and family\\u2014the way empanadas are meant to be enjoyed! Making the dough can be done by hand but it is easier in a mixer with a dough attachment. Mix the flour and salt in a mixer until well combined, about 1 minute. Add the butter and mix until blended, another 2 minutes. Add the egg and 1/4 to 1/2 cup water, adding gradually, and continue mixing until slightly rough to the touch. Make the dough into a ball and finish kneading by hand until soft and smooth. Wrap in plastic wrap and put in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Unwrap the dough and roll out with a rolling pin until thin, but not too thin, so it doesn&#39;t break when folding. Create discs with a 5-inch cutter for large empanadas or a 3-inch cutter for small ones. If not using immediately, use wax or parchment paper to separate a stack and refrigerate or freeze to use later. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 62870,&quot;Spinach and Egg Sandwiches 4 plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 English muffins, split 2 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 shallot or 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced 1/4 pound sliced Canadian bacon, cut into thin strips 8 cups baby spinach (about 8 ounces)<br> 4 large eggs 1/3 cup shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a saute pan, heat some of the olive oil until smoking and sear the beef until browned all over. Transfer to oven and cook until medium rare, (120-degree internal temperature) about 12 to 15 minutes. Set aside and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Season mixed greens with the two tablespoons of olive oil and salt and pepper. Divide evenly onto 4 plates. Cut the tenderloin into 1/2-inch thick slices and place slices on top of mixed greens. Spoon half of the tomato salsa over the beef (don&#39;t cover completely) and serve remaining salsa on the side. Serve with Potato Cheese Galette. Over a hot grill, roast the tomatoes until blackened. Transfer to a bowl and add the chipotles. Cover and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Add the basil, garlic and lime juice and marinate for 10 minutes. Transfer to a blender or food processor and pulse until chunky. Transfer to a bowl and add the vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of olive oil. Reserve. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place the potato slices in a double layer in a medium bowl, pour the clarified butter over, and toss to coat the slices. Season lightly with salt. Arrange half the potatoes, flower fashion, in a 9-inch ovenproof skillet. Cook over medium heat until the ends begin to brown and the potatoes stick together. (This will keep the cheeses from running through.) Sprinkle with the cheeses and cover with the remaining potatoes, arranged the same way as the bottom layer. Set in the oven for 10 minutes, carefully flip potatoes with a wide spatula, and brown on a medium-high flame. Return to the oven for 5 minutes longer. Cut into 4 quarters and keep warm. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 62875,&quot;Cilantro Pesto 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 packed cup coarsely chopped cilantro (stems and all) 1 packed cup flat-leaf parsley 1/4 cup marcona almonds or blanched almonds 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar Kosher or fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: This is particularly good with shrimp skewers or short ribs, but it would be at home with any simple fish steak or fish fillet off the grill. I went with a straightforward white wine vinegar here, but you can fine tune this to your own taste by using sherry vinegar, lemon and/or lime juice, or balsamic vinegar. Pour the oil into a blender jar. Add the cilantro, parsley, almonds, and vinegar and blend until the herbs are finely chopped and the mixture is fairly smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. The pesto can be made up to a day in advance. Scrape into a storage container and press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent the pesto from turning dark. Refrigerate until ready to use. Bring the pesto to room temperature before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 62876,&quot;Double Chocolate Chip Muffins 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips 3/4 cup milk 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the chocolate chips. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, brown sugar, butter, oil, vanilla and eggs until smooth. Quickly fold the milk mixture into the flour mixture with a rubber spatula. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Transfer the muffins from the pan to a wire rack to cool.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 62877,&quot;Old Fashioned Sugar Cookies 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter 1 cup granulated sugar 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon vanilla 3 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt Colored sugar and milk, for decorating, or Royal Icing, recipe follows 2 pounds confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons meringue powder (egg white powder) Food coloring, as desired Instructions: Cream the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a second large bowl and mix well. Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture 1 cup at a time. Chill the dough for 3 to 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment. Roll out the dough and cut it into shapes with cookie cutters or a knife. Place the shapes on the prepared cookie sheet. If decorating with colored sugar, brush the cookies with milk and sprinkle with colored sugar (if using royal icing, leave unfinished). Bake until the cookies are just beginning to brown around the edges, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the cookies. Remove the cookies to a rack to cool completely. If using royal icing, decorate the cookies as desired. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and 3/4 cup water in a large bowl. Mix slowly with an electric mixer until stiff enough to form peaks; the icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is over-beaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, and then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting. Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. Gels are best with royal icing. You don&#39;t want to thin them with liquid colors. Be careful of adding too much color, which reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days. Store the icing at room temperature, covered, with plastic wrap on the surface. Yield: 3 1/2 cups icing &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 62878,&quot;Lobster Wrap 1 (8-ounce) container chopped lobster meat 1 cup finely chopped tomato 1 avocado, peeled and diced 1/2 cup cilantro-pepita Caesar dressing Pinch salt and pepper 1/2 lemon, juiced Whole chives 2 (12-inch) flour tortillas Freshly chopped lettuce Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine lobster, tomato, avocado and Caesar dressing.

Add the strawberry puree to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the puree reduces by half (to about 1 cup). Transfer the puree to a bowl and set aside to cool. For the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat two 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick baking spray. Line the bottoms with parchment rounds; lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a large bowl until combined. Beat the butter, granulated sugar, oil and vanilla in another bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the whole eggs and yolks one at a time, beating to blend between additions and occasionally scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl, until the batter is completely combined, smooth and creamy. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Fold in 1/2 cup of the cooled strawberry puree. Reserve the rest of the puree for the frosting.<br> Scrape the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Smooth the tops. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the cakes are a light golden brown and a tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer the pans to a wire rack and let the cakes cool for 30 minutes. Run a knife around the sides of the cakes and invert onto the wire rack. Remove the parchment and let the cakes cool completely.\\u202f For the frosting: Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy. Gradually beat in the butter, beating until smooth. Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into the bowl and beat until smooth. Add the vanilla and beat until light and fluffy. Remove 3 cups of the frosting to a medium bowl and set aside. Fold the reserved strawberry puree into the remaining frosting. Refrigerate both until slightly chilled and firm, about 20 minutes. To assemble the cake: Place one cake domed-side down on a platter. Spread 1 1/2\\u202fcups of the strawberry frosting evenly over the top. Place the remaining cake domed-side up on top. Spread the top and sides of the cake with 1 1/2 cups of the white frosting. Smooth out completely to make an even crumb coat. (It&#39;s okay if some of the cake shows through. This is just a base layer.) Refrigerate for 30 minutes to let the frosting set.<br> Spread the remaining white frosting on the top of the cake and the upper half of the sides. There should be a band all around the bottom of the cake with the crumb coat exposed. Fill in the exposed area with 1 cup of the strawberry frosting. Use a large offset spatula to smooth the top and sides of the cake. The strawberry and white frostings should blend together during smoothing to create an ombre effect. Transfer the remaining strawberry frosting to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag fitted with a medium star tip.

Bring to a boil and cook until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Remove from the heat and strain into a small bowl, discarding the solids. Preheat the grill to high. Brush the radicchio with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill cut side down until golden brown and slightly charred, 2 to 3 minutes per side. The radicchio should not be cooked all the way through, but retain some bite. Remove from the grill, thinly slice and put in a bowl. Remove the kale from the water and shake gently to get some of the water off (any excess water will help it steam while grilling). Season with salt and pepper and place on the grill. Grill until slightly wilted and charred on all sides, about 1 minute per side. Remove, thinly slice and add to the radicchio. Add some of the vinegar mixture and toss to coat. Toss again with olive oil, salt and pepper. Taste, and add more vinegar if desired. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 62933,&quot;Araya&#39;s Place Tom Yum Soup 3 cups vegetable broth 5 kaffir lime leaves 3 slices unpeeled galangal, about 2 inches long 3 slices lemongrass, about 2 inches long 1 cup sliced button mushrooms 2 tablespoons thin soy sauce 10 Thai cl peppers, pounded with the edge of a knife or cooking mallet to release the flavor 1 lime, juiced 1 medium tomato, sliced 1/2 onion, sliced 8 medium-size cubes tofu, optional (your favorite brand) Dash chopped cilantro Dash chopped green onions Instructions: In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable broth to a boil.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt and add to the skillet in a single even layer. Cook until golden and crispy on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip with a heatproof spatula and drizzle 2 more tablespoons oil around the edge of the skillet, giving the skillet a good shake once all the oil is in. (This allows you to use less oil while still getting a crispy potato cake.) Continue cooking until golden and crispy on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, spread 4 tortillas out on a clean work surface and put 1/2 cup cheese in the middle of each. Using the spatula, break the potato cake into 4 pieces and place on top of the cheese. Wipe the skillet out, return to the heat and add 1 tablespoon oil, then the onion and poblanos. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted and golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the spinach and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in the eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggs are just set but still moist, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide the egg mixture evenly among the tortillas and wipe out the skillet. Return the skillet to the heat and reduce it to medium-low. Fold the sides of each tortilla in, then roll each one up into a burrito. Brush the burritos all over with the remaining tablespoon oil and put them in the skillet seam-side down. Cook until golden and crispy, about 4 minutes, then flip and repeat on the opposite side. Serve with sour cream and hot sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 62935,&quot;Roasted Italian Cauliflower 1 small head cauliflower, cut into medium-size florets (about 4 cups) 1/2 cup grape tomatoes, halved 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon drained capers Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1/4 lemon 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Adjust an oven rack to the top position and preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.

Transfer to a large bowl and soak in tepid water for 30 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and the 2 teaspoons salt. Pour in the beer and whisk to form a smooth batter. Set aside. Pat the fish very dry. Cut the fish lengthwise into 1 by 3-inch strips. Pour enough oil into a tall heavy-bottomed pot so it comes about a third of the way up the sides. Heat the oil over medium heat until a deep frying thermometer inserted in the oil registers 360 degrees F. While the oil heats, drain and spin the potatoes dry in a salad spinner. Spread them out on a pan and pat completely dry with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Working in small batches, fry the potatoes until golden brown, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the chips to a paper towel-lined pan to drain. Season with fine salt to taste. (Make sure to let the oil come back to 360 degrees before frying each batch.) Transfer the potatoes to the oven to keep warm. Season the fish with the salt and pepper. Working in batches, dip the fish strips in the batter to coat evenly. Carefully add to the oil. Fry the fish, turning once, until golden and crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined pan to drain. Keep the fish warm on a heatproof platter in the oven while you fry the remaining fish. (Just like with the potatoes, make sure the oil returns to temperature before adding more fish.) Serve the fish with the chips and malt vinegar and/or tartar sauce. In a small mixing bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, capers, cornichons, parsley, lemon juice, tarragon, lemon zest, hot sauce, and scallion. Refrigerate for 30 minutes for the flavors to come together.

Add the pork fat and cook just until the edges turn translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and drain the pork on paper towels. Coarsely chop the fat and set aside. If using egg white, start with step 2. Heat the oil in a small saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and shallots and saute until slightly wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer onion mixture (not the juice) to a bowl and add the fish sauce, salt, sugar, garlic, white pepper, cornstarch, baking powder, and pork fat. Add the shrimp and toss well. Transfer the shrimp mixture to a food processor and process until almost smooth but still lumpy. Transfer the paste to a bowl, scraping the work bowl clean. Stir in the scallions. (If the paste is not cold, refrigerate at this point to stiffen it.) Quarter the sugarcane pieces lengthwise, or halve them if they&#39;re small. Wet your hands with cold water. Place 2 tablespoons of the shrimp paste in the middle of your palm. Place a piece of the sugarcane on top and mold the paste around it. (The paste should be about 1/4 inch thick and about 2 1/2 inches long). Gently press the paste against the stick so that the edges are sealed. Set the shrimp stick aside on an oiled plate. Repeat with the remaining sugarcane and paste. Oil a steamer basket and place the sugarcane sticks in a single layer. (If necessary, steam in several batches.) Steam until the shrimp paste turns pink, 2 to 3 minutes. You can make this dish in advance up to this point. To finish, grill or broil the shrimp sticks until the paste is hot inside and slightly charred around the edges. Serve immediately with some lettuces, mustard leaves, and herbs, rice vermicelli and dipping sauce. Cut the chiles into thin rings. Remove one-third of the chiles and set aside for garnish. Place the remaining chiles, garlic, and sugar into a mortar and pound into a coarse, wet paste. Transfer to a small bowl and add the water, lime juice, and fish sauce. Stir well to dissolve. Add the reserved chiles and carrots.

Pour into a small serving bowl and top with the sliced cl. Set aside to let the flavors blend. Meanwhile, make the flatbread: Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the sesame seeds. Cook, stirring, until toasted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and reserve the skillet. Add the scallions and remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil to the bowl and set aside. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface until it is about 1/8-inch thick. Sprinkle with the scallion mixture and salt and fold in half like a book. Press the halves together with your fingers and then roll the dough out again until it is 1/8-inch thick. Cut the dough into 6 equal pieces. Stretch and roll each piece until very thin, pinching the edges together to keep the filling from spilling out. When the dough is thin enough, you should be able to see the filling through the dough. The pieces should be 7 to 8 inches in diameter, although they need not be perfectly round.<br> Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the canola oil over medium-high heat in the same skillet. When very hot, add a piece of the dough and cook, turning once, until it is puffed and cooked through and has some charred spots, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough, adding more canola oil as needed to just lightly coat the bottom of the skillet and reducing the heat if the dough starts to burn before it cooks through. Cut the flatbreads into pieces and serve with the dip and cooked shrimp. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 62946,&quot;Jasmine Tea Ganache 10 ounces heavy cream 1-ounce light corn syrup 1 1/4 ounces jasmine tea 9 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 4 1/2 ounces milk chocolate chopped 1/4-ounce rum Instructions: Chop the chocolate into small pieces approximately 3/8-inch.

Place the walnuts on a baking sheet in a single layer and toast until golden brown and fragrant, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool slightly and chop. Put in a shallow dish with the bacon and mix together. Set aside. For the apple cider glaze: In a small saucepot, add the apple cider, brown sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon and a squeeze of lemon juice. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer until syrupy and reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Put the confectioners&#39; sugar in a bowl and slowly pour in 1/4 cup of the glaze, a little at a time. Whisk together until smooth. To top the doughnuts: Gently dip the top of each plain doughnut into the glaze and let any excess drip back into the bowl. Next, lightly dip the glazed tops into the chopped walnuts and bacon. Place on a wire rack to let set. Bring the milk to a simmer in a 1-quart heavy saucepan, then remove from the heat and stir in the sugar and salt. Pour into a large bowl and let cool slightly. While the milk is cooling, dissolve the yeast in 2 tablespoons warm water in a small bowl, stirring. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir the yeast mixture into the milk mixture along with the oil, lemon zest and eggs. Stir in 2 1/2 cups of the flour with a wooden spoon to make a very soft dough. Spread 1 cup of the flour on a work surface and put the dough on top, scraping it from the bowl with a rubber spatula. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, incorporating all of the flour from the work surface and adding just enough additional flour (if necessary); the dough should be slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to an oiled large bowl and sprinkle lightly with additional flour. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll out with a floured rolling pin until 1 inch thick. Cut out rounds with a 2-inch cutter. To make ring shapes, cut out doughnut holes with a 1-inch cutter. Place on a baking sheet, cover the doughnuts with another kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. While the doughnuts rise, heat about 10 cups vegetable oil in a deep 4-quart pot until it registers 365 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Fry the doughnuts 2 at a time, turning once or twice, until puffed and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch.

Cover and set over high heat. Bring to a boil, decrease the heat to low and cook, at a low simmer for 2 1/2 hours. After 2 1/2 hours add the carrots, onions, potatoes and celery. Return to a simmer and cook uncovered for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, add the cabbage and cook for an additional 15 to 20 minutes until the potatoes and cabbage are tender. Remove the bay leaves and serve immediately. Place the water into a large 6 to 8 quart stockpot along with salt, sugar, saltpeter, cinnamon stick, mustard seeds, peppercorns, cloves, allspice, juniper berries, bay leaves and ginger. Cook over high heat until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the ice. Stir until the ice has melted. If necessary, place the brine into the refrigerator until it reaches a temperature of 45 degrees F. Once it has cooled, place the brisket in a 2-gallon zip top bag and add the brine. Seal and lay flat inside a container, cover and place in the refrigerator for 10 days. Check daily to make sure the beef is completely submerged and stir the brine. After 10 days, remove from the brine and rinse well under cool water. Place the brisket into a pot just large enough to hold the meat, add the onion, carrot and celery and cover with water by 1-inch. Set over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and gently simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until the meat is fork tender. Remove from the pot and thinly slice across the grain. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 62952,&quot;Miniature Peanut Butter and Jelly Pies 3 cups whole milk 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup cornstarch 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 3 large egg yolks, beaten 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter 12 miniature graham cracker pie crusts, such as Keebler 3/4 cup of your favorite fruit jelly 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup roughly chopped roasted peanuts Instructions: Heat 2 3/4 cups of the milk in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot but not boiling. Whisk the granulated sugar, cornstarch and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and the remaining 1/4 cup milk. Whisk half of the hot milk into the egg mixture until smooth, and then gradually whisk the egg mixture into the heated milk. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the peanut butter until melted. Transfer to a bowl and cool slightly, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming. Meanwhile, place the pie crusts on a baking sheet or large platter. Place 2 teaspoons of the fruit jelly on the bottom of each pie crust. Smooth out slightly with the back of a spoon or a small offset spatula. Evenly divide the slightly cooled pudding among the pie crusts. Use the back of a spoon or a small offset spatula to spread the pudding to the edges of the pie crusts. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of each pie and chill until set, at least 4 hours. Whip the heavy cream and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer to medium to stiff peaks. Refrigerate until ready to use. To assemble, whisk the remaining fruit jelly with 2 teaspoons water until smooth. Place a dollop of whipped cream on top of each pie, using the back of a spoon to create a small well in the center of the whipped cream. Spoon a small amount of jelly into the well and garnish with some roasted peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 62953,&quot;Couscous with Green Peas, Mint and Coriander 1 cup couscous 1/2 cup frozen green peas 1 teaspoon ground coriander 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves Salt and ground black pepper Instructions: Cook couscous according to package directions, adding peas and coriander when you add couscous to hot water.

Pulse them together until the flour is fluffy and aerated. Add the butter. Pulse ten times. The flour and butter should look like a sandy mixture with chunks of butter still visible. Pour in 1/2 cup of the water. Pulse five times. The dough should look moistened but not wet, and gathering but not collected into a ball. If there are any dry patches of flour remaining, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. The final dough should look a bit like cheese curds. Form the dough into discs: Dump the curds of dough onto a clean, cool surface. (A piece of parchment paper works well here.) Gather them loosely into a pile. Put the heel of your hand on the top portion of the pile and press down and away from you. Repeat this with the entire pile until you have a smooth pie dough. Cut the pie dough into half. Take one half and press the dough onto itself, as though you are closing the page of a book; repeat with the other side. Form the pie dough into a smooth disc and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the other half of the dough. Let the discs of dough rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Roll out the dough: Take the pie dough disks out of the refrigerator and let them sit out until they have come to a chilly room temperature, about 15 minutes or so. Put one disc of dough between two lightly greased pieces of parchment paper. Pat down the disk and put the rolling pin on top of it. Now, imagine that the dough is the face of a clock. Roll out once at 12 o&#39;clock. Then, lift the pin and roll at 12:10. Moving in \\ten-minute\\ increments, roll out the dough to slightly larger than your pie pan. Lift the top paper, put a 9-inch pie pan on top of the pie dough, and flip it over. Carefully, strip away the parchment paper. Go slowly. Voila! Pat the dough down into the pan. If some of the pie dough has stuck onto the parchment, no need to worry. Simply peel it off and pat into the rest of the pie dough. Roll out the second disc of pie dough in a similar fashion. Put the pie pan and the top piece of dough in the freezer while you make the chicken filling. Sear the chicken: Set a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil. Put half of the chicken into the hot oil. Let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then stir it up and cook until it is evenly browned. Remove the cooked chicken from the oil and repeat with the remaining chicken. Cook the vegetables: Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in the Dutch oven. Add the mushrooms, carrot, onion and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is soft and translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the thyme and cook until it is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the potato.<br> Make the gravy: Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in the chicken stock, stirring it into the vegetables. Bring the stock to a boil and then turn the heat down to simmer. Simmer the stock, stirring occasionally, until it begins to thicken, about 15 minutes. Finish the filling: Add the asparagus and edamame to the vegetable mixture. Stir until they are fully incorporated. Taste the filling and season with salt and pepper if needed. Fill the pie: Let the filling cool to room temperature. Pour it into the prepared pie pan. Allow the remaining piece of pie dough too come to a chilly room temperature. Top the pie: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Flip the pie dough on top of the pie. If the dough sticks and breaks, just pat the pieces together. Working with slightly wet fingers, crimp the edges of the pie dough together. Bake the pie: Put the pot pie onto a parchment-lined sheet pan to catch the drippings during baking. Bake the pot pie until the crust is golden brown and the filling is piping hot and starting to ooze out of the pie crust, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool the pie: Allow the pie to cool to room temperature. Serve! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 62955,&quot;Puttanesca with Angel Hair Pasta Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 ounces dry angel hair pasta 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for tossing the pasta One 28-ounce can whole plum tomatoes 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 4 anchovy fillets 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/2 cup roughly chopped pitted black olives 3 tablespoons drained jarred capers 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves Grated Parmesan, for serving Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package directions for al dente. Drain, toss with some oil and keep warm. Drain the tomatoes into a large bowl and reserve the juice. Roughly crush the tomatoes with your hands. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic, anchovies and cl flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is lightly golden, about 3 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes and a generous pinch each of salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are soft and begin to lose their shape, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the olives, capers and reserved tomato juice. Continue to simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly and the flavors have blended, about 10 minutes more. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet along with the parsley and remaining 1 tablespoon oil and toss well.

Set a wire cooling rack inside a sheet pan. Remove the steak from the fridge and bring to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Mix together the garlic powder, onion powder, salt and cayenne in a small bowl. Sprinkle the entire steak with the rub on both sides, adding more salt if necessary. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a large cast-iron skillet and heat over medium high. When the skillet is lightly smoking, sear the steak until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. While searing, use a spoon to baste the steak with the oil from the pan. Turn off the heat and place the garlic halves cut-side down in the skillet and sprinkle the thyme sprigs around the steak. Transfer the skillet to the oven to finish cooking until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F when measured with an instant-read thermometer not touching bone, about 8 minutes. Remove the steak and garlic halves to the cooling rack to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the potatoes and remaining 4 garlic cloves to a boil in a medium pot of heavily salted water. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are fork tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the empty pot. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and coat with olive oil. Add the shallots and sweat until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Continue cooking, tossing occasionally to ensure that the mushrooms do not stick to the skillet, until the mushrooms are tender and browned, about 10 minutes. Add the red wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in the demi-glace and reduce until the mixture is thick, saucy and coats the back of a spoon, about 4 minutes. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the potatoes until smooth. Add 2 pats of butter and a splash of the hot heavy cream. Continue mixing. Repeat, adding more butter and cream 2 more times and finishing with a pinch of salt. Cut the bone off the steak and slice the meat on the bias, keeping the slices together (reserve the bone). Fan the steak slices on a serving plate and garnish with the bone and the roasted garlic halves. Spoon the mushroom sauce around the edge of the steak and garnish the steak with chives. Serve with a small ramekin of extra sauce. Serve the mashed potatoes in a separate bowl garnished with a small pat of butter and more chives.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 62957,&quot;Chicken Wing Skewers 2 to 2 1/2 pounds chicken wings (about 12 wings) 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br> 2 teaspoons fresh orange zest<br> 1 teaspoon ground fennel seeds<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground white peppercorns<br> Honey Glaze, recipe follows 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup honey<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat your grill (propane, charcoal or wood fired) to medium-high heat. Remove the wing tips from the chicken wings and save for another use, or freeze to make a stock. Cut the wings in half at the joint to separate the drums and the flats. Mix the vegetable oil, orange zest, fennel seeds, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Toss the drums and flats in this mixture to coat well. Separate the drums and flats to skewer. First skewer the flats using 2 metal skewers, one on each end of the flat placed lengthwise. You should be able to fit 6 flats per pair of skewers. Now, skewer the drums only with 2 skewers, one on each side of each drum. For even cooking, alternate the placement of the meatier end as you add on each piece. You should be able to fit 6 drums per pair of skewers. After the skewering assembly, you will have a total of 2 lines of flats and 2 lines of drums ready for grilling. Transfer the wings onto the grill over direct heat and grill for 6 minutes per side on medium-high heat. Remember the metal skewers will be hot; use sturdy tea towels or long tongs to help with flipping. Turn the heat down to medium. At this point (the wings will be about three-quarters done), brush the top side of the wings with the Honey Glaze. Grill for 8 to 10 minutes, then flip onto the other side and glaze again. Grill for another 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let rest for 5 minutes; the glaze will still be very hot. Serve warm. Put the orange juice, honey and 1/2 cup water in a small pan on medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced to maple syrup consistency, about 8 minutes (the glaze will thicken very slightly as it cools down). Season with salt and set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 62958,&quot;Roast Pork With Creamy Peas 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons packed dark brown sugar 3 teaspoons mustard powder 3 teaspoons mild cl powder Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 3-pound boneless pork loin (with fat layer intact) 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons white vinegar 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon granulated sugar Kosher salt 4 cups shelled fresh peas (from 4 to 5 pounds pea pods) or frozen peas 3/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 2 scallions, thinly sliced Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Prepare the pork: Mix 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 teaspoons each mustard powder and cl powder, 1 tablespoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl.

Place the bowl over a saucepan containing barely simmering water (or use a double boiler,) the water should not touch the bottom of the bowl. Continue to whisk rapidly. Be careful not to let the eggs get too hot or they will scramble. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter and continue to whisk until the sauce is thickened and doubled in volume. Remove from heat, whisk in cayenne and salt. Cover and place in a warm spot until ready to use for the eggs benedict. If the sauce gets too thick, whisk in a few drops of warm water before serving. Brown the bacon in a medium skillet and toast the English muffins, cut sides up, on a baking sheet under the broiler. Fill a 10-inch nonstick skillet half full of water. Add white vinegar to the cooking water. This will make the egg white cook faster so it does not spread. Bring to a slow boil. Gently break 1 of the eggs into the water taking care not to break it. Repeat with remaining eggs. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Cook 3 1/2 minutes until the egg white is set and yolk remains soft. Remove with a slotted spoon, allowing the egg to drain. To assemble: Lay a slice of Canadian bacon on top of each muffin half, followed by a poached egg. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon hollandaise sauce over the eggs.

Add the lemon and lime zest and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Blend all the ingredients until smooth and completely mixed.<br> Place a sheet of plastic wrap out on your workspace. Spread the butter across the plastic wrap and roll into a log, twisting the ends to seal. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to chill. This will give you a nice clean round of butter to top the fish with. Alternatively, you can leave the butter in a small bowl and dollop the butter on top of the fish once it&#39;s grilled.<br> Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.<br> Sprinkle the salmon on both sides with salt and pepper. Oil the grill grates with a clean tea towel. Grill the salmon for 4 minutes, and then flip and cook the second side for another 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter.

Cook&#39;s Note: If the peaches are ripe, you will only need 2, but if they&#39;re still a bit firm, you may need 3 to yield the 2 cups needed. In a small saucepan, cook the peaches and sugar over medium heat until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat. In a medium bowl, combine the mascarpone cheese and chopped pecans. Add the cooked peaches to the mascarpone mixture and stir to combine. In a medium-size, heavy-bottomed skillet or deep fryer, heat the oil to 375 degrees F. In a bowl, beat the egg for the egg wash. Keep the wonton wrappers under a moist towel to prevent them from drying out. Working 1 by 1, place a wonton wrapper on the cutting board. Place a heaping tablespoon (using 2 spoons to scrape the mixture off) peach-mascarpone mixture in the center of the wonton wrapper, making sure you have pecans in the mixture. Brush the egg wash along the top 2 sides of the wonton, and then fold over into a triangle, squeezing out as much air as possible. Too much air in the filling will cause the wonton to burst during frying. Press to seal the edges. Line the finished wontons on a plate and cover with another damp towel until ready to fry. Working in batches of 3, gently fry the wontons until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove the wontons to a paper towel-lined plate to drain the excess oil.

Cook the mushrooms until tender and dark, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the sage midway through the cooking time. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper, to taste, after they&#39;re dark and tender, as salt slows the browning by drawing out liquids. Meanwhile, in a second small skillet over medium heat melt another tablespoon of the butter. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the sauerkraut, cook until warmed through, then turn off the heat. While the onions cook, heat a cast iron pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Season the chicken liberally with Montreal Steak Seasoning. Add the extra-virgin olive oil to the pan or griddle and cook the chicken, turning once, until cooked through, about 12 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate. Wipe down the skillet or griddle, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Thinly slice the chicken on an angle. Add the sour cream, relish, and ketchup to a small bowl and stir in the fresh herbs. Lightly butter 1 side of the bread slices with the remaining tablespoon of butter. Build the sandwiches with buttered sides facing out, in this order: dressing, cheese, mushrooms, sliced chicken, sauerkraut with onions, cheese, and ending with the dressing to set in place.

Cook over medium heat until meat is lightly browned. Drain off juices, pat sausage dry and set aside. Over low to medium heat, melt butter in a frying pan. Saute shallot until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add remaining beer and cook for about 10 minutes over medium heat. Add heavy cream and salt, cook for about 20 minutes, stirring often. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. On a floured surface, press out Pizza Dough balls. After dough is pressed out flat, begin stretching by hand to desired size and thickness. Place on baking sheet or preheated pizza stone. Spread a thin layer of the cream sauce on the dough, leaving 1/2 inch all the way around free from sauce. Put on the sausage, onion and cheeses. Bake for at least 10 minutes, or until pizza dough edges look browned and cheese has some browned spots. (Best results will be achieved by using a pizza stone that is placed in the oven for at least 15 minutes before placing dough on it. Pizza can then be built directly on the pizza stone.) In a small cup, combine 2 tablespoons of the water and the yeast and stir until the yeast is dissolved. Set aside for about 10 minutes. In a mixer with a dough hook, combine the flour and yeast mixture and mix until incorporated. Add the salt and the remaining water. Mix until dough feels and looks smooth. You may have to add a bit more flour or water to achieve this consistency; do this in very small increments, like 1 teaspoon of either flour or water at a time. Let each incorporate and check for desired consistency. When the dough is smooth, and the bowl is free from dry flour, add the oil. Mix until well incorporated. With slightly oiled hands, remove the dough, divide into 2 balls and wrap in plastic wrap.

Roll the dough over the pin and transfer to the tart pan, pressing the dough into the bottom and up the sides. With your fingers, pinch away the excess dough at the top of the tart pan. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill at least 30 minutes and up to overnight. If you are using a frozen pie shell, skip this step and prepare apples.<br> While the dough chills, make the filling. Peel, halve, and core 6 of the apples. With a mandoline, vegetable slicer, or sharp knife, cut the apples into thin 1/4-inch thick slices lengthwise. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the apple slices. Toss to coat in butter, then add the sugar, vanilla, and salt, and continue to cook until the apples are soft and almost falling apart and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 15 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool while the dough finishes chilling. Meanwhile, peel, halve, and core the remaining 4 apples and, with a mandoline, vegetable slicer, or sharp knife, cut into very thin 1/8-inch thick slices lengthwise. Squeeze the lemon juice over the slices to prevent browning.<br> When the dough has finished chilling, remove the pan from the refrigerator and spread the cooled filling over the bottom of the tart. Starting at the outside edge of the tart, make a ring of tightly overlapping 1/8-inch thick apple slices on top of the filling, tucking the last slice under the first when finished to make an unbroken circle. Make a second ring in the same manner, inside and slightly overlapping the first ring. There will be a tiny opening left in the middle: Arrange some apple slices to cover. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and brush all over the top of the apples, being careful not to disturb the rings.
