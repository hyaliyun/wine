With a pleasant minerality, it should age well through 2016, gradually losing fruit.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"Very dry and tannic, a style of Cabernet that relies more on structure than flash.

It's a great way to enjoy this Bordeaux grape variety bottled on its own instead of in a blend, as usual.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"es","description":"Toasty, roasted aromas of baked berry and earth head straight to a narrowly built yet weighty palate with earth, plum and raspberry notes.

It has a young, mineral texture, while possessing a nervy acidity.","designation":"Le Grand Caillou"},{"country":"us","description":"Hard to imagine greater concentration in a Napa Cabernet than you'll find here. It's just insanely rich in blackberries and blueberries and liberally oaked, while the tannins are hard and potent. Nowhere near ready now, even though it's already more than five years old. Give it at least six years in a good cellar, and it could easily go another decade beyond that.","designation":"Mountain"},{"country":"it","description":"This plump blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc is raw in places but carries a pretty tune of blueberry, spice and smoked ham. The deep ruby color is glorious and the wine ends with firm tannins.","designation":"Tenuta S. Giovanni Valdisanti"},{"country":"us","description":"Like the label says, this wine is absolutely dry. It's also very crisp in acidity, with a mouthwatering tartness that has the taste of freshly-squeezed lime juice.

While it's technically dry, there's a honeyed sweetness that suggests a touch of botrytis. It's a strong wine, unafraid to command a boldness that may not be for everyone. This is distinctly Californian in style, and as it loses fruit with age, it will develop nut and earthy notes.","designation":"Charles Heintz Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"The vineyard is in the Carneros district, which makes you wonder why the winery doesn't so identify it.

Wonderful to see this veteran Napa producer remaining vital and relevant after all these years.","designation":"Rutherford Hillside Reserve"},{"country":"it","description":"Made with Nero di Troia grapes, this has aromas of wild rose, citrus peel and a whiff of Mediterranean brush.

Seems a victim of the vintage, but could soften and develop in a few years.","designation":"Julia's"},{"country":"us","description":"This has a noticeable scent of tackroom leather that carries into the flavors, somewhat muting the black-cherry fruit.

This is good and rugged but short on ease and flow.","designation":"OG Esencia Crianza"},{"country":"au","description":"Dry Red No. 2 is virtually all Shiraz, though small amounts of Viognier, Marsanne and Mataro are often included. The 2008 displays slightly vegetal shadings of capsicum and tomato that may prove controversial, but there's ample cassis as well, rounded out by a cedar note. Its medium weight and delicate, silky texture combine to impart those ineffable qualities of grace and elegance.","designation":"Dry Red Wine No. 2"},{"country":"de","description":"While the nose is a bit subdued, suggesting bruised apple and herb notes, the palate of this spry, off-dry Riesling is fresh, fruity and elegant. Crisp white peach and grapefruit flavors are lively and tart, finishing with a refreshing green herb note. Drink now through 2018.","designation":"Rothenberg"},{"country":"es","description":"This starts with some Verdejo sweat and funk on the nose, and while those notes don't last, the bouquet doesn't improve dramatically with airing. It feels soft and basic, with melon and lettuce flavors. Falls off a bit on the finish, which tastes a bit briney.","designation":"Ducado de Altan"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine hits the mark for spicy aromas, rich flavors and a velvety yet vibrant texture.

Intimations of orange peel and golden pear promise a great wine with a rich mouthfeel and cleansing acidity.","designation":"Lamm Reserve"},{"country":"it","description":"This savory Verdicchio offers freshness and fleshy fruit flavors of creamy white peach, lemon and tropical fruit, all accented by mineral notes. The round structure is brightened by crisp acidity that leaves a cleansing finish.","designation":"Riserva Aurato"},{"country":"us","description":"The King Estate name is intentionally printed upside down on the label, emphasizing the paradoxical nature of the wine, which has been barrel aged. As when oak is applied to Pinot Gris, it mutes the varietal nuances of the grape. So along with tart apple and pear fruit, you'll find a softer palate, with vanilla and buttered nuts in the aftertaste.","designation":"Paradox"},{"country":"at","description":"A shy nose hints at crushed autumn leaves, fresh red fruit and soft vanilla. The palate has that same interplay of earthiness and red-berry fruit, supported by a gentle nudge of oaky vanilla. Slender and layered, the body shows a firm grip of very fine tannin.

The palate has the same richness but is kept in check by wonderfully insisting, bright lemon acidity that suggests both peel and flesh. This is not really fully sweet and thus occupies an uncertain field‚Äîone which clever and innovative cooks navigate with aplomb. This is a wine for spiced, exotic dishes that involve fruit, for soft, ripe cheeses or savory fruit combos. The wine's creamy finish pulls all the elements together.","designation":"Wahre Werte Auslese"},{"country":"us","description":"A beautiful wine, dry, complex and crisp, and easily one of the best white Rh√¥ne-style bottlings of the vintage.

A smooth bruiser to enjoy with venison or steak.","designation":"Gran Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"Quite distinct from the winery's regular Pinot Gris, this is oak fermented and barrel aged on the lees for 16 months. The hock bottle suggests an Alsatian model, the extended barrel time softening the sharp acidity. There's a light suggestion of wood flavor, not toast but neutral wood, and the fruit is damped down.

It just keeps on the right side of drinkability because the spice merges into pear flavors to give an intriguing nutmeg character, while the aftertaste offers freshness. The wine needs at least a year to blend together.","designation":"Les Brul√©s"},{"country":"us","description":"Very tough and tannic now, and dry too, so that the ultimate impact is disagreeably harsh. That, despite a solid core of blackberries, black currants, violets, bacon and minerals. The question is one of ageability. The answer is that it's a gamble, as the wine, like the stock market, could go either way.","designation":"Morehouse Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Dry and soft, this is a pretty Merlot to drink with lusty fare, like barbecued pork and tri-tip.

It's complex, elegant and silky‚Äîjust like more Pinots should be.","designation":"Seddon"},{"country":"us","description":"From one of the larger estates in the Edna Valley, this wine has sweet-smelling plum, cherry candy and grenadine aromas. The palate is front-loaded with sagebrush, thyme, dried lavender and rosemary notes, while a hibiscus flavor unfolds in the background.","designation":"Estate Grown"},{"country":"ar","description":"Aggressive and ultra-bubbly, with gassy apple, pear and pineapple aromas.

Tightly wound tannins on the palate are balanced by a good lick of acidity and fairly prominent oak.","designation":"Three Canoes Lease Block"},{"country":"es","description":"This marks the final version of Roda II. Starting with the 2002 vintage it will just be called Roda. Regardless of name, we especially like the racy red fruit and the length of the finish. Up front there's smoke and balsam wood, and after that flavors of cherry, raspberry and tobacco. Will age well for another five years.","designation":"Roda II Reserva"},{"country":"cl","description":"This is another take-it-or-leave-it version of Lot 5. As per usual, it's an intense example of Leyda Valley Chardonnay, which means it's super briny and barely ripe. Blazing acidity creates a sense of sharpness, while saline-rich flavors of citrus and oak finish racy in that patented Chilean coastal way.","designation":"Lot 5"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a very good Pinot Noir that shows how well the appellation can balance the variety. It has lush cherry, blackberry, tea, cola and cocoa flavors, and a rich, silky texture. Could develop bottle complexity over the next six years.","designation":"Stonewall Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a bone-dry, tannic, acidic and tightly wound Cabernet, with a solid core of blackberry aromas and flavors. Stylistically, it plants its flag squarely in favor of elegance, it just needs a little more time to fully integrate.","designation":"Special Reserve"},{"country":"cl","description":"Strong-like-bull blackberry flavors  follow dirt, oak and a little pepper on the nose‚Äîall of the above appear on the finish. It's not terribly lush or complex, but it gets the job done.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"This starts out closed and tight, shut down by tannins and immaturity, but plenty of swirling reveals elusive black-licorice and blackberry notes, accented by smoky oak. The tannins really kick in toward the middle, but hard as they are, they exhibit great breed. Despite its sweet core of fruit, this is nowhere close to being ready. Give it 10 years.","designation":"Tre Vigneti"},{"country":"at","description":"This is a compelling red for those who like a bit of mystery: is it red or black cherry? Or possibly, dark, aromatic elderberry? Oak spicily supports this interchange of fruit, and firm tannins lend structure while the fresh acidity keeps it lively. It's almost like a whole cast of characters were lined up in this wine for your entertainment. The lingering finish is especially convincing. This will get even better with cellaring; drink from 2016.","designation":"Alter Berg"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is one of several estates in this cru appellation where Georges Duboeuf makes and markets the wine.

Oaky and soft, it possesses a funk of earthiness.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"ar","description":"Heavy and dark, with licorice, fruit syrup and blackberry pie aromas.

Endnotes of crushed black pepper and crushed clove bring up the rear.","designation":"La Togata"},{"country":"us","description":"This delicious bottle sings out with a burst of bright raspberry fruit. As with all the Winderlea designates, the exposure to new oak is fairly minimal‚Äîjust 10 months in one-sixth new barrels. Juicy acidity keeps flavors buoyant, and the barrels add light notes of caramel and nougat. Drink this with great enjoyment over the next two or three years.","designation":"Crawford Beck Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"There sure is a lot of ripe flavor in this Pinot, which swamps the tastebuds with raspberries, cherries, vanilla and sweet oak.

More elegant and food-friendly than many of the fruitier, high alcohol, oaky Cabs out there.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"us","description":"Ripe raspberry, slight minerality, mossy earthiness and a minty lift kick off this offering. On the palate, expect sour cherry, mocha and a pleasing espresso finish bolstered by tingling acidity. Though 2010 was considered a less-than-optimal year, the vintage look like a shining star now that wines like this have had time to come into their own.","designation":"Edna Valley"},{"country":"es","description":"While this foamy ros√© is not elevated, it should appeal to those who like sweet Moscato bubblies. Candied flavors of raspberry, lychee and dried mango finish with a note of pineapple syrup.","designation":"Moscato"},{"country":"cl","description":"Spicy, herbal and toasty on the nose, but the palate fails to meet the promise of the aromas.

Plan on serving it with fish or chicken rather than something rich or extravagant.","designation":"Amour de Dieu"},{"country":"fr","description":"A rich floral notion of dandelion precedes the rich aroma of ripe peaches on the nose. The palate opens into a kind of vast peach mellowness, edged with a touch of citrus zest and a grounding, earthy element. A gentle sweetness boosts the peachy roundedness but does not dominate.

High in citrus flavor and pear, it has a gritty texture that gives it added complexity.","designation":"Peters Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Lots of new, smoky oak stands out on this polished Cab. Give it a little time in a decanter before you drink, as it pulls together, becoming more powerful and accenting the blackberry and cherry flavors.
