Drain immediately and rinse with cold water until cool. Drain the noodles really well and transfer to a wide bowl; toss with the sesame oil so they don&#39;t stick together. In a small saucepan, heat the peanut oil over medium-low flame. Add the green onions, ginger, garlic, and chili paste. Cook and stir for a minute until soft and fragrant. Mix in the brown sugar, peanut butter, vinegar, soy sauce, and hot water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the peanut butter has smoothed out. Toss the noodles with the peanut sauce until well coated. Serve at room temperature or chilled. Garnish with the sesame seeds, cucumber slices, and cilantro. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30640,&quot;George&#39;s Fluffy Garlic Mashed Potatoes 1 head garlic Extra-virgin olive oil 3 pounds russet potatoes Water Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 3 sprigs rosemary 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the top off the garlic and wrap it in foil leaving the top cut edge exposed. Drizzle on some olive oil and bake for 45 minutes or until the garlic is soft and caramelized. Remove from the oven and let cool a bit. Meanwhile peel the potatoes, cut them into cubes, and put them into a medium sized pot. Cover them with water and add a big pinch of salt. Bring them to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to medium and simmer until they are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain them well. While the potatoes are cooking, warm the cream and rosemary in a small pot over low heat. When you are ready to mash, strain out the rosemary. When the potatoes are dry but still hot, put them through a ricer into a large bowl. Squeeze in the garlic and add some of the warm cream. Mix well, then add the butter and mix again. Add more cream if they are too dry. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30641,&quot;Crispy Bottomed Basmati Rice with Lentils 3 cups Basmati rice 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sea salt 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 large onion, finely diced 2 cups brown lentils, washed and drained 4 to 5 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon Hungarian paprika 1 bunch fresh basil, leaves julienned Instructions: Wash the rice in several changes of warm water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice for 6 to 8 hours or overnight, in cold water to cover, with 1 tablespoon of the salt. (Alternatively, to save time, soak the rice in lukewarm water with the salt for 30 to 45 minutes.) Heat a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the onion. Cook until the onion becomes translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the lentils, garlic, pepper, and paprika. Continue cooking 2 minutes. Add 2 cups of water, cover, and cook until tender, about 45 minutes. Season with the 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste. Stir in the basil. In a large saucepan, over medium high heat, bring 2 1/2 quarts of water to a boil with the remaining 1 tablespoon of salt. Drain the rice from the soaking liquid and add it to the boiling water. Return to a boil and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Test a grain of rice for doneness; it should be cooked entirely except for a small part in the center. Strain the rice in a colander and rinse with warm water. Drain well. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large, well-seasoned or nonstick stock pot with a tight-fitting lid, over medium heat. Add about 2 tablespoons water and sprinkle the cooked rice evenly onto the bottom of the pot a spoonful at a time until two-thirds of the rice has been distributed. Spread the lentil mixture evenly over the rice. Cover the lentils with the remaining rice, mounding it slightly in the center. Use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke about 5 deep holes in the rice from the surface of rice to the bottom of the pot to allow steam to escape. Cover the pot with a thick cotton dish towel and place the lid on tightly. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for 35 to 40 minutes, turning the pot occasionally. Fill the sink with cold water 1 or 2 inches deep. Remove the cover from the rice and have a large, round platter ready. Place the pot in the sink for 1 minute, watching so that no water enters the pot. Remove the pot and dry off the bottom, then invert the rice cake onto the platter. It should unmold itself in one piece and be golden brown. Bring the platter to the table and serve family style. Cut individual wedges from the rice cake, similar to cutting a pie. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 30642,&quot;Mashed White Beans with Truffle Oil 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 2 ounces white truffle oil 1 pound dried Great Northern, navy, pea or other white beans 2 quarts chicken stock 2 teaspoons salt 1/3 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons chopped garlic Instructions: Sort the beans to make sure they are free of stones or other debris. Rinse, then cover with cold water, refrigerate, and soak overnight. The next day, drain the beans, place them in large pot, and cover with the stock. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer the beans for 2 hours, or until they are soft, tender and yield to pressure when squeezed between your finger tips. Add the salt only in the final 15 minutes of cooking since the addition of salt earlier in the cooking process will result in tough beans. Pour the beans in to the bowl of a food processor. Begin to pulse the beans along with any of the stock that may have remained from cooking. Add all the remaining ingredients except the truffle oil and pulse together with the warm bean puree. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and add freshly ground pepper if needed. Return the bean puree to a pot set over low heat or a double boiler to keep warm. Serve each portion of puree with a drizzle of truffle oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30643,&quot;Blackened Stuffed Pork Chops 1/4 of each, red, yellow and green bell peppers, chopped 1/4 red onion, chopped 2 tablespoons garlic butter 1 pound fresh crabmeat 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves 1 tablespoon fresh chopped basil leaves 1/4 cup bread crumbs 1 fresh egg Salt and freshly ground black pepper Pepper jack cheese About 1/2 pound shredded asiago 2/3 cup half-and-half 2/3 cup heavy whipping cream 1/2 cup Spanish paprika 1/2 cup cayenne pepper 1/2 cup Black pepper 1/2 cup salt 1 cup chili powder 1 cup granulated garlic 1 cup granulated onions 5 (1 1/2-inch thick) bone-in pork chops 2 pounds angle hair pasta, cooked, for serving Instructions: For the stuffing Dice the bell peppers and onions.

Add the mushrooms and red onions and saute until the bacon is fully cooked and onions have softened. Increase the heat to high. Add the collard greens and cook until the greens are wilted. Turn off the heat and set the pan aside. In a separate pan, melt the butter and then add the flour. Cook, whisking frequently, to create a smooth, blond roux (this will take 3 to 4 minutes; do not brown, as the goal is just to remove the raw taste from the flour). Slowly add the cream while whisking and adjust the heat to keep the sauce at a simmer. Add the salt and pepper to taste (it should taste like a moderately salty cream gravy). Continue cooking until the sauce thickens and easily coats the back of a spoon.<br> Butter an 8-by-12-inch casserole dish (or 8-to-10-cup capacity casserole). Combine the collard greens with cream sauce and transfer to the casserole. Top with the cheese and french-fried onions.

Remove 1/4 inch of the crust from the ends of the loaf, then cut the loaf crosswise into 4 even pieces. Use a fork to score one cut end and gently dig a square hole into each piece of bread to make a box, leaving a 1/2-inch layer of bread around the walls and bottom (see Cook&#39;s Note). Save the removed crumbs for another use.<br> Microwave the butter and a large pinch of salt in a small microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 1 minute. Brush the bread boxes inside and out with the melted butter. Put 1 slice of cheese at the bottom of each bread box. Put the boxes open-side up on a baking sheet and bake until the cheese melts and the inside of the bread is lightly browned and crispy in parts, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fill a small liquid measuring cup with 1/4 cup water. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the onion and a large pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until the onions are tender and lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. If the pan ever gets too hot, stir in 1 tablespoon of water and use a wooden spoon or heat-proof rubber spatula to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add another tablespoon of oil and the red and green bell peppers to the skillet. Season with a large pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until tender and lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes.

Arrange fillets so that marinade completely covers fish. Marinate in the refrigerator for as long possible (a minimum of 4 hours, but ideally 24 hours to do it justice). Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Rub oil on a 10 by 10-inch sheet of aluminum foil. Place pepper on a small plate. Remove salmon from marinade and pat topside only into cracked pepper to coat. Place fillets, pepper side up, on foil. Bake on the top rack of the oven for approximately 7 minutes. (Syrup may cause fish to smoke when cooking, do not be alarmed.) Salmon can also be grilled directly over hot coals for about 3 minutes per side. But do not even think about using a microwave. Avoid overcooking the fillets.

Heat a large saucepan or pot with a lid over medium-high heat; add remaining 1/4 cup vegetable oil to warm. Add chopped onion and minced garlic and saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the turmeric and chunks of meat. Continue to saute until meat is browned on outside and the juices have begun to render, creating a thin sauce in the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the sauteed herbs and fold into the meat/onion mixture. Add kidneys beans, black pepper, salt, dried limes and 10 cups water. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and let simmer, making sure to check water level throughout cooking time, until the meat is tender enough to shred with a fork, 4 to 5 hours.

Drain, pit and roughly chop, reserving the liquid. Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a saute pan and add the apples until soft, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle over 2 to 3 tablespoons of the sugar and continue cooking to caramelize, about 10 minutes more. Pour on about a tablespoon of the reserved Armagnac, flambe, and boil until the flames die out and the liquid has disappeared. Remove from the heat and taste. Depending on your apples, the mixture may need more acidity. If it does, add a squirt of lemon to taste. Stir through the chopped prunes.<br> Heat the oven to 375 degrees F/190 degrees C. Set the ring part of an 8-inch/20 cm springform pan on a baking sheet.<br> Prepare the pastry: Melt the remaining butter in a small saucepan or microwave. Working with one phyllo sheet at a time, prepare as follows: lay one sheet of phyllo on a clean surface and cut into three strips crosswise (not lengthwise). Brush one of the three strips with melted butter, sprinkle with a little sugar and a few drops of Armagnac. Lay another strip on top and repeat. Lay the final strip on top and brush with butter. Your single sheet of phyllo is now a three-layer-thick strip. Lay it in the center of the ring mold so that it runs from the middle out, and up and over the edge of the ring, like the spoke of a wheel. Continue with the remaining strips, laying them in around the ring slightly overlapping so that there are no openings.<br> Spoon the prune and apple filling into the bottom of the mold. Fold the pastry strips up in over top, twisting somewhat as you go so that the top is a rustic landscape of papery peaks and valleys totally covering the top of the tart. Brush quite generously with butter and scatter over a scant handful of sugar. (You may have some butter and sugar left over once you&#39;re done. If you do, use them for something else. The same goes for the Armagnac, of which you will have a lot left: use it in fruit salad or let a piece of pound cake drink it up...or serve it in tiny glasses with dessert.)<br> Remove the springform ring, leaving the formed croustade on the baking sheet. Bake until the pastry is fully cooked and golden, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, slide onto rack and cool.

Add pureed chiles, vegetable stock, sugar and salt and let simmer, 10 minutes. Add can of red chili sauce and stir to heat thoroughly. For the filling: Pour oil into a saucepan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, squash, garlic, oregano and some salt. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are glazed and no longer crisp, approximately 10 minutes. (The filling does not need to be tender because it will also cook while tamales are steaming.) Add 3/4 cup red tamale sauce to the filling and let cool. For the masa: Mix together masa, baking powder and salt in a large bowl until incorporated. Stir in the vegetable stock and 1/2 cup red tamale sauce. Beat the vegetable shortening in a stand mixer until fluffy, then beat in masa mixture with the mixer running until evenly incorporated. Soak the corn husks in hot water until softened and pliable, about 15 minutes. Drain and squeeze water from husks. Spread masa on the less ridged side of a corn husk, across all but the pointed end, with a spatula or the back of a spoon, Fill each with 2 to 3 tablespoons squash and mushroom mixture. Roll tamale by folding one long side about a third of the way over the filling, then the other side, and folding the long pointed end against the tamale (this will leave the filling exposed on the opposite end, and that is okay). Push two black olives into masa on the open end of each tamale. Place a steamer rack in a large pot filled with just enough water so the bottom of the rack sits just above the water line. Line the rack with flat corn husks. Place rolled tamales in pot on the rack, open-side up. Drop two pennies in the bottom of the pot. Cover the tamales with more flat husks. Cover the rack with a clean dish towel. Cover the large pot with a tight fitting lid or aluminum foil and steam for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. (The pennies will dance and tinkle furiously when the water comes to a boil. Turn the heat down until the pennies dance to a relaxing beat. If you no longer hear the pennies, you have boiled away the water, and you had better add more?fast!) Serve tamales with additional red tamale sauce.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 30658,&quot;Caramel Sauce 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/3 cup water 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1/2 vanilla bean or 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Mix the water and sugar in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cover and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat and boil uncovered until the sugar turns a medium brown, about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Watch it carefully at the end, as it will go from caramel to burnt very quickly. Stand back to avoid splattering, and gradually add the cream and the seeds scraped from the vanilla bean (or vanilla extract). Simmer until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth and thick, about 2 minutes. Serve warm, or add another 1/4 cup of heavy cream and serve room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Port]&quot; 30659,&quot;Pea and Mint Dip 1 cup frozen peas, thawed 1 tablespoon fresh mint (about 6 leaves; chopped if mashing by hand)\\u202f<br> 1/2 cup canned or cooked cannellini beans, drained and rinsed\\u202f<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil\\u202f<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon (about 1 tablespoon)\\u202f<br> Pinch of flaky sea salt\\u202f<br> Lightly salted potato chips, for serving<br> Instructions: Blitz all the ingredients together in a food processor so there is still a little texture to the dip, about 15 seconds, or longer if you prefer a smoother dip.

To prepare the artichokes, place them in a large pot and cover them with cold water. Squeeze the lemons and add the juice and the lemon to the pot and bring to a boil over a high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until they are tender, about 25 minutes. Use the tines of a fork to check for tenderness. Transfer the artichokes to the ice water. When they are cool enough to handle, remove the leaves and the choke (the fine fibrous clump on top of the bottom, in the middle). Trim the edges of the bottoms. Place the artichoke bottoms, eggs and water in a blender or a food processor fitted with a steel blade and blend until creamy. Pour into a mixing bowl and add salt, pepper and flour and combine until pasty. Whip the egg whites in a dry copper or stainless steel bowl until they are creamy and hold stiff peaks. Gently stir into the artichoke mixture. Place a cast iron skillet over a medium high flame and when it is hot, add the oil. Drop dollops (about the size of 2 tablespoons) of batter, a few at a time. When the edges begin to stiffen, turn the pancakes over. Combine the goat cheese and sour cream in a small mixing bowl. Place the pancakes on an oven proof plate and top each one with a large dollop of the goat cheese mixture and place in the oven until the cheese just begins to melt, about 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 30678,&quot;Mashed Potato Napolean 2 onions 2 tablespoons butter 1 pound ground beef 2 2/3 cups frozen mashed potatoes 1 1/3 cups of milk 40 frozen green beans Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Cut the onions into rings, place them in preheated buttered frying pan and saute them until caramelized. Remove and in the same pan, place the meat and fry it, cutting through the meat regularly to keep it from attaching. Add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Melt the frozen mashed potatoes with the milk and salt and pepper to taste in microwave (according to the recipe on package) to create warm mashed potatoes. Boil water with salt and add frozen green beans and cook until tender. Presentation In a ring mold, place one layer of mashed potatoes, then one layer of beef, then some caramelized onions, repeat and finish with the mashed potatoes. Place on a plate, then disperse the green beans around like logs for a fire.

Cut the leaves 2 or 3 at a time into fine julienne. If the leaves are more than 4 or 5 inches long, fold them under to make them easier to julienne.<br> Julienne the carrots and turnip into 3- inch lengths. The easiest way to do this is first to slice them with a benriner cutter (a Japanese slicer) and then with a chef&#39;s knife. Cut the celery stalk into 4-inch sections and julienne it as finely as possible. Combine the julienned vegetables, bouquet garni, and just enough water to cover- about a quart- in a 4-quart pot. Simmer gently, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Add the wine and simmer for 10 minutes more. Strain the vegetable broth, reserving the cooked vegetables and broth. About 10 minutes before you&#39;re ready to serve, put the cooked vegetables with 1/4 cup of the broth in a covered saucepan over low heat.<br> Bring the remaining vegetable broth to a simmer in a saute pan just large enough to hold the scallop in a single layer. (If the pan is too large, there won&#39;t be enough liquid to cover.) Gently slide the scallops into the simmering broth. If there&#39;s not enough liquid to cover the scallops. Poach the scallops for 8 minutes. Spread 3/4 quarters of the julienned vegetables in shells. Carefully arrange the scallop on the vegetables.<br> Add the chopped parsley to the simmering poaching liquid, season the liquid with salt and pepper, swirl in 1/4 cup tarragon butter and ladle enough over the fish to come about a third of the way up the sides of the fish. Arrange the rest of the julienne over the fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 30680,&quot;Cupcake Bouquet Butter, for greasing bowl 1 (18.25-ounce) box golden yellow cake mix 1 1/3 cups water 1/2 cup vegetable oil 3 eggs 2 (16 ounce) containers vanilla frosting 1/2 cup powdered sugar 48 store-bought mini-cupcakes or mini-muffins, paper liners removed 48 toothpicks Pastry bag Star tip Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Place heavy cast-iron skillet into oven to preheat. Chill a large mixing bowl, pastry cutter, flour and 1 stick butter in the freezer 15 minutes before assembling the biscuits.<br> Add the flour to the chilled mixing bowl. Working quickly, cut 1 stick butter into the flour using the chilled pastry cutter (or your fingers); the goal here is pea-size balls of butter. In batches, add in the buttermilk until the dough is cohesive yet still moist. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly press into a 1-inch-thick round. Using a biscuit cutter or business end of a dry-measuring cup, cut out 8 biscuits. (Use the extra dough to cook up a big piece of shortcake for dessert....strawberry shortcake!)<br> Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and add the oil. Place the dough rounds into the hot skillet, right up against each other, and brush with the 3 tablespoons melted butter.

Whisk until smooth and season with pepper. Cut the pork against the grain into 1-inch-thick slices. Add to the marinade and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a rack on top. Drain the meat from the marinade (reserving the marinade) and place on the rack. Roast until the top is lightly caramelized, about 25 minutes. Flip the pieces and roast until the second side is lightly caramelized, about 25 minutes more. Meanwhile, pour a few tablespoons of the marinade into a small bowl. Add the cornstarch and whisk until smooth with no lumps. Add 2 cups of the marinade to a small saucepan (discard the rest) and heat over medium. Add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.<br> Let the pork cool, then chop into small pieces for the filling and put in a medium bowl. Add the thickened, cooled marinade and stir to coat.<br> For the dough: Combine the yeast, 1/2 cup warm water (90 to 110 degrees F) and a pinch of sugar in a large spouted measuring cup. Let sit until foamy, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the all-purpose flour, cake flour, granulated sugar and salt in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Whisk the milk, vegetable oil and egg into the yeast mixture. Add to the flour mixture and mix with the paddle to make a cohesive dough. Switch to the dough hook and knead, adding a little more flour or water if needed, to make a dough that cleans the sides of the bowl. Knead until the dough is very smooth and springy, 4 to 5 minutes. Knead the dough on a floured counter to bring the dough together. Oil a large bowl and turn the dough to coat in the oil. Cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Punch the dough down and divide into 2 pieces. Roll each piece to about a scant 1/4 inch thickness and use a 4-inch ring cutter to cut as many circles as possible. Reroll the dough to cut out 9 to 12 circles total. Fill the center of each with about 1 tablespoon of the filling. Pinch the dough to enclose the filling and make a ball. Put the balls pinched-side down on the baking sheets. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the topping: Combine the flour, confectioners&#39; sugar, baking powder and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse to combine. Add the butter and process until crumbly.

With an electric beater, mix all the ingredients for the frangipane cream just until blended. On a slightly floured cold surface, cut 2 circles the size of dinner plates out of the puff pastry. Put one of them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush one inch around the edge of the circle with egg wash (beaten egg yolk). Spread half of the frangipane cream on the center and place the second circle on top matching the edges of the circles. Press all around the edges to glue them together. Press softly in the center to evenly spread the filling. If making 2 galettes use remaining cream and follow the same method for preparation. Decorate the galette with a fork, press edges together all around-no pricking. With the point of a knife, make any kind of design being careful not to go all the way through the puff pastry. Brush the surface with egg wash being careful no to get any on the sides. Bake the galette in the center of a preheated 450 degree oven for 15 minutes then 350 degrees for 30 minutes. For the last 5 minutes, sprinkle with powdered sugar and bake until golden brown. Serve warm with gold paper crown on top. For the tradition of Epiphany in the privacy of your kitchen cut the galette in as many parts as people in the party. In one of them, insert a little ceramic toy (big enough to prevent swallowing). In the old days, they used a dried fava bean, so to this day it is still called \\la feve.\\ Everyone picks 1 piece of galette the one who discovers the toy is made the king of the day and wears the crown. He picks a queen by putting the toy in her glass and everyone raises his or her glass and applauds. Same process in reverse if a lady finds the toy. Tradition says that the next party should be at the king&#39;s expense. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 30750,&quot;Lemongrass Tofu 2 (1-pound) boxes firm tofu 10 kaffir lime leaves, minced 3/4 cup kecap manis (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3/4 cup soy sauce 5 cloves garlic, minced 3/4 freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 cup minced fresh lemongrass Vegetable, canola or grapeseed oil Chili sauce, for serving, optional Rice and your favorite vegetable, for serving Instructions: The tofu should be drained of water, and then each block cut into 3 rectangles in the longest direction. Each rectangle can then be cut on the diagonal to form 2 triangles each. Place in a shallow pan. Mix together the lime leaves, kecap manis, soy sauce, garlic, lemon juice and lemongrass. Pour the marinade over the tofu and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours, or overnight. Remove the tofu from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Pat it dry so it doesn&#39;t splatter in the pan. Coat the bottom of a nonstick pan with oil over medium-high heat and saute until the tofu is golden brown on both sides and barely crispy around the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. The sugars in the marinade will affect the rate of browning, so if the tofu seems to be getting dark too fast, it&#39;s ok to lower the heat to ensure that it will be hot all the way through. Remove the tofu and add the reserved marinade. Boil to heat through. Adjust the seasoning with chili sauce, if using, and serve over rice and alongside your favorite vegetable. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 30751,&quot;Sorrel Drink 5 to 6 (1-inch) slices ginger 1 cup dried sorrel leaves 1 tablespoon cloves Brown sugar Red wine sherry, optional Instructions: Let cut ginger sit for 2 to 3 hours.

Lift the chocolate-covered paper by its corners and move it to a clean space on your work surface. Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour a little milk chocolate over one end of the slightly set white chocolate. Pull the wood grain tool through the chocolate to create a wood grain design. Let the chocolate set slightly, until firm but not hard. Using the tip of a sharp paring knife or an X-Acto knife, cut 4 strips of chocolate, 18 by 2-inches. Cut 2 more strips of chocolate, 11 by 2-inches each.<br> For the Sides of the Crate: Repeat the process and cut 2 strips 18 by 2-inches and 2 strips 11 by 2-inches. Cut 8 pieces 2 by 1-inch. These will be the supports for the sides and will hold the base to the sides.<br> Assemble the Crate: On your work surface, place 4 (18 by 2-inch) strips spaced about 1/2-inch apart. Place 2 (11 by 2-inch) strips across the 4 (18 by 2-inch) strips towards the ends. Use white chocolate to glue the 2 strips in place. Divide the 1 by 2-inch pieces into pairs and glue each pair together along the long side, creating a right angle, or an L-shape. Stand the L-shaped chocolate pieces on their ends on each corner of the base, and glue them down about 1/4-inch from the outside edge of the base. Allow the chocolate to set.<br> To glue the sides onto the base, glue the 2 remaining 18 by 2-inch strips and the 2 remaining 11 by 2-inch strips perpendicular to the base on the reinforcement corner. Position them so the bottoms of the strips are one inch above the base. Allow the chocolate to set.<br> For the Hay: Place a large block of ice on a sheet pan and place on your work surface. Make a cornet and fill with the untempered white chocolate. Drizzle long strands of chocolate directly on top of the block of ice. The chocolate will set immediately but remain flexible. Lift the chocolate hay off the ice and gently bend to fit inside the crate. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. How to Make a Cornet(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):<br> The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations.<br> Cut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of one hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side. Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the two corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be one point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 30755,&quot;Jollof Fonio 4 cloves garlic 1 small red bell pepper, chopped 1 small onion, chopped 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 tablespoons tomato paste 2 teaspoons curry powder 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon bouillon powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, optional 2 bay leaves 1 cup meat broth (chicken or beef) or water 1 cup fonio Instructions: Process the garlic, red bell pepper and onion in a blender or food processor until a coarse puree, about 30 seconds. You should have about 1 cup. Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until it starts to look grainy in the oil, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper puree and stir to combine. Cover, lower the heat to medium low and let the mixture simmer for 5 minutes. Add the curry powder, thyme, smoked paprika, bouillon powder, salt, cayenne pepper, if using, and bay leaves and stir to combine. Cover and let simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the broth. Add the fonio and stir to combine. Cover the pot with aluminum foil, then put on the lid. Cook over medium-low heat until the water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Use a fork to fluff the jollof fonio in the pot. Cover again with the foil and lid and let it cook for another 5 minutes. Transfer the fonio to a bowl. Serve by itself or with sauteed meat, vegetables and sweet plantains. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 30756,&quot;ttt err &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 30757,&quot;Iced Sugar Cookies 2 1/2 cups cake flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1-pound box confectioners&#39; sugar (about 3 3/4 cups) 2 tablespoons meringue powder Nonpareils, for decorating (optional) Instructions: Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until incorporated. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the flour mixture in 2 batches and beat until just incorporated. Divide the dough in half, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, lightly dust the dough with flour and roll out between 2 pieces of parchment paper until about 1/8 inch thick. Refrigerate until slightly firm, about 15 minutes. Cut out shapes using 2-to-4-inch cookie cutters and transfer to the prepared baking sheets. Gather the scraps and refrigerate until firm; reroll once to cut out more cookies. Refrigerate the cutouts until firm, about 30 minutes. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake the cookies, switching the position of the pans halfway through, until just golden, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the icing: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder into a large bowl. Beat in 6 tablespoons water with a mixer on medium speed until soft, glossy peaks form. Spread on the cookies and decorate with nonpareils.

Begin by preparing the vegetable base for the fish. Heat 1/3 cup of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the eggplant, season with salt and pepper and cook for 10 minutes until just tender. Set aside on a platter. Add the zucchini to the pan and cook in the same way until just tender and remove to the platter with the eggplant. Add to the pan, smashed anchovies, onion, garlic and fennel. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes until caramelized then add tomatoes and tomato paste and cook for a further 5 minutes until wilted. Season with salt and pepper and add the red pepper flakes. Combine all the vegetables together in a large roasting pan. Now prepare the fish. Get your fishmonger to prepare the tail piece of your fish so it is cleaned and boned, and ready to go when you get home. Begin by vertically scoring the fish in 4 places, skin side up so the cuts pierce the skin and reveal the flesh. Prepare the basil compound butter by chopping half of the basil and mixing it with the room temperature butter until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Season the piece of fish with salt and pepper and smear the top of the fish with basil butter then take the whole fish and transfer to the roasting tray and place on top of the bed of vegetables. Sprinkle the buttered fish with the bread crumb mixture. Place in hot oven and roast for 12 to 15 minutes for medium rare, then finish under the broiler for 2 minutes to crisp the skin. Do not over cook, otherwise the fish will be dry. To serve, portion the fish along the score marks, serve with a scoop of the vegetables. Put bread, herbs, garlic and 1/3 cup of olive oil in a food processor and pulse until you have the texture of coarse bread crumbs. They should be a vibrant green from the olive oil and the herbs. Season well with salt and pepper and toast over medium heat in a large saute pan until crispy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 30759,&quot;Fennel Focaccia 2 teaspoons fennel seeds 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/4 cups warm water 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast (from one 1/4-ounce packet) 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 head fennel, cored and thinly sliced (about 1 cup)<br> Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling Instructions: Cook the fennel seeds in a small dry skillet over medium heat, stirring, until toasted, about 3 minutes. Combine the flour, water, 3 tablespoons olive oil, the yeast, sugar, kosher salt and the toasted fennel seeds in a large bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface, dust with more flour and knead, stretching the dough and folding it over itself, until smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes (dust with more flour as needed). Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br> Brush the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch nonstick baking dish with 3 tablespoons olive oil, letting the excess oil pool on the bottom. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and push it to the edges with your fingers (it should almost fill the pan). Cover and let rise again until the dough is puffed and the pan is full, about 1 hour.<br> Uncover the dough and press deep dimples all around with your fingers. Scatter the fennel over the dough and drizzle with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, letting some oil pool in the dimples. Sprinkle generously with flaky salt. Cover and let rise again until small bubbles appear in the dough, about 30 minutes.

Spread each with a strip of warm refried beans down the center. Top with the chicken (warmed), Crema, avocado and tomatoes. Lightly toss the watercress with the lime juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper and place over each burrito. Fold the bottom quarter of each tortilla up and then roll from the side into a cylinder. In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, place the flour, shortening and salt. Beat with the paddle until crumbly, about 3 to 5 minutes. With the mixer running, gradually add the warm water and continue mixing until the dough is smooth, about 3 minutes. Divide the dough into 3 pieces. Roll each into a ball and place on a baking tray or board. Cover with a towel and let rest at room temperature at least 15 minutes or up to one hour. Cut out eight 12 inch squares of waxed or parchment paper for stacking the tortillas. On a lightly floured board, roll each ball into a 10-inch circle, and transfer to a paper square. Stack on a baking tray or platter and refrigerate until cooking time. Uncooked tortillas can be kept in the refrigerator, well wrapped with paper squares between the layers, up to 2 days. To cook, heat a dry griddle or 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Carefully peel off the paper and cook the tortillas, one at a time, until puffy and slightly brown, about 30 to 45 seconds per side. Set aside to cool slightly on a towel lined platter. Bring to the table wrapped in a towel for warmth, or wrap well and refrigerate or freeze for quesadilla or other dishes. In large bowl whisk together cream and buttermilk. Cover and set in a warm place (a gas oven with just the heat from the pilot light for example) for 8 hours. Place in refrigerator.

Brussels Sprouts (about 12 ounces) 2 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup grated Parmesan (about 4 ounces) 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a 17.3-ounce box), thawed 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon honey Zest of 1 lemon (about 1 teaspoon) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spread the Brussels sprouts on a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with the oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Roast, stirring the sprouts once halfway through cooking, until golden brown and tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack and let cool completely, about 20 minutes. Leave the oven on. Line a second rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the Parmesan evenly on a work surface and lay the puff pastry sheet on top. Roll the pastry into a 12-inch square, sweeping up any loose Parmesan onto it and pressing it into place. Use an offset spatula or table knife to spread the butter over the pastry so it covers it from edge to edge in a thick, even coating. Lay the prosciutto over the butter so it covers the pastry completely. Cut the pastry square in half to make two 12-by-6-inch rectangles. Cut each rectangle crosswise into six 2-inch-wide, 6-inch-long strips. Then cut each strip diagonally so you have 24 long, narrow triangles. Place each Brussels sprout at the wide end of a pastry triangle, then roll it up toward the tip (it will look like a crescent roll with the Brussels sprout peeking out on each end). Transfer the rolls to the prepared baking sheet and space 1 inch apart. Sweep up any excess Parmesan from the work surface and sprinkle it on top of the rolls. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the Brussels sprouts are warmed through, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the mayonnaise, sour cream, honey, lemon zest, remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan and a generous amount of black pepper in a medium bowl. Transfer to a small serving dish.

Coat three 10-inch round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper; set aside. Combine the all-purpose flour, almond flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the milk and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until fluffy, 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Reduce the speed to low; beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the milk mixture, until combined. Stir in the hot coffee (the batter will be thin). Divide among the prepared pans. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out mostly clean, 30 to 45 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then turn out onto racks to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the ganache: Melt the chocolate chips with the heavy cream in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Let cool slightly. Add the cherries and let cool.<br> Make the buttercream: Combine the egg whites, sugar, salt and cream of tartar in the heatproof bowl of a mixer set over the pan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Heat, whisking, until a candy thermometer reaches 185 degrees F, 5 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the mixer and beat on medium-high speed until the egg whites are stiff and glossy and the bowl is cool to the touch, 10 minutes. Beat in the butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Add the cherry liqueur and continue to beat until smooth. Beat in cherry syrup, 1 teaspoon at a time, to tint the frosting pink. Spread half of the ganache on one cake and top with a second cake. Repeat with another layer of ganache and the remaining cake. Trim the sides of the cake with a serrated knife to make them even; crumble the trimmings. Frost the cake with the buttercream and pipe some around the top. Top with cherries and the reserved cake crumbs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 30794,&quot;Queen&#39;s Choice Quail with Fig and Date Sauce 2 fresh limes 8 whole quail (these are normally between 4 and 8 ounces each) Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 shallots, minced 1 cup dry red wine 8 fresh figs, chopped 8 dates, chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary leaves 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves 2 teaspoons salt Instructions: Early in the day, place the limes in s small bowl and microwave them for about 3 minutes to release the essential oils. Set aside briefly until they are just cool enough to handle. Rinse the quail and dry with paper towels. Set the quail in a non-reactive bowl and squeeze the lime juice over, and then season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Let sit refrigerated for about 3 or 4 hours. While the quail are marinating, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil over medium high heat in a medium saute pan and saute the shallots until translucent. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, and stir in figs and dates and let sauce reduce by half. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper as needed. On the episode, the quail were roasted over a spit. If you have a rotisserie arrangement you can roast them that way. Otherwise, preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine olive oil with rosemary, thyme, and salt, and rub over surface of the quail. Roast until tender but still juicy, about 20 minutes. Remove and let rest. Serve with fig and date sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 30795,&quot;Lobster Lasagna with a Red Pepper Coulis and Mint-Pesto Sauce 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 shallot, minced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups seafood stock 16 ounces fresh lobster meat, steamed Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 10 to 12 lasagna noodles Olive oil, for frying noodle ribbons Red pepper coulis, recipe follows Mint-Pesto sauce, recipe follows 2 red bell peppers 2 shallots, coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 2 to 3 plum tomatoes 8 ounces seafood stock 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1/4 cup walnuts 1 bunch cilantro leaves 3 cloves garlic, peeled 1 bunch fresh mint leaves 1 shallot, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper Instructions: In a large pot, bring just enough water to cover the pasta to a boil. In a large skillet, combine the garlic, shallot, butter and seafood stock. Saute over medium-high heat until garlic and shallot have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the lobster meat, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the lobster meat is heated through and the stock mixture reduces slightly. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm over low heat. Salt the boiling water and cook the noodles according to package directions. Once the noodles are tender, drain them into a colander, and then flatten them on a cutting board. Cut the ribbon edges off of the noodles and set aside. Toss the flattened noodles with the red pepper coulis, coating them well. In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat and add the ribbon edges of the noodles to the oil. Fry the ribbons until they are browned and crispy, and then remove them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Roast the red peppers directly over a gas flame on high heat, turning the pepper with tongs, until the skin is completely blackened. Place the peppers in a large sealed plastic bag, and allow the peppers to steam for 5 to 10 minutes so that the skin can be easily peeled off.<br> After peeling the skin, coarsely chop the pepper, removing the seeds and the inner membranes. In the work bowl of a food processor, pulse the shallots and garlic until they are finely minced. Add the tomatoes and seafood stock to the bowl, and then slowly drizzle the olive oil through the feeding tube of the processor while pureeing. Continue adding olive oil until the coulis achieves the desired consistency, not too runny. Season, to taste, with salt. In a medium-sized saute pan, toast the walnuts over medium heat until fragrant, approximately 5 minutes. Remove the walnuts from the pan, let cool for a few minutes, and place in the bowl of a food processor. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl and blend them together until the puree becomes a smooth, thick paste. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve as a side sauce for the lobster. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 30796,&quot;Parmesan Cheese Crackers 8 tablespoons (1 stick) cool unsalted butter 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan, (grana is okay, but it should be good quality) 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 6 fresh figs Instructions: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter until smooth and fluffy. Add the flour, cheese, and pepper and mix at low speed until blended. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 2 hours. (The recipe can be made up to this point and kept refrigerated up to 2 days in advance.) Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before rolling out. On well-floured parchment paper, roll out the dough into a rough rectangle, a little less than 1/4-inch thick. The dough will be somewhat delicate and may crack in places, but you can just push the edges together with your fingers. Carefully transfer the dough to the cookie sheet and prick evenly all over with a fork. Cut with a pizza cutter or a knife into 1 1/2-inch squares, making a grid. Bake in a preheated 375 degree F oven, just until the crackers turn golden, 15 to 20 minutes. As they come out of the oven, run your pizza cutter or knife again along the grid to separate the crackers (the edges will have baked together a little bit in the oven). Let cool on the pan, then gently separate the crackers with your hands. They will be slightly fragile. Cut the figs in half and serve with the crackers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 30797,&quot;Pickled Jalepenos 2 quarts red jalapenos 1-inch piece ginger root, smashed 1 clove garlic 1 quart rice vinegar 1 cup mirin 3 cups white wine 3 tablespoons salt 1 teaspoon coriander seed 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 teaspoon fennel seed 1 star anise 1 cup simple syrup (equal amounts sugar and water heated until sugar dissolves; cool) Instructions: Slice jalapenos thinly with a sharp knife (red jalapenos are usually to limp for a mandoline) and place in a container.

Insert 1 strip of cheese into each of the 8 remaining chiles. On a plate, mix together the cornmeal, flour, and salt. In a small bowl, thoroughly whisk the eggs. One at a time, dip the jalapenos into the beaten egg and then roll them in the cornmeal mixture until well coated. Let the jalapenos stand on a rack for 30 minutes to firm the coating. In a deep fryer or in a wide, deep pan fitted with a deep-fry thermometer, heat about 4 inches of corn oil (the fryer or pan should be no more than half full) to 375 degrees. Working in batches and using a slotted spoon, lower the jalapenos into the hot oil. Fry, turning the chiles gently, until they are just crisp and golden, about 4 minutes. (Overcooking the chiles may cause the fillings to boil away.) With the slotted spoon, transfer the fried jalapenos to absorbent paper. Keep the chiles warm in a 250 degree oven until all have been fried. Serve them hot or warm, accompanied by sour cream for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]</p><p>&quot; 30836,&quot;Mapo Tofu 4 stalks gai lan or Chinese broccoli Peanut or canola oil, for cooking<br> 2 cups shiitake mushrooms, stemmed 8 ounces millet, rinsed<br> 1 cup Chinese chives or scallions, chopped, plus more for garnish<br> 2 tablespoons doubanjiang or broad bean paste<br> 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger<br> 2 tablespoons minced garlic<br> 8 ounces Shaoxing, mirin or dry sherry 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce, plus more to taste<br> 2 teaspoons sugar<br> 1 to 2 teaspoons toasted and ground green or red Sichuan peppercorns, plus more for garnish<br> 8 ounces firm tofu, diced<br> Chinese cl oil, for drizzling<br> 1/2 cup fried or roasted peanuts<br> 1/4 cup crispy shallots<br> 4 sprigs fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Occasionally reach down to the bottom of the bowl and mix all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Beat the egg(s) in a small bowl and pour over the flour and butter mixture. Stir in with a fork until the dough begins to hold together, but still appears somewhat dry. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform.<br> To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1 tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1-second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse-ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible, about 15 pulses in all. Add the egg(s) to the work bowl and pulse ten times or so, until the dough forms a ball. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. Press the dough into a disk (two equal disks for the larger amount of dough).

Beat on medium-high speed until the egg whites reach the soft peak stage. Meanwhile, pour the remaining sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and bring to the soft-ball stage, without stirring, 240 degrees F. The egg whites and syrup should be ready at about the same time. If one is ready before the other then you can remove the pan from the heat or stop whipping for a few minutes. Continue to whip the egg whites on medium-high speed and slowly drizzle in the hot syrup, aiming the syrup between the side of the bowl and the beaters. Continue to whip until both the bottom of the bowl and the mixture are cool, 10 to 15 minutes. The mixture should be thick and will form firm peaks at this point. Beat in the salt. At this point you have an Italian meringue. While still beating on medium-high, add the butter, a few pieces at a time. As the butter is added, the buttercream may appear to thin out some, but it will thicken into firm peaks once all of the butter is added. Beat in the vanilla extract. If the buttercream is still too loose, beat on high speed until thickened. Use right away or refrigerate in an airtight container overnight. The buttercream may need to be beaten slightly to smooth out before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 30853,&quot;Island Drinks Splash B &amp; B 1- ounce gin 1- ounce cherry brandy 1/2- ounce lime juice 4 ounces club soda 2 ounces Jamaican rum 1- ounce Tiamaria 1- ounce strong coffee 1/2- ounce cold milk or cream 1-ounce club soda 2 ounces Campari 2 ounces vodka Instructions: Pour all ingredients over ice in a Collins glass.

Slice up your chosen vegetables any way you like, but if it&#39;s a larger vegetable try to get the pieces around 1/2-inch in thickness. This way, the flavors and pickling liquid will penetrate sufficiently. Smaller vegetables, like mushrooms or very small onions, can be left whole. Place the sliced vegetables in the boiling pickling liquid and leave for around 3 minutes - they&#39;ll probably rise to the surface, so keep pushing them down to ensure they are all immersed. Lift the pieces out with a slotted spoon and place them into your bowl of pickling marinade. Toss together - it will smell fantastic. Pretty much straightaway, put the hot vegetables and pickling marinade into your sterilized jars, filling them to the very top. Cover the vegetables completely with the marinade and put the lids on tightly. Put the jars aside until they&#39;re cool. Clean the jars, attach sticky labels and write the date and the contents on them. Store the jars somewhere cool and dark - it&#39;s best to leave them for about 2 weeks before opening so the vegetables really get to marinate well, but if you absolutely cannot wait, you can eat them sooner. They&#39;ll keep for about 3 months - but they&#39;re so bloody good I&#39;m lucky if the jars last for a couple of weeks in our house! \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Paddle the butter in stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until soft, light and the consistency of mayonnaise. Use a kitchen torch to gently warm the bowl if necessary. Add the sugar and paddle at medium speed until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl often, about 5 minutes. Add the cocoa powder and continue to paddle at medium speed until completely incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl 3 or 4 times to ensure all the cocoa powder is well mixed in, another 5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time and mix at medium speed until well incorporated. Scrape down the bowl and paddle after each addition. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and espresso powder in a medium bowl. With the mixture on the lowest speed, alternate adding the dry ingredients and water, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Scrape well. Paddle at top speed until smooth and slightly glossy, 5 to 6 minutes. Place the cake batter in a piping bag. Spray the donut molds with cooking spray. Pipe a thin layer of cake batter into each donut mold, enough to just cover the bottom, about 1/2 inch thick. Bake until the cake has set and a tester comes out clean, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool completely on a rack. Repeast to make 48 donut cakes total. For the marshmallow: Bloom the sheets of gelatin in some ice water. Combine the 1 1/4 cups sugar, corn syrup and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan and cook on medium-high heat until a candy thermometer reads 238 degrees F. Meanwhile, when the sugar reaches 218 degrees F, begin to whip the egg whites, salt and lemon juice with a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment at medium speed. When egg whites become frothy, gradually add 2 teaspoons granulated sugar. Continue to whip the egg whites to soft peaks. Time this well so egg whites are at soft peaks when the sugar mixture reaches 238 degrees F. Squeeze the excess water from the bloomed gelatin and add to the hot sugar mixture. Swirl the pot to melt the gelatin; do not stir. Remove from the heat. With the stand mixer on medium-low speed, slowly pour the hot sugar mixture into the whipping meringue, being careful not to let the sugar hit the whisk and splatter. When all the hot sugar mixture has been poured in, increase the mixer speed to high. Add a splash of vanilla extract and whip the marshmallow until the bowl is cool to the touch and the marshmallow holds its shape, but is still loose and glossy, about 8 minutes. Place the marshmallow in a piping bag with number 3 or 4 large round tip. Makes about 3 cups For the hippen tuile: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Paddle the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the sugar and paddle at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl often. Slowly add the egg whites and continue to paddle at medium speed until completely combined. Reduce the speed of the mixer to the lowest setting, add the flour and vanilla extract and mix until combined. The batter will resemble cake batter. Scoop tuile batter into a pastry bag fitted with a number 0 tip. Chill the batter until firm, about 20 minutes. Pipe the chilled batter into desired shapes (small rectangles to resemble buckles) on a baking sheet lined with a Silpat or silicone baking mat. The batter will be stiff; loosen it slightly by the kneading pasty bag with your hands. Chill the piped tuile cookies until the batter is firm, about 10 minutes. This is a very important step so that the cookies maintain their shapes. Bake the tuiles until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool completely before taking the cookies off the baking sheet. The tuiles will crisp as they cool. To assemble: Pipe a ring of marshmallow onto the bottom of a cake ring. Top with another cake ring, pressing down gently to distribute the marshmallow. Attach a buckle cookie to the marshmallow filling on the side. Repeat with the remaining whoopee pie pieces, marshmallows and tuiles.

Scrape the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and beat until incorporated. Beat in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture and beat on medium-low speed. Fold in the walnuts if using. The batter will be quite soft at this point. Refrigerate until firm enough to scoop, about 30 minutes. Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop heaping tablespoons of batter (a number-30 ice cream scoop works great, too) onto the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart (the cookies will spread considerably). (You will have additional batter for a second batch.) Bake until the tops of the cookies are crackled and no longer glossy and the edges are firm, 14 to 16 minutes, rotating the sheets about halfway through. Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. When the baking sheets are cool, repeat with the remaining batter. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 30882,&quot;Chicken with Spiralized Sweet Potato and Broccoli 1 sweet potato, ends trimmed 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 heads broccoli with thick stems, ends cut off and set aside and tops broken into florets<br> 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 1 teaspoon lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon toasted sliced almonds 1/4 cup freshly-grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Let stand in sink for 3 hours. Drain the squash and onions, transfer to a large colander and rinse well under cold water. Place a bowl over the vegetables, and add a couple cans of tomatoes or whatever you have on hand to weigh the bowl down to squeeze out as much of the water as possible.<br> Prepare the jars and lids: Wash all jars and lids thoroughly with soap and water and rinse well. Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1-inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil.<br> Make the brine: Bring the sugar, vinegars, mustard and celery seeds and turmeric to a rolling boil in a large nonreactive stockpot or Dutch oven. Add the squash and onions. Bring back to the boil, stirring gently. Remove from heat and allow to cool.<br> Make the relish: Transfer the pickles in batches to a food processor, and pulse until broken down to a fine, even consistency. Return the processed relish to a pan and bring back to a boil. Add the pectin, stir until completely dissolved and bring back to the boil for 1 minute.<br> Fill and close the jars: Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the relish in the saucepan. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the relish into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight.<br> Seal the jars: Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch of water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 10 minutes.<br> Remove and cool: Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately.<br> Label and store: Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year.

For the guajillo sauce: Remove the stems and seeds from the guajillos; tear the chiles in half lengthwise. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, toast the chiles and garlic until they become fragrant and start to brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the chiles to a bowl and add 2 cups boiling water, or enough to just cover. Set aside to rehydrate for 15 minutes. In a blender, add the chiles with their soaking water, and the toasted garlic, oregano, cumin and chicken broth. Puree until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the guajillo puree into a pan and bring to a simmer; cook gently until slightly thickened, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat, and stir in the salt, sugar and pepper. Cover and keep warm. Make the burritos: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the flour tortillas on a clean flat surface. In the middle of each tortilla, place about one-quarter of the chicken filling, and top with a 1/2 cup of the Chihuahua cheese. Spread the filling out slightly. Fold in the sides of the tortillas and then carefully roll them up into burritos. In a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat, place the burritos, seam side down, and cook to lightly brown and seal, about 1 minute. Turn and cook on the reverse side. Transfer the burritos to an oven-proof platter and cover completely in guajillo sauce. Sprinkle the remaining Chihuahua cheese over the top. Bake until the burritos are golden brown around the edges and the cheese is bubbly, 7 to 8 minutes. Garnish the burritos with a dollop of sour cream and some cilantro and scallions. Add a squeeze of lime juice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 30897,&quot;Dill Pickles 15 pickling cucumbers or Kirbies 3 cups water 2 cups white vinegar 1/4 cup coarse salt 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 2 whole cloves 1 bay leaf 1 medium onion, sliced 1 stalk celery, sliced 1/2 carrot, peeled and sliced 1 jalapeno pepper, sliced with seeds 8 garlic cloves, peeled 1 bunch dill 1 sprig thyme Instructions: Bring a large stockpot water to a boil.

Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve with falafel or as a salad dressing. Instructions: In a food processor, combine the chickpeas, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, cayenne, parsley, cilantro, egg, and lemon juice. Pulse to combine and season with salt. The mixture will not be smooth, but it should not have large chunks. Add in the baking powder and 1/3 cup of the flour and pulse to just combine. Remove to a bowl and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove the chickpea mixture from the refrigerator. Add enough oil to a large saute pan so it reaches 1/2-inch up the sides and heat it over medium-high heat until an inserted thermometer reads 360 degrees F. Meanwhile, drop spoonfuls of the chickpea mixture onto a plate with 1/4 cup flour. Roll into balls on the floured plate and press gently into patties. Fry in batches of hot oil for about 3 to 4 minutes each side and drain on paper towels. Serve the falafel on a bed of lettuce with chopped salted tomatoes, grated cucumber and White Bean Yogurt Sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 30919,&quot;Gnocchi with Blush Sauce 2 pounds potatoes (about 4 large potatoes), peeled and cut into chunks, boiled and cooled to room temperature 1 to 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 egg, beaten 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan 1/2 cup steamed spinach, cooled, and chopped fine in a food processor 1/4 cup milk (approximately), if needed to moisten dough 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter 1 medium onion, minced 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup hot milk 1 (8-ounce) can chunky tomato sauce Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces soft cream cheese 1/4 cup fresh chives, chopped Instructions: Mash potatoes in a bowl and 1 cup of the flour, reserving the rest to use if the gnocchi is not light and fluffy. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add beaten egg and cheese and mix everything well. Remove half the mixture to a separate bowl and stir in the chopped spinach. Knead the ingredients in each bowl lightly and on a floured board form into long cylinders. The gnocchi should have a light texture which is cohesive enough to remain whole while it is being boiled. If the mixture in either bowl is too wet, add the additional flour until the proper consistency is achieved. Conversely add milk if the dough is too dry, using only enough as needed to bring the dough together. Cut the long cylinders into pieces about 1-inch long and crimp with your fingertips into gnocchi dumplings which are roughly marquise-shaped. Bring a pot of water to boil for the gnocchi. Melt butter in a saucepan which will be large enough to accommodate the pound of cooked gnocchi, and saute onion until it becomes translucent. Mix in the flour to make a roux. Gradually add milk and allow to thicken. Stir in tomato sauce and heat through. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and add cream cheese. Blend with an immersion blender. Immediately cover surface of sauce with a sheet of plastic wrap and set aside briefly. Boil the gnocchi until al dente, drain, transfer to a serving dish, and spoon sauce over. Sprinkle with chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 30920,&quot;Compost Cookies 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats 1/2 cup rice cereal squares, such as Rice Chex 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus 10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature Kosher salt 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground coffee 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar 1 large egg 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate (around 60% cacao) 1/2 cup honey-roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped 1/2 cup dried sour cherries, chopped 1/2 cup lightly crushed salted potato chips Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> In a medium bowl, toss together the oats, cereal, melted butter and 1/8 teaspoon salt.

Over low heat, bring to a boil and turn off heat. In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Place over a pan of simmering water and continue to whisk vigorously until mixture becomes a very pale yellow and feels hot to the touch. Remove from heat and turn the cream up to high. It will come to a boil quickly because its already hot. Pour the boiling cream into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Place the bowl over a larger bowl half-filled with ice cubes. Stir occasionally until cool. Strain through a fine strainer and refrigerate, covered, until ready to use. In a small saucepan, combine l cup cream with butter and heat until butter melts and cream is hot. Keep warm. Spoon the corn syrup into a medium deep saucepan and top with the sugar. On medium heat, cook until mixture turns a deep amber color and temperature reaches 225 degrees on a candy thermometer, stirring often with a wooden spoon. As the mixture turns golden, check the thermometer often. Immediately remove pan from heat and pour cream mixture into the sugar, stirring to combine well. Mixture will bubble up as you pour, so be careful not to burn yourself. Stir in remaining l/4 cup cream. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a heatproof bowl. If not using the sauce immediately, let cool and refrigerate, covered, until needed. This will keep for weeks in the refrigerator. Yield: l l/2 cups Thaw one package of frozen puff pastry sheets or use homemade puff pastry. Cut out circles of puff pastry to fit into a six-inch tartlette pan.

Next add the butter and pulse to pebble-size granules. With the food processor running, slowly stream in the cold grape juice -- stop when the dough comes together, even if you haven&#39;t added the full 1/4 cup. Remove the dough from the food processor, form into a disc, and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. For the grape and ricotta filling: To a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the crumbled almond paste, granulated sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of the crushed sea salt. Turn the mixer on low speed and slowly increase the speed to medium-high. Continue to beat the almond paste on high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until the sugar is completely combined with the almond paste. (The mixture will have softened for the most part, but some of the almond paste will still have the texture of sand.) Add the ricotta, lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg and one of the eggs. Beat on medium-high for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl halfway through to ensure the almond paste is completely combined with the ricotta. Set aside at room temperature until ready to use. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the rested dough from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature; this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour. Just before rolling out the dough, combine the green grapes, red grapes, honey and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon crushed sea salt in a bowl. Set aside. (Do not let the mixture sit for any length of time or the grapes will release too much liquid.) On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 14-inch round. Roll the crust onto the rolling pin, then unroll it onto the prepared baking sheet; arrange in the center of the baking sheet (the sides will overhang by a couple inches). Using an offset spatula, evenly spread the ricotta frangipane onto the crust, leaving a 2-inch border. Mound the grape mixture (and any honey from the bowl) in the center of the frangipane, leaving at least a 2-inch border of frangipane. Gently fold the sides of the crust toward the center, covering 1 to 2 inches of the grapes. Allow the dough to fold over and land naturally; the galette doesn&#39;t have to look perfect, as long as all the sides are folded over to seal the filling inside the dough. Whisk the remaining egg and brush it generously over the crust. Sprinkle the turbinado sugar over the crust and grapes. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. When done, the crust will be a deep golden brown, the grapes will have browned slightly but still hold their shape, and the frangipane will look set except for a little bubbling in the center. Let cool. For the red wine syrup: In a medium saucepan, combine the red wine, granulated sugar and fennel seed. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced to about 3/4 cup, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the fennel seeds from the syrup and let cool; the syrup will thicken as it cools. If the syrup becomes too thick, stir in warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency. (Makes 3/4 cup.) To serve: Slice the galette and drizzle with red wine syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 30932,&quot;Braised and Charred Octopus Taco 3 pounds baby octopus One 750-ml bottle red wine<br> One 32-ounce carton chicken stock<br> 3 carrots, coarsely chopped<br> 1 head garlic, coarsely chopped, plus 4 cloves 1 yellow onion, coarsely chopped<br> 1 shallot, coarsely chopped<br> Salt and black pepper<br> Red pepper flakes<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil Juice of 1 lemon 2 cups arugula 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar<br> Salt and black pepper 1 tablespoons olive oil 1 clove garlic Juice of 1 to 2 lemons<br> 1 can black olives<br> 1 jar Kalamata olives<br> 1/2 jar green olives 1/2 cup pistachios 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves Pinch red pepper flakes<br> Salt and black pepper 2 cups white vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 tablespoon salt<br> Pinch red pepper<br> 5 or 6 carrots, shaved on a mandolin<br> 3 Thai chiles<br> 16 ounces Greek yogurt Juice of 2 lemons<br> 3 cloves garlic<br> Salt and black pepper<br> Pinch red pepper flakes<br> Corn tortillas, for serving Instructions: For the octopus: Add the octopus, red wine, chicken stock, carrots, 1 head garlic, onion, shallot and some salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes to a large stockpot.

Boil until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove soybeans from their pods and add to a pot (reserving about 1/2 cup for texture in a separate bowl) along with chicken stock. Set aside until needed, at which time you will heat and then puree just before serving. For the rice: Rinse rice in strainer under cold water. Add rice, 3 3/4 cups cold water and salt to a saucepot. Cover and let soak for a half hour. Remove lid, then turn heat to medium and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes without removing the lid. Transfer to a mixing bowl, stir in tarragon, vinegar, and cover with a clean damp kitchen towel and keep at room temperature. For the stuffing: Remove the meat from the Peking duck, reserving the skin and bones in a saute pan. Finely shred enough duck meat to make 6 tablespoons shredded duck, and place in a mixing bowl. Stir in scallions, hoisin sauce, and ginger soy syrup and set aside at room temperature until needed. For the filet mignon: Cut a slit in the top center of each steak to hold the stuffing. With a spice grinder, with a mortar and pestle (if you are strong and persistent), or with a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, pulverize the wasabi peas, peppercorns, and salt, together. Stuff the steaks with even amounts of the duck mixture and tie up with butcher&#39;s string to help them keep their shape through the searing process. Coat each filet with the wasabi/peppercorn mixture and set aside briefly. Return to the edamame and heat the beans and chicken stock over medium-high heat until the chicken stock is reduced by half. Remove from heat and keep warm. For the sauce: To the pan of duck skin and bones, add enough water to cover and the demi-glace. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half and strain through a chinois. Discard the skin and bones. Season the reduction with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer to a small bowl and keep warm by nesting the bowl in another bowl of hot water. To cook the filet mignon: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Heat 1 tablespoon of the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in a saute pan with oven safe handles (reserving the other tablespoon of oil). When the oil begins to shimmer add the steaks to the pan, stuffed side down first, and sear, leaving undisturbed for the first 2 minutes or so to let the caramelization process begin to allow the stuffing to integrate into the meat and to prevent tearing the beef. Add the reserved grapeseed oil and flip the steaks, searing the other side in the same way, leaving undisturbed for about 2 or 3 minutes. Transfer to the oven to finish to an internal temperature of 125 degrees F as measured with an instant-read thermometer, about 8 to 15 minutes depending on the thickness. Remove from oven and let carryover cook to about 132 degrees F for medium-rare, or cook to your liking. When you have placed the filet mignon in the oven, puree the edamame with an immersion blender and toss in the reserved whole beans for texture. Cover and keep warm. Remove steaks from oven, if done, and let rest as indicated above. For the rice: Using a 3-inch circle cutter, form the sushi rice into \\cakes.\\ Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and lightly fry the rice circles until golden brown on each side. Leave each side undisturbed for the first 2 to 3 minutes to prevent the \\cakes\\ from breaking apart. For the carrots, heat the canola oil in a saute pan and deep-fry carrots. Spoon some edamame puree in the left center of serving plate and some duck essence (sauce) on the right center of plate. Place a sauteed circle of rice in the center topped with a stuffed steak and 2 fried carrots on the very top.

In a large skillet, heat the canola oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper and cook until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the thyme leaves. Break up the cornbread in a bowl, add the onion-thyme mixture and stir to combine. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper. Sear the pork, turning as needed, until golden brown all around, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool completely. Reserve the skillet to make the sauce. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. On a cutting board, lay out the ham slices, overlapping them to create a rectangle about 12 inches long. Rub the tenderloin completely with the mustard and place over the ham slices. Wrap the ham over the tenderloin to seal in the mustard. Lay out the puff pastry sheet on a floured surface and roll out to a rectangle with the long sides 2 inches longer than the pork tenderloin. Spread the cornbread mixture around the pastry sheet, leaving about a 1-inch border all the way around. Place the wrapped tenderloin along one of the long sides of the pastry. Roll the tenderloin up in the pastry, making sure it&#39;s completely wrapped. Fold in the pastry ends, brush with the beaten egg and tuck in.

Bollocks. All you need to do is peel off the excess huskage (leaving the cob with 2 or 3 layers of husk still intact) and yank off the silk. Then simply place the corn on the hottest part of the grill and turn 1/4 rotation every 2 to 3 minutes, as the husk starts to blacken. When the entire husk begins to resemble blackened carbon, remove from grill. Peel away blackened husk and serve with Red Bell Pepper Butter. F.Y.I., the heat of the grill causes the natural sugars in the corn to caramelize and some of the kernels to turn brown. The more browning, the sweeter the corn. Roast the red peppers whole over a charcoal flame or under a broiler, turning until entirely blackened. Remove from the grill and immediately place in a paper bag. Seal bag and let sit for 10 minutes. Peel off the charred skin and discard. Slice the peeled peppers open and discard the membranes and seeds. In a food processor, puree the butter, peppers, basil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Divide butter into 4 equal amounts, place each portion on tin foil, waxed paper or plastic wrap, then roll into a butter log, approximately 1 1/4-inches in diameter. Return to refrigerator until butter hardens. To serve, remove from foil, and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Flavored butter may be kept refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for 1 month. It is excellent on burgers, veal chops, steaks, baked potatoes, or on toasted crusty bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 30943,&quot;Arugula Salad with Pear, Blue Cheese and Apricot Vinaigrette 2 bunches arugula, washed and dried, stems trimmed (Look for 5 or 6 ounce sacks of washed and trimmed arugula leaves, available in some markets) 1 head bibb lettuce, torn 1 ripe pear, thinly sliced 1/2 lemon, juiced 8 ounces Maytag or other blue cheese, crumbled 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1/4 cup apricot all fruit spread, found near jams and jellies (preferred brand Polaner) 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, eyeball the amount Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine arugula leaves and bibb lettuce in a salad bowl.

Meanwhile place the gelatin in enough cold water to submerge the gelatin completely, about 1 1/2 cups. Soak the gelatin until softened. Once soft, remove the gelatin from the water, squeezing out excess water. Add the gelatin to the hot liquid and stir to melt. Let cool slightly then stir in the yogurt. Strain the mixture into a clean bowl. Chill over an ice bath until it starts to thicken. Fold in the whipped cream. Pour into individual 4-ounce molds or ramekins, or a large mold or ring mold, and chill for 2 hours. When ready to serve, dip in hot water 10 seconds to remove from the molds and turn them out onto dessert plates. To make the compote, place the blueberries, sugar, orange juice and lemon juice in a saucepan and bring just to a boil. Stir the fruit once, turn off the heat and let it stew on its own for 5 minutes. Serve cold or at room temperature, spooned around the panna cotta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 30978,&quot;Pickled Mango With Ginger 1 cinnamon stick 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns 3 cardamom pods, crushed 3/4 cup distilled white vinegar 1/4 cup sugar Juice of 1/2 lemon Kosher salt 6 thin slices peeled ginger 2 dried chiles de arbol 2 large firm mangoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges Instructions: Heat the cinnamon stick, cumin seeds, peppercorns and cardamom in a small skillet over medium-low heat, stirring, until toasted, about 4 minutes.

While the ganache is still warm, pour over the cake. Using a palette knife sparingly, gently swipe 1 or 2 times to spread the ganache evenly over the top and so that it runs down the sides and covers them. Let the cake sit until the ganache sets up, about 30 minutes to 1 hour. While the ganache is setting up begin making the wings. Cut the remaining cake in half, lengthwise. Cut the remaining cardboard round in half as well and place each cake half on one of the cardboard halves. Using the red buttercream and a palette knife, frost both halves completely. Try to make the frosting appear to be as smooth as possible. Place the black licorice rounds on the wings to make ladybug spots. Once the ganache is set up, assemble the ladybug. Allow 2 inches in the front of the ganache cake for the ladybug&#39;s face. Place the 2 halves behind the 2-inch face with 2 corners touching right behind the head and at an angle to each other. The wings should be in position for the ladybug to fly away. Place the candy wafers on the ganache cake to create eyes. Using a small dab of leftover frosting, secure the candy coated chocolates to the wafers to make pupils. Cut the licorice whip to the desired length and lightly press into the ganache to create a mouth. Use the remainder of the licorice whip to create antennae. ***To cut this cake for serving, remove the wings and cut separately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 30983,&quot;Hot Chocolate Cheesecake 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more butter for the pan 9 graham crackers (about 1 sleeve) 1/4 cup hot chocolate or cocoa mix Pinch fine salt Four 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 2/3 cup hot chocolate or cocoa mix 1 cup sour cream 6 large eggs, at room temperature 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 10 marshmallows Instructions: For the crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 325 degrees F. Butter the inside of a 9-inch springform pan. Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor until finely ground. Add the butter, hot chocolate mix and salt, and pulse until the mixture comes together and holds its shape when squeezed. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, and press it into the bottom to make an even layer. Bake until the crust is just firm, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely. Place the pan on a large piece of foil, and fold the foil up the sides of the pan. (This helps seal the pan, to keep water out while baking.) For the filling: Wipe out the food processor. Pulse the cream cheese, sugar, hot chocolate mix and sour cream until completely smooth, without any lumps, scraping down the side of the bowl a few times. Add the eggs and vanilla, and pulse until incorporated. Pour the filling into the crust, and set the pan inside a roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to go halfway up the side of the springform pan (but not above the foil). Bake the cheesecake until the edge is set but the center jiggles slightly (when you gently shake the pan, the cheesecake should move in a cohesive wave motion), 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. Turn the oven off, and open the door for a few seconds to let out some heat. Close the door, and let the cheesecake sit in the oven until cooked completely through, 1 hour more. Transfer the springform pan to a cooling rack. Run a knife around the edge, and let the cheesecake cool to room temperature. Wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. Before serving, cut the marshmallows on the diagonal, and arrange them, cut-side down, in a neat line all over the top edge of the cheesecake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 30984,&quot;Stovetop Pork Chops with Cabbage and Apples 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 2 teaspoons caraway seeds 2 teaspoons crushed coriander seeds 2 small heads savoy cabbage, cored, leaves cleaned of ribs and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 2 teaspoons freshly ground white pepper, plus more for seasoning 2 knobs fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated 1 teaspoon dry ginger 1 small can whole, peeled tomatoes 1 poblano pepper, washed, cored and seeded, cut into thin slices 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves 5 pork loin chops (bone-on), about 1 1/2 inches thick 1 teaspoon Hungarian paprika 3 tablespoons canola oil 2 green apples, washed, cored, halved and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices 1 to 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar Instructions: In a large saute pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the cumin, caraway and coriander seeds toasting them slightly for 30 seconds. Do not let them turn dark brown. Immediately add the cabbage. Toss to coat with the butter and spices. Season with salt, white pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring from time to time, 10 to 15 minutes. Taste, for seasoning. Add the fresh ginger, dry ginger, tomatoes, and poblano pepper and stir to blend. Taste for seasoning and cook for 5 to 8 minutes or until the cabbage is tender. Lower the heat and add the cilantro. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Remove from the heat and keep warm while cooking the pork chops. Note: I find the cabbage tastes even better the next day when all of the flavors have had time to meld together. Heat a skillet large enough to hold the pork chops in a single layer. Season each chop on both sides with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with paprika. Pour oil in the skillet. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, remove the pan from the heat and gently arrange the pork chops in a single layer. Immediately return the skillet to the heat and brown on the first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a pair of tongs or a spatula to turn the chops on their second side. Brown about 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Turn the chops back to the first side and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Season them again, lightly, with salt and pepper. Heat the cabbage, stir in the apple slices and add the red wine vinegar. Arrange cabbage on the bottom of a serving platter. Remove the pork chops and place them on top of the cabbage. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 30985,&quot;Creme Brulee 1 quart heavy cream 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 1 cup vanilla sugar, divided 6 large egg yolks 2 quarts hot water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.<br> Place the cream, vanilla bean and its pulp into a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and reserve for another use.<br> In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks until well blended and it just starts to lighten in color. Add the cream a little at a time, stirring continually. Pour the liquid into 6 (7 to 8-ounce) ramekins. Place the ramekins into a large cake pan or roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake just until the creme brulee is set, but still trembling in the center, approximately 40 to 45 minutes.<br> Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. Remove the creme brulee from the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes prior to browning the sugar on top.

Parboil the carrots in boiling, salted water for 10 minutes, until they are very nearly cooked, then drain and put them into a roasting pan. You should flavor them while they&#39;re steaming hot, so while the carrots are cooking get a pestle and mortar and smash up the cumin seeds, chilles, salt and pepper. Add the garlic and thyme leaves and smash up again until you have a kind of paste. The idea here is to build up the flavors. Add enough extra-virgin olive oil to generously cover the paste, and a good swig of vinegar. This will be like a marinade, a rub and a dressing all in one! Stir together, then pour over the carrots in the pan, coating them well. Add the orange and lemon halves, cut side down. These will roast along with the carrots, and their juice can be used as the basis of the dressing. Place in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden. While the carrots are roasting, halve and peel the avocados, discarding the pits, then cut them into wedges lengthwise and place in a big bowl. Remove the carrots from the oven and add them to the avocados. Carefully, using some tongs, squeeze the roasted orange and lemon juice into a bowl and add the same amount of extra-virgin olive oil and a little swig of red wine vinegar. Season, and pour this dressing over the carrots and avocados. Mix together, have a taste and correct the seasoning. Call your gang round the table while you toast or broil your ciabatta slices. Tear the toasted bread into little pieces and add to the dressed carrot and avocado. Mix together, toss in the salad leaves and cress and transfer to a big platter or divide between individual plates. Spoon over a nice dollop of sour cream, sprinkle over your toasted seeds and drizzle over some extra-virgin olive oil.

Lay several wonton wrappers on a work surface. Scoop a generous tablespoon of the ricotta filling into the center of each wrapper, and brush outside edges with egg white. Lay another wonton wrapper on top of each, and press firmly with fingertips to press out air and seal ravioli. Transfer ravioli to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wonton wrappers and filling, making 18 to 20 ravioli total. Cover baking sheet with a damp paper towel and transfer to refrigerator to set up, about 30 minutes. To make the spinach pesto: In a food processor, combine remaining 3/4 cup hazelnuts, lemon juice, spinach, garlic, parmesan, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste and puree until smooth. Fill a large pot with water, salt liberally, and bring to a boil. Cook ravioli in three batches, until they are cooked and float to the top, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Watch carefully. When the sugar beings to melt and turn clear, gently swirl the pan occasionally. When the sugar turns an amber color, after about 15 minutes total, whisk in the cream. Be careful because the caramel will bubble up slightly. Let cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Port]&quot; 30990,&quot;Chocolate Caramel Tarts 1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa 1 large egg yolk 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup water 2 cups sugar 1/4 cup light corn syrup 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons creme fraiche 1/2 cup heavy cream 3 1/2 ounces extra-bittersweet chocolate, chopped A pinch fine sea salt, such as fleur de sel Instructions: To prepare the tart dough, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar until combined, about 1 minute. Add the cocoa and beat until incorporated. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and beat until smooth. Sift in the flour and beat on low speed until just combined. Scrape the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and form it into a disk. Wrap and chill until firm, about 1 hour, or up to 3 days. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the tart dough 3/16-inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out 24 rounds of dough and press them into mini-muffin tins or 2 dozen 2-inch tart pans, trimming away any excess dough; prick the dough all over with a fork. Chill the tart shells for 20 minutes. Line the tart shells with foil and fill with dried beans, rice, or pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights and bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer or until the pastry looks dry and set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Remove cooled shells from tart pans and transfer to a plate. To prepare the filling, place the water in a large saucepan. Add the sugar and corn syrup and cook the mixture over medium-high heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until you have a dark amber caramel, about 10 minutes. Carefully whisk in the butter, cream, and creme fraiche (the mixture will hiss and bubble up so stand back), whisking until smooth. (The caramel can be made up to 5 days ahead and refrigerated). Divide the caramel among the tart shells while still warm (or reheat the caramel in the microwave or over low heat until it is pourable) and let sit until the caramel is set, at least 20 minutes. To make the glaze, in a saucepan, bring the cream to a boil. Place the chocolate in a bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, add a pinch of sea salt, and let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Pour some of the glaze over each of the tarts while it is still warm. Let the glaze set at room temperature for at least 2 hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]&quot; 30991,&quot;Hot and Sour Salmon with Greens 2 1/2 pounds baby bok choy, or bok choy, stem ends and leaf tips trimmed 8 to 9 whole scallions, ends trimmed, cut into thin julienne slices on the diagonal 3 heaping tablespoons fresh ginger, cut into very thin julienne shreds 6 salmon steaks, about 6 ounces each 6 tablespoons soy sauce 3 1/2 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar or Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup sugar, or to taste 2 tablespoons minced garlic Steamed rice Instructions: Trim the tough outer leaves from the bok choy and discard.

Place the bread in a food processor and, using the metal blade, process until finely crumbled. Measure and reserve 2 tablespoons of the bread crumbs to use in the filling. The remaining bread crumbs will be used to coat the crab cakes. Mix the crabmeat with the sweet peppers, garlic, jalapeno, cilantro leaves, and mayonnaise. Add the \\Old Bay\\ seasoning powder, 2 tablespoons of the bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Mix well, then refrigerate for twenty minutes before continuing. Cover a work surface with waxed paper sprinkled with the reserved bread crumbs. Using a 2-ounce ice cream scoop, form eight equal-size portions of crabmeat. With the palm of your hand pat each portion into a disk-shaped cake approximately 3/4-inch thick. It is important for the crab cakes to be the same thickness so that they will cook uniformly. Press each cake into the bread crumbs, turning them so they coat evenly on all sides. Refrigerate for at least an hour to prevent them from crumbling during cooking. No more than half an hour before you plan to serve the crab cakes, add enough oil to cover the bottom of an oven-proof saute pan. Heat until just before it begins to smoke. Add the crab cakes gently, being careful not to crowd the pan. (Cook them in two batches if necessary.) When the crab cakes are well browned on both sides, place in a 375 degree F. oven for six minutes to ensure that they are fully cooked and hot at the center. Serve with mesclun salad, chili mayonnaise and garnish with finely chopped tomato. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 31003,&quot;Gingered Sweet Potatoes 6 tablespoons butter 6 garlic cloves, peeled 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 4 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and roughly chopped Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat a small saucepan over medium heat.

Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until they can be pierced easily with the tip of a knife, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and transfer to a food processor. Add the cream and process until well blended. Add the remaining butter, season with salt and pepper, and puree until smooth. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl, correct the seasonings, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 31004,&quot;Cupcake Christmas Tree Paper mini cupcake liners 2 cups sugar 1 3/4 cups flour 3/4 cup cocoa powder 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 1 cup whole milk 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon almond extract 1 cup boiling water 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened at room temperature 1 pound confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 to 4 tablespoons whole milk Green sprinkles or jimmies 1 small 11-inch styrofoam cone (you can get this at a craft shop or in the craft department of a large discount store) 30 to 40 toothpicks 10 small candy canes 1/2 cup fresh cranberries Gold leaf Gold and red curling ribbon Sugar, for snow Instructions: Cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the cups of 2 to 4 mini muffin tins with paper liners (you can bake the cupcakes in batches if necessary). Mix the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the eggs and milk and mix until well combined. Drizzle in the oil and the vanilla and almond extracts and mix. With the mixer running at low speed, add the boiling water and mix just until smooth. Fill the lined muffin cups about 2/3 full. Bake until risen and firm to the touch, about 20 minutes. Let cool in the pans. Frosting: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the butter until smooth. Add the sugar, vanilla, and 2 tablespoons milk and mix until smooth. Add more milk a little at a time until the frosting is thick and spreadable. Using a flexible spatula, frost the tops of the cooled cupcakes. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before assembling the tree.<br> To assemble the tree, spread a thick layer of sprinkles out on a plate. Dip the tops of the cupcakes in the sprinkles and set aside. Tie curling ribbon around the candy canes and curl with a scissor blade. One inch up from the bottom of the styrofoam cone, stick toothpicks into the cone 1 1/2 inches apart, making a circle around the cone and leaving them sticking out at least 1 inch. Place the cone on a serving platter. Make the bottom ring of cupcakes by spearing the bottom of a cupcake onto one of the toothpicks in the cone, with the frosting facing out and with the side of the cupcake resting on the plate. One inch above the tops of the first row of cupcakes, place another row of toothpicks 1 1/2 inches apart, all around the cone, positioning them so that the second row will rest between the tops of the first row. You will fit fewer cupcakes on the second row; feel free to cut a cupcake in half if necessary to fit into the space available. Spear the cupcakes onto the toothpicks as before. Continue up the cone to form a tree of cupcakes, ending with a single cupcake on top. Serve within one hour, or refrigerate up to 24 hours. Stick the candy canes in the styrofoam and stick gilded cranberries on with a little extra icing. Pour sugar on the serving platter around the tree. To gild the cranberries, roll them on the sheets of gold leaf to roughly coat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 31005,&quot;Jack-O&#39;-Lantern Onion Dip Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking dish 1 large egg<br> One 13.8-ounce tube refrigerated pizza dough<br> All-purpose flour, for rolling 12 cubes sharp Cheddar plus 1 cup shredded, plus more for sprinkling on top<br> 1 to 2 jalape?os, sliced 1/4 inch thick 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan 1/2 cup chopped fresh chives 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 medium yellow onion, grated<br> 3 blue corn tortilla chips, plus more for serving 1/4 cup black olives, sliced<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Port, Sherry, Madeira]&quot; 31016,&quot;Quick and Easy Bacon, Egg and Cheese 2 large eggs 2 tablespoons whole milk Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 2 slices sharp Cheddar cheese, about 1 ounce (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 slices cooked bacon (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 slices toasted white bread or 1 kaiser roll, split Instructions: Whisk the eggs, milk, a pinch of salt and a couple of grinds of black pepper in a small bowl until smooth and combined. Heat the vegetable in a medium non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Once the skillet is warm, pour the egg mixture in and allow it to cook undisturbed until the edges are set, about 1 minute. Use a spatula to gently lift the edges of the egg and allow the uncooked egg to run underneath. Once the egg is fully set, about 4 minutes, place the slices of cheese in the center of the egg. Carefully lift each side of the egg and folder it over the cheese to form a square package about the size of your toasted bread. Flip the eggs over gently, keeping the package intact, and allow the folded side to cook and melt the cheese, about 30 seconds more.<br> Assemble the sandwich by layering the bacon on 1 slice of toast and then topping with the warm eggs. Top with the remaining slice of toast and serve immediately.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 31017,&quot;Almost-Famous Soft Pretzels 1 cup milk 1 package active dry yeast 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing 1 teaspoon fine salt 1/3 cup baking soda 2 tablespoons coarse salt 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon cider vinegar Instructions: Make the pretzels: Warm the milk in a saucepan until it&#39;s about 110 degrees F; pour into a medium bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Let the yeast soften, about 2 minutes; stir in the brown sugar and 1 cup flour with a wooden spoon. Dice 2 tablespoons butter and soften; stir into the mix. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour and the fine salt to make a sticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding more flour if needed, until smooth but still slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Shape into a ball, place in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and grease a large baking sheet. Punch the dough to deflate it, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface. (If the dough seems tight, cover and let rest until it relaxes.) Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Roll and stretch each piece with the palms of your hands into a 30-inch rope, holding the ends and slapping the middle of the rope on the counter as you stretch. Form each rope into a pretzel shape. Dissolve the baking soda in 3 cups warm water in a shallow baking dish. Gently dip each pretzel in the soda solution, then arrange on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with the coarse salt. Bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Prepare the sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, mustard, brown sugar and vinegar in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate. Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons butter in a shallow dish. Dip the hot pretzels in the butter, turning to coat; place on a wire rack to let excess butter drip off. Serve the pretzels warm with the sweet mustard sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31018,&quot;Keto Pink Drink 1/3 cup freeze-dried strawberries 1 tea bag acai green tea 2 tablespoons powdered erythritol sweetener 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: Crush half the freeze-dried strawberries to a coarse powder using the back of a spoon or a small food processor.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cream the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy. Slowly add and combine the yeast mixture, and the extracts. In a separate bowl whisk together the cake flour, all-purpose flour and salt and gradually add them to your mixture. Caution: Do not over mix, but make sure to keep your mixture homogenous. Prepare a cookie sheet with pan spray and drop spoonfuls of dough 3 to 4 inches apart. Bake until the edges begin to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before decorating. Place chocolate into 2 separate bowls, 1 for dark and 1 for white. Slowly boil the cream in 2 separate pots. Pour 1 pot cream over the dark and 1 pot over the white and let chocolate melt. Whisk each until smooth. To decorate: While the ganache is slightly warm, have fun with it. Maybe some of it will even end up on the cookies!

For the vegetables: In a small bowl, whisk together the seasoning, mustard, oil and salt and pepper, to taste. Toss with the vegetables and spread in a layer on the bottom of a roasting pan. For the chicken: Season the chicken with the chicken seasoning. Place the chicken on the vegetables in the roasting pan. Roast until golden and an instant-read thermometer registers 150 degrees F when inserted in the thickest part of the thigh, 50 minutes to 1 hour. For the glaze: While the chicken is roasting, whisk together all the ingredients for the glaze in a pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened slightly. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. When the chicken is nearly cooked through, completely coat the outside with the glaze using a pastry brush. Pour any remaining glaze over the vegetables. Roast until an instant-read thermometer registers 175 degrees F when inserted in the thickest part of the thigh, an additional 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Garnacha]&quot; 31022,&quot;Korean Quinoa Bowl 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for cooking eggs 1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps sliced Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound bean sprouts Juice of 2 limes 4 teaspoons sesame oil 2 cups cooked red quinoa (season with salt, cook in a rice cooker in a ratio of 2 water to 1 red quinoa, and refrigerate) 1 pack toasted nori sheets 1 head organic baby lettuce, picked, washed and dried 2 tablespoons toasted white sesame seeds 1 cup kimchi, sliced 4 ounces soft tofu 4 large eggs 1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced, for garnish Leaves from 1/2 bunch cilantro, for garnish Instructions: Heat a large cast-iron pan, and add the vegetable oil. Once the oil is hot, add the mushrooms and some salt and pepper and cook until golden brown. Transfer the mushrooms to a plate, and refrigerate. Put the bean sprouts in a tall plastic container, add some salt and 4 tablespoons of the lime juice and refrigerate. Before you cook the eggs, gather all the ingredients and start building your bowls: Add 1 teaspoon of the sesame oil into each of 4 bowls, and spread it around with a plastic spatula. Distribute the quinoa evenly among the bowls, and continue with the nori, lettuce, sesame seeds, kimchi and tofu. (I like to keep everything separated near the edge of the bowl.) Once the bowls are filled, heat a large nonstick pan over medium heat, add enough oil to coat the whole pan and add the eggs. Cook to desired doneness (I prefer mine sunny-side up, so the yolks can coat all the ingredients). Once the eggs are cooked, season with salt and pepper, and place 1 egg in the middle of each bowl.

In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup of cold water to a boil over high heat. Add ham and return to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 20 minutes. Drain ham, set aside to cool. Slice into paper-thin slices, then stack a few at a time and cut into julienne strips to make about 1/2 cup. Soak mushrooms in 1/2-cup cold water for about 30 minutes. When softened, drain and squeeze mushrooms dry, reserving the liquid. Cut off and discard stems, and thinly slice caps. Cut chicken into scant 1/2-inch thick slices and place in medium bowl. Add mushrooms, ginger, rice wine, thin soy sauce, black soy sauce, cornstarch, sesame oil, sugar and pepper and mix with hands to combine. Place rice in a 2-quart saucepan. Wash the rice in several changes of cold water, until water runs clear. Drain. Level the rice and add enough cold water to cover by 1 inch (or add 1 3/4 cups of water). Bring to a boil, covered, over high heat, never stirring. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, 7 to 10 minutes or until water almost completely evaporates. Meanwhile, stir 1-tablespoon vegetable oil into the chicken mixture and combine thoroughly. Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the remaining 1-tablespoon vegetable oil to the wok, and carefully add chicken mixture, spreading it in wok. Cook undisturbed 1 minute, letting chicken begin to brown. Then, using a metal spatula, stir-fry 1 minute, or until chicken is lightly browned on all sides but not cooked through. Add mushroom liquid and ham and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Uncover rice and quickly spread chicken mixture and scallion over it. Immediately re-cover rice and cook 5 to 10 minutes more, or until chicken is just cooked through and rice is tender.

Lay on a towel to dry. Cut the puff pastry in half lengthwise and then in thirds crosswise to make 3 1/2-inch squares. Make 1/4-inch L-shaped cuts on opposing corners of the squares. Leaving 1/4-inch in opposite corners uncut. Whip the egg with a fork in a small bowl to make egg wash. Brush the wash over the pastry squares. Fold 1 corner over to the inside edge of the opposite edge, then repeat on the other side. This will make a 1/4-inch edge on the square with small diamond shapes on 2 corners. Put egg wash on the edges of the squares and place on a sheet pan with parchment paper. Place the pan in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the pastry squares for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Make sure not to undercook, as the pastry will fall when removed from the oven. These pastry squares may be made in advance and placed in an airtight container when cool. Blanch the asparagus in salted boiling water for approximately 2 minutes depending on the size of the asparagus stalks, or until just tender. Cool under cold water and set aside. In a saute pan, heat the butter. Lightly dust the morels in flour and place in the pan with the chopped shallots, salt and pepper, to taste. Cook until tender, and then add Madeira wine. Be sure to remove from the heat before adding the wine as the alcohol may flame. Return to heat and add the heavy cream and a pinch of nutmeg. Simmer for 5 to 6 minutes until the cream has reduced to about 2 cups. Add the asparagus and turn the heat to low just to keep hot. Cut around the center square of the pastries, just 1/4-inch deep and remove the lid. Place the squares on the center of your plates and with a slotted spoon scoop the morels and asparagus into the center. Divide the sauce over the squares evenly and replace the lid.

Bring a deep pot of water to a boil. Plunge the lobster into the boiling water, head first, and cook for 3 minutes. Remove from the water and place in an ice bath to stop the cooking. Carefully halve the lobster lengthwise. Score the claws with a sharp knife, then the knuckle, to expose the meat. Discard the innards, if desired. Lay the lobster on a sheet pan, with the meat facing up and season it with the oil, and salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until the meat is cooked through. Place the Crab and Shrimp Pasta in 2 bowls. Top with 1/2 a lobster and serve. Place a large pot of water for the pasta over high heat and bring to a boil. While the water is heating, in a small saucepan sweat the onions, Cajun seasoning, garlic, and shallots in oil over low heat. Add the tomatoes and cook for 15 to 20 minutes over a very low heat.

Hold a banana half cut-side down and carve a wedge from the top part of the curved side to make a gaping shark&#39;s mouth. Insert an ice pop stick into the cut end and lay the banana on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with each banana half. Freeze the bananas until solid, about 2 hours and up to overnight. Line another baking sheet with parchment. Draw three 3-inch circles on the parchment and flip over.<br> When ready to assemble, lay a wire cooling rack over your sink or other surface where there is at least a foot of space below. (This is how you will let the candy coating on the sharks harden and dry.) Combine the chocolate, coconut oil and enough black gel food coloring to make a shark gray color (3 to 4 drops) in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 1 minute intervals, stirring in between each, until the chocolate is melted.<br> Spread a thin layer (about 1/8 inch) of the gray chocolate inside each circle template on the baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.<br> Cut the circles in half (warming your knife over a burner flame will help with making a clean cut). Cut 3 of the pieces in half again for the back fins. Cut the other 3 pieces in quarters for the shark flippers.<br> Tip the bowl so the gray chocolate pools on one side. Holding a banana by the stick, dip the banana into the chocolate with the shark mouth facing up using a curving motion to coat the back, sides and top; leave the space above and below the mouth uncoated.<br> Working quickly so the chocolate doesn&#39;t harden, dip a back fin into the chocolate and stick it on the back of the shark with the rounded part of the fin facing forward. Dip 2 flippers in the chocolate and stick them on towards the bottom of the shark. Dip the flat side of 2 chocolate chips in the chocolate and stick them on the head for eyes.<br> Clip the end of the stick with a binder clip and thread another ice pop stick through it to suspend the shark to dry. Thread through the cooling rack so it hangs down. Repeat the dipping and drying with the remaining bananas. Once all of the sharks are dipped and dried, serve right away.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31046,&quot;Crab Cakes with Cocktail Sauce 1/2 stick sweet, unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs 1 tablespoon crab boil seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 pound lump crabmeat 1 lemon, juiced 3/4 sour cream 1 egg, lightly beaten 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 tablespoon dry mustard 1 tablespoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 cup ketchup 1 cup chili sauce 1/4 cup prepared horseradish, strained and liquid removed 1 teaspoon hot sauce (recommend: Tabasco) 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce Instructions: Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray lightly with nonstick spray. Whisk together the eggs, mustard and a splash of water until smooth; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside. Dust a work surface with flour and roll out the puff pastry to a 10-by-14-inch rectangle with the shorter side facing you. Spread the cheese over the top half of the dough, then fold the bottom half over the cheese half and roll lightly to seal. Cut the dough vertically into 12 even strips; each strip will be slightly thinner than 1 inch. Place a bacon strip on each pastry strip and twist the pastry and bacon together. Place the twists on the prepared baking sheet, pressing down the ends. Brush the tops with some of the egg wash and sprinkle with salt and sesame seeds or poppy seeds (or both). Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the bacon is crisp, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheet to a rack and let cool for 5 minutes before removing. For the eggs: Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat; there should be enough water to cover the eggs by at least 1 inch. Using tongs, gently place eggs in the water and boil for 5 1/2 minutes for soft-cooked eggs; the whites will be set, but the yolks will be very runny. Transfer the saucepan to the sink, pour off most of the water, and then run under cold water for 30 seconds. Set the soft-boiled eggs in egg cups; use an egg topper to slice off the tops of the shells, or tap around the shells with a small spoon to break and peel off. Season lightly with salt and pepper, and serve with the twists for dipping in the yolks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 31067,&quot;Sage Advice 1 cup brewed black tea 3 tablespoons honey 3 fresh sage leaves 2 dashes Peychaud&#39;s bitters 3/4 ounce fresh orange juice 1 1/2 ounces rye 1/2 ounce Averna bitters Instructions: Make the syrup: Combine the tea and honey in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.

Rub the meat all over with the Memphis Shake; cover and refrigerate overnight. Prepare an outdoor grill with an indirect medium-hot fire with a mix of briquettes and hardwood charcoal in half of the grill. Set grate over coals. Place pork, skin side up, in an aluminum pan with about 1 1/2 cups water on the cooler side of the grate. Toss 1 cup of the soaked and drained wood chips onto the coals and cover the grill, making sure the lid&#39;s vents are directly over pork. When the coals cool to medium-low heat, preheat a chimney-full of hot briquettes and hardwood charcoal. Whenever smoke stops coming out of the vents, about every hour, add more hot coals and 1 cup of soaked and drained wood chips to the fire. The goal is to maintain a medium-heat, smoky fire (but don&#39;t worry if it is hotter when the coals are added and cooler while preheating the coals). Rotate the pork when you add coals so it cooks evenly. Cook the meat until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the pork registers 180 degrees F, about 6 hours. Set aside 1 quart of the North Carolina-Style Vinegar BBQ Sauce. Once the pork reaches 180 degrees F, begin mopping the entire surface of the meat every 20 minutes with some of the remaining sauce and the pan drippings. Continue to cook the pork, covering the grill between mopping, until an instant-read thermometer registers 200 degrees F, about 1 to 2 hours more. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and let rest for at least 15 minutes. Remove the outer skin and discard. Cut large chunks from the bone and shred, using 2 forks or your fingers, (when cool enough to touch) or chop. Toss with about 1 cup of the reserved barbecue sauce for every 3 cups of meat. Tuck the pork into the soft rolls and serve with pickles. Whisk paprika, brown sugar, oregano, garlic, ancho powder, salt, and celery salt in a small bowl. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 2 months. Heat the vinegar and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Off the heat, stir in the ketchup, honey, salt, red pepper, and black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 31099,&quot;Russian Wedge Salad 6 slices bacon 1 head iceberg lettuce, cut into 6 wedges 1 tomato, chopped<br> 1 cup mayonnaise 1 clove garlic<br> 1 tablespoon minced red onion<br> 1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish<br> 1 tablespoon ketchup<br> 1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce<br> 2 hard-boiled eggs<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Make the salad: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Serve hot with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 31112,&quot;Sauce Bearnaise 2 sticks butter 1/4 cup tarragon vinegar 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 teaspoon crushed peppercorns 1 small shallot, finely chopped 3 large egg yolks 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh tarragon leaves Pinch cayenne pepper Kosher salt Instructions: In a small saucepan, gently melt the butter, over low heat, and bring to a simmer. As the butter is gently simmering, skim off the froth that accumulates on the surface of the butter. Simmer the butter for about 15 minutes, cool and ladle off the clear butterfat, leaving any milk solids in the bottom of the pan. This is clarified butter! Wow-who knew? In a small saute pan combine the vinegar, white wine, peppercorns and shallots. Cook over medium heat until the liquid has almost all evaporated. Remove from the heat, add 1 large ice cube and let it melt. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a medium-sized metal bowl. Add the 3 egg yolks and whisk vigorously to combine. Put the metal bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Whisk the eggs until fluffy, about 5 minutes. While whisking slowly drizzle in the clarified butter. Start with a couple drops at a time. If the eggs seem to be cooking too quickly, remove the saucepan from the heat. The idea of what is going on here, is that the eggs are being cooked ever so gently into a frothy, foamy deliciousness, not a scrambled curdled mess. Once all of the butter has been whisked in, add the fresh tarragon, and a pinch of cayenne. Season with kosher salt, to taste. The sauce should be very full flavored, foamy and delightfully yellow. Serve on a big fat steak and call yourself a superstar! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 31113,&quot;Sweet Potato-Chicken Hash with Poached Eggs with Green cl Hollandaise 2 large sweet potatoes 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 2 scallions, thinly sliced 1/4 cup cilantro, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup canned chipotle peppers 1 tablespoon honey Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cups water 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 4 eggs Green cl Hollandaise, recipe follows 3 large egg yolks, lightly beaten 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Pinch white pepper 1 large poblano pepper, roasted, skinned, seeds removed and finely chopped 1 stick unsalted butter, melted until foamy Instructions: To prepare the hash: In a medium saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat.

Meanwhile, wash the rice thoroughly in cold water 30 to 60 minutes before cooking and let drain in colander. Place rice and water in a heavy, tightly covered saucepan over medium-high heat. When water just begins to boil, turn the heat to high and let it come to a vigorous boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook until all the liquid is absorbed by the rice, about 12 to 13 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the rice stand, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes. Using a flat wooden spoon or rice paddle, fluff the rice with a cutting motion. Stretch a towel under the lid and cover tightly to keep warm until ready to use. Toast the nori sheets over a high gas flame, and cut crosswise into 1-inch wide strips, or use pre-toasted nori. Mix the bonito flakes with the soy sauce. Rinse the salt off the salmon, pat dry, and grill for 3 to 5 minutes. Use a fork to break the salmon into small pieces. Wet your hands with salted water to keep the rice from sticking to your hands. Cup one hand and place a handful of rice, about 1/2 cup, in your hand. Make an indentation in the rice and tuck in one of the fillings: a teaspoon of soaked bonito flakes, a few flakes of salmon, or a few pieces of pickled plum. Close the rice over the filling and mold it into a triangular shape. Mold the rice firmly, pressing just hard enough to hold it together. Set the rice triangle down on one of its sides and cover the top peak with a strip of nori, shiny side out, like a roof. You can also make cylindrical shapes and wrap the nori around the middle. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the rice shapes.

Whisk 1 cup each flour and granulated sugar, the baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, whisk the 4 egg yolks, vegetable oil, coconut milk and coconut extract. Whisk in the flour mixture in 2 batches. Beat the 6 egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until foamy. Increase the speed to medium high; gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar and beat until stiff, shiny peaks form. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk mixture with a rubber spatula, then gently fold in the rest. Spread the batter on the prepared baking sheet and bake until the cake is golden and springs back when pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Loosen the edges of the cake with a knife; transfer the baking sheet to a rack and let the cake cool slightly. Dust a large piece of parchment paper with confectioners&#39; sugar. Invert the cake onto the parchment and peel off the parchment on top. Brush the cake with the rum. Make the frosting: Whisk the egg whites and granulated sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) until the mixture is warm and the sugar dissolves. Remove the bowl from the pan; cool slightly. Beat the egg white mixture with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, 12 to 15 minutes. Beat in the butter a few pieces at a time, then continue beating until glossy and smooth, 5 to 7 more minutes. (Don&#39;t worry if the mixture looks curdled at first; continue beating.) Beat in the rum. Spread about 2 cups of the frosting on the cake, then sprinkle with 2 cups coconut. Starting at a short end, roll up the cake, using the parchment to help you.

Spray a 15 by 10 by 1-inch baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Line the pan with parchment paper and butter the top of paper. Place nuts, both sugars, ginger slices, almond extract, and cake flour into food processor. Process until nuts are finely ground. Beat the egg whites in a large, clean bowl until stiff, forming peaks, but not dry. Fold nut mixture into beaten egg whites in 3 separate additions (the egg whites will collapse if too much nut mixture is added all at once). Add cake mixture to prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 30 minutes or until cake is lightly golden on top. The cake will be moist. Do not overbake. Cool cake for 10 minutes in the pan. Turn out onto cooling rack and cool until cake is slightly warm. Line a 2 1/2 quart bowl with plastic wrap overlapping sides by 3 inches. Cut cake lengthwise into 1/3-inch wide strips. Line bowl with cake strips placing slices tightly side by side with cut side down in a single layer, trimming to fit and completely covering bowl. If cake slices break, piece together to fit. Brush cake with 2 tablespoons amaretto. Spread ganache over cake covering completely. Gently press peanut butter chips into ganache. Spread peanut cream into center and smooth top. Cover filling with remaining cake, placing slices side by side, fitting tightly together and trimming to fit. Brush with remaining 1 tablespoon amaretto. Fold excess plastic wrap over top. If plastic wrap does not cover cake completely, cover with more wrap. Chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Garnish the cake with Apricot Roses and the Sugar Cage. Heat the heavy cream, butter and sugar in a 2 1/2 quart saucepan over medium high heat. When hot, stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. Place the chocolate in a stainless steel bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth. Allow the ganache to cool to room temperature. Add chilled whipping cream and stabilizer to a large bowl. Beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and beat until cream is firm. Fold amaretto into whipped cream in 2 additions. Add chopped nuts, chocolate and zest into a bowl and stir to combine. Gently fold nut mixture into soft whipped cream in 2 additions trying not to deflate whipped cream. Roll each apricot out, sticky side down, between 2 sheets of waxed paper to 1/16-inch thickness. Roll up tightly, sticky side in, to form a tight center bud of a rose. Wrap another apricot around the bud, sticky side in, pressing gently to stick together. Repeat with 2 more apricots, overlapping half of each previous wrap. Gently bend top of outer 3 apricots outward to form petals. Place toothpicks through bottom of rose and cut off apricot below toothpick to form a flat base. Repeat until desired number of roses are complete. Place roses on a plate and freeze for 30 minutes. Garnish finished cake with apricots roses. Place sugar, corn syrup, and water in a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium high heat. Cook the sugar mixture until it reaches the hard-crack stage (310 to 320 degrees F). Remove the pan from heat and carefully pour into a heatproof microwaveable glass bowl. Do not leave sugar in the pan because it will continue to cook and turn brown. (If sugar thickens and is not easy to work with, place the sugar into the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes to thin.) Spray a bowl (large enough to fit over cake) lightly with vegetable oil. Dip a fork into the hot sugar and quickly wave the fork over the inside of the bowl in a swirling motion allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands distributing evenly on the sides and bottom of the bowl making sure the sugar comes up to the rim. Set aside to cool about 5 minutes. Gently pull the \\cage\\ loose from the side and bottom of the bowl. If the sugar is too warm, the cage may collapse. Place cage over finished cake. Be extremely careful when working with cooked sugar. The temperature of the sugar exceeds the temperature of boiling water and can be very dangerous. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Pinot Noir]&quot; 31190,&quot;Quick Chicken Tortellini Soup 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 chicken wings<br> 3 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (about 2 1/2 pounds)<br> 3 carrots, diced<br> 3 stalks celery, diced<br> 2 shallots, minced<br> Couple splashes dry sherry<br> 24 cups (6 quarts) good-quality, low-sodium chicken stock<br> 4 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped<br> 1 bay leaf<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 lemon, zested and juiced, plus lemon wedges, for garnish 2 cups cheese tortellini<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish Instructions: Heat a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or soup pot to medium heat and add the oil.

Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel and carefully and quickly wipe the hot skillet to make a nonstick surface. Season the ground meat in a bowl with salt and pepper. Give it about 3 turns in the bowl with your hands or a big spoon and it&#39;s done. Shape into 4 patties. When the skillet is hot, put the burgers on the skillet and cook 4 minutes on the first side and 5 for the second side for rare; 7 minutes per side for medium, adding the cheese during the final minute or 2 to melt. Remove the burgers to a plate. Rub the skillet with the folded paper towel again to clean it. Then toast the buns cut side down for about 1 minute, just to mark them. Serve the hamburgers in the buns with the accompaniments below. Saute 1 pound thickly sliced mushrooms in 1/4 cup olive oil with 2 sliced garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves over super-high heat until nicely browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in a couple of drops fresh lemon juice to brighten the flavor. Heat 2 tablespoons unsalted butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add 2 onions, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook slowly until well caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. Thickly slice 2 pounds red and yellow beefsteak tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with sea salt and 1/2 bunch chopped fresh chives.; Lay out 1/2 pound sliced bacon on a baking sheet, strip leaves from 1 sprig rosemary and throw them on top with lots of cracked black pepper and roast at 400 degrees F until the bacon is crisp, about 10 minutes.

Use both pie crusts to cover the bottom and sides of a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish. Patchwork works, just cover the holes. Dock by pricking holes in the crust with a fork all over the bottom. Bake until lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes. For the fruit filling: In a large bowl, stir together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, almond extract, pumpkin pie spice, lemon zest and lemon juice. Divide the mixture among the smaller bowls: 3/4 cup in the first, 1/2 cup in the second and 1/4 cup in the third. (Think of the 3 bears: poppa, momma and baby bear bowls.) Put the cranberries in the poppa bear bowl; in the momma bear bowl, add the apples; and in the baby bear bowl, add the figs. (Do you need a translation? Add cranberries to the bowl with the most flour mixture, apples to the bowl with 1/2 cup of the flour mixture, and the figs to the bowl with the least amount of the flour mixture.) Stir each bowl independently, unless you?re an octopus. For the streusel topping: In a food processor add the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, and a pinch of salt. Blend until crumbly, taste and add more salt if needed. Pour into a small bowl with the almonds and stir. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pour the fruit filling into the prepared crust, dividing it into thirds with the apples in the middle and the figs and cranberries on either side. Top evenly with the streusel mixture. Cover the pie edges with aluminum foil so they don?t overcook. Bake until the top is golden brown and the fruit is beginning to bubble around the edges, 40 to 50 minutes. Serve warm with the bourbon whipped cream. Whisk the cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Add the bourbon and sugar and continue whisking until the cream holds slightly stiff peaks when the whisk is removed from the bowl.

Place the bread in a small dish, cover with milk, and set aside to soak. Meanwhile, in large bowl, mix the beef, onion, celery, ketchup, egg, Worcestershire sauce, barbecue sauce, garlic, basil, mustard, salt, pepper, and crumbled bacon. Squeeze excess milk from the bread, then use your hands to squeeze the bread into the meat mixture until fully incorporated. Transfer the mixture to a ring mold pan and top with the sliced, uncooked bacon. Place the ring mold on a baking sheet and bake until meatloaf is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, to make the mashed potatoes, cook the potatoes, covered, in boiling salted water until tender, about 12 minutes. Drain and mash the potatoes or pass them through a ricer. Stir in the heavy cream, butter, sour cream, chives, and horseradish, if using. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. If desired, put 1 cup of the potatoes in a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Set aside. When the meatloaf is done, turn on the broiler. Remove and discard the bacon slices and carefully pour the pan juices into a saute pan. Invert the ring mold onto an ovenproof platter. Using a spatula, cover the meatloaf on all sides with mashed potatoes, as if frosting a cake. If using a pastry bag, add decorative swirls to the top. Place the platter under the broiler until potatoes are nicely browned, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, to make the gravy, place the saute pan with drippings over medium heat and stir in the flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in the broth, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and barbecue sauce. If desired, fill the center of the meatloaf with buttered carrots and peas.

Place the garlic onto a sheet of aluminum foil, top it with the thyme, drizzle it with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and season it with salt and pepper. Close the foil up and roast the garlic until it is soft, about 35 to 40 minutes. When it is cool enough to handle, squeeze the soft pulp into a bowl and set aside. In a non-reactive bowl or in a food processor, combine the egg yolks, mustard, water, and salt and pepper. Whisk or pulse with the machine to break up the yolks. If you&#39;re making the mayonnaise by hand, put the bowl on a damp towel to keep it from moving around while you work. Then drizzle in the oils, whisking constantly, to form an emulsion. If the mayonnaise breaks, stop drizzling and whisk until it comes together again. If you&#39;re using the food processor, pour in the oils in a thin stream with the machine running. Then whisk or process in the garlic and lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasoning with more lemon juice, salt, or pepper. Thin the mayonnaise with more water if it is too thick. Pour the vegetable oil into a deep fat fryer or heavy saucepan to reach halfway up the sides and heat to 325 degrees F. While the oil is heating, peel the skin off the potatoes and cut them into uniform 1/4-inch sticks using a knife, mandoline, or French fry cutter. Rinse the potato sticks well and dry them thoroughly to keep the hot oil from splattering. Fry the potatoes in batches so the pot isn&#39;t crowded and the oil temperature does not drop too much. Cook the potatoes until soft but not browned, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove them and drain on paper towels. Increase the oil temperature to 375 degrees F. Cook the par-fried potatoes in batches a second time until golden and crispy, about 2 to 4 minutes. Drain on fresh paper towels. Salt the French fries while they are still hot and garnish with chives. Serve immediately with the Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise as a dip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 31242,&quot;Fried Green Tomato Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing Coconut oil, for frying 1 1/2 cups cornmeal 1 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper, plus more for seasoning 3 eggs, beaten 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 green tomatoes, sliced 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard Pinch salt and ground pepper 1/4 cup olive oil 1 pound mixed greens 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese 1/4 cup slivered almonds 2 peaches, pitted and thinly sliced Instructions: For the fried green tomatoes: Preheat the frying oil to 350 degrees F in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium to medium-high heat.

Cook the macaroni until still very firm; the macaroni should be too firm to eat right out of the pot. Drain and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch pan generously. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it just starts to brown, throw in the lobster and stir and cook for 1 minute. Set the lobster aside. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons butter to the same skillet. Sprinkle in the flour, whisking to combine. Let the roux cook for a minute or so, whisking constantly. Pour in the milk, whisking constantly, then cook the white sauce until thick and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Next, add the half-and-half, 1 teaspoon of salt and plenty of black pepper, and stir to combine. Add the Parmesan (holding back some for the topping), Cheddar, fontina and goat cheese and stir them around to melt. Stir in the lobster and macaroni. Pour the mac and cheese into the prepared pan and top with the reserved Parmesan. Bake until bubbly and a slight crust forms on top, 20 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31247,&quot;My Sweet Italian Angel 1/2 cup sugar Water 1 shot limoncello, look for the small airplane size bottles if you don&#39;t want the investment of a larger one 1 store-bought angel food cake 1 lemon, zested 3 cups whole milk ricotta cheese 3 tablespoons honey 1 1/2 pints total mixed berries such as blueberries, strawberries, raspberries or blackberries Instructions: Place the sugar in a small sauce pan, add enough water for it to resemble wet sand.

Remove from the heat and add the limoncello, let it cool while you prepare the cake and filling. In a bowl combine the lemon zest, ricotta cheese and the honey. Cut the angel food cake into 3 slices horizontally; make sure the slices are of equal thickness so that you end up with 3 doughnut looking slices of the same thickness. Arrange the bottom slice on a serving plate. With a pastry brush drench the slice with 1/3 of the limoncello mixture, top the slice with a 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture, repeat with the next layer and finish the top with the last 1/3 of the limoncello mixture. Slice and serve alongside some mixed berries. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Brachetto d&#39;Acqui, Vin Santo]&quot; 31248,&quot;Corn, Zucchini and Red Pepper Tortilla Bake 1 tablespoon oil 1/2 onion, chopped 1 medium zucchini, sliced 1/2 red pepper, diced 2 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon cayenne Salt 1 1/2 cup frozen corn, thawed 1 package flour tortillas Monterey Jack cheese, grated Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise with a paring knife, and scrape down the length with the back of the knife to remove the seeds. Add the seeds and granulated sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer, and beat on medium-high speed for 1 minute. Slowly add the butter, and beat until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. While continuing to beat, add the eggs 1 at a time, scraping down the bowl with a spatula as needed. Add the bourbon, and reduce the mixer speed to medium-low (the mixture will look curdled, but that&#39;s OK). Beating after each addition until just combined, add in 1/3 of the flour mixture, 1/2 the milk, 1/2 the remaining flour mixture, the remaining milk, then the remaining flour mixture. Divide the batter evenly among the liners in the prepared tin. Clean the mixer bowl and paddle attachment. Bake the cupcakes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes, rotating halfway through. Cool the cupcakes in the tin on a wire rack for 5 minutes. While they are still warm, brush the tops with the remaining 2 tablespoons bourbon if desired. Transfer them to the rack to cool completely. For the minty frosting: Mix the butter, sugar and salt in the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on low speed until the sugar has been incorporated, about 2 minutes. Add the liqueur and peppermint extract, and mix on medium-high until smooth. Add the half-and-half, and beat until incorporated. Refrigerate the frosting for about 15 minutes to firm up. Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes with a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain round tip or a plastic bag with a tip cut off, using all the frosting. Decorate with mint sprigs and sanding sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 31250,&quot;Chipotle Chicken Chili 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 onion, diced<br> 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into large dice<br> One 12-ounce bottle good beer, preferably Mexican<br> One 14-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed<br> One 14-ounce can kidney beans, drained and rinsed<br> One 14-ounce can pinto beans, drained and rinsed<br> One 14-ounce can diced tomatoes<br> 1 tablespoon cl powder<br> 1 tablespoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon salt 1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, minced (use less if desired)<br> 1/4 cup masa harina<br> 5 limes, 1 juiced, 4 cut into wedges 1 pound sharp Cheddar, grated 16 ounces sour cream<br> 5 Roma tomatoes, diced<br> 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro<br> Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
