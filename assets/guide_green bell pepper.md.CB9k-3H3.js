Using your fingers, pluck the doughy section of bread away from the crust leaving a 1/4-inch thick collar of crust. Place the crusty collars in a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Toss and squish the bread like a sponge until the oil is evenly absorbed. Place the oil-soaked crusty collars on a baking sheet, standing up so that the hot air can circulate through the \\O, and bake for approximately 20 minutes, or until collars are crispy and golden brown. Place the egg, in its shell, in boiling water for 40 seconds. Remove, run under cold water for 15 seconds to stop the cooking process, then use as directed. To make caesar salad dressing, add salt and pepper to the salad bowl (this creates a sandpaper-like base that will make the next steps easier). Using the back of a soup spoon, grind the garlic against the wall of the bowl until it becomes a paste. Then add the anchovies, and once again use the back of the spoon to grind it into a paste. Follow the same procedure, adding the Dijon, egg yolk, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce, 1 at a time. Make sure that each ingredient is blended into a smooth paste with the previous ingredients before proceeding. Add the oil and vinegar. Blend well. To serve, stand lettuce leaves upright in crouton collars. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of dressing overtop each serving, then sprinkle liberally with Parmigiano-Reggiano. Note: If you don&#39;t have a rough wooden salad bowl, the dressing can be made (with some sacrifice) in a blender. Add the salt, pepper, garlic, anchovies, Dijon, lemon juice, Worcestershire and vinegar. Puree. Then add the oil and pulse a few times. Add the yolk and pulse a couple more times\\u2014just enough to blend it without causing the dressing to turn mayonnaisey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 8061,&quot;Zabaione con Crema: Zabaglione with Cream 6 large egg yolks 6 tablespoons sugar 6 tablespoons Vin Santo wine or Marsala 1 cup whipping cream 1/2 cup fresh blueberries Instructions: Put the egg yolks in a stainless steel bowl.

Lay the chops between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and, using a mallet or a rolling pin beat them until the meaty part of the chop is half as thick. You will need to beat around the bone, so turn them over once as you go. Beat the egg in a shallow wide bowl with the mustard, oregano, and salt and pepper. On a large plate or platter, combine the breadcrumbs with the Parmesan. Press each of the chops into the egg mixture, coating either side. Then dip the eggy chops into the bread crumbs, covering them evenly. Let them lie on a cooling rack to dry slightly while you heat the oil in a large frying pan. When a small cube of bread sizzles if dropped into the oil, then the oil is hot enough. Cook the chops until they are a deep golden color, about 5 to 7 minutes a side (depending on how thin you&#39;ve managed to get them and how cold they were before going in the oil). Meanwhile, quarter the tomatoes and take out the seeds, then cut the shells into strips and dice them. You can take off the skins, too, if you prefer, by steeping the tomatoes first into a bowl of just boiled water for 3 to 5 minutes. Combine the diced tomato, minced or grated garlic, oil, and lemon juice in a bowl, and season well with salt and pepper. When the chops are ready, toss the spinach in the tomato mixture until well coated and divide the salad between 2 large plates, putting each chop alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 8065,&quot;Pansy Flower Cupcakes 12 Go-To Vanilla Cupcakes 2 cups Swiss Buttercream 1/2 cup Grape-Tinted Frosting 1/2 cup Egg Yolk-Tinted Frosting 1/3 cup Avocado-Tinted Frosting Instructions: Frost the cupcakes with the buttercream.

Place the salt, pepper, brown sugar, paprika, thyme leaves, garlic, vinegar, and cayenne in a food processor and pulse until well combined. Add extra-virgin olive oil until you have a nice paste. Rub all over the pork, being sure to get into the nooks so the salt can penetrate the meat and pull out the moisture - this will help form a crust on the outside when cooked. Cover the pork with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or up to overnight. Allow the meat to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Roast the pork for 3 1/2 hours, uncovered, until the outside is crispy-brown (it should look like mahogany). Let the meat rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes before slicing. While the pork is cooking, prepare the slaw. Combine the mustard, mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar and sugar. Mix well and add finely sliced savoy cabbage, purple cabbage, green onions and carrots. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, cover with plastic wrap and set aside in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve. To serve, cut the brioche buns in half and pile up some sliced pork.

In a large mixing bowl, whip the egg whites until white and foamy. Add the cream of tartar and salt and continue whipping until soft, droopy peaks form. Still whipping, add 1 cup of the sugar in a thin stream and whip until stiff and glossy. Sift the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the flour together 3 times to aerate and lighten the mixture. Work quickly so the egg white does not deflate (or sift through a strainer onto a sheet of waxed paper). Fold into egg whites 1/3 at a time. Fold in the vanilla and tangerine zest. Gently spoon the mixture into an ungreased tube pan. Smooth the top and bake 30 to 35 minutes, until golden brown. Remove cake from oven and turn the pan upside down and hang it around the neck of a wine bottle to cool to room temperature. Slide a butter knife around the sides of the pan and put a serving plate on top. Turn over and knock the cake out onto the plate. (The browned crust of the cake will stick to the pan.)

Sift the cake flour, 3/4 cup superfine sugar and the salt onto a piece of parchment paper. Sift the flour mixture a second time onto another piece of parchment; set aside. Beat the egg whites in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until frothy, about 1 minute. Add the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form, about 4 more minutes. Gradually beat in the remaining 1 cup superfine sugar; increase the speed to high and beat until the egg whites are stiff and glossy, about 7 minutes. Beat in the vanilla, rosemary, thyme and lemon zest. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the flour mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, until fully incorporated with no pockets of dry ingredients. Transfer the batter to an ungreased 10-inch angel food cake pan. Bake until golden and the cake springs back when pressed, 40 to 45 minutes. Invert the cake pan onto a small funnel or bottle neck and let cool completely, at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the compote: Combine the brown sugar, rum, 1/2 cup water and the rosemary and thyme sprigs in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat; simmer, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Add the pineapple, return to a gentle simmer and cook until the pineapple is softened and the liquid is syrupy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the vanilla. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until cool, about 1 hour. Remove the herb sprigs. Loosen the edge of the cake with a knife, tap the sides of the pan against the counter and unmold the cake onto a platter.

The flour should be heavily seasoned, not bland. Pout the sourdough starter into a wide, shallow bowl and set aside. Pour the oil into a Dutch oven or a heavy, deep-sided skillet and set the pan over medium-high heat. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F, using a thermometer to measure the temperature. While the oil is heating, prepare the steaks by breading. It is helpful to use one \\dry hand\\ and one \\wet hand\\ while dipping the steaks. One at a time, dip a steak into the flour and then into the sourdough starter, completely coating the steak. Dip the steak into the flour once again, completely coating it. Set the prepared meat on a wire rack set on a sheet pan until there are enough coated to fill the pan without crowding. When the correct oil temperature is reached, slide 2 or 3 steaks into the hot oil. Cook the steaks for 4 to 6 minutes, turning once, taking care not to break the coating. After the steaks are cooked, place them on a paper towel-lined pan to drain. Repeat the cooking process, allowing the oil to come back to 375 degrees F before adding the next batch of steaks. Repeat until all steaks are cooked. Serve immediately with gravy or ketchup. Whisk all of the ingredients together in a bowl. Stir well before using. Fill a large crock or a large bowl with the water. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it dissolve for at least 4 minutes. Using a long spoon or a whisk, stir in the sugar and flour. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and set the mixture aside at room temperature for at least 12 hours before using. Once you begin using the starter, it must be fed and replaced. Do not finish it completely, but rather add the same proportions of water, sugar, and flour to the existing starter after taking some out. For example, if you remove 1/2 of the starter, add 2 cups warm water, 1/2 cup sugar, and 3 cups flour. Blend the new ingredients into the starter with a whisk and set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 8108,&quot;Coquito Recipe | Puerto Rican Coconut Eggnog One 15-ounce can cream of coconut, such as Coco Lopez One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk<br> One 12-ounce can evaporated milk<br> 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk beverage<br> 1/2 cup white rum<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, plus more for serving<br> Cinnamon sticks, for serving<br> Instructions: Put the cream of coconut, condensed milk, evaporated milk, coconut milk beverage, rum, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg in a blender and blend until smooth, about 2 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix together the self-rising flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in the bowl of stand mixer. Toss in the cold butter and mix by hand to break apart the pieces a bit, then beat on medium speed just until the butter is coated in the dry mixture and begins to break down a little bit, 1 to 2 minutes. (Do NOT overmix to the point that the butter starts absorbing the dry mixture and looks shaggy.) Add the cold milk in two batches, scraping down the bowl in between each addition. Mix until dough comes together and feels tacky, no more than 2 minutes total. (You may need to add a splash or two more of milk to help it come together.) Flour a clean work surface and dump out the dough. Gather it together briefly and shape it with your hands or a floured rolling pin into a 10-by-16-inch rectangle. Use a 3 1/4-inch square biscuit cutter to cut 15 pieces out of the dough. (You may have enough scraps to form one more biscuit.) Place them close together on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops liberally with melted butter. Bake, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until biscuits are nicely golden brown, 16 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool at least 10 minutes to set before removing from the baking sheet or cutting open. For the gravy: Brown the sausage in a large saute pan, breaking it up into chunks. Add just enough all-purpose flour to coat the sausage, about 1 cup. Cook, stirring, until it looks crumbly. Slowly stir in the milk in several batches, letting the gravy absorb the milk and thicken in between each addition. Season with salt and pepper, and add more flour in small doses if needed to thicken the gravy. Cut one biscuit in half. Warm it through on a hot griddle for a few minutes. Place a biscuit cut-side up on a plate and top with gravy. Top with fresh black pepper.

Beat in the vanilla and egg yolk just until combined. Switch to a wooden spoon or use your hands to gradually mix in the flour and salt until combined and the dough is uniform. Do not over-mix. The dough should be slightly tacky; if it\\u2019s very sticky add a little more flour 1 tablespoon at a time. Gather the dough into a ball, flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. For the caramel filling: Place the sugar in a medium heavy-bottom saucepan and cook, stirring, over medium heat. The sugar will clump up at first and then melt into a brown liquid; lower the heat if it starts to burn. This will take about 10 minutes so be patient!<br> Combine the butter, cream and salt in a separate small saucepan and place over medium heat just until the butter melts. Once the sugar is melted, slowly whisk the cream mixture into the sugar until uniform in color. Simmer for 2 minutes without stirring. Remove from the heat. Transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate, covered, until firm, about 2 hours.<br> When you are ready to form the hamantaschen, roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4-inch-thick. If your dough cracks as you roll, let it warm up to room temperature before continuing to roll.<br> Cut out circles with a 3-inch round cookie cutter (the top of a wine glass works too!). Gather any scraps, roll them out and cut more circles. Beat the remaining egg and 1 teaspoon of water together in a small bowl. Brush each circle with some of the egg wash.<br> Place a teaspoon of the caramel in the center of each circle. Do not over-fill; excess will leak out. If you are having a hard time scooping the caramel, let it come to room temperature. (You can scoop out all the teaspoons of caramel first, then place them in the centers of the hamantaschen.)<br> Fold two sides of each circle together overlapping at the bottom, and then fold the top down to make a triangle. There should be a quarter-sized amount of the caramel showing. Place hamantaschen 1 inch apart on 2 parchment-lined cookie sheets. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes; this will prevent them from spreading and opening during baking\\u2014do not skip this step.<br> While the cookies chill, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Bake the cookies until lightly golden on the bottoms, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.<br> For the chocolate glaze: Place the chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water and stir frequently until melted. Remove from the heat and add the butter. Stir until the butter is melted and glaze is shiny. If the butter doesn\\u2019t melt completely, return the top of the double boiler to the heat and stir until smooth. Let the glaze cool until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon but not so long that it hardens.<br> Dip one corner of each cooled hamantaschen into the chocolate and place them on a wire rack. Let sit at room temperature until the chocolate is firm; you can place the cookies in the refrigerator to speed up the process. Decorate the cookies with edible gold foil if using. The cookies will keep at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days or can be frozen for up to 2 months.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8121,&quot;Crispy Whole Trout with Curried Zucchini Couscous Canola oil, for frying 4 trout, cleaned, head and tail on 2 cups rice flour 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin Salt, to taste 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 fine diced yellow onion 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic 1/2 tablespoon minced ginger 1 tablespoon madras curry powder 2 cups diced zucchini Salt and black pepper, to taste 3 cups cooked couscous, already fluffed 1/4 cup sliced green scallions, for garnish 1/4 cup madras curry powder Pinch salt 1 cup canola oil Instructions: Heat a large casserole filled halfway with oil. The trout must be able to fit in. On a large plate, mix flour with cumin. Dredge trout in flour, inside and out and deep-fry until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt. For the zucchini cous-cous: In a saucepan on medium heat, coat with olive oil, sweat the onions, garlic, ginger and curry powder. Season. Add zucchini and saute for 3 to 5 minutes until soft. Check for seasoning. Keep on very low heat. For the curry oil: In a small bowl, combine curry powder with salt and about 1/8 cup water to make a loose paste.

Taste and add salt and pepper to your liking. For the fried fish: Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep skillet (I use cast iron) on medium heat until the oil reaches about 375 degrees F. Clean the fish with cold water and dry just a tad; the fish should be a little wet to help the cornmeal mixture stick to it. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper on the fish. Add the cornmeal and flour to a paper bag. Sprinkle in the Cajun seasoning. Add the fish to the flour mixture and coat each piece evenly. Transfer the breaded fish to a plate or cutting board. Lay the fish into the oil in batches and fry until they start to float and are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Rest them on a rack to let the extra oil run off. Squeeze a little lemon juice on top.

Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, opening the bottle at least once a day to let out excess carbonation. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato, Cava]&quot; 8144,&quot;Sugar and Spice Panna Cotta 1/2 cup butterscotch morsels 1 to 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 packet powdered gelatin 1/4 cup Irish cream liqueur 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 large egg 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg 1 teaspoon ground cloves 3 tablespoons packed brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon maple extract 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 teaspoons powdered gelatin 1 cup heavy cream 5 tablespoons honey 1 1/2 teaspoons powdered gelatin 1 cup milk 4 gingersnap cookies, for garnish Instructions: Start by making your spice cookies: In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla, salt and egg and mix well. Add the flour a little at a time, mixing well and scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition. Mix until well combined. Let chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Split the dough into 3 pieces. Into one, knead the ground cinnamon in with your hand until well incorporated. Into the next dough piece, knead in the nutmeg. And into the last, the cloves. Pick teeny tiny portions of the cinnamon dough (about the size of a jelly bean), roll them between your fingers and place on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the nutmeg and clove dough (making sure to keep track of the separate flavors) until you have the desired amount of little cookies (20 to 30 of each). Bake until crisp, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Next, make the butterscotch cookie coating: In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the butterscotch morsels and 1 tablespoon heavy cream in 30-second increments, stirring every 30 seconds, until the butterscotch is melted. A touch more cream can be added if necessary. Add the corn syrup and very gently fold the mixture until it&#39;s a thin, liquid consistency, only heating the mixture for an additional period of 15 seconds or less. Using a fork or slotted spoon (or, if you can use them, chopsticks work well), dip your cookies in the butterscotch mixture to lightly coat them (make sure you keep track of which flavor is which throughout--don&#39;t mix them up). The butterscotch creates delicious little pockets of butterscotch sauce while protecting the cookies from getting too soggy in the hot liquid panna cotta. Try to place them somewhere where the excess can drip off of the cookies a bit. Place the coated cookies in the freezer to harden, making sure not to mix up the different flavors! Get out whichever 4 glasses you would like to present your dessert in (this recipe made enough for four 8-ounce stemmed sundae cups that we used). Wine glasses, martini glasses, tumblers, Irish coffee mugs--any of these work, but, depending on size, the layer size will vary! The Irish cream panna cotta will be the bottom layer, so the first to make. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the heavy cream and vanilla. Gently bring to just a boil, then immediately remove from the heat. Sprinkle the gelatin over the cream and whisk well until the gelatin is completely dissolved and no lumps remain, at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, then add the Irish cream liqueur and stir well. Divide the liquid among your 4 glasses and carefully place them in the refrigerator for 5 to 6 minutes to slightly set up. Get your cookies out of the freezer. Take out your panna cotta and add 5 to 6 of the coated nutmeg spice cookies to the layer (up to you!) and then return the glasses to the refrigerator to set up completely (will take up to 45 minutes). The next layer will be the brown sugar maple panna cotta layer. In a small saucepan over medium heat, gently bring the heavy cream, brown sugar, maple extract and vanilla to just a boil. Immediately remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatin until completely dissolved and no lumps remain, at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Making sure that the Irish cream layer is set up, divide the brown sugar maple liquid among your 4 glasses. Return to the refrigerator for 5 minutes to set up, then add your coated cinnamon spice cookies. Chill for 45 minutes to set up completely. The final (top) layer will be the honey panna cotta. Heat the heavy cream and honey in a small saucepan over medium heat until it comes to just a boil. Remove from the heat and whisk in the gelatin until dissolved completely and no lumps remain, at least 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Whisk in the milk. Making sure the other layers are completely set, divide the honey liquid among your 4 glasses. Let set up for 5 minutes, then add your coated clove spice cookies. Let the final layer set up for at least an hour. We garnished each serving with a gingersnap cookie for a beautiful, rich holiday dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 8145,&quot;Peanut Butter Banana Bread Cooking spray 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup smooth peanut butter 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 very ripe bananas, mashed 1/3 cup smooth peanut butter 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 3 tablespoons honey-roasted peanuts, chopped Instructions: For the bread: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9- by 5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Beat together the peanut butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla, then fold in the mashed banana. Add the flour mixture, and beat on medium-low until just combined (it&#39;s OK if there are some lumps). Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan, and bake until the bread is golden brown and has split at the top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. Run a knife around the edges, and let cool completely in the pan on a rack. (You can tent the bread with foil if it begins to brown too quickly.) For the glaze: When the bread has cooled, combine the peanut butter, butter and confectioners&#39; sugar in a medium microwave-safe bowl, and microwave in 30-second increments, stirring after each, until smooth. Let the glaze sit until it has stiffened up a bit but is still spreadable. Spread over the top of the bread, and sprinkle the peanuts on top. Let sit for 10 minutes to set up before slicing. The bread can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 8146,&quot;Sesame Chicken 4 cups cold water 2 scallions, washed, dried, with both ends trimmed, and cut in half crosswise 1 slice ginger, 1/4-inch thick 3/4 pound chicken cutlet, whole SAUCE (combine in bowl) 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 1 teaspoon white vinegar 1 teaspoon Shao-Hsing wine or sherry 2 teaspoons sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon sugar 2 tablespoons chicken broth Pinch of white pepper 2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions 1 1/2 teaspoons black sesame seeds 2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce Instructions: In a large pot, add the cold water, scallions, and ginger, and bring to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes. Add the chicken cutlet, bring to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes. Turn off heat, cover, and allow to cool to room temperature. Remove the chicken from pot, place on a chopping board, and hit smartly with the broad side of cleaver blade. This will break the fabric of the meat. Then with your hands pull the meat apart, shredding it. Place the shredded chicken in the bowl with the sauce and mix together well. Add the sliced scallions and mix well again. Reserve. Dry-roast the sesame seeds (see below). When done, allow to cool, then pour into bowl with the chicken and sauce. Mix well together. Prepare a serving dish by making a border of the shredded lettuce. Then pour the chicken into the center of the dish and serve immediately. TO DRY ROAST Heat the wok over high heat for 30 to 45 seconds. Add the seeds and lower the heat to very low. Spread the seeds in a single layer and use a spatula to move them about and turn them over to avoid burning on one side. This process takes about 2 to 3 minutes, or until the seeds turn brown. Turn off the heat, remove the seeds from the wok, and allow them to cool. Seeds can be dry-roasted two to three days in advance of their use. After they cool, place them in a sealed jar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8147,&quot;Salmon in Lemon Brodetto with Pea Puree 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 shallot, diced 2 lemons, juiced 1 lemon, zested 2 cups chicken broth 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves 2 cups frozen peas, thawed (about 10 ounces) 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves 1 clove garlic 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup olive oil 4 (4 to 6-ounce) pieces salmon Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To make the Lemon Brodetto, warm the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and saute until tender, about 7 minutes. Add the lemon juice, zest, and broth. Bring to a simmer, and keep warm, covered, over low heat. To make the Pea Puree, combine the peas, mint, garlic, salt, and pepper in a food processor and puree. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a steady drizzle. Transfer the pea puree to a small bowl and stir in the Parmesan. Set aside. To make the Salmon, warm the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Season the salmon pieces with salt and pepper. Sear the salmon until a golden crust forms, about 4 to 5 minutes on the first side. Flip the fish and continue cooking until medium-rare, about 2 minutes more depending on the thickness of the fish. To assemble the dish, add the tablespoon chopped mint to the Lemon Brodetto and divide between 4 shallow dishes. Place a large spoonful of Pea Puree into the center of each bowl. Place a salmon piece atop each mound of Pea Puree. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8148,&quot;Crispy Chicken and Scallion Waffle Sandwich 2/3 cup buttermilk 1 1/2 teaspoons hot sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion 2 pounds boneless chicken tenders Vegetable oil, for frying 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons smoked paprika Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3 cups panko breadcrumbs 3 tablespoons ancho cl powder 3 large eggs 8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter, softened 3 tablespoons maple syrup 3 teaspoons hot sauce 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs 1 1/4 cups buttermilk 1/2 cup seltzer 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon table salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 cup chopped scallions Nonstick cooking spray 4 tomatillos, cleaned and thinly sliced, for serving Instructions: For the chicken: In a small bowl, mix together the buttermilk, hot sauce, kosher salt, granulated garlic and granulated onion. Place the chicken into a re-sealable bag and pour the buttermilk marinade over the chicken. Marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight, in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F and have 2 baking sheets with wire racks set inside. Preheat a waffle maker according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. In a large cast-iron skillet, bring an inch of oil to 350 degrees F. In a baking dish, add the flour and season it with the paprika and some salt and pepper. In another baking dish, add the panko and season it with the ancho cl powder and some salt and pepper. In another dish, beat the eggs. Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing the excess buttermilk to drip off. Then dredge the chicken first in the flour, then in the eggs and finally coat the chicken in the panko. Fry the chicken in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan, until each side of the chicken is golden brown and the interior reads 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the fried chicken to one of the prepared baking sheets and place into the warm oven to stay warm and crispy while you make the waffles. For the spicy maple butter: Mix the butter, syrup, hot sauce and cayenne in a bowl. For the waffles: Whisk the oil, vanilla and eggs in a medium bowl until combined. Add the buttermilk and seltzer. In another bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, table salt and baking soda to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk until smooth. Stir in the scallions. Spray the waffle maker with some nonstick cooking spray. Pour the batter in the waffle iron and cook until golden. Set aside in a warm oven on the other prepared baking sheet until ready to serve. For the sandwich build: Spread each waffle with a generous portion of the maple butter. Place some tomatillo slices on a waffle and then some of the hot crispy chicken. Top with the other waffle to seal the deal. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 8149,&quot;Chicken Enchiladas 3 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup oil, divided 1 tablespoon flour 1/4 cup New Mexican chili powder 16 ounces chicken stock 10 ounces tomato puree 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin Salt 3 cups grated cheddar cheese 2 cups cooked and shredded chicken 1 onion, chopped 10 corn tortillas 1 cup sour cream, for garnish 1/2 cup chopped scallions, for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Score the skin on the duck in a crosshatch pattern, being careful not to cut into the meat. Sprinkle the duck on both sides with kosher salt and pepper. Gently heat a dry cast-iron pan over low heat. Place the duck into the pan, skin side down, and begin to slowly render the duck fat. Very slowly and gently, cook until most of the fat has rendered, about 20 minutes. Flip the duck and cook on the flesh side for 3 to 4 minutes, basting with some of the duck fat, until the duck reaches an internal temperature of 130 degrees F for medium-rare. Remove from the pan and allow to rest on a sheet tray lined with a rack. Reserve the duck fat. Add a drizzle of oil, 2 sprigs of the thyme, the bay leaf, shallots and pink peppercorns to a small saucepan. Saute over medium-high heat until the shallot has softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the sugar and 1/2 cup of the sherry vinegar. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until reduced au sec (or until there is barely anything left), a few minutes. Add the red wine and continue to reduce until almost completely dry, 5 to 6 minutes. Add 1 cup of the veal demi and 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and cook until reduced and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Strain the sauce into another saucepan and put back on the heat. Add the sour cherries and the remaining cup of demi and reduce until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the butter and the remaining 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar and remove from the heat. Coat the bottom of a large cast-iron pan with oil and heat over medium-high heat. Season the endive with salt and place into the pan, cut side down, and sear for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and place onto a sheet tray. In another large saute pan, add the orange juice and the remaining 4 sprigs thyme and 1/2 cup chicken stock. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 10 minutes. Add the charred endive and the remaining 1 stick butter and braise in the sauce until softened, about 10 minutes. Combine the coriander, cumin, sesame seeds, cardamom and 1 teaspoon kosher salt in a small bowl. Brush the skin side of the duck breast with the honey. Press an even crust with the spice mixture onto the duck, making sure to firmly press to ensure it&#39;s nicely adhered to the honey. Slice the duck lengthwise. For the potatoes, using a cast-iron pan, heat up the reserved duck fat on medium heat. Season the sliced potatoes. Sear the potatoes gently in the duck fat and then place in the oven. Cook on the first side until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes, then flip over for another 8 minutes.

Quickly stir the water into the mixture and then gather up the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and press it into a flat dish shape. Refrigerate dough for 1 hour. Line a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment or a silicon pad. Roll the dough out onto a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 15-inches long by 10-inches wide, with rough edges. Roll the dough up onto your rolling pin and then unroll it directly onto the lined pan. Roast the hazelnuts on a cookie sheet for 7 or 8 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a food processor, add the 1/4 cup sugar, egg, 1 tablespoon butter, and vanilla, and process until a creamy paste forms. Spread the frangipane on the dough, stopping about 1 1/2-inches from the outer edge on all sides. Peel the apples, remove the cores, and cut them into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange them attractively in a slightly overlapping pattern, like the tiles of a roof, on the pastry dough so that the apples cover the frangipane. Fold the edge of the dough back over the apples to make a 1 to 1 1/2-inch border of dough. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over the apples, letting a little of the sugar fall onto the border to help crystallize the dough. Break the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into pieces and scatter them over the tart. Bake for 1 hour. The dough should be nicely crystallized all over. Remove the finished tart from the oven and cool on a rack until lukewarm. Dilute the apricot preserves with the calvados or water and glaze the surface of the tart, spreading it carefully on the apples with the underside of a spoon.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment and draw on 2 (9-inch) circles. Cook&#39;s Note: You could also do rectangles. In a small bowl, combine the ground almonds, cornstarch, and all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar. In a separate bowl, beat the whites to soft peaks, and then beat in the remaining sugar to make a stiff meringue. Fold in the almond mixture in 3 batches to combine thoroughly. Using a piping bag with a large tip, pipe the meringue onto the circles on the parchment. Bake until crisp and dry, about 1 1/2 hours. To make the buttercream: Heat the sugar with 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons water to dissolve, then boil to soft-ball stage, which is just before the syrup changes color (235 to 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer). Beat the egg yolks in a stand-up mixer, then, with the beaters running, quickly add the hot syrup in a thin stream. Continue beating until the mixture is cool and forms and thick mousse, about 5 minutes. Beat in the butter, gradually, and finally add the vanilla. To assemble the cake: Set a round of meringue on a serving plate. Spread over a quarter of the buttercream. Lay in a layer of sliced peaches. Spread the top layer with buttercream and set it on top of the first. Spread the remaining butter cream over the sides of the cake. Press the toasted almonds all around the sides. Arrange another layer of peach slices on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 8184,&quot;Trenette with Potatoes and Pesto 3 medium sized boiling potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced 1 pound fresh trenette (or linguine fini) 1 recipe pesto (recipe above) Instructions: In 1 quart of boiling salted water place potatoes and cook until one minute shy of being done, about 6 minutes.

Serve with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 8186,&quot;Pasticcio 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 pounds ground beef (80/20)<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cups finely diced yellow onion 1/2 teaspoon ground Aleppo pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 4 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 cup dry white wine<br> 3 cups crushed tomatoes<br> 8 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> 4 cups whole milk<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup finely grated kefalotyri cheese<br> 3 large eggs<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound macaroni #1<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for the casserole dish 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 1 cup grated kefalotyri cheese<br> Instructions: For the meat sauce: In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the ground beef and sear without disturbing until brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Break it up into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper and cook until deeply browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the Aleppo and cinnamon and stir to combine. Tie the thyme sprigs together with butcher\\u2019s twine and add to the meat sauce. Deglaze with the wine, reduce by half, then stir in the crushed tomatoes and 1 cup water. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the tomatoes have begun to break down, about 30 minutes. For the bchamel sauce: In a large saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and allow to melt. Whisk in the flour and allow to toast for 1 minute. Add the nutmeg and about a quarter of the milk and whisk as the mixture cooks and bubbles. Add another quarter of the milk and cook, whisking. Once the milk is incorporated, add the rest of the milk and whisk again. This will ensure a smooth bechamel sauce. Season with salt and pepper and continue to cook, whisking, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the kefalotyri cheese until melted. Whisk in the eggs and set aside. For the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the pasta. Do not stir as you will disturb it. In order to have even layers, the pasta needs to be cooked undisturbed, with all the noodles facing the same way. Cook the pasta for 4 minutes less than the package instructions. Set up your grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. To assemble: Brush a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish with olive oil and set aside. Using tongs, remove the pasta from the pot and line the pasta evenly in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. All the noodles should be facing the same direction. Add the melted butter and kefalotyri cheese and season with black pepper. Remove the bundle of thyme from the meat sauce and pour the meat sauce on top of the pasta. Using a rubber spatula, spread into an even layer without pressing down. Pour the bchamel over the meat sauce. Place the casserole dish onto the offset heat part of the grill, close the grill and bake until the top is golden brown and puffy, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the grill and allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting into slices and serving. Oven method: Bake uncovered at 400 degrees F for 40 to 45 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 8187,&quot;Grilled Shrimp with Oregano and Garlic Chips 16 large shrimp, shelled, deveined 1/2 cup olive oil 3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons fresh oregano 2 tablespoons fresh flat leaf parsley 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes Salt and freshly cracked pepper 2 cups canola oil 6 cloves garlic, finely sliced Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the shrimp with the olive oil, garlic and oregano, parsley, red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper.

Butter a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, combine the butter and sugar, and beat with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. After the last egg, continue to beat on high speed for 5 minutes. Beat in the heavy cream and vanilla. Add the flour mixture and beat on low until just incorporated. Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Cool the pound cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out onto a rack to cool completely. (The pound cake can be made up to 2 days ahead; store at room temperature, well wrapped.) For the strawberries: Heat the strawberry preserves in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until just warm. Add the strawberries and 1/4 cup water, and bring to a simmer; simmer until the strawberries are just beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice. Add a little sugar to taste if desired. Cool completely. (The strawberries can be made up to 1 day ahead; refrigerate in an airtight container.) For the cream layer: In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese and confectioners&#39; sugar with an electric mixer until very smooth and light. Add a little bit of the cream, and beat to loosen. Beat in the remaining cream, a little at a time, until the mixture just holds stiff peaks, stopping occasionally to scrape the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat in the lemon juice and vanilla. To assemble the trifle: Cut the pound cake into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Spoon a little more than a quarter of the cream into the bottom of a trifle bowl. Top with a third of the pound cake, followed by a third of the strawberries and their juices. Repeat the layers, starting with cream, then cake, then strawberries.

Lay out four 18-inch-long sheets of heavy-duty nonstick foil on a work surface. Brush the foil with the olive oil (this will help the enchiladas get crisp on the bottom). Spread 1 tablespoon enchilada sauce in the center of each sheet. Combine the chicken, 1 cup cheese, the refried beans, corn, oregano, 2 tablespoons enchilada sauce, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl.<br> Stack the tortillas and wrap them in a damp paper towel. Microwave until warm and pliable, 15 to 30 seconds. Lay out the tortillas on a clean surface. Divide the chicken filling among the tortillas (about 1/4 cup each) and roll up. Place 3 enchiladas seam-side down on each sheet of foil, arranging them on top of the sauce. Spoon 3 more tablespoons enchilada sauce over each trio of enchiladas, then sprinkle evenly with the remaining 1 cup cheese. Bring the two short ends of the foil together and fold twice to seal; fold in the sides to form a packet. Grill the foil packets seam-side up until the cheese has melted and the enchiladas are warmed through and crisp on the bottom, about 7 minutes.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the potatoes, reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are cooked through and tender. Drain, return to pot and mash with a potato masher. In a small pot over low heat, add the butter and milk and heat until hot. Mix the butter and milk mixture to the mashed potatoes and season with salt and pepper, to taste. (For very creamy potatoes use a hand mixer to incorporate the milk and butter mixture. Only mix for about 45 seconds to prevent potatoes from getting gummy.) Set aside. Evenly divide the beef stew into 4 (11-ounce) ramekins. Top with the mashed potatoes and bake until the stew is bubbling and potatoes are slightly browned on top, about 30 minutes. In a 6-quart slow cooker combine the celery, carrots, potatoes, onions, thyme and beef. In a large bowl, stir together all the remaining ingredients and pour over the beef and vegetables in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on high for 5 hours.

Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. When the skillet is hot, add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the chorizo and cook, stirring and finely crumbling with a wooden spoon until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and let cool. Set the flank steak on a cutting board. Use a knife to score the steak down the middle against the grain, halfway through its thickness. Working from the center line, out toward the edges, cut thin flaps from the score to the edge, like a gatefold. Pound with the flat side of a meat mallet to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. Sprinkle both sides of the steak with salt and pepper and brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Chop the cilantro, parsley, olives, pickled jalapenos and garlic together on a cutting board to make a chunky paste. Brush the steak with the mustard. Spread the herb paste over the steak, leaving empty a 1-inch border around the edges. Pat to adhere the paste to the meat. Starting a third of the way in from the right, make 4 equidistant lines of egg. Between the egg lines, mound lines of chorizo, then carrots and then peppers, covering all but that first third of the steak&#39;s surface. Roll the steak around the fillings like a jelly roll, from the filled to the empty side. Tie closed at 2-inch intervals around the circumference with kitchen twine. Tie 1 more piece of twine lengthwise around the meat. Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the steak on the direct-heat side of the grill to brown all 4 sides, about 2 minutes per side. Move the steak to the indirect-heat side of the grill, cover and cook, turning occasionally and testing the temperature frequently, until the very center reads 115 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, for a steak that is well-done on the outside and medium-rare in the center, 25 to 30 minutes more. Transfer the matambre to a cutting board to rest. For the chimichurri sauce: Finely chop the cilantro, parsley and garlic on a cutting board. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the red pepper flakes, vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in the olive oil. Untie and slice the flank steak into 6-thick slices on a slight bias. Serve with the chimichurri sauce for drizzling. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 8202,&quot;Orange Cream Cupcakes 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2/3 cup granulated sugar 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk 3/4 cup fresh orange juice (from about 2 oranges) 1 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest 3 drops yellow food coloring (optional) 1 drop red food coloring (optional) Store-bought candied orange zest, for topping Instructions: Make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a muffin pan with 12 cupcake liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the eggs and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium low; slowly beat in the melted butter, then add the orange zest and vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture in 2 additions, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture; beat until just combined (do not overmix). Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds of the way. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then remove the cupcakes to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Bring the orange juice to a boil in a saucepan; reduce the heat to medium and simmer until reduced to1 1/2 tablespoons, about 8 minutes. Let cool.

Using a spoon or strainer, strain the cooled espresso into a serving glass, leaving the ice behind (if desired, ice can be included or added later). Add the cold milk to the cooled espresso in the serving glass. Using the steam wand of the espresso machine, steam the whole milk so that a tight, small-bubble, microfoam is created. Using a spoon, add only the tight microfoam (about 3 to 4 ounces or an amount equal to the other parts) to the milk and espresso. Serve without any garnishes so as not to mask the delightful flavors.

Butter two 8-by-2-inch round cake pans. Line the bottom of each pan with parchment paper, then butter and flour the pans. Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low speed until combined.<br> Whisk together the buttermilk, oil, vanilla and eggs in a medium bowl. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture. With the mixer still on low, add the coffee and mix until just combined, scraping the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.<br> Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake until a cake tester comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 30 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto cooling racks and cool completely. When the cakes are completely cool, level each cake and then cut each layer in half to make four cake rounds. Chill until ready to assemble. For the mint buttercream: In the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together the confectioners&#39; sugar and butter until creamy. Beat in the peppermint extract, salt and 2 tablespoons of the milk until well combined. Gradually stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons milk until the desired spreading consistency is reached. Set aside until ready to assemble the cake. For the chocolate buttercream: Chop the chocolate and place in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir until just melted and set aside until cooled to room temperature. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until light yellow and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and egg yolk and continue beating for 3 minutes. Turn the mixer to low, gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar, then beat at medium speed until smooth and creamy, scraping down the bowl as necessary.<br> Dissolve the coffee powder in 2 teaspoons of the hottest tap water. With the mixer on low speed, add the melted chocolate and the coffee to the butter mixture and mix until blended. Do not whip! Set aside until ready to assemble the cake. For the mint curls: Put the melting wafers and shortening in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave in 1-minute increments, then in 15-second increments, stirring after each heating. When the wafers are melted, add the peppermint oil and stir until incorporated. Flip over a large, clean baking sheet. Pour half of the melted candy onto the back of the baking sheet and spread evenly with an offset spatula. (This is important, as you want the layer to be as even and level as possible. Thin is good, but translucent is not.) Place the baking sheet in the fridge to set for 1 to 2 minutes or leave it on the counter for about 10 minutes. The mixture needs to be at the perfect temperature for curls to form. If it&#39;s too cold, they will just break. If it&#39;s too warm, they will just be blobs. Press your finger into the mixture; if it leaves a mark, the mixture is too soft. Press a very clean flathead screwdriver into the mixture at a 45-degree angle and then slide it forward slowly. Curls should form. Immediately transfer the curls to a plate and place in the refrigerator so that they hold their shape. Repeat the process with the remaining half of the melted candy. Chill all the mint curls until ready to assemble the cake. To assemble the cake: Place 1 layer of cake on a cake stand or cake plate. Spread one-third of the mint buttercream over the top of the cake. Top with a second layer of cake and spread another third of the mint buttercream over the top. Repeat with a third layer of cake and the remaining mint buttercream. Top with the remaining layer of cake. Coat the top and sides of the assembled cake with the chocolate buttercream. Smooth the surfaces of the cake as much as possible. Place the remaining chocolate buttercream into a piping bag or resealable plastic bag fitted with a large round tip, such as a 2A tip. Pipe dollops of frosting around the top of the cake. Sprinkle the mint curls over the top. Chill the cake until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8255,&quot;Eggplant Parmesan 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped 3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 3 roasted red peppers, peeled, seeded and chopped 2 (28-ounce) cans plum tomatoes and their juices, crushed with your hands 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 3 tablespoons freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley 3 tablespoons freshly chopped basil leaves 1 tablespoon freshly chopped oregano leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper Honey, to taste 5 cups fresh dried breadcrumbs (made from dried day-old bread) Butter, for greasing the dish 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano leaves 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 large eggs, beaten 2 tablespoons water 2 to 3 medium eggplants (about 2 1/4-pounds), cut into 1/2-inch-thick round slices (need about 18 slices) All-purpose flour, for dredging Vegetable oil, for frying 12 ounces grated mozzarella (not fresh), plus1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced 12 ounces grated fontina 3/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano Fresh basil leaves, torn Instructions: For the Roasted Red Pepper Tomato Sauce: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

In a medium saucepan, gently bring coconut milk and salt (if using unsalted pistachios) to a boil, stirring with a rubber spatula. Pour over the pistachios. Put the lid on the blender and let steep for 5 to 10 minutes. Blend until smooth and transfer back to the saucepan. In a large, 8-cup liquid measure or a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, egg yolks, sweetened condensed milk and cornstarch until fully combined with no lumps. Gently bring the pistachio mixture to a boil over medium heat (it will be pretty thick), stirring and scraping the bottom continuously. Ladle about 1/3 cup of the pistachio mixture into the egg mixture, whisking vigorously. Add another 1/3 cup, whisking again. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low to medium heat until the pudding is bubbly and thick. Continue to whisk, alternating between this and scraping the bottom with a wood spoon. This will take around 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the rose water if using and the almond extract. Add in the food coloring if using and stir to combine. Set aside to cool completely, or cool over an ice bath. Pour into the crust and refrigerate until set- at least 4 hours or overnight. Once the pie is set, add a dollop of whipped cream on top. Decorate with dried rose petals, chopped pistachios and serve.

Melt the butter and cool it. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the egg whites, sugar and vanilla. Stir in the salt and half of the flour, then mix in the melted butter. Beat in the rest of the flour until smooth. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use the back of a big spoon to spread 2 level tablespoons of the batter into a circle 6 inches across. Try to get the circles as even and smooth as possible. Cook&#39;s Note: You&#39;re likely to get 2 rounds on one standard baking sheet. Put the baking sheet in the oven, and begin checking the cones after about 10 minutes. Depending on your oven, they&#39;ll take between 10 and 15 minutes to bake. The circles should be golden brown throughout (some lighter and darker spots are inevitable so don&#39;t worry). Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Use a thin metal spatula to loosen the edge of one disk. Slide the spatula under the disk, quickly flip it over, and immediately roll it around a cone form Press the seam firmly on the counter to close the cone and pinch the point at the bottom securely closed. Let the cone cool slightly on the mold until it feels firm, then slide it off and stand it upright in a tall glass to cool. Roll the other cones the same way. Repeat, using the remaining batter. Place in cone holder of some sort to cool. Glasses work well.

Whisk the milk, melted butter and coconut oil, egg yolks and vanilla in a medium bowl until combined. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir with a rubber spatula until combined (it&#39;s OK if a few lumps remain). In a separate large bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Fold the beaten egg whites into the batter, then fold in the mini chocolate chips. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the cherry sauce: Bring the cherries and their juice, preserves and maple syrup to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until syrupy, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the almond extract. Set aside until ready to serve. Cook the waffles: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Set a wire rack on a baking sheet. Preheat a waffle iron (preferable Belgian-style). Lightly brush the waffle iron with melted butter; pour in the batter, filling each compartment about three-quarters full. Close and cook according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Transfer the waffles to the rack and keep warm in the oven. Repeat to make more waffles, brushing the waffle iron with more butter each time. Thin the cherry sauce with a splash of water, if necessary. Serve the waffles with whipped cream and the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 8318,&quot;Deconstructed Falafel Salad 1 tablespoon dried oregano 2 teaspoons dried thyme<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> One 19-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed, drained and patted dry<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves<br> 1/2 cup plain yogurt<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 2 tablespoons tahini paste<br> 2 small cloves garlic, minced (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)<br> 4 cups chopped romaine lettuce (about 1 head)<br> 1 large tomato, diced<br> 1 medium cucumber, seeded and diced<br> 1 tablespoon toasted white sesame seeds Hot sauce, for serving, optional<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, mix together the oregano, thyme and cumin with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Add the chickpeas and then the olive oil, and toss until the chickpeas are evenly coated with the spice mixture. Spread the chickpeas out onto the baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Add the parsley leaves to the bowl where the chickpeas were tossed. Gently stir the parsley leaves so they are coated with the leftover oil and spices and set aside. While the chickpeas are cooking, whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, tahini, garlic and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, sprinkle the parsley leaves on top of the chickpeas and cook for another 10 minutes. (Try to avoid the parsley touching the parchment paper, as it is more likely to burn this way.) To serve: On a large platter, put down a layer of the chopped lettuce and top with the tomatoes and cucumbers. Scatter the crispy chickpeas over the top of the salad. Drizzle the yogurt and tahini dressing over top of the chickpeas, sprinkle with the sesame seeds and serve with hot sauce on the side if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 8319,&quot;Peach Sangria 1 pound fresh peaches, pitted and sliced 750 milliliter bottle dry Riesling 3/4 cup orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier Club soda, for serving Instructions: To a pitcher, add the sliced peaches, Riesling and orange liqueur.

Put the drippings in a 9-inch cast iron skillet. Place the skillet in the oven and let the drippings heat while you prepare the batter. In a big bowl, mix the cornmeal, salt, and baking soda. Add the egg and buttermilk, and stir until just blended. The drippings should be good and hot, but not smoking, by now. Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and swirl gently to coat it with drippings. Pour the rest of the drippings into the batter. It should crackle and pop. Mix quickly and lightly, just to blend, then pour the batter into the skillet and put it back in the oven. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the bread is set in the middle, the edges are browned, and the top crust is golden. Serve hot, cut into wedges and lifted straight out of the skillet. If you prefer, turn the skillet upside down and let the cornbread slip out on a big plate. If your cast-iron is seasoned well, it will do so easily. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 8321,&quot;Roasted Garlic and Four-Cheese Pull-Apart Bread 8 cloves garlic, peeled 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup grated mozzarella 1/2 cup grated fontina 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1/2 cup grated Romano<br> 2 teaspoons chopped chives<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br> 1 round artisan or sourdough loaf<br> 1 stick (1/2 cup) salted butter, melted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the garlic cloves on a square of heavy foil, drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle on some salt and pepper. Wrap it up and bake until the garlic is golden, nutty and mushy, about 1 hour. Let cool. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Mix the garlic together with the 4 cheeses, chives, crushed red pepper flakes and some black pepper in a bowl. Cut the bread in strips in one direction, being careful not to cut all the way through the loaf. Rotate the bread 90 degrees and cut in the other direction. Stuff the cheese mixture in between the rows. Drizzle the melted butter all over the top. Wrap in foil and bake for 25 minutes. Open up the foil and bake until the cheese is hot and bubbly, another 10 minutes.

Butter a deep casserole dish. Bring the chicken broth, milk, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and cayenne to a boil in a medium saucepan. Slowly whisk in the grits and lower the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Cheddar and pepper-jack cheeses and butter until melted and smooth; cool slightly. Stir in the eggs and transfer the mixture to the prepared casserole dish. Smooth the top of the grits and then bake until just set and lightly brown, about 1 hour. Let rest for at least 5 minutes.

Drain water. In your best large nonstick pan or well-seasoned skillet, over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil. When the butter/oil mixture is hot, transfer potatoes to pan and use a spatula to chop the quarters into smaller pieces (there is no science here). As the potatoes absorb the butter and oil during cooking, continue to add equal amounts of each, as required, to keep the pan well greased. Saute for 20 minutes, turning occasionally, or until potatoes begin browning on all sides. If the potatoes start burning before they brown, reduce the heat. Add garlic, and onions and continue cooking for 15 more minutes, or until potatoes, garlic and onions are all very browned and crispy. When it seems potatoes are almost done to your liking, add herbs, salt, and pepper to taste and toss well. Serve immediately on warmed plates. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 8324,&quot;Roasted Pork Loin with Brussels Sprouts, Shallots, Garlic 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup grainy mustard 1 lemon, zested and juiced, plus 1 lemon, zested and juiced (2 lemons total) 8 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pork loin, preferably center cut or relatively \\even\\ in thickness from 1 side to the other Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 cloves, or 1 head, garlic, cloves separated but not peeled 2 cups Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and dry outer leaves removed 14 to 20 small shallots, peeled 1 teaspoon red chili flakes 1 slice rye bread, diced 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. In a medium bowl, add the Dijon mustard, grainy mustard, the zest and juice from 1 of the lemons, the fresh thyme and the butter. Whisk together and set aside. Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat and add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil to the pan. Season the meat on all sides with salt and pepper, to taste, and gingerly put the pork loin in the hot oil. Brown the pork, without moving it around, for 3 minutes. Use a pair of kitchen tongs or 2 large spoons, to gently, but firmly, rotate the pork a 1/4 turn in the oil. Repeat this process turning the pork every 3 to 4 minutes. The most important thing? Be patient. Get the other vegetables together as the meat browns. Meanwhile, toss the garlic cloves, Brussels sprouts and shallots in a bowl with the remaining 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt, to taste, and stir in the chili flakes. Heat a roasting pan over medium-high heat. Arrange the vegetables evenly in the bottom of the roasting pan and cook just until the vegetables begin to caramelize, about 5 minutes. When the pork is browned on all sides, remove it from the skillet and put it on a rack in the roasting pan, flesh side up, fatty side down. In the same cast iron pan that was used to brown the pork, discard some of the leftover fat, leaving about 1 to 2 tablespoons in the pan. Add the diced bread and toast over low heat. Remove to a paper towel lined plate and set aside until service. Take care to disperse the vegetables so the heat in the oven can circulate around and under the pork as it cooks. Pour the mustard mixture over the pork. Turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees F and put the roasting pan in the center of the oven and roast for 30 minutes. Test the temperature in the center of the loin. You are looking for an \\ideal\\ internal temperature of 90 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Roast for 10 to 15 additional minutes and test again. You are looking for an ideal temperature of 125 degrees F. Remove the pork from the pan and allow it to \\rest\\ for 10 minutes. Put the roasting pan on top of the stove, over low heat, and add the vinegar and the juice and zest from the remaining lemon. Stir to blend with the vegetables. Taste for seasoning. Arrange the pork in the center of a platter (sliced or whole) and spoon the vegetables and any cooking liquid over the top. Garnish with croutons and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 8325,&quot;Grilled Beef Tenderloin with Grilled Spring Onions 1 tablespoon toasted coriander seeds 1 tablespoon toasted cumin seeds 1/2 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 beef tenderloin, trimmed (about 3 pounds) Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 2 bunches spring onions, stems removed, cut in 1/2 Horseradish Cream, recipe follows 1/2 cup prepared horseradish 1/2 cup creme fraiche 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1 garlic clove, smashed and finely chopped 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 bunch chives, finely chopped Kosher salt. if needed Instructions: Preheat grill to medium-high. Grind the toasted spices in a spice grinder and add to a small bowl with cayenne. Fold the tail end of the beef under to create a roll of meat that is even in thickness. Tie with butcher&#39;s twine to secure. This will help the meat to cook evenly and to be handled easily. Once the tenderloin is tied, season the beef generously with salt and rub with the spice mix. Give it a little massage with extra-virgin olive oil. Place the tenderloin on the preheated grill and grill on all sides until it is very brown and charred on the outside. When the tenderloin is nice and brown on all the sides, move it to a cooler part of the grill and shut the grill and cook until it is cooked to the desired doneness (medium rare for me), about 20 to 25 minutes or so for medium-rare. If cooking indoors, put the meat in a preheated 375 degrees F oven to roast to the desired doneness, about 125 to 130 degrees F for medium-rare. Remove the meat from the grill or oven to a cutting board and let rest for about 10 minutes before slicing; this will keep the tenderloin very juicy. Meanwhile, toss the onions with extra-virgin olive oil and salt and place on the preheated grill. Grill until they are soft and charred. Remove from the grill and reserve. To serve, remove the string from the beef. Cut into relatively thin slices, but thicker if you prefer. Serve 3 slices of beef, for each serving, with the grilled onions and a spoonful of Horseradish Cream. MMMMM...BIG MEAT! Combine all the ingredients in a serving bowl.

Bring a saucepan of water to a boil and then boil 3 of the eggs for 7 minutes. Refresh them in cold water. Peel and chop the onions, and heat the duck fat in a thick-bottomed frying pan. Cook the onions gently sprinkled with the salt, for about 20 to 25 minutes or until the onions are golden and catching in the fat. Remove to a bowl to cool. Put the Worcestershire sauce and ground beef into a bowl, and when the onion mixture is not hot to the touch, add to the bowl and work everything together with your hands. Add the remaining raw egg and mix again before finally adding the breadcrumbs. Divide the mixture into 2, and in the pan, make the bottom half of the meatloaf by patting half the beef mixture into a flattish ovoid shape approximately 9 inches long. Peel and place the 3 hard-boiled eggs in a row down the middle of the meatloaf. Shape the remaining mound over the top of the eggs and pat into a solid loaf shape. Compress the meatloaf to get rid of any holes, but don&#39;t overwork it. Cover the meatloaf with slices of bacon, as if it were a terrine, tucking the bacon ends underneath the meatloaf as best you can to avoid its curling up as it cooks. Bake for 1 hour, until the juices run clear and once it&#39;s out of the oven let the meatloaf rest for 15 minutes. This should make it easier to slice. When slicing, do it generously, so everyone gets some egg. Pour meat juices over as you serve or do what you will gravy-wise. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 8327,&quot;Vegetable Tart 5 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt<br> 1 pound (4 sticks) cold butter, cut into 1/2 inch cubes<br> 4 egg yolks<br> 1/2 cup ice water<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 6 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 small onion, chopped<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 ounces Gruyere or Swiss cheese, grated<br> 1 zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch coins 1 yellow squash, sliced into 1/4-inch coins<br> 1 butternut squash, peeled, quartered and sliced into 1/4-inch pieces<br> Olive oil, for drizzling<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 eggs, beaten 1 cup half-and-half<br> 1 teaspoon lemon zest<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Sift in the cornflour and continue to whisk. Don&#39;t stop whisking at any point, otherwise the eggs will curdle. Once the curd is as thick as pureed tomatoes and has released a bubble or two, take it off the heat and whisk in the butter a cube at a time. Pour into a bowl and cover with cling film, placing it in direct contact with the curd to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for at least an hour (best overnight). For the biscuit base: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C/Gas 4 and butter six 3- by 2-inch/8- by 5-centimeter metal dessert rings. Cream together the butter and sugar with the salt and lemon zest until fluffy and pale in colour. Add the egg yolks and continue to beat. Sift the flour and baking powder together, add to the creamed mixture and continue beating until the dough comes together as a smooth paste. Put the dough into a piping bag fitted with a 1/3-inch/1-centimeter round nozzle. Pipe the dough into the rings in a spiral working from the outside towards the centre until the base is completely covered by a 1/8-inch/3- to 4-millimeter layer, and then pipe a ring round the edge to create a little dip for the curd to sit in. Bake until golden (but not too dark), 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the biscuit base from the oven and leave to cool for a couple of minutes before running a small sharp knife around the inside of each ring to release the biscuit. Transfer the biscuits to a wire rack (be careful as they&#39;re fragile) and leave to cool. For the Italian meringue: Put the sugar into a pan with 1 fluid ounce/40 milliliters water and place on a high heat. Bring to the soft-ball stage (245 degrees F/118 degrees C on a sugar thermometer) which will take about 10 minutes. To test without a thermometer, drop a tiny bit of sugar syrup into a bowl of very cold water. When it forms a soft sticky ball, it is ready. While waiting for the sugar syrup, start whisking the egg whites with the salt in a clean glass or metal bowl. Whisk until a light froth forms, stopping before any soft peaks can be formed. Once the sugar syrup has reached the soft-ball stage, beat the egg whites at the same time as pouring the syrup onto them in a thin stream. (Don&#39;t pour the syrup over the whisk, but down the side of the bowl.) Add the pepper and continue to whisk for 10 minutes or until the egg whites are glossy and stiff. To assemble, place a generous tablespoon of the grapefruit curd on top of the biscuits, followed by the meringue. Either place under a very hot grill for a couple of minutes or use a blowtorch to brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8348,&quot;Online Round 2 Recipe - Crispy Eggplant and Pasta 1/2 (1-pound) package rigatoni Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups reserved tomato sauce from Crispy Eggplant Parmesan recipe 4 slices reserved eggplant from Crispy Eggplant Parmesan recipe 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1 tablespoon chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat.

Line the muffin tin with pink or white cupcake liners In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder and salt. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Occasionally turn off mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Reduce the speed to low, add the eggs, 1 at a time, and mix until incorporated after each addition. Add the food coloring and vanilla and mix well. With the mixer on low, alternately add the flour mixture and sour cream in 3 additions, beginning and ending with the flour, waiting until each addition is well incorporated before adding the next. In a small bowl, combine the vinegar and soda, and once fizzing has stopped, add to the batter and mix well. Divide the batter evenly in the tin, filling each liner about 3/4 full. Bake until cupcakes are set and spring back when touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely. For meringue icing: Bring a few inches of water to a gentle simmer in a saucepan large enough to hold a standing mixer bowl above the water. Whisk the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt together in the bowl until combined. Set the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until sugar is completely dissolved and mixture is smooth and hot to the touch, 2 to 3 minutes.

Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Line the bottom with an 8-by-20-inch piece of parchment paper, allowing the excess paper to hang over the sides.<br> For the crust: Whisk the all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl.<br> Beat the sugar and butter using an electric hand mixer until combined in a large bowl. Beat in the egg, cream and vanilla until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and beat until the mixture forms into clumps. Press the clumps together to form a dough. Knead the dough for 30 seconds and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.<br> For the filling: Place 1/4 cup water, the figs, orange juice, vanilla extract and orange zest in a food processor. Blend until the figs are finely ground, about 2 minutes. Add the almond butter and blend until incorporated. Add the almonds and pulse until combined.<br> Remove the plastic from the dough and cut in half. Roll out 1 piece of dough into an 8-by-12-inch rectangle on a well-floured work surface. Cut the dough in half lengthwise and then in half crosswise to make 4 equal-size pieces of dough. Transfer the dough pieces to the prepared baking dish using a spatula, and arrange in a single layer. Pinch the edges of the dough together to seal. Spoon the filling onto the dough. Spread the filling evenly over the dough using damp hands. Smooth the top of the filling using a rubber spatula. Roll out the remaining dough into an 8-by-12-inch rectangle. Cut into 4 equal pieces and place on top of the filling, pinching the edges of the dough together to seal. Bake until golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Place the baking dish on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.<br> Using the excess parchment paper as handles, remove and place on a cutting board.

Remove the corn from the husks. In a large, deep bowl, slice off the kernels of corn with a sharp knife. Turn the knife to the dull side and scrape the cob all the way down to remove all the bits of kernel and creamy milk inside. (I do this inside the bowl because it goes everywhere if you cut it on a board.) Add the red bell peppers, jalapenos, heavy cream, milk, salt to taste, a generous amount of pepper and butter and mix it well. Pour into a 9 by 13-inch baking dish. Bake until thoroughly warmed through, 30 to 45 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Zinfandel]&quot; 8369,&quot;Cherry Brown Butter Crostata with Vanilla Ice Cream and Caramel Sauce 3 cups heavy cream 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 vanilla bean, split<br> 6 eggs<br> Pinch salt<br> 1 1/2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into pea-size pieces 1 cup flour<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup ice water<br> 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter 1 cup sugar<br> 3/4 cup flour<br> 3 eggs, plus 1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon water 1 vanilla bean, split, seeds scraped<br> 2 cups pitted cherries 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 lemon, juiced<br> 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1 stick unsalted butter, cut into 4 pats<br> Instructions: For the ice cream: In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar, and vanilla bean. Bring just to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then remove from the heat. In a small bowl, combine the eggs and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and beat to a homogeneous consistency. Strain a third of the cream mixture into the egg mixture, whisk to combine, and then immediately whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the cream. Chill in an ice bath and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Churn in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. For the crust: Combine the butter, flour and salt in a food processor. Pulse until the mixture looks like grated Parmesan. Drizzle in 2 tablespoons of the ice water, and pulse until the mixture forms a rough ball, adding the remaining 2 tablespoons ice water if needed. Remove the dough from the food processor and form into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. For the filling: Melt the butter in a small saucepan and cook it until it starts to brown and begins to smell like hazelnuts. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a paddle. Add the sugar and beat on medium speed.<br> Gradually add the flour. Once the flour has combined, add the eggs, one at a time. Beat in the vanilla bean seeds. To assemble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Dust a clean work surface with flour. Roll out the dough to a 1/8-inch thickness, and cut into 4 rounds. Lay the rounds in four 4-inch ring molds, leaving lots of overhang on the sides. Schmear the filling into the bottom of the ring molds, and top with the cherries. Fold the overhanging dough over the cherries. Brush the dough with the egg wash. Bake until golden brown and crispy on top, 45 to 50 minutes. For the caramel: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons water. Bring the pan to medium-high heat; while doing so, be careful not to swish the pan around--it could cause the sugar to recrystallize. As the sugar mixture boils, the water will eventually evaporate and the sugar will begin to turn brown, or \\caramelize.\\ Pay close attention! Things can take a terrible turn for the worse here, and there will be no recovery. As the sugar turns gold, followed by light brown, and then a pale shade of darker brown, remove it from the heat and add the heavy cream. Be careful when you do this--it will bubble up like crazy, and getting it on you could cause a severe burn! Be sure to have a saucepan large enough to accommodate the bubbling up. Whisk until things settle down, then add the butter, 2 pats at a time, whisking until completely incorporated before adding more butter. Spread some of the caramel onto four serving plates. Unmold the crostatas and set them on top of the caramel. Top with a scoop of ice cream.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 8370,&quot;Elk or Venison Jerky 5 pounds elk or venison, use fairly good quality meat 1 cup soy sauce 1/2 cup lime juice 1/2 cup vinegar 1/4 cup crushed red chili flakes 2 tablespoons garlic powder Instructions: Slice meat against the grain approximately 3/16 to 1/4-inch thick.

Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise from the very top to the bottom (keeping the leaves on). Then cut each half lengthwise in half again, so you have 4 long pieces with leaves at one end. Add the jelly, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and salt to a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring, until the mixture is fully combined and liquid. Brush the pineapple with some of the mixture (reserve the remaining mixture), transfer to the grill and grill 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a platter and, using a sharp knife, cut the bottom ends off each piece of pineapple. Then, carefully cut lengthwise from the bottom to the top of each piece along the skin (separating the fruit from the skin), and then crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Drizzle the remaining apricot mixture over the pineapple.

Cut into 1-inch pieces and continue the process with the remaining dough. Transfer the finished gnocchi to a floured baking sheet while working. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium. Cooking in small batches, drop about a dozen gnocchi into the water and cook until they are firm and floating, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove them from the water with a slotted spoon and put them on a lightly greased baking sheet. Continue making the gnocchi with the remaining dough.<br> Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.

Put the flour in a small bowl. Beat the milk with the eggs in another bowl. Stir together the breadcrumbs and Parmesan in a third wide, shallow bowl. Working one at a time, coat a mozzarella stick in flour and shake off the excess. Dip the stick in egg, letting the excess drip off, then add it to the breadcrumbs and roll it to coat. Dip the stick in the egg one more time, again letting the excess drip off, and roll it in a final coat of breadcrumbs. You can pat the mozzarella stick gently between your hands to smooth out the coating. Transfer the coated mozzarella stick to a platter. Repeat with the remaining mozzarella sticks. Refrigerate the mozzarella sticks until cold, about 15 minutes. Heat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F. Have a large brown paper bag ready for the fried sticks (they will stick to paper towels). Add half of the mozzarella sticks and fry, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute total. Transfer to the paper bag to drain. Return the oil to 350 degrees F (this is important, as the cheese will seep out if it is not hot enough) and fry the remaining mozzarella sticks. Serve hot with Homemade Pizza Sauce on the side. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the oregano, garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil and 1/2 teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, with the saucepan loosely covered in foil to avoid splattering and stirring occasionally, until fairly thick, 5 to 10 minutes, depending on your tomatoes.

Roughly chop the raw shrimp, scallops and sea bass. In a saute pan over medium heat, saute the shiitake mushrooms, cilantro, green onion, red and yellow peppers, garlic, ginger and oyster sauce. Mix sauteed ingredients with seafood. Fold seafood mixture into kataifi to create a loose nest. Deep fry until golden brown and cooked all the way through.<br> For the sauce: Bring all ingredients except cornstarch to a boil. Add a little cornstarch slurry, then strain. If the sauce seems thin once it&#39;s been strained you can add a little more cornstarch slurry, but do it in a saucepan over low heat.<br> Ladle sauce into a small bowl; place it on the plate alongside the kataifi crisps. Mix crabmeat, lemon grass, eggs, cream, scallions and season well with salt and pepper. Using a muffin tin cut small circles of puff pastry that has already been docked (pricked with a fork to allow steam to escape, thus preventing too much bubbling on the surface of the pastry during the blind baking stage). Spray the tins with cooking spray and line each one with the cut pastry. Line each tartlet shell with foil and fill with rice to help keep the shape. Bake blind (without the filling) at 350-degrees until golden, about 10 minutes. Pull out foil and bake 5 more minutes to ensure the bottom is nearly cooked through. Fill cups with crab mixture. Bake another 15 to 20 minutes until mixture solidifies and the pastry is completely cooked. Serve warm or at room temperature. PLATING Line a plate with iceberg lettuce and place tartlets on top.

Using your fingers, make a big well in the middle of the flour. Add the sugar, salt and yeast then pour in the tepid water and olive oil. Using a fork, make circular movements from the center moving outwards, slowly bringing in more of the flour until all the yeast mixture is soaked up. This should be starting to look like dough now so you can start to work and knead it until it is smooth. This should take around 4 minutes. Roll out to a sausage shape and divide into 8 or 10 balls, depending on how large you want the pizzas to be. Flour the surface and roll each pizza out to about the thickness of 3 beer coasters (1/3 of an inch). They don&#39;t have to be perfectly round, they should look home-made. Place each pizza on a lightly oiled and floured piece of tin foil. Flour the top of the pizza, placing another on top of it. Flour that and repeat this until all the pizzas are stacked together. These can be frozen for a couple of months, placed in the fridge for 10 hours, or cooked straight away. Lightly top with your chosen topping (the simpler the better) and bake directly on the oven bars for 10 minutes at your oven&#39;s highest temperature.

Add chicken pieces and saute until golden but not necessarily cooked through. Add coconut milk and stock and bring to a simmer. Once the liquid is simmering, add the peanut butter a spoonful at a time and keep stirring until it is well incorporated. The sauce should be fairly thick (stew like, not soup like), so you may need to add more peanut butter or loosen with water depending upon the ingredients you use. Add chopped collards/greens and cook until very wilted. Season, to taste, with chili paste/sambal oelek and salt. Serve over rice or other starch. Traditional African stiff porridge would be served on the side and used to dip into the sauce with one&#39;s hands. Pull off a piece the size of a meatball, use your thumb to make an impression in the porridge and use the divet to scoop up the stew and pop it into your mouth!

The Driver&#39;s Manual: In preparation for your first car meal, you should start by locating your engine&#39;s hot spots. Do this after any long drive by turning off the engine and letting the car sit for 15 minutes. Then lift up the hood and quickly tap the various components of the engine block. On most vehicles, the hottest area is the exhaust manifold cover, but most engines have additional nooks and crannies that will generate enough heat to slow-cook your freeway fare. Stay clear of areas near any moving parts such as the accelerator linkage, belts, or fans, and don&#39;t block any air intakes. The sensible way (relatively speaking) to take advantage of the oven under your hood is to cook small portions of lightly textured foods. For this reason, fish is the perfect road chow. Before attempting any complex recipes, get to know your engine by cooking a hot dog (or tofu dog), the guinea pig of engine cooking. When you are ready to cook: ? Lay out 3 equal-size sheets of aluminum foil, one on top of the other. Proceed as if they were a single sheet. ? Grease the top sheet with a small amount of butter or olive oil to avoid stickage. ? Wrap ingredients in foil, then seal the seams by folding them over twice and tightly pinching them to create an airtight package. FYI, even perfectly sealed packages will leak small amounts of liquid. Before placing food on the engine, loosely roll up a 6-inch ball of foil, set it on top of the engine, and close the hood. Immediately reopen the hood and use the squashed ball to determine the amount of clearance space between it and the engine block. Set food on the predetermined sweet spot of your engine and secure it with a ball of foil that is equal to the clearance space less the pouch size. If you are cooking on a slanted section of the engine, strap the pouch in place with additional aluminum foil bracing. If you are cooking in a nook or cranny, be sure that package is secure. Make, model, speed, outside temperature, food density, and placement will all affect the cooking time. Most small packets of food should cook in 1 to 2 hours. To ensure that you have fingers left to lick at the end of the meal, always turn off the engine before loading, unloading, or testing for doneness. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 8391,&quot;Boardwalk Boss 1 1/2 ounces whiskey 1/2 ounce sweet vermouth 1 1/2 ounces apple brandy Lemon twist, for garnish Instructions: Combine the whiskey, sweet vermouth and apple brandy in a cocktail shaker; add ice and stir.

Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons bacon fat from the pan. Reduce the heat to low and add the onions, garlic and mustard seeds to the pan. Saute until the onions are translucent, about 15 minutes. Add the maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, red wine, fish sauce, Worcestershire and cayenne; bring to a simmer, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Return the bacon to the pan, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deeply caramelized and a jam-like consistency is achieved, 30 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and chill. For the flaky bacon bruschetta: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a half-sheet pan with parchment and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, water and salt to make an egg wash. Set aside. Roll the Flaky Pastry Dough into a rectangle slightly larger than 4-by-6 inches. With a very sharp knife, trim the rectangle to exactly 4-by-6 inches and then cut the dough into twelve 2-inch squares. (Note: If the dough is getting warm, transfer it to a parchment-lined pan, cover and refrigerate until chilled, 10 to 15 minutes.) To form a bruschetta, fold a square of dough in half to form a triangle. Cut two slits parallel to the edges, leaving a 1/4-inch border and taking care to not cut all the way through to the tip; the triangle will resemble an arrow. Unfold the triangle; the dough should now resemble a square within a square. Brush the surface of the dough with egg wash. Take one cut corner of the outside square (rather than one that is attached to the inner square) and fold it over to the edge of the opposite inside square. Fold the other cut corner to the opposite edge of the inner square. Gently press. Place 1/2 teaspoon bacon jam in the middle of the formed bruschetta, then brush the edges with egg wash. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining squares; reserve the remaining bacon jam for another use. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 25 minutes. Serve warm, garnished with cherry tomatoes.<br> Add the flour and salt to a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the butter and toss to combine. With your fingers, begin to \\smush\\ the butter into flat pieces. Continue smushing until all the butter is flattened but none of the pieces are larger than a quarter. The flour will look like coarse cornmeal. Add the water, quickly folding it in with a wooden spoon to distribute the moisture. (Do not stir vigorously--the dough should appear shaggy.) Use your hands to break up any large clumps of moisture. Then use your knuckles or a palm to smear the dough up the sides of the bowl (a technique known as fraisage). This distributes the butter over a larger surface to achieve larger flakes and compact the dough. Once you&#39;ve gone around the bowl one time, fold the dough over itself a few times to pick up any dry bits from the bottom. Gently press the dough into a disk. (Note: The dough should remain very cool to the touch throughout the process. If it approaches room temperature, refrigerate it for 5 to 10 minutes to chill.) Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll out to a 10-by-12-inch rectangle. Perform a letter fold by folding one of the short ends towards the middle and the other short end over the first, like folding a business letter. Turn the dough 90 degrees, so the long side faces you, and perform a second letter fold. Turn the dough 90 degrees again; perform a third letter fold. If the dough still feels cool, it can be used immediately. Otherwise, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. The dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 8407,&quot;Tomato Soup 8 medium ripe tomatoes, cored and roughly chopped 2 cups chicken broth Bouquet Garni including basil leaves, 2 whole garlic cloves 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1/4 cup sour cream for garnish Snipped chives Instructions: In a nonreactive saucepot, combine the tomatoes with the broth bouquet Garni and bring to a simmer. Cook covered over low heat for 15 minutes. Remove bouquet Garni from the soup and pass it through a sieve. Return the sieved mixture to the saucepan and whisk in the tomato paste; simmer until heated through or boil down until the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper and garnish with sour cream and chives if you wish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 8408,&quot;Hot Buttered Rum Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 1 cup chopped pecans<br> 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup dry milk powder<br> 6 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened<br> 1 3/4 cups sugar<br> 3/4 cup milk<br> 3/4 cup dark rum<br> 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br> 4 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/4 cup honey<br> 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1/4 cup dark rum<br> Instructions: For the cake: Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Spray a 12-cup Bundt pan with cooking spray and sprinkle the bottom with the chopped pecans. Set aside. Combine the flour, dry milk, cornstarch, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Cream the butter and sugar together in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the dry ingredients and mix until combined. (It will look like crumb topping.) Whisk together the milk, rum, oil, vanilla and eggs in another bowl. Slowly add the liquid mixture to the crumb mixture and mix until combined. (Pouring the liquid in slowly is important. The batter has a high ratio of liquid and will be thin almost like a thick crepe batter, but if you add the liquid too quickly you will get lumps that never go away no matter the amount of mixing!) Pour the batter into the pan and bake until the top is golden, center is set and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted, 50 to 60 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack. Poke holes all over the cake using a wooden skewer. For the buttered rum sauce: Meanwhile, add the butter, honey, cinnamon, cardamom, allspice, nutmeg, salt and 1/3 cup water to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until the honey has dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the rum. (It is going to bubble and splatter a little, so be careful.) Clean and dry the Bundt pan, then place the cooled cake back inside the pan. Poke a few holes in the top. Evenly pour the rum sauce over the cake. Let the cake sit to absorb the sauce, 30 minutes or up to overnight. Invert the cake back onto a cake plate and serve at room temperature.

Combine the butter and sugar in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape down the side of the bowl and add the egg and vanilla. Beat until smooth and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the flour mixture and beat on low, scraping the bowl once, to make a smooth dough. Remove the dough from the mixer and divide in half. Add the orange zest and orange gel food coloring to one half of the dough, kneading to incorporate, but don&#39;t incorporate the food coloring fully, in order to achieve a marbled look. Knead the teal food coloring into the other half of the dough. Wrap and refrigerate the teal dough. Lay a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the orange dough to about 1/2-inch or a bit thicker. Use a small kitty face cutter (around 1 1/2 inches in diameter) to cut out as many faces as you can and transfer to the parchment paper. Push together the scraps, then roll and cut again. Brush the faces with a little cold water and stick them all together into a log 8 to 9 inches in length. Refrigerate or freeze until very firm, 1 hour in the fridge or 30 minutes in the freezer. Once the orange log is firm, cut the teal piece of dough into 8 pieces and roll each into a snake about as long as the log. Press the snakes to flatten slightly. Stick the snakes on the log all around, covering the log. Roll the log gently on the counter to make it round (but don&#39;t put so much pressure that you smoosh the kitty faces inside). Once the log is round spread 1/2 cup or so of nonpareils on a plate or small rimmed baking sheet. Roll the log to coat in nonpareils. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate or freeze again until firm. (The cookies can also be made up to this point and frozen for later use.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Unwrap the dough and use a sharp knife to cut cookies just a bit more than 1/4-inch thick. Space the cookies about an inch apart on the baking sheets. Bake, rotating the trays from top to bottom once, until crisp on the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 8414,&quot;Sweet Potato \\Fries<br> 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled (2 medium potatoes) 1 tablespoon canola oil 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more, to taste Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Toss the pears with olive oil and roast for 30 minutes. Turn the pears over halfway through cooking. Roast the hazelnuts with the pears for 5 to 6 minutes. Coarsely chop the hazelnuts and set aside. Place the Taleggio in a heatproof dish or pan and toss into the oven for 3 to 4 minutes. Heat a grill pan to medium-high heat. (If you don&#39;t have a grill pan and are using a regular grill, put foil on the grill grates.) Toss the romaine quarters in olive oil and salt; grill until slightly charred and wilted, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Place one romaine wedge on each plate. Thinly slice each pear half and fan over the romaine wedges. Spoon some melted Taleggio on top and sprinkle with hazelnuts. Whisk together the champagne vinegar and 1/4 cup olive oil, and season with salt. Drizzle each salad with a little vinaigrette. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Vermentino, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 8416,&quot;Cajun Zucchini Fries Nonstick cooking spray 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning Kosher salt 2 large eggs, beaten 1 1/2 cups stone-ground cornmeal 1 cup panko breadcrumbs (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 pound zucchini (2 to 3 small to medium zucchini) cut into 3-inch-by-1/4-inch sticks 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon Creole or whole-grain mustard 1/2 small dill pickle spear, finely chopped 1/2 to 1 teaspoon Louisiana-style hot sauce, such as Tabasco Instructions: Adjust two oven racks to the top and bottom third of an oven and preheat oven to 425 F. Put the wire racks in the baking sheets and coat each generously with cooking spray. Combine the flour and Cajun seasoning in a large re-sealable plastic bag. Combine the eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in another large plastic bag; combine the cornmeal, breadcrumbs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a third large plastic bag. Add about half of the zucchini sticks to the bag with the flour and use a combination of your hands and shaking the bag to coat the zucchini. Remove the zucchini and shake off any excess flour. Transfer to the egg wash and repeat until coated. (It&#39;s less messy if you use only one hand for the dry ingredients and the other for the wet.) Let any excess egg drip off before transferring to the breadcrumbs and repeat until fully coated (you&#39;ll still see some green and white of the zucchini peeking through the breading). Transfer to the prepared baking sheets and coat the breaded zucchini generously with cooking spray (there&#39;s no need to turn them). Repeat with the remaining zucchini. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom about halfway through, until golden brown and tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together the mayonnaise, mustard, pickle and hot sauce in a small bowl.

Slice the onion into thin slivers and add them to the melted butter. Reduce the heat to low and cook the onions for 15 minutes until translucent. Add the mushrooms, rosemary, salt and pepper, and raise the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms give up their liquid. Let the mixture simmer until the mushroom liquid has reduced by 3/4. Add the white wine and reduce again until the pan is almost dry. (The recipe can be made to this point the day before if you like. Reheat the mushroom mixture to continue with the recipe.) Add the crumbled gorgonzola and heavy cream. Bring to a simmer and reduce by half.

Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the shallot, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the thyme and parsley and transfer to a bowl. Divide the meat into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each). Form each portion loosely into a 3/4-inch-thick burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of each burger with salt and pepper. Cook the burgers using the canola oil (see Cook&#39;s Note) and topping each one with a slice of cheese and a basting cover during the last minute of cooking. Place the burgers on the bun bottoms and top each burger with chipotle ketchup, if using, and a large spoonful of the mushrooms. Cover with the bun tops and serve immediately. I love ketchup as much as the next American does, but when I was designing the menu for Bobby&#39;s Burger Palace, I knew that I wanted to have a little something extra to offer in the squeeze bottles. The simple addition of pureed chipotle in adobo gives prepared ketchup an exciting smoky edge, while still keeping its sweet yet tangy identity intact. Whisk together the ketchup, chipotle, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. The sauce will keep for 1 week in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 8420,&quot;Maple-Roasted Delicata Squash Salad with Spiced Pepitas 1 delicata squash (about 1 pound 8 ounces) 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon chili powder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup raw pepitas 1/4 teaspoon hot smoked paprika 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1 tablespoon minced shallot 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1 small clove garlic, grated 1 small head frise, cut into bite-size pieces (4 ounces) 1 small head little gem lettuce, cut into bite-size pieces (4 ounces) 1 head Bibb lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces (5 ounces) 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds 1/3 cup goat cheese crumbles Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Using an electric mixer on low speed, cream the butter and both sugars together to a smooth and creamy consistency. Slowly add one egg at a time, letting each egg incorporate fully into the creamed sugar mixture before adding the next. Stop the machine, scrape down the sides of a bowl with a spatula, reset the machine on low, and add the salt, cinnamon, baking powder, and allpurpose flour. Continue mixing for several minutes until the flour is fully incorporated. With the mixer still running, add the ground almond flour and allow it to become fully incorporated before removing from the mixer. Turn the dough out onto a board that has been dusted with flour. Pat the dough down using your hands and divide it into two pieces. Using a rolling pin, roll the first piece into a 1/4 inchthick rectangularshaped piece that will fit on a cookie sheet or into a 9 by 13 baking pan. Roll out the second piece of dough to the same thickness, then cut it into 1/2-inch wide strips with a crinkleedge cutter. These strips will be used to form the lattice crust. Place the solid piece of dough on a lightly buttered cookie sheet or baking pan. Spread the raspberry jam evenly across the dough&#39;s surface. Use the cut strips of dough to form an open latticework crust over the top of the jam. Bake at 325 degrees for 20 minutes.

Sprinkle the yeast over the top, and set aside until bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together both flours and the kosher salt in a medium bowl. Once the yeast is ready, add the oil to the bowl, then the flour mixture, and stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer the dough to a work surface dusted with all-purpose flour, and knead until it is smooth, elastic and slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Lightly oil the bowl that held the flour mixture, put the ball of dough in it, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Generously oil an 11-by-17-inch baking sheet. Punch the dough down, and transfer it to the baking sheet. Gently stretch the dough and pat it to the edges of the baking sheet with your hands (it will recede slightly from the edges).

Spread the coconut evenly onto a baking sheet and toast until lightly golden brown, stirring once, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn off the oven and let the coconut sit in the oven until very dry and crunchy, about 15 minutes longer. Bring water and sugar to a boil. Stir in the coconut, remove from the heat and let sit for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours. Strain the liquid into a clean saucepan, bring to a boil and let cook until the mixture is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Let cool. Combine the milks and vanilla bean and seeds in a medium nonreactive saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Whisk together the yolks, sugar and cornstarch in a large bowl. Slowly whisk the warm milk into the egg mixture then return the mixture to the pot over medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly, until thickened. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and whisk in the rum and vanilla extract. Let cool to room temperature then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours. Combine the custard and cream in a bowl and whip until soft peaks form. Beat the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the coconut custard and salt and beat until combined and smooth. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour 2 (9 by 2-inch) round cake pans and line bottoms with parchment paper. Whisk together the milk, egg whites, vanilla bean seeds and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. With mixer running at low speed, add the butter, one piece at a time and continue beating until mixture resembles moist crumbs. Add all but 1/2 cup of milk mixture to crumbs and beat at medium speed until the mixture is pale and fluffy, about 1 1/2 minutes. With mixer on low speed, add remaining 1/2 cup of the milk mixture, increase speed to medium and beat 30 seconds more. Scrape sides of bowl and mix for 20 seconds longer. Divide the batter evenly between the cakes pan and smooth the tops using a rubber spatula. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs attached, 22 to 24 minutes. Cool in the pan on baking rack for 10 minutes. Run a small knife around the side of the pan and invert cakes onto the baking rack, removing parchment paper, and let cool completely, about 45 minutes. Using a long serrated knife, slice each cake horizontally into 2 layers. Reserve 1 of the flat bottom layers for the top of the cake. Place another layer on a cardboard round cut side up and brush with some of the coconut simple syrup. Spoon 1/3 of the coconut filling onto the cake and using a small offset metal spatula, spread it into an even layer, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the cake. Repeat with 2 more layers. Brush the cut side of the reserved cake layer with the remaining syrup. Place the layer cut side down on top of the cake. Frost the sides and top of the cake with the buttercream. Pat the coconut onto the sides of the cake and sprinkle the remaining coconut on the top of the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 8450,&quot;Kalbi Bun 1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped 5 large cloves garlic 1 pound boneless beef (ribeye or prime chuck), sliced 1/8-inch thick 1 cup soy sauce<br> 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons cider vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon corn syrup<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 teaspoon sesame oil<br> One 1-inch piece ginger, pureed Splash of cola Splash of apple soda<br> 2 tablespoons cooking oil<br> 8 frozen gua bao buns<br> Spicy Aioli, recipe follows 2 cups mixed baby greens, for serving Tempura Onions, recipe follows 1 cup mayonnaise 1 cup your favorite hot sauce (recommended: sriracha) 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 cup corn syrup<br> 1/4 cup sambal (cl-garlic paste) 2 tablespoons honey<br> 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil<br> 4 cloves garlic, pureed 2 cups cooking oil 1 cup buttermilk<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3/4 cup tempura flour<br> 1/2 cup cold lemon-lime soda, such as Sprite<br> 1/2 medium yellow onion, cut into 1-inch-thick rings or strips<br> Instructions: Puree the onions and garlic in a food processor until smooth, adding a splash of water if needed. Pour the puree over the beef and let sit it at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes. (This step is to tenderize the meat. If you are worried about leaving meat out, place it in the refrigerator for 2 hours.) Whisk the soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, corn syrup, sugar, sesame oil, ginger, cola, apple soda and 1/2 cup room temperature water until well incorporated. Pour the mixture over the beef and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Set a skillet over high heat and get the oil scorching hot. Drop in the beef and listen for a sizzle when it hits the pan. (We are looking for a sear on the bottom, so do not touch the meat for first 2 minutes; let the pan do the work.) Once the edges of the meat are brown, mix it up while scraping the browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Cook until the meat juices have reduced by half and been absorbed into the beef, about 10 minutes. Set up a steamer and steam the frozen gua bao buns until they have a soft, pillow-like texture, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully open the steamed buns and drizzle some spicy aioli inside. Add a layer of baby greens and then, with a spoon or tongs, place the beef on top of the greens. Garnish the beef with tempura onions. Mix the mayonnaise, hot sauce, sour cream, corn syrup, sambal, honey, sesame oil and garlic in a bowl. Whisk until smooth. (Add half the amount of hot sauce and double the sour cream for milder heat.) Heat the oil in a pot to 350 degrees F for frying. Season the buttermilk with salt and pepper and set aside. Whisk the tempura flour, sprite, and 1/4 cup ice-cold water to get a pancake batter consistency. Dip the onions in the buttermilk, then coat them with the batter. Fry the onions until amber brown, then drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Season lightly with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 8451,&quot;The Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened<br> 1 3/4 cups packed dark brown sugar<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste<br> One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips (about 2 cups)<br> Instructions: Sift the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl.

Season the chicken all over with the thyme, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot, but not smoking. Working in batches, add the chicken to the skillet, skin-side down, and cook, flipping once, until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Turn the heat down to medium if the skillet starts to get too dark. Transfer the thighs to a baking sheet and roast in the oven until no longer pink near the bone, 10 to 12 minutes more.

Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Wrap the large ball of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate while preparing the rest of the recipe (feel free to make the dough the night before if you prefer.) To make the chicken broth: Put the chicken in a large stockpot and cover with 3 quarts of cool water. Add the vegetables and herbs and bring it up to a boil over medium-high heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour; skimming frequently as the oil rises to the surface. What we&#39;re doing here is not only cooking the chicken but also creating the base sauce for the pot pie. It&#39;s the old trick of killing two birds with one stone -- or one pot as the case may be. Remove the chicken to a platter to cool. When it&#39;s cool enough to handle shred the chicken meat, discarding the skin and bones, and set aside. Using a colander, strain the chicken broth into another pot and discard the solids; you should have about 2 quarts when you&#39;re done. To make the pot pie filling: Wipe out the stockpot and put it back on the stovetop over medium-low heat. Melt the butter and just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps. This is a roux, which will act as a thickener. Cook and stir the roux until it&#39;s the color of a California blonde. Now, gradually pour in the reserved chicken broth, whisking the entire time to prevent lumps. Whisk and simmer for 10 minutes to cook out the starchy taste of the flour and thicken the broth; it should look like cream of chicken soup. Fold in the carrots, pearl onions, peas, garlic, rosemary, thyme, and lemon juice; stir to combine. Simmer for 10 minutes to soften the vegetables a bit; season the mixture with salt and pepper. Stir in the shredded chicken until incorporated, remove from the heat and cool to room temperature; it will get quite thick as it cools down. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and set it out on the counter for 5 minutes to warm up a bit, making it easier to roll out. Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour. Roll the dough out into a big 14 by 20-inch rectangle. Carefully transfer the dough to a large rectangular pizza stone or standard sheet pan, leaving about 1 foot of the pastry hanging off 1 end. Spoon the cooled chicken filling on the pastry that is on the pizza stone, leaving a border around the sides. Lightly beat the egg with 3 tablespoons of water to make an egg wash and brush it on the dough border. Fold the \\free\\ dough over the filling like a blanket and crimp the ends with a fork to form a tight seal; it should look like a big pillow. Brush the top of the giant chicken pie with the remaining egg wash, sprinkle with the coarse salt, and cut tiny slashes in the top so steam can escape.

Add the tomatoes, cucumbers, garlic and a nice big pinch of salt to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a few times, scrape down the sides with a spatula, and pulse again. Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined strainer. Set aside to strain for 2 hours, giving it an occasional stir to redistribute the juices. For the cucumbers: Add the fish sauce, rice wine vinegar, sugar and sambal to a large bowl and stir to combine. Trim the ends of the cucumbers so they are even in size. Using a mandoline, shave the cucumbers lengthwise on all sides, turning the cucumber when you get to the seeds. Discard the center with the seeds. Stack the shaved cucumber and slice lengthwise into noodles, about the width of linguine. Add to the dressing and sit for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside. For the fish: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the thyme, chives, parsley and potato flakes to a small bowl and mix to combine. Sprinkle the halibut with salt, then brush with the egg wash. Dip each piece of fish into the herb and potato flake mixture, pressing firmly to ensure the crust is tightly adhered. Place onto a sheet tray with the crusted side up and set aside. Heat a large saute pan with some olive oil and the smashed garlic over medium-high heat. Swirl the pan to infuse the oil with the garlic. Cook until the garlic is golden brown, a few minutes, then remove from the pan. Add the zucchini and cook to soften, 2 to 3 minutes, then toss in the corn and cook for another minute. Finally, add the diced tomatoes and season with salt. Cook for just a minute, then turn off the heat. Heat a large nonstick pan with some olive oil over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers. Add the fish, crusted side down. Cook until the crust is golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Flip the fish, then transfer onto a sheet tray lined with a rack. Arrange the sliced tomatoes next to the halibut. Place into the oven and bake until it reaches an internal temperature of 125 to 130 degrees F when inserted with a thermometer, 5 to 7 minutes. Set up a deep fryer and heat canola oil to 350 degrees F. Combine the flour and wine in a small bowl and stir to make a batter. It should be the consistency of a thin pancake batter. If it&#39;s too thick, add a bit more wine. Dip the zucchini blossoms into the batter, then fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes, flipping halfway through. Drain on a paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt. To serve: Place a slice of the roasted tomato on the bottom of a shallow bowl and top with the cucumber noodles. Add some of the sauteed zucchini, corn and tomatoes over the top, followed by the fish, crust side up. Garnish with the fried zucchini blossoms and micro basil. Pour some of the tomato water around the edge of the plate right before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 8493,&quot;Creole Caesar Salad 2 cups of 3/4-inch cubed dried French or Italian white bread, crusts removed 1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon Angel Dust Cajun Seasoning (see below) Creole Anchovy Dressing 1 anchovy fillet 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 large egg 2/3 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese 2 teaspoons Creole mustard 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice 1 teaspoon water 1/8 teaspoon Angel Dust Cajun Seasoning (see below) 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 pound romaine lettuce, washed and cut into bite-sized pieces Grated Parmesan cheese 3 tablespoons Hungarian paprika 1 1/2 tablespoons Spanish paprika 5 teaspoons salt 1 1/4 teaspoons dried thyme leaves 1 1/4 teaspoons dried oregano 1 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/2 teaspoon dried basil 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder 1/8 teaspoon onion powder Instructions: To prepare croutons, heat the oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat for 1 minute.

Store in a resealable bag in a cool dry place for up to 3 months until ready to use. To bake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 9-inch cake pans with parchment. Coat with cooking spray. Whisk 1 1/4 cup water, oil, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl until well combined and slightly frothy. Add the dry mix and whisk vigorously until well combined and smooth, about 50 strokes. Divide between the prepared cake pans. Bake until lightly golden and slightly puffed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pans 5 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack right-side up to cool completely. Frost and decorate as desired. For cupcakes: Place liners in pans for 24 cupcakes. Fill each cup 2/3 full. Bake at 350 degrees F until golden, puffed and a toothpick comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through.

When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat and let the flavors infuse for 10 minutes. Whisk together the egg yolks and the sugar. In a thin stream, whisk half of the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Then pour the egg-cream mixture back into the saucepan containing the rest of the cream mixture. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you don?t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Meanwhile, in a bowl, put two handfuls of ice cubes in the bottom, and add cold water to cover. Rest a smaller bowl in the ice water. Pour the cream mixture through a fine sieve or chinois (to remove the vanilla bean pieces and cinnamon sticks) and into the smaller bowl. Chill 3 hours, then continue according to the directions of your ice cream maker. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 8505,&quot;W+M Carrot Pizza 2 ounces olive oil, plus more for the pan 2 ounces sugar<br> 2 ounces dry yeast<br> 2 ounces kosher salt<br> 9 cups all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups starter 1 cup unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups chopped onion (1-inch pieces)<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 8 cups whole milk<br> 4 cups heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper<br> 6 jumbo carrots, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds with a mandoline 2 medium oranges, zested and juiced 1/2 cup raw honey<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1 cup almonds 1 cup hazelnuts<br> 1 cup sesame seeds<br> 2 tablespoon coriander seeds<br> 1 tablespoon black peppercorns<br> 1 tablespoon fennel seeds<br> 2 tablespoons paprika<br> 1 tablespoon ground cumin<br> 2 cups grated Gruyere cheese Sliced Fresno chiles, for topping Chopped fresh cilantro, for topping Instructions: For the pizza dough: In a mixer fitted with a hook attachment, mix the olive oil, sugar, yeast, salt and 5 1/2 cups water for 5 minutes.

Season the ribs liberally on both sides with the Rib Rub. Refrigerate.<br> Prepare the grill for cooking over indirect heat at 300 degrees F using apple or cherry wood for flavor. Place the ribs directly on the cooking grate, meaty-side up. Cook for 1 hour. Flip and cook another 30 minutes. Flip again and cook until they are nicely caramelized and golden brown, about another 30 minutes, but may vary depending on your grill. Transfer the ribs to a platter.<br> Lay out two big double-layered sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil, each big enough to wrap a whole slab of the ribs. Transfer the ribs to the foil, meaty-side up. Fold the foil up around the ribs into a packet. Seal the packets snugly, being careful not to puncture the foil with the rib bones. Return to the grill for 45 minutes to 1 hour to reach your desired degree of tenderness. The best way to determine the doneness is to open the foil after 45 minutes and feel the texture of the meat. It should be very tender. Transfer the foil packets to a platter. Raise the temp of the grill to 400 degrees F. Remove the ribs from the foil and return to the cooking grate. Sprinkle lightly with additional Rib Rub #99. Cook for 5 minutes. Flip and sprinkle the other side lightly with the Rib Rub and cook for 5 minutes. Flip one last time and cook for 5 minutes more.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water. Brush the egg wash on the rim of a pastry square. Fold the pastry in half to form a triangle and press the edges to seal, then press with the tines of a fork. Repeat with the remaining pastries. Transfer to the prepared pan, spacing ? inch apart. Brush the tops of the pastry with the egg wash. 5. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, leaving behind any cheese that may have oozed out of the pastry.

Spoon sauce around mussels and put extra sauce in a serving bowl to be used for dipping crusty bread or serving over a side of pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 8537,&quot;Vera Cruz Corn 4 ears of corn, husked Cooking spray, if using the grill 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, plus more as needed 5 corn tortillas, cut into 1/4-inch slices (optional) 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion 2 jalapenos, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped Kosher salt and ground black pepper 2 to 4 tablespoons Chipotle Aioli (recipe follows) or to taste 1 cup grated or crumbled queso fresco (about 4 ounces) 1 large egg yolk 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1 small clove garlic, minced 1/2 cup canola oil 2 teaspoons minced chipotle in adobo sauce Kosher salt to taste Instructions: If grilling the corn, coat the grill grate with cooking spray and prepare a medium-high grill. Brush the corn with oil and place it on the grill. Cook, turning, until the corn is evenly cooked and browned in spots, 5 to 7 minutes. If boiling the corn, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the corn, cover, and remove from the heat. Let stand 3 to 5 minutes. Drain well. When the corn is cool enough to handle, cut it from the cob and set aside. If using the tortillas, line a baking sheet or large plate with paper towels. In a large skillet, heat 1 cup of the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmery and hot but not smoking. Add a handful or two of tortilla strips-they can be touching but not overlapping-and fry just until lightly browned around the edges, about 45 seconds. Transfer the strips to the paper towel-lined baking sheet, tossing and moving them around so they take on squiggly shapes as they cool and harden. Continue in batches until all the tortilla strips are fried, adding more oil to the pan if necessary. Set aside. In a small, preferably ovenproof, skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and jalapeno and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the corn and tortillas, if using, and toss until warmed through. Add a pinch each of salt and pepper, or to taste. If necessary, transfer to a small, ovenproof dish. Drizzle the aeoli on top and sprinkle with the cheese. Place an oven rack 6 inches from the broiler and turn the broiler to high. Place the skillet or dish under the broiler and cook until browned and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Watch carefully so it does not burn. Serve. In the work bowl of a food processor, place the egg yolk, mustard, lemon juice, and garlic. Process until blended. With the food processor running, add the oil just a few drops at a time. When the mixture begins to resemble mayonnaise (this will take a while because you&#39;re adding the oil so slowly), pour in the remaining oil in a very fine, slow stream. If making the aioli to be drizzled over Vera Cruz corn or a salad, thin it if necessary by adding water 1 tablespoon at a time until it is pourable. If using as a condiment to be spread or dolloped, it may not need any thinning. Add the chipotle and process until well blended. Add several pinches of salt to taste. Use at once or store in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 8538,&quot;Confetti Pancake Cake 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 2 1/2 cups buttermilk<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted<br> 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Vegetable oil, for skillet<br> 1/3 cup rainbow sprinkles, plus for sprinkling 3/4 cup vanilla frosting, from can<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, melted butter, eggs and vanilla. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the flour, and stir until combined but still somewhat lumpy. Mix in 1/4 cup of the sprinkles. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle pan over medium-high heat. When hot, lightly brush with oil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. In batches, spoon 1/2 cup batter per pancake onto the skillet, and immediately sprinkle some of the remaining sprinkles. Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface of the pancakes, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until golden brown on the underside and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes more. As you go, transfer cooked pancakes to a baking sheet, cover loosely with foil, and keep warm in the oven. Heat the frosting in the microwave until just barely runny, about 40 seconds (do not overheat or the frosting will separate). Stir. Make a giant pancake stack, and pour the warm frosting over the top. Sprinkle with additional sprinkles. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 8539,&quot;Chicken and Dumplings 1 (3-pound) whole chicken Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ounces unsalted butter, softened 1 lemon, halved and juiced; halves reserved 1/4-cup fresh chopped herbs, such as thyme, parsley and rosemary 1 onion, halved 4 garlic cloves, smashed Fresh whole herbs, such as rosemary, thyme and parsley sprigs 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 carrots, cut in large chunks 2 celery stalks, cut in large chunks 1 onion, halved 1 garlic bulb, halved Reserved chicken bones 2 quarts cold water 4 sprigs fresh parsley 4 sprigs fresh thyme 2 bay leaves 2 cups flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 3/4 to 1 cup buttermilk 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon oil 1/2 cup diced carrot 1/2 cup diced celery 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 bay leaves 1/4 cup flour 6 cups chicken stock 1/4 cup heavy cream Freshly ground black pepper, for garnish Chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish Instructions: For the chicken: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the chicken and discard. Rinse the chicken under cold water, inside and out. Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Season the body and cavity of the chicken generously with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, mash together the butter, lemon juice, and chopped herbs. Rub the herbed butter all over the chicken, as well as under the skin. Put the lemon halves, onion, garlic, and whole herbs inside the chicken cavity, for added flavor. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Place the chicken, breast side up, in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Roast for 1 hour until the meat is no longer pink. When cool enough to handle, shred the meat, discarding the skin and set aside. Reserve the bones for chicken stock. For the stock: Coat a large stockpot with olive oil and place over medium heat. Add the vegetables and saute for 3 minutes. Add the reserved chicken bones, water, and herbs; simmer for 1 hour. Strain the stock to remove the solids and set aside. For the dumplings: sift dry ingredients together in a large bowl. In a small bowl, lightly beat the eggs and milk together; pour the liquid in the dry ingredients and gently fold. Mix just until the dough comes together, the batter should be thick and cake-like. For the sauce: In a Dutch oven, melt butter and heat oil over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, garlic, and bay leaves. Saute until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the flour to make a roux. Continue to stir and cook for 2 minutes to coat the flour and remove the starchy taste. Slowly pour in the chicken stock, 1 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. Let sauce simmer until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. Fold the reserved shredded chicken into the sauce and bring up to a simmer. Using 2 spoons, carefully drop heaping tablespoonfuls of the dumpling batter into the hot mixture. The dumplings should cover the top of the sauce, but should not be touching or crowded. Let the dumplings poach for 10 to 15 minutes until they are firm and puffy. Season with freshly cracked black pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 8540,&quot;Corn Tortillas 4 cups masa harina 1 teaspoon salt 2 cups warm water 2 teaspoons honey Instructions: Put the masa harina in a bowl and mix in the salt. Add about 1 cup warm water and mix with your hands; add more water as needed until the dough comes together. Add the honey and smear it into the dough. Knead for a few minutes to smooth the dough out. The dough should be firm and springy and should not stick to your hands. Test by forming a small disk, if it cracks around the edges you need more water. Place a piece of heavy plastic (like from a garbage bag) onto a tortilla press. Form a 1 1/2-inch ball of dough and place it in the center of the press. Top with another piece of plastic, close the press, and push the lever down to form the tortilla. (Alternately, the dough balls can be rolled between plastic sheets with a rolling pin.) Open the press and remove the top layer of plastic. Carefully peel the tortilla off the bottom plastic and place it onto a hot, ungreased cast iron skillet; cook for about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the tortilla and place it on a clean tea towel; keep it covered to keep it soft and pliable. Continue until you have used up all the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 8541,&quot;Bun Bo Hue 5 pounds oxtail and/or beef marrow bones 1 pound boneless beef shin (or flank steak) 2 pounds pork hocks (not smoked), cut crosswise 1-inch thick (or pork neck bones ) 1 yellow onion, peeled and halved through the root<br> Kosher salt 10 stalks lemongrass 2 teaspoons shrimp paste 1/3 cup vegetable oil 2 teaspoons annatto seeds 1/3 cup minced shallots 2 tablespoons minced garlic 2 tablespoons cl flakes 3 tablespoons fish sauce, plus more to taste 5 teaspoons sugar, plus more to taste Salt 2 pounds thick round rice noodles (see Cook&#39;s Note) 4 scallions, sliced 1 medium white onion, very thinly sliced and soaked in ice water for 20 minutes<br> 1 cup cilantro leaves, roughly chopped Serving suggestions: bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves, very thinly sliced red cabbage, lime wedges Instructions: For the broth: Place a large colander in the sink. Place the oxtails, marrow bones, beef shin and pork hocks in a large (at least 8-quart) pot. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Let boil for a few minutes, then remove from the heat. Scoop out the bones and meat into the colander and discard the water. Wash the pot. Rinse off the bones and meat and put them back into the pot. Fill with fresh cold water to cover by 1 inch. Add the yellow onion halves and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Periodically skim the foam and some, but not all, of the fat. Simmer until the meats are tender but not falling apart, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, then remove the beef shins and pork hocks. (Do not remove the oxtails or pork neck bones at this stage, if using.) When the meats are completely cool, wrap them in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. Meanwhile, cut the tops off of the lemongrass stalks, about 6 inches from the base, and discard. Smash 6 of the bottom stalks with a meat pounder to bruise and open up the lemongrass. For the remaining 4 stalks, peel off 2 or 3 layers until you reach the smoother, more tender core. Quarter the peeled stalks lengthwise and then slice thinly across. Reserve the sliced lemongrass for the satay. Add the bruised lemongrass stalks to the broth and continue to simmer until the broth has reduced by about 10 percent from its original amount, about 1 more hour, then strain the broth into a clean pot. If using, pick the meat from the cooled oxtail and pork neck bones (save the beef shins and pork hocks for later) and reserve; discard the bones, onion and lemongrass. Bring the shrimp paste and 2 cups water to a simmer in a small saucepan, then let simmer for 5 minutes. Skim off the foam. Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes for the fine solids to settle to the bottom. Pour the shrimp water into the large pot of stock, leaving the fine solids behind. For the satay: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the annatto seeds and let the seeds infuse the oil and turn it red, about 1 minute. Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard. Add the shallots to the annatto oil and cook until starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic, cl flakes and the reserved chopped lemongrass and cook until the garlic starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons fish sauce, 4 teaspoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir to incorporate and then cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is sticky and thickened slightly to the texture of loose jam. (The satay is done when a spoon dragged across the bottom of the skillet leaves a trail and the oil begins to separate from the solids.) Turn off the heat and remove half of the satay for serving. Add about 1 cup of the broth to the remaining satay in the skillet and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes to infuse, then strain back into the pot with the broth. Add the remaining tablespoon fish sauce, teaspoon sugar and 2 teaspoons salt to the broth. Simmer for 15 minutes for the flavors to meld. Add the pork hocks back into the simmering broth to re-warm, and slice the beef shin meat . Before serving, taste the broth and add more seasoning, if necessary. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Drain very well, and divide among 8 bowls. Top each bowl with a pork hock, if using, some slices of shin, some oxtail and pork neck meat, if using; top with scallions, white onion and cilantro. Pour hot broth into the bowls to completely cover the noodles. Serve with the reserved satay and suggested garnishes on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 8542,&quot;Big Daddy&#39;s Beer Float 1 pint super premium coffee ice cream Chilled beer mug 1 (22-ounce) bottle chocolate stout, chilled (recommended: Brand Rogue Chocolate Stout) Fresh whipped cream, for garnish Shaved chocolate curls, for garnish Cherries, for garnish Instructions: Add 2 large scoops of ice cream to a chilled beer mug.

Serve these with lots of napkins if your crowd is the peel-and-eat type. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]</p><p>&quot; 8552,&quot;Trio of Brigadeiros Nonstick cooking spray, for the dish 3 tablespoons salted butter<br> One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk<br> 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup toasted coconut<br> 1/4 cup rainbow sprinkles<br> 1/4 cup cocoa powder<br> Instructions: Spray a shallow dish with cooking spray and set aside. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. When the butter has melted, whisk in the condensed milk, cocoa powder and salt until well combined. Cook over a medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula, until the mixture becomes thick and starts to pull away from the bottom and sides of the pan, 7 to 15 minutes. Pour the mixture onto the prepared dish and spread it out so it cools quickly. DO NOT touch the mixture with your hands at this point\\u2014it is VERY hot. If you are having trouble spreading, use a rubber spatula or spoon. (It doesn&#39;t need to look perfect.) Refrigerate until cool enough to comfortably handle, about 1 hour to 70 minutes. (The colder the mixture, the easier the next steps will be.) Place the coconut, sprinkles and cocoa powder in separate shallow bowls. Take a tablespoon of the candy mixture and form into a ball. Place the ball on a sheet pan. Continue forming the balls and placing on the sheet pan until all of the mixture is used; you should have 24 to 28 small balls. Once all the balls are prepared, roll each in one of the desired coatings, pressing the flaked coconut and sprinkles coatings so they stick. Place each coated ball in a little paper cup. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to eat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 8553,&quot;Bread with Tahini and Syrup 2 cups flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon whole milk 1/3 cup tahini 2 tablespoons maple syrup 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly Melted butter Maple syrup, warmed, for drizzling Instructions: In a large bowl, combine flour, salt and butter.

Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture. To make the dough in a food processor: Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor fitted with the metal blade until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry, add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade and bring the dough together by hand. Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. For the filling: Put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Toss the apples with the lemon juice. Add the sugar and toss to combine evenly. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the blackberries and gently stir until they just start to break down, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour, cinnamon and nutmeg over the fruit and gently stir until the liquid thickens, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated.) Cut the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a disc 11 to 12 inches wide. Layer the dough between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Place a baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with one of the discs of dough, and trim it so it lays about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pan. Evenly layer the apple-berry filling in the pan. Use a chef&#39;s knife or a pizza cutter and cut the second round into 1/2-inch thick strips. Lay strips of dough, evenly spaced, across the entire pie. Weave more strips of dough perpendicular through the previous strips to make a lattice or basket weave design across the entire pie. Trim the excess ends from the strips of dough. Pinch the bottom crust edge and lattice edge together, and flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool on a rack for at least 3 hours before serving. The pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 8567,&quot;Grilled Yucatan Chicken Skewers 6 chicken thighs, skinless and boneless, cut in half lengthwise 1/2 cup fresh squeezed orange juice 1/4 cup fresh squeezed lime juice 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 tablespoons ancho cl powder 3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons chipotle in adobo sauce, pureed Salt and freshly ground black pepper Chopped scallions, for garnish Grilled lime halves, for garnish Instructions: Skewer each half chicken thigh with 2 skewers so that they lay flat.

Add the diced onions and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add half of the minced garlic and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Set aside to lightly cool. In a medium bowl, add the ground beef, panko, chicken stock, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, egg, 2 tablespoons of the Dijon and the sauteed onions and garlic. Reserve the pan that the onion and garlic were cooked in. Combine the ground beef mixture until all ingredients are fully incorporated. Turn the saute pan back on to medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Take a small amount of the meat mixture and cook a tester patty to check for seasoning; adjust the remaining meat mixture with more salt if necessary. Form the remaining meat mixture into 4 equally-sized oval patties, patting firmly, each 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and cook the patties over medium-high heat until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove the patties onto a sheet tray and discard any excess fat from the pan. To make the gravy, return the pan to medium-high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until brown and softened, another 5 minutes. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the beef stock and remaining 2 tablespoons Dijon. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the gravy has thickened slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the Salisbury steaks back into the gravy and simmer for 5 minutes. For the peas, carrots and peppers: To a medium saute pan, add the carrots, 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and a generous pinch of salt. Turn on the heat to medium high and cook until the carrots are slightly tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the red bell pepper and remaining 1/4 cup chicken stock and cook until the chicken stock has mostly reduced, about another 5 minutes. Add the frozen peas and butter and swirl until the butter has melted, then turn off the heat and set aside. For the garlic mashed potatoes: Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan over low heat. In another saucepan, add the potatoes and garlic and cover with cold water. Generously season the water with salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes, then return them to the pan. Using a hand mixer, blend the potatoes and add half of the butter. Then add some of the heated cream and the rest of the butter. Continue to mix, gradually adding more heavy cream until you reach the desired consistency for your mashed potatoes. You may not need to use all of the cream. To plate: Plate the Salisbury steaks and smother with the gravy, then garnish with the sliced chives. Serve alongside the peas, carrots and red peppers and garlic mashed potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 8574,&quot;Black Rice Salad 1/2 pound dry black beans, soaked overnight, cooked, drained, cooking liquid reserved 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 teaspoon cumin 2 cups long grain rice 4 1/2 cups reserved bean cooking liquid Salt and freshly ground pepper 3 green onions, finely sliced 1 jalapeno, finely chopped Instructions: In a medium saucepan heat oil over medium-high heat, add onions and garlic and saute until soft.

Place the butter in a bowl; add the sage and thyme. Season the butter well with pepper and stir to combine. Set aside.<br> Twenty minutes before roasting, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> Place the turkey on a clean work surface. Using a chef&#39;s knife, remove the remaining portion of the neck and reserve it for the stock and gravy. Remove the wishbone to make carving easier; set it aside with the neck for the gravy. With your hand, carefully release the skin on both breasts to form two pockets. Rub the seasoned butter under the released skin. If there is any extra butter, massage it on the outside of the skin.<br> Put the celery, carrots, and onions in a large roasting pan. Pour 1/2 cup of the chicken stock into the pan bottom to prevent the drippings from burning. Place the prepared turkey, skin side up, on top of the vegetables. Place the pan in the oven with the wide neck end toward the rear of the oven. Roast for 15 minutes, then rotate the pan back to front. Roast for 15 minutes more, until skin turns golden.

Season the chicken with 1 teaspoon salt. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken on all sides until almost cooked through and beginning to brown, 5 minutes. Stir in the chorizo; cook until it releases its oil and begins to brown, another 5 minutes. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook just until the garlic is toasted and the onions are slightly softened, 2 minutes more. Stir in the chicken stock, clam juice and fire-roasted tomatoes. Add the peas, paprika, saffron and 1 tablespoon salt. Increase the heat to medium and slowly bring the liquid to a boil. Meanwhile, lightly spray a baking sheet with canola oil. Spread the rice evenly onto the tray and lightly spray with more canola oil. Toast the rice in the oven until light golden brown in spots, 10 minutes. At this point, the chicken mixture should be boiling. Ladle it evenly over the rice and return the baking sheet to the oven. Cover the paella by inverting another baking sheet and placing it on top. Bake until the liquid is completely absorbed and the rice is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Carefully remove the top baking sheet, and then remove the paella from the oven. Preheat the broiler.

Pulse in the shortening until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add the butter and pulse until pea-size pieces form. Add 2 tablespoons beaten egg (reserve the rest) and 2 tablespoons ice water; pulse a few times until the dough begins to clump together, adding more water 1/2 tablespoon at a time as needed. Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap, press into a rectangle, wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Meanwhile, make the filling: Preheat the oven to 450? F. Toss the mushrooms with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch each of kosher salt and pepper on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until the mushrooms shrink and release some liquid, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the celery root, parsnips and/or turnips, the carrots, fennel, shallots, rosemary, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil; toss. Roast until the vegetables are tender and the mushroom liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Lightly dust a piece of parchment paper with flour. Roll out the dough on the parchment into a 12-by-14-inch rectangle. Refrigerate until the vegetables are done. Drizzle 2/3 cup broth on the baking sheet, especially in the corners, and scrape up any browned bits. Stir in the remaining 1 cup broth, the heavy cream and peas. Cut the dough into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Lay half the strips across the top of the sheet pan diagonally, trimming or adding extra bits as needed. Lay the remaining strips on top in the other direction. Brush the dough with the reserved beaten egg. Bake until the crust is golden and the liquid on the pan thickens, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 8618,&quot;BBQ Pulled Pork Bruschetta Olive oil 2 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 pounds onion, sliced 1 loaf French bread, sliced on into 1/2-inch slices 2 cloves garlic, smashed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 pound pulled pork Barbecue sauce Chives, sliced for garnish Olive oil 2 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 pounds onion, sliced 1 loaf French bread, sliced on into 1/2-inch slices 2 cloves garlic, smashed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 pound pulled pork Barbecue sauce Chives, sliced for garnish Instructions: Preheat the grill to high.

Place 1 piece of toasted seaweed on top of a sushi roller (makisushi), with the short end closest to you. Using lightly wet fingers, press enough rice onto the seaweed to completely cover the seaweed, and press firmly so that rice adheres to seaweed. Turn seaweed over so that rice side now faces down. Arrange strips of tuna on top of seaweed, with the tuna strips running vertically in line with the short side of the seaweed, about 1/3 of the way into the seaweed sheet. Spread a small amount of wasabi on the tuna, then sprinkle with sliced scallions. Using the sushi roller as a guide, carefully begin rolling the seaweed up, pressing as tightly as possible so that the roll is firm and compact. Once the roll is completely rolled, reposition roll on sushi roller and press again. Sprinkle sesame seeds on a flat surface and lightly roll in seeds to coat. Allow roll to sit for a few seconds before slicing with a sharp, damp knife. Cut roll into 6 or 8 pieces and serve with dollops of sauce spooned on top, or alongside for dipping. Repeat with remaining ingredients. In a large bowl, add rice and cover with lots of water. Stir rice in water with your hands, then pour off most of the water, and agitate 10 to 15 times by quickly moving your hand back and forth, swishing rice against side of bowl. Rinse the rice several more times, until the water that drains off of the rice is almost clear. Transfer the rice to a colander and let drain for 1 hour, undisturbed. Transfer the rice to a rice cooker, add the water, cover and cook as directed by manufacturer&#39;s directions. While the rice is cooking, bring rice vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan, and then remove from the heat. Add sugar and salt and stir until dissolved. Allow to cool to room temperature. When rice is done, allow cooked rice to remain in rice cooker for 10 minutes. Transfer rice to a large shallow mixing bowl (traditionally a wooden tub, called a hangiri), so that rice forms a mound in the center of the bowl. Using a diagonal slicing motion, gently cut into rice with a wooden paddle (called a kijakushi), and pour cooled vinegar mixture over top of rice. \\Cut\\ rice several times to evenly distribute vinegar mixture, then allow to cool. Gently turn rice over from time to time with paddle so that rice cools evenly. You might want to consider using a fan if time is of the essence. When rice has cooled to body temperature, it is ready to use for sushi rolls. Rice can be kept at the proper temperature by placing it in an insulated container such as a small ice chest, covered with a damp kitchen towel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 8628,&quot;Rumanian Turkey Burgers (Carnegila) 1 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons coriander seeds 1 medium onion 3 cloves garlic 1 pound ground turkey 1 teaspoon ground cumin Salt and pepper Serving suggestions: rolls with ketchup, tomato, fried onions, feta cheese Instructions: Toast the coriander in a pan for 1 minute.

Beat on medium speed until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until fully combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl halfway through with a spatula. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk in 2 batches; mix until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half and flatten each portion into a disk. Place each disk into a separate resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate the dough until firm, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out both pieces of dough until about 1/4 inch thick. Using 2 different sized butterfly cookie cutters (2-inch and 3-inch), cut out as many cookies as you can. Use the 2-inch cutter on one portion of dough and the 3-inch cutter on the other portion of dough. Be sure to dip the cutters in flour every other cookie or so while you are cutting them out to prevent the dough from sticking. Transfer as many of the cookies as will fit onto the prepared baking sheets and bake until they&#39;re just set but not browned, about 7 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then remove to racks to cool completely before decorating. Repeat with the remaining cookies. For the icing: Combine the powdered sugar, milk and egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until thick and glossy. Add more powdered sugar if the icing seems too thin. Add more milk if it is too thick. You may need to play with it until it is just right. The icing should be loose enough to stick to the cookies in an even layer, but not too loose to slide off. For decorating: Divide the icing among 3 or 4 smaller bowls. Add 2 to 3 drops each of red and orange food coloring to each bowl, scattering it over the surface of the icing. Drag a toothpick through the drops a few times to make swirls. Dip the top of each cookie in the icing and let the excess drip off over the bowl. Transfer the dipped cookies to a rack and allow to dry completely. When the colors in the first bowl of icing become too muddled, move on to the next bowl of icing and so forth until all the cookies are iced. Let the icing dry completely, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 8648,&quot;Oven Roaster with Fresh Herbs and Garlic and Roasted Potatoes 7 1/2 pound oven roaster or capon 1 cup fresh herbs on stalks or 1 tablespoon dried thyme, rosemary and tarragon 5 to 6 whole garlic cloves in skins 1 cup liquid (water, broth, wine or a combo) for deglazing 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup chopped parsley 2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed clean and cut in 1/4th lengthwise so they are more like wedges Instructions: Remove wing tips (save for stock) and cut out wish bone.

Lightly brush each circle with the melted butter. Spread a third of the preserves or jam on each circle, leaving a clearance of 1/4-inch on the perimeter so the filling won&#39;t ooze out while baking. Sprinkle a third of the almond-raisin-sugar mixture on top of the preserves and press in slightly to help adhere.<br> Using a pizza wheel, divide each circle into four quarters. Divide each quarter into three thin triangles, for a total of 12 wedges. Roll each triangle from the curved side to the point and place on a parchment-lined or nonstick baking sheet. Refrigerate the sheets for 30 minutes while preheating the oven to 350 degrees F. Note: The rugelach can be frozen on the trays and then stored in a zip-top bag in the freezer for baking fresh later.<br> Carefully brush each rugelach with the egg wash, trying to avoid drips. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until deep golden. Cool on a rack and store in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 8658,&quot;Macaroni and Cheese with Broccoli 1 package macaroni and cheese mix 1 to 1 1/2 cups leftover broccoli florets Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the pork and beef to a bowl and season liberally with salt and pepper. Trim the crust of bread and chop into fresh breadcrumbs in a food processor, scrape into a small bowl and soak in milk. Return the processor to the base. Squeeze out some of the liquid from the bread and add the moistened bread to the meat, season with a little freshly grated nutmeg, a few grates. Add a beaten egg yolk and half of the chopped parsley to the bowl, a couple of tablespoons. Add 2 cloves finely chopped garlic to the meat. Add the mortadella to the food processor and pulse to very finely chop the meat, add to the ground meats along with a couple of handfuls of grated pecorino. Drizzle the meat liberally with extra-virgin olive oil. Place a baking rack over a baking sheet or cover a baking sheet with parchment baking paper. Mix the meatballs and roll into large walnut-size balls and roast 12 to 15 minutes to light brown, but not cooked through. Meanwhile, heat extra-virgin olive oil, 3 turns of the pot, over medium to medium-high heat in a large Dutch oven. To the warm oil, add fennel seeds, cl pepper, onions, and sliced garlic, season with salt and pepper, and marjoram. Stir 4 to 5 minutes then add tomato paste and stir 30 seconds, pour in wine and stir a minute, then add stock and tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes into small bits and when sauce comes to a boil reduce heat to simmer, add a few leaves of torn basil, reserving a few for garnish. Add the remaining chopped parsley and gently slide in the meatballs. Simmer the mixture 15 to 20 minutes to combine flavors and finish cooking the meat through. Cook&#39;s Note: Cook the pasta at this time or if this is a make-ahead meal cool completely, cover and store. Reheat the sauce over medium heat covered until it bubbles then uncovered at gentle simmer while pasta cooks. Cook the pasta in large pot of boiling, salted water to al dente. Save about 1/2 cup starchy cooking liquid just before draining. Add the drained pasta back to the hot pot with butter, a few ladles of sauce and the reserved starchy liquid. Toss to combine and melt butter. Serve in bowls with lots of sauce and meatballs on top, lots of shaved cheese and a few leaves of torn basil. Serve with simple tossed greens salad if you like but it&#39;ll probably get ignored...it is spaghetti and meatballs night! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 8660,&quot;S&#39;mores Melted Ice Cream Cake 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> One 15.25-ounce box chocolate cake mix<br> 1 pint high-quality s&#39;mores ice cream, melted<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1/2 cup marshmallow creme<br> Crushed graham crackers and mini marshmallows, for topping<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Set aside. For the skewers: Preheat a grill, cast-iron grill, griddle or pan over medium-high heat. In a medium bowl, add the chicken, pineapple, jalape?os and oil and toss to coat. Add the elote seasoning and a couple grinds of black pepper and toss again. Add to metal skewers in any order, but I prefer adding all of the same thing on one skewer. Cook on all sides until the chicken is cooked through and the pineapples and jalape?os are charred, 10 to 12 minutes, turning every couple of minutes. Brush the skewers with the sauce halfway through and again when they\\u2019re done. Transfer the skewers to a cutting board. Remove the skewers and roughly chop the chicken, pineapples and jalape?os together. Transfer to a serving bowl. For the tacos: In a medium bowl, combine the onions and cilantro. Place some taco filling in a warm tortilla and top with some onion-cilantro mixture, a squeeze of lime juice and a few shakes of hot sauce if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 8664,&quot;Gyudon 1/4 cup soy sauce 3 tablespoons mirin<br> 3 tablespoons sake<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 teaspoon instant dashi powder, such as Ajinomoto\\u2019s Hondashi (see Cook\\u2019s Note)<br> 1 medium onion, thinly sliced (about 1 cup)<br> 1 1/4 pounds very thinly sliced boneless rib-eye (see Cook\\u2019s Note)<br> 6 cups steamed white rice<br> 4 poached eggs, optional<br> 2 scallions, thinly sliced<br> Shichimi togarashi, for serving, optional<br> Pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga), for serving, optional<br> Instructions: Pour 1 cup water into a 12-inch skillet. Add the soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar and instant dashi powder, stir to combine and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the onions and simmer, stirring once or twice, until they start to soften, about 3 minutes. Raise the heat to high and bring the liquid to a boil. Add the beef and cook, turning the slices often with tongs, until the meat is barely cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes. For the tenderest texture, cook the meat as little as possible.<br> Divide the rice among 4 bowls and top with equal portions of the beef and sauce. Top with an egg if using.

Add the mint. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool. Puree the fruit in a food processor until liquefied. Pour the fruit into a medium bowl and add the salt. Remove the mint leaves from the syrup. Add the syrup to the pureed fruit and mix well. Pour the cantaloupe mixture into a pre-chilled 7 by 12-inch glass baking dish. Place it uncovered into the freezer. Stir with a fork every 1/2 hour until almost completely frozen but still grainy, about 3 to 4 hours. Cooking Notes: This works best in 2 glass loaf pans or one 7 by 12-inch glass baking dish. The only critical point here is NOT to stir it past the almost frozen state or the ice crystals will become too fine and hard to scrape. Entertaining Notes: To serve, find a really interesting glass or bowl and dip it in cold water. Put the bowl into the freezer for 15 minutes; repeat. The result will be a frosted glass that looks great and sets the right backdrop for the granita. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 8666,&quot;Chocolate Peanut Butter Fudge Crisco?

For the Buffalo sauce: To a medium saute pan over medium heat, add the oil, butter, jalapeno and garlic. Allow the butter to melt, and lightly saute the garlic and jalapeno for about 2 minutes. Stir in the hot sauce, chicken broth, lime juice and vinegar and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm until ready to use. For the dry rub: Combine the smoked paprika, cayenne, celery salt, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Mix to blend. Combine the chicken and 1/4 cup of the Buffalo sauce in a bowl; toss to coat. Transfer the chicken to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and sprinkle with the dry rub. Bake until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, allow to cool a bit, then chop the chicken into bite-size pieces. Set aside. (Leave the oven at 350 degrees F for the nachos.) For the pita chips: While the chicken is baking, fill a deep, heavy pot with 4 inches of oil and heat the oil to 350 degrees F over moderate heat. In batches, fry the pita wedges until golden brown and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and immediately sprinkle with salt. For the blue cheese topping: To a small saucepan over medium heat, add the milk and 1/2 cup of the smoked blue cheese. Allow the cheese to melt into the milk, then transfer the mixture to a bowl along with the remaining blue cheese and the mayonnaise, sour cream and chives. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble: In a large roasting pan, spread out half of the pita chips in an even layer. Top with half of the chopped chicken, half of the remaining Buffalo sauce, half of the blue cheese topping and 1/2 cup of the shredded mozzarella. Repeat, ending with a generous helping of the shredded mozzarella. Place the roasting pan on the center rack of the oven and bake until the cheese has melted and the pitas have crisped and soaked up some of the hot sauce, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle the nachos with the celery, radish, jalapeno and Parmesan.

Season all the pieces of eggplant with salt and pepper on both sides. Coat a large skillet with oil and heat over medium flame. Fry the eggplant in a single layer, turning once, until brown on both sides- you will need to do this in batches, adding more oil, as necessary. Drain the eggplant as they cook on a paper towel-lined platter. Add a little more oil to the pan and toss in the onion, garlic, lemon slices, oregano, and parsley. Cook and stir until soft and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the ground lamb, stirring to break up the meat; season with salt and pepper, and toss in the cinnamon stick. Stir in the tomato paste and hand-crushed tomatoes. Simmer until the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish with 1/3 of the eggplant slices; they should completely cover the bottom with no gaps. Spread 1/2 of the meat sauce over the eggplant, evening it out with a spatula. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the feta and Parmesan. Repeat the layers again, ending with a final layer of eggplant. Cover the top with a nice even layer of bread crumbs. Bake the moussaka for 30 to 40 minutes or until the top is golden.

Set aside. Pour about 2 inches of water into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. In a medium, heatproof bowl, whisk together the remaining salt, egg yolk, vinegar, water, lemon juice, and saffron until light and frothy. Place the bowl over the simmering water and whisk constantly until the yolk mixture is just warmer than room temperature, about 20 seconds. Remove from the heat and whisk in the garlic paste. While whisking constantly, gradually drizzle in the olive oil until a smooth and slightly thick sauce is formed. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Meanwhile, make the sweet potatoes: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Put a baking sheet on the center rack and preheat for 10 minutes. Quarter the sweet potatoes and leave the skins on. In a large bowl, toss the wedges with the olive oil. Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and place the wedges evenly spaced on the pan, cut-side down. Bake until the bottoms of the potatoes are lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven. Turn the wedges so the other cut side comes in contact with the hot baking sheet. Continue to bake the sweet potatoes until both sides are browned and tender, about 15 minutes more. To serve, arrange the sweet potatoes on a platter, and season with salt, to taste. Drizzle the potatoes with some of the aioli. Serve warm. Cook&#39;s Note: We recommend golden olive oil for its smooth finish and low acidity. The golden color comes from olive pressed at the peak of ripeness. These oils are made on California, southern France, and Sicily. *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.

Cover the pot and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Cook until the potatoes are cooked through, about 30 minutes. Drain and let cool slightly. Meanwhile, bring another large saucepan of water to a boil; salt generously. Blanch the green beans until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and then shock in an ice water bath to stop cooking. When cool enough to handle, cut the potatoes into 1 1/2-inch chunks and place in a large serving bowl. Add the green beans, red onions and tomatoes and toss together. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil and dried basil. Pour about three-quarters of the dressing over the salad and toss to combine. (The potatoes should break up a bit and coat the salad.) Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve at room temperature, garnished with torn basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 8678,&quot;Beef Grillades with Cheesy Fresh Corn and Sweet Onion Grits 1 1/2 pounds top round steak (1/2-inch thick) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon Spanish paprika 1 teaspoon New Mexican cl powder 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon cl de arbol powder 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more if needed 2 Vidalia onions, halved and thinly sliced 1 poblano cl, thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 2 cups homemade chicken stock or low-sodium canned chicken broth One 16-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained 2 sprigs fresh thyme 1 bay leaf Splash red wine vinegar Honey 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 small Vidalia onion, finely diced 3 ears fresh corn, kernels removed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups whole milk 1 1/2 cups stone-ground grits 1 1/2 cups grated aged white cheddar 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 3 green onions, green and pale green parts only, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish Poached eggs, for serving, optional Fresh parsley leaves, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the grillades: Cut the steak in half. Sandwich each half between 2 pieces of plastic wrap or wax paper, and pound to an even 1/8-inch thickness. Sprinkle the steak on both sides with salt and pepper, and cut into 2-inch pieces. Mix the paprika, New Mexican cl powder, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and cl de arbol powder in a small bowl until combined. Put the flour in a shallow baking dish and season it with salt and pepper. Heat the butter and canola oil in a large, high-sided saute pan over high heat. Working in batches, coat the steak pieces in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess, and brown them on both sides in the hot fat. Transfer the steak to a plate as you finish each batch. Add the onions, poblano and red pepper to the pan, adding more oil if needed, and cook until the vegetables are very soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the spice mixture and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the chicken stock, tomatoes, thyme and bay leaf, and bring to a boil. Return the beef to the pan, cover and transfer to the oven to cook until tender, about 45 minutes. When done, remove the beef to a plate and cover to keep warm. Using potholders, move the pan to the stovetop and set over high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened into a gravy, about10 minutes. Season with a splash of vinegar. Add honey, salt and pepper to taste; stir in the parsley. Before serving, return the grillades to the pan, cover and warm them up over medium-low heat. For the grits: Heat the butter and canola oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft. Add the corn, season with salt and pepper and cook for a few minutes. Add the milk and 3 cups water and bring to a boil. Slowly whisk in the grits until well combined and continue whisking until smooth. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and smooth, about 45 minutes; add more water as needed to keep the mixture creamy. Remove from the heat, and whisk in the cheddar and Parmesan and the green onions. To serve: Use a slotted spoon to transfer the grillades to a shallow platter. Pour over some of the gravy. Top with the grits, poached eggs if using, and some of the remaining gravy. Garnish with green onions and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 8679,&quot;Peas and Prosciutto 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 ounces sliced prosciutto (1/8-inch thick), sliced into ribbons<br> 1 shallot, minced 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 pound frozen peas, thawed<br> Pinch red pepper flakes<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon lemon zest<br> Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes to allow the flavor and aroma to build. Remove from the heat, add 4 cups of ice and stir until the ice has melted and the brine has cooled. Place the suckling pig in a double-lined trash bag and pour the brine over. Place in a cooler or refrigerate for 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Remove the pig from the brine, place it on a large baking sheet and pat dry. Sprinkle inside and outside with salt and pepper. Cover the pig&#39;s ears, snout and tail with aluminum foil. Cook for 4 to 4 1/2 hours (20 minutes per pound). Remove the foil from the ears, snout and tail. Let rest for 15 to 20 minutes. To serve, warm up tortillas on a medium-hot grill or nonstick saute pan. Keep warm. Carve, pull or chop the roasted pig and hold warm. Taste and season with apple cider vinegar and salt as needed. Serve with Pineapple Pico and Tomatillo Salsa. Mix together the jalapenos, lime juice, cilantro, red onions, bell peppers and pineapple in a bowl. Season with salt. Preheat the broiler. Broil the tomatillos and jalapeno on a baking sheet placed 4 inches below the heat source, until darkly roasted and blackened in spots, about 5 minutes. Flip and broil until splotchy-black and blistered, 4 to 5 minutes more. Add the tomatillos and jalapeno, as well as the delicious juice that has run onto the baking sheet, to a blender. Add the cilantro and 1/4 cup water and blend to a coarse puree; scrape into a serving dish. Rinse the onions under cold water, then shake to remove the excess moisture; stir into the salsa. Season with salt, about a generous 1/4 teaspoon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 8681,&quot;Chicken Mozzarella Pasta 1 pound penne or rigatoni 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br> 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 large onion, finely diced<br> One 25-ounce jar good-quality marinara sauce<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley<br> 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into medium cubes<br> 1/4 cup Parmesan shavings, plus grated Parmesan, for serving 12 basil leaves, cut into chiffonade Instructions: Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces in a single layer and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Allow to cook, without stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Stir the chicken around to brown it on all sides. Remove to a plate. In the same skillet over medium-high heat, add the garlic and onions and stir immediately to start cooking. Cook until the onions are deep golden, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and pour in the marinara sauce, red pepper flakes and 1/2 cup water. Stir until the onions and garlic are mixed in, then add the chicken back to the skillet. Add the parsley and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 7 to 8 minutes. Make sure the sauce is bubbly and very hot, then gently stir in the mozzarella. Let sit, undisturbed, until you can see that the mozzarella is very soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the pasta and pour it onto a platter. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Immediately sprinkle on the Parmesan shavings. Pour on the sauce, sprinkle with grated Parmesan and the chiffonade of basil and serve immediately! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 8682,&quot;Tomatoes Roasted with Pesto 2 to 2 1/2 pounds large red tomatoes 3 tablespoons good olive oil 2 teaspoons dried oregano Kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup Pesto, store-bought or homemade, recipe follows 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1/4 cup walnuts 1/4 cup pine nuts 3 tablespoons diced garlic (9 cloves) 5 cups fresh basil leaves, packed 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups good olive oil 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
