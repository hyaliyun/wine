It's bold on the palate with supple fruit encased in big, craggy tannins that linger on the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"With decent blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this is an everyday Cabernet for drinking now. It's dry and tannic, and the finish is clean and spicy. The price makes it a good buy.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"A full and ripe wine, it is richly layered with black fruits, soft tannins and a juicy, warm aftertaste. The acidity at the end adds a little freshness. It's made to be drunk now.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This wine offers a sizable mouthful of blackberry and softened though persistent and present tannins. On the nose a whiff of rubber glove mars the wine.","designation":"Estate Bottled"},{"country":"ar","description":"Nectarine, peach pit and a dusty, oily scent define the nose on this mid-level, quaffable white. The body is on the plump side, with ample acidity. Flavors of stone fruits and papaya finish briny.","designation":"Estate Bottled"},{"country":"fr","description":"With considerable spicy, smoky wood, this is a rich, while extracted, wine. It does have some juicy fruit that shows potential so it should soften and become less bitter. Drink from 2017.","designation":""},{"country":"es","description":"Bring on the funk! This smells unsure and soapy, while the palate feels hard and spiky. Flavors of black cherry and bitter greens come with a woody lift, while the finish is abrasive and a bit hot. The 2004 version of Onomastica was better.","designation":"Onomastica Reserva"},{"country":"US","description":"Plum, dark chocolate, blackberry jam and licorice flavors star in this ambitious Cabernet. It's soft and appealing, but a little too one-dimensional, and it's hard to see it aging.","designation":"Saunders Vineyard Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"A light and rather stalky wine from the flat plain close to the Dordogne river. It has some black currant flavors that are firmed out by dry tannins. The aftertaste is fresh and juicy.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Weight and dense tannins go with the firm black fruits and acidity, producing a wine that is spicy, fruity and likely to age quickly. Drink from 2015.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Light and fruity, this is a fresh, rounded wine with attractive berry fruits. It is already smooth, although the tannins are in the background. It's fragrant with a medium-term potential. Drink from 2015.","designation":""},{"country":"es","description":"Despite having mildly cheesy, oily aromas, this ranks as a perfectly quaffable everyday white, with modest acidity and a round, easygoing attitude. Flavors of peach and melon finish a touch mealy.","designation":"Edicion Limitada"},{"country":"US","description":"While youthful on the nose with scents of fresh apple, citrus and blossom, it feels fleshy on the palate with flavors of ripe pineapple and citrus.

With savory raspberry and vanilla flavors, it's ready to drink now.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Though only aged in 30% new oak half French and half Hungarian the wood is far out front here with notes of vanilla and butterscotch overtaking the cherry. It's light in style with vanilla flavors throughout.","designation":"Pheasant Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"Earthy aromas include forest floor, black berries, leather and spice. The palate is less expressive and has a green character, showing unripe red cherry alongside astringent tannins that give it an abrupt, bitter close.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"A bit funky, the nose shows notes that suggest animal, farmyard and leather along with aromas of overripe black berries. The fruit has already dried up on the palate however, leaving green coffee bean sensations and astringent tannins that generate a drying, bitter finish. The second bottle was exactly the same.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A pretty coppery color reminiscent of the ros s of southern fr, this unusual blend of Mourv dre, Syrah, Malbec and Viognier is done via the saign e (bleeding the tanks) method. Muted flavors of dried peach, banana and cantaloupe combine in an interesting way, but the finish has off-flavors.","designation":"La Primavera"},{"country":"US","description":"A lightly aromatic wine with notes of peach, melon, and toasted grapenuts. It drinks off dry, but lacks the stitching to hold it all together.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"There's a stubbornly vegetal streak to this Merlot. It pops out in the aroma and lasts through the flavors of cherry pie and raspberry sour candy. Ready to drink now.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"High alcohol gives the wine heat, especially in the finish.

Tasted twice, with consistent results.","designation":"La Tertazza Bloc Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Showing good varietal character, it's dry and tart in acidity, with a delicate mouthfeel. The flavors are of cherry pie, cranberries, mushrooms, sandalwood and white pepper.

There's a hint of something burnt in the nose and the finish, which thins out rather quickly.","designation":"Fiore Rosso"},{"country":"fr","description":"A solid, foursquare and tannic wine, it shows the structure of the vintage. It is dense and firm, the wood aging giving dryness. Hints of the juicy fruity side of the wine are there, so wait until 2015 for it fully to balance out.","designation":"Grand Palais"},{"country":"US","description":"Pure Merlot from a cool site in a cool vintage yields a somewhat attenuated wine with tart berry fruit. The barrel aging has contributed flavors of sandalwood and chocolate, but the chalky tannins need some rich red meat to soften them up.","designation":"Stillwater Creek Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Pure Petit Verdot is not an easy wine to balance. Here the cool vintage seems to have led to a disjointed wine with flavors that don't quite sync up. The grapy fruit shows a hint of residual sugar, the acids are tart and citrusy, the tannins chalky. More bottle age may help pull it all together.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Innovation is a blend of 50% Sangiovese, and one-quarter each Barbera and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in neutral oak.

It's unabashedly juicy and fruity on the palate, but balanced with brisk acidity. A fun, easy-drinking sip.","designation":"Dry"},{"country":"US","description":"This Zin has candied, fruit punch flavors of cherries, licorice, raisins, brown sugar and cinnamon. It's a robust wine, mouthfilling and heady, that's best paired with barbecue.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The name references the two vintages blended together. Of more interest is the mix of eight different red grapes, principally Sangiovese, Cabernet and Cab Franc. It's dark, oaky and quite tannic, showing some bitterness as a result.","designation":"Due Anni"},{"country":"es","description":"While this isn't easy to identify as Shiraz, it still qualifies as a good, everyday red wine. Rubbery berry aromas come with a pinch of spearmint, while the palate feels juicy and racy.

It's dry and tannic, with the blackberry flavors veering into bacon. Give it an hour or two in the decanter, and drink up.","designation":"Paso Bordo Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"Smoky wood aromas are confirmed on the palate by a tough, wood-laden character. It's all spice and toast, leaving little room at this stage for fruit. That should come because the wine has weight and suggestions of rich berry fruits in the background.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Very structured, this wood-aged wine is showing more tannin than fruit. Smoky, burnt flavors dominate a wine that is all tannin and dry texture. Only the juicy acidity at the end suggests potential.","designation":""},{"country":"ar","description":"With its bright pink color and fruity aromas of cherry, strawberry and raspberry, this wine is more good than bad.

It does have hints of black currant flavors that are hidden by the firm tannins and dense texture. While it will soften, it will always be an austere.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this wine seems to bear more resemblance to Cabernet Sauvignon than Merlot with its notes of plum, herbs and bell pepper.

It has a melted mouthfeel. The finish suggests caramelized wood.

Its blueberry fruit lurks shyly in the background and there's a send-off of sturdy tannin on the finish.","designation":"Small Lot Blend"},{"country":"US","description":"Spicy, slightly sweet foods will pair well with this easy-drinking Viognier. Its flavors range from mangoes and oranges to honey, vanilla bean and cinnamon.
