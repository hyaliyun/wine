Add the chicken, making sure that all the pieces are fully submerged. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or seal the bag and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours. Mix together the flour, baking powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in another large resealable plastic bag. Set aside. For the waffles: Preheat a waffle iron to medium-high. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (to keep cooked waffles warm). Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the milk, butter, shortening and eggs in another bowl. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and gently stir until just incorporated (it&#39;s okay if there are some lumps). Lightly brush the top and bottom of the waffle iron with butter. Fill the waffle iron about three-quarters of the way full (there should still be some waffle iron showing). Close the lid gently and cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp, 6 to 7 minutes. Keep the cooked waffles warm in the oven or covered with foil on a plate while you make the remaining waffles. For frying the chicken: Fill a wide, deep pot with 2 1/2 to 3 inches of oil and heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. As the oil heats, remove half the chicken from the buttermilk brine, letting any excess brine drip back into the bowl. Place into the bag of seasoned flour and seal. Shake the bag to thoroughly coat the chicken pieces. Remove the chicken, shaking off any excess flour, and transfer to a wire rack. Working in batches, carefully add the coated chicken to the hot oil. The oil temperature will drop to between 300 and 325 degrees F; adjust the heat to maintain this temperature (it&#39;s important not to let the oil get too hot or the crust will brown before the meat is cooked through). Fry the chicken, undisturbed, for about 1 minute to allow the crust to set; then begin to check the chicken pieces to make sure they are browning evenly and carefully turn as needed so that the pieces are evenly golden brown and cooked through and an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a clean rack to drain; season with salt. Flour and fry the remaining chicken. Spread each waffle with softened butter and top with 1 to 2 pieces of chicken. Drizzle generously with honey and a few dashes of hot sauce and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 55599,&quot;Grilled Wedge with Bacon and Blue Cheese 6 ounces bacon, chopped 1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1/3 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 romaine hearts, cut in half Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat until hot, about 15 minutes. Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate, reserving the fat in the pan. Meanwhile, stir together the blue cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a couple turns of pepper in a small bowl.

Transfer to a medium bowl and cover with hot water; let sit for 20 minutes to soften. Drain. Meanwhile, add the shrimp paste foil packet and the coriander, cumin, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon to the skillet. Toast the shrimp paste (in the foil), about 1 minute per side and stir to toast the spices until golden brown in spots and very fragrant, about 2 minutes total. Remove the foil packet and transfer the spices to a bowl. When completely cool, remove the shrimp paste from the foil and discard the foil. Grind the spices into a powder in a spice grinder. Turn the heat up to medium-high. Add the lemongrass, galangal, garlic, cilantro roots and shallot and toast until blackened in spots, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add the drained chiles, toasted shrimp paste, ground spices, nutmeg and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Pulse and scrape down the food processor multiple times until you have a fine paste. Place the curry paste and 1/2 cup coconut milk in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. As the mixture cooks down, stir more frequently, scraping the bottom, until the oil separates and the paste sticks aggressively to the pan, 6 to 8 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons tamarind, the tablespoon fish sauce and tablespoon palm sugar and cook, stirring, a few seconds. Add the chicken thighs and turn in the curry paste to coat. Add the rest of the coconut milk, the peanuts, bay leaves, star anise, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 cup water. Simmer gently, partially covered, until the chicken is almost cooked through and the liquid has reduced slightly, 40 minutes. Tuck in the potatoes and onion, making sure the potatoes are submerged in the liquid. Simmer, partially covered, until the potatoes are fork tender, about 20 more minutes. Add 2 more tablespoons of tamarind. Taste and adjust with more tamarind, fish sauce, sugar and salt, if necessary. There might be a layer of bright orange oil on top. Feel free to skim some of it off, but it is traditional to leave some oil in the curry.

Remove the tips of the wings and discard or save for making stock. Use kitchen shears or a knife to separate the wings at the joint. Toss the chicken wings and vegetable oil on a baking sheet until well coated. Sprinkle with salt and a few grinds of pepper. Broil the wings until the skin starts to crisp and brown, about 12 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and flip the wings over. Broil the other side until crisp and golden brown, about 8 minutes more. Meanwhile, put the cranberries in a food processor and pulse until you have small pieces. Add them to a medium skillet with the sweet chili sauce and 3/4 cup water. Add all of the scallion whites and 2 of the scallion greens. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Strain into a medium bowl, pressing to get as much liquid through as possible. Return the liquid to the skillet and simmer until thick and shiny, like a glaze. Remove the wings and check for doneness; if a knife inserted into the meat closest to the bone is no longer pink, it&#39;s done. Toss the wings in the sauce bowl until well coated, return to the baking sheet and broil until the glaze turns shiny and the skin has blistered spots of char, 1 to 3 minutes. Check the wings every minute at this stage to ensure the glaze does not burn. If your glaze is not sticking as well as you would like, apply the glaze with a pastry brush. Sprinkle the remaining scallion greens over the top of the wings.

If you like, you can use bottled water instead. Do not use warm tap water. Boil water in kettle. If you are in a particularly cold climate, such as the North of England, add hot water to the tea pot until you are ready to pour in the boiling water, so that the tea pot will already be warm when you add the tea leaves. Put 1 tablespoon of tea leaves in tea pot for 2 6-ounce servings. Pour boiling water over tea leaves. Allow to brew for 3 - 5 minutes, according to how much you will be cutting the tea with milk or cream. 5 minutes is only for tea that you intend to add a lot of milk or cream to. 3 minutes will allow the tea leaves to reach their optimum flavor, so it is considered the perfect brewing time. Cover with a tea cozy in order to keep the heat in the pot. &quot;,&quot;[British Breakfast Tea, Earl Grey, Darjeeling, Assam]&quot; 55647,&quot;Feta Cheese Fondue with Walnuts and Parsley 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons flour 2 cups whole milk 6 ounces feta cheese 2 scallions minced 1 tablespoon chopped parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup walnuts toasted and finely chopped Instructions: In a 2 quart saucepan over medium heat, melt butter the stir in the flour. Stir the 2 together into a paste. Whisk in the milk to create what the French call a bechamel sauce. Drop the temperature a little and simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes so it thickens and the flour taste cooks out. After that it&#39;s easy, just fold in the crumbled feta, scallions, and parsley. Season it with salt and a little cracked pepper. Once the cheese melts it is officially fondue, you can either use a fondue pot with a candle or just leave it in the pot and have everyone eat from there. Finish it with the walnuts tossed on top.

Wash the collards thoroughly to remove the grit, 2 or 3 times, until the water runs clear. Dry thoroughly. Tear the leaves into large pieces. Place a large pot over medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the onion, garlic, bay leaves, and ham hock. Cook until the onions are soft and starting to brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Pack in the greens, pushing them down into the pot. Add the broth, vinegar, and sugar. Bring up to a boil turning the greens over occasionally with a wooden spoon as they wilt. Lower to a simmer, cover the pot, and let cook for 45 minutes. Taste the \\pot liquor\\ (broth) and check the seasoning, add salt and pepper. Cover and let cook for 15 more minutes. Remove the bay leaves and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 55658,&quot;Three Cheese Hasselback Potatoes 6 medium baking potatoes (8 to 10 ounces each) 1 ounce lemon juice 1/3 cup butter, melted 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 2 teaspoons sea or kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 cup finely grated mixed Parmesan, gruyere and double Gloucester cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Peel all the potatoes and, as you peel them, put them in a large container with 1 gallon water and the lemon juice to keep them from browning. Once they are all peeled, remove them from the water and pat dry. Then slice the potatoes about 1/4-inch apart and about three-quarters of the way through to create a series of uniform slices so that they are still joined together at the bottom. This should create a fan type finish to the potatoes.<br> Next, using a whisk, blend the butter, parsley, salt and pepper. Make sure to mix well. Dunk the potatoes into the butter mixture, making sure that the slits in the potato soak up the mixture as well. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes.<br> After 30 minutes, remove the potatoes, re-heat any remaining butter and drizzle on top. Divide the cheese mixture over the potatoes. Bake the potatoes until the cheese is melted and the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Once melted, remove the potatoes and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55659,&quot;Mulled Wine and Cranberry Sorbet 4 cups fresh cranberries 2 1/2 cups red wine (any red wine is fine, but do shy away from one with too much alcohol, as it may affect the freezing process) 4 whole allspice 2 cinnamon sticks 2 whole cloves 1 orange, zest peeled in strips and juice 1 vanilla bean Instructions: Combine the cranberries, red wine, 2 1/2 cups water, allspice, cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, orange zest, orange juice and vanilla bean in a saucepot. Cook over medium heat for 20 to 30 minutes. The cranberries will have become very soft and the liquid will be reduced by about 20-percent.<br> Strain the mixture through a sieve fine enough to catch the spices, pushing lightly to extract some of the cranberry pulp. Chill the sorbet mixture thoroughly and spin in an ice cream maker until frozen. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Tempranillo, Barolo, Chianti]&quot; 55660,&quot;Butternut Squash 3 Ways: Mushroom Ravioli with Brown Butter, Sage and Butternut Squash 1 large butternut squash (about 3 pounds) 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter<br> 10 fresh sage leaves<br> 1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> One 10-ounce bag fresh mushroom ravioli<br> Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Trim the top and bottom of the squash. Cut in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds with a large spoon and place the halves, cut-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Rub all sides with the olive oil. Bake until fork-tender, about 50 minutes. Let cool.<br> Use a small spoon to scoop 1/2- to 1-inch pieces of flesh (leaving skin behind) from the neck portion of one of the squash halves. You should have about 2 cups. Place in a bowl and set aside. Reserve the remaining squash for another use.<br> Place the butter in a large skillet and melt over medium-low heat. Add the sage, hazelnuts, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds black pepper. Cook until the butter stops bubbling, and the butter solids begin to brown on the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Keep an eye on it as it can go from nutty brown to burnt very quickly. Once the butter is a nice, nutty brown color, turn off the heat. Using a slotted spoon, remove the sage and place on a paper towel to drain. Add the squash to the pan and toss to coat, seasoning with salt if needed.<br> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ravioli and cook according to the package instructions. Remove with a slotted spoon, add to the squash and browned butter and toss to coat.<br> Divide between two shallow bowls, then top each with some of the crisped sage and a sprinkling of cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 55661,&quot;LOBSTER SAUCE Lobster shells from 4 lobsters, meat reserved for another use 10 Szechwan peppercorns 3 ounces extra virgin olive oil 1 large white onion, cut into small dice 1 carrot, peeled, cut into small dice 1 stalk celery, cut into small dice 1 ounce tomato paste 1/2 cup brandy 1/4 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons roux, equal parts butter and flour 1 piece star anise 2 quarts lobster stock Bouquet Garni 1 head fennel, shredded 2 teaspoons cold butter Instructions: In a hot pan, cook the lobster shells and peppercorns in olive oil until well browned. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and cook until lightly caramelized. Add the tomato paste and cook a few more minutes, being careful not to add any more color to the tomato paste. Deglaze with brandy and reduce by 1/2. Add paprika, cayenne, roux, star anise, lobster stock, bouquet garni, and fennel, and whisk to incorporate the roux. Simmer covered for 1 hour. Strain the sauce, discarding the vegetables. Place lobster shells in a food processor and grind. Return ground shells to the sauce and cook until reduced to sauce consistency. Finish with cold butter whisked into sauce. When butter is incorporated, strain sauce again.

Bring to a boil and immediately add the lobsters. Cook for 7 minutes. Remove the lobsters, split them, brush them with melted butter and place under a broiler for another 7-8 minutes, or just until the meat is cooked and the top is nicely browned. If desired, a minute before removing from broiler, you may sprinkle the green tomalley with buttered bread crumbs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Wine]&quot; 55664,&quot;Heart Shaped Jelly Donuts 3 to 3 1/2 cups bread flour, plus extra for dusting 1 teaspoon salt 1 (6/10 ounce) cake fresh yeast or 1 (1/4 ounce) envelope active dry yeast 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 cup lukewarm milk 2 eggs 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Vegetable oil, for frying 1 cup strawberry or raspberry jam Confectioners&#39; sugar A deep-frying thermometer A 2-inch heart shaped cutter 2 cookie sheets A pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch plain tip Instructions: In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine 3 cups of the flour and the salt. Combine the yeast, sugar, and milk in a small bowl and let \\proof\\ (foam up) for 5 minutes. Add the proofed yeast mixture to the flour. Add the eggs and butter and mix at low speed until the dough comes together and is soft, but not sticky. If the dough does seem sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition, until a soft dough forms. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 1 minute, until smooth and elastic. Return the dough to the mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap (or transfer to a clean oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap). Let rise in a warm spot (such as an oven that is not on) until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. (The recipe can be made up to this point and refrigerated after the kneading up to 1 day in advance. The dough will rise slowly in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.) Turn on the mixer for a few seconds to punch down the dough, or punch it down in the bowl with your fist. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times. Roll the dough out 1-inch thick, letting it \\rest\\ a few times during the rolling (if you handle the dough too much, the natural gluten will tighten up and make your donuts tough). Lightly flour 2 cookie sheets. Using a well-floured cutter, cut out hearts of dough, transferring them to the cookie sheets as you work, spacing them 2 inches apart. Reroll the scraps and cut out more disks to use up the dough. Cover lightly with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in bulk, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, pour 3 inches of vegetable oil into a deep, heavy pot and heat it to 350 degrees F. Lay out a thick layer of paper towels or brown paper bags for draining the fried donuts. Spoon the raspberry jam into your pastry bag. Working in batches of 6 or 7, transfer the risen donuts to the hot oil and fry until golden and puffed, turning frequently, about 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the hot donuts to the paper to drain. When cool enough to handle, poke the tip of your pastry bag into the center of each donut hole (entering from the side). Squeeze in a little jam. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve as soon as possible. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 55665,&quot;Any Liquor Pantry Cocktail 2 ounces liquor, such as vodka, gin, rum, bourbon, whiskey or tequila 1 1/2 ounces sour, such as lemon juice, lime juice, grapefruit juice, unsweetened pomegranate juice, unsweetened cranberry juice, pickle brine (from sour pickles, pickled jalapenos, giardiniera, etc.) or vinegar 1 ounce sweet, such as simple syrup, agave, maple syrup, honey, orange juice, pineapple juice, maraschino cherry juice from the jar or Triple Sec<br> Flavor enhancer, such as herb sprigs or fruit pieces, optional<br> 2 ounces fizzy topper, such as plain seltzer, flavored seltzer, prosecco or other sparkling wine, ginger ale or sparkling Italian soda like San Pellegrino, optional<br> Garnish, such as fresh fruit, pickles, olives, herb sprigs, maraschino cherries or other fruit in syrup, candy or crunchy raw vegetables Instructions: Fill a cocktail shaker with ice.

Drain on brown paper. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan. Place the bread slices in a food processor and pulse until coarse crumbs are formed. Reserve 1 cup breadcrumbs for Round 2 Recipe, Fried Potato Cakes. Add the remaining breadcrumbs to the skillet and cook until they are lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Set aside Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray. In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the milk and butter. Place the potatoes into a large pot, cover with cold water, add a generous pinch of salt, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until tender and they crumble when pressed with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. When the potatoes are cooked through, drain them well, put them back into the pot, and mash them. Slowly mix in the warm milk and butter mixture until incorporated. Mix in the grated cheese and cream cheese. Don&#39;t over mix or the potatoes will become gummy. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. (Reserve 2 cups mashed potatoes for Round 2 Recipe). Put the potatoes into the prepared baking dish, crumble the bacon over the top, and sprinkle evenly with the breadcrumbs. Bake until heated through and golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve garnished with chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55668,&quot;Frita Cubano 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise 1/2 cup sour cream 4 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1 pound 80/20 ground beef 1/2 pound Mexican chorizo 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 medium white onions, chopped 12 slices Swiss cheese 12 mini Hawaiian rolls, cut in half Mini French Fries, recipe follows 3 large russet potatoes 1 quart peanut oil Kosher salt Instructions: For the quick mojo aioli: Whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, Dijon mustard, cumin, paprika, onion powder and garlic powder. Cover and refrigerate until ready to dress the burgers. For the burgers: Mix the ground beef, chorizo, cumin, onion powder, paprika, cayenne, salt and pepper in a large bowl, folding it over itself until thoroughly mixed. Let the meat rest 15 minutes at room temperature or for up to 4 hours refrigerated. Shape the meat into 12 balls all the same size, then lightly press them into chubby round patties. Preheat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the onions and sweat until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the patties on top of the onions and press the patties onto the onions using a spatula. Let cook, 3 to 4 minutes; the onions will continue to cook and caramelize in the patty juices, adding flavor to the patties. Flip the patties and cook until firm, 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove from the heat and top with the Swiss cheese. Spread 1 tablespoon mojo aioli on the bottoms of each Hawaiian roll, then top with a patty and a generous handful of the Mini French Fries. Serve. Peel the potatoes, then shred them on the largest holes of a box grater. Soak in cold water to remove starch and prevent browning, 5 minutes. Strain in a colander and dry on paper towels. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 375 degrees F. Fry the potatoes in batches, moving the potatoes gently with a spider to keep them separated, until brown and crispy, about 4 minutes.

Double it for stiffness. Wrap around the outside rim so that it rises at least an inch above the top of the dish, and tape to secure. Puree the berries with 1/4 cup/55 g sugar, the lemon juice and salt. Strain and reserve. Put the yolks in a nonreactive bowl with 1/4 cup/55 g sugar and 1/2 cup/125 g of the berry puree. (Reserve the remaining puree for another use.) Set the bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water, making sure the bowl does not touch the water below, and whisk until the sugar dissolves and it is warm in the center. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and set aside. Put 1/4 cup/60 ml water into a ramekin, sprinkle the gelatin on top and let soften 5 minutes. Set the ramekin in the hot water in the saucepan (make sure the water does not come up over the edge of the ramekin) and let it melt, about 2 minutes. It should be translucent. Whisk this into the berry mixture, and let cool until it thickens slightly. Don&#39;t let it set too far. Beat the whites with the cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually incorporate the remaining 1/4 cup/55 g sugar, and beat to thick, shiny peaks like whipped cream. Whip the cream in a separate bowl. Stir a spoonful of the whites into the berry mixture to lighten it. Scrape the remaining whites and cream on top and fold together. Spoon into the prepared mold, cover and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours. To serve, remove the collar and spoon into dishes. This is best eaten on the day it is made or the next day. After that, the gelatin starts to break down. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55671,&quot;Crab and Avocado Salad with Pancetta 1 pound jumbo lump crabmeat, picked through 1 avocado, cut into 1-inch pieces Freshly ground pepper 12 thin slices pancetta (about 3 ounces) 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup sour cream 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 1 anchovy fillet 1 clove garlic, chopped Juice of 1/2 lemon Kosher salt 2 small heads Boston lettuce, torn into large pieces 3 cups baby arugula 1 14-ounce can hearts of palm, drained and cut into 1/2-inch pieces Instructions: Working in batches, cook the pancetta in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 6 minutes.

Simmer for about 10 minutes Add large onion chopped to the pot, let simmer for about 20 minutes until the onions are translucent. The longer you let simmer the more flavor blends. At this point add the potatoes and clam juice to the pot. The clam juice should cover the potatoes. Cover the pot and let simmer until the potatoes become tender not mushy. Then add the clams, butter, dash of salt and fresh ground pepper. Cover pot and let simmer for 5 minutes, then turn stove off and let set the chowder sit on the stove. At this point if I&#39;m making it a day ahead which I usually do because the flavors seem to blend better, this would be the stock. Pack it in ice to chill quickly then refrigerate.

In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and salt. Pour in the oil and, when absorbed, scrape in the dissolved yeast. Add the remaining 1/2 cup water and knead on low speed about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm spot for 30 minutes. (Dough will stretch when lightly pulled.) Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down on the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover with a damp towel and let them rest for 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be loosely covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for 1 to 2 days. Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat it to 450 degrees F. Heat a large skillet over high heat and cook the eggplant and artichoke hearts separately in 1 tablespoon olive oil, adding more oil if necessary. To prepare each pizza, place a ball of dough on a lightly floured surface. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into a 7 or 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle. (Or roll out with a rolling pin.) Place dough on a pizza paddle or a cutting board and brush it with olive oil. Arrange the mozzarella and fontina cheeses over the inner circle. Top with the eggplant and artichoke hearts. Add a layer of tomato slices and sprinkle over the Parmesan and thyme. Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone and cook until the dough is brown and the cheese is bubbling, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove carefully, cut into 6 slices, and sprinkle with basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 55677,&quot;Hard Polenta Cakes with Taleggio and Cherry Tomatoes 3/4 cup whole milk, plus more if needed Pinch cayenne pepper 1 bay leaf Kosher salt 1/2 cup polenta 1/4 cup mascarpone 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 4 ounces taleggio cheese, rind removed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved lengthwise Extra-virgin olive oil Coarse sea salt, for finishing 1 bunch fresh chives, finely chopped Instructions: Combine the milk, 1/2 cup water, the cayenne and bay leaf in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and season generously with salt. You want to take the seasoning to the edge of too salty in this case; to do this you MUST taste as you go! Polenta acts like a \\salt eraser; if you don&#39;t salt abundantly in this early step, you&#39;ll never recover. When the liquid comes to a boil, gradually sprinkle in the polenta, whisking constantly. Once the polenta is combined, IMMEDIATELY switch over to a wooden spoon and stir frequently until the polenta thickens, 30 to 35 minutes. Taste the polenta to see if it&#39;s cooked through. If it still feels mealy and grainy, add some more milk or water and continue to cook for another 10 minutes. Repeat this process as needed until the polenta feels smooth on your tongue. Remove the bay leaf and stir in the mascarpone and Parmigiano-Reggiano, then remove from the heat. Line a 7-inch square baking pan with plastic wrap. Pour the polenta into the pan and cover with plastic, pressing down so the plastic sits on the surface of the polenta. Chill until set, at least 45 minutes. (All of this can totally be done ahead of time, like yesterday!) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the cooled polenta into 1-inch squares. Place the squares on a baking sheet and top each with a piece of taleggio. Put the cherry tomatoes on a separate baking sheet and toss them with olive oil. Bake both the polenta squares and the tomatoes for 10 minutes. The tomatoes should be hot, starting to relax and getting a little squishy, and the taleggio should be nicely melted. Place the polenta cakes on a serving dish, top each square with a tomato half, and garnish each with a little sprinkey-dink of coarse sea salt and chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 55678,&quot;Watercress, Avocado and Mango Salad 1/2 cup pink grapefruit juice, reduced to 1/4 cup 1 tablespoon honey 1 teaspoon minced shallots 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil Salt and pepper to taste 6-ounces fresh watercress 1 cup diced fresh mango 1 Haas avocado, cut into 6 wedges Instructions: Place the grapefruit juice in a small nonreactive saucepan and cook until reduced in volume by one-half.

Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to medium and cook until reduced by one-third, about 30 minutes. Add the chicken broth and continue cooking until reduced by half, about 40 more minutes (you should have about 2 cups liquid). Strain into a clean saucepan. Mix the butter and flour in a bowl to form a paste. Whisk the paste into the sauce and simmer over medium heat, whisking, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Whisk in the heavy cream and season with salt. Set aside. Meanwhile, make the meatballs: Pulse the bacon and onion in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl and add the beef, breadcrumbs, parsley, egg, garlic, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; mix until just combined. Dampen your hands and form into about 48 meatballs, 1 inch each. Heat the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add the meatballs to the skillet and cook, turning, until browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Wipe out the skillet, add the sauce and the meatballs, and cook over medium heat until the sauce is simmering and the meatballs are heated through, about 2 minutes. (Add 1 to 2 tablespoons water if the sauce is too thick.)

Wrap lightly and place in the refrigerator for 12 hours. Get the grill hot 1 hour before cooking (a charcoal or wood fire, preferably with hardwood); the embers must be burned down and glowing and there should be no flames at all. Remove the steak from the refrigerator and leave at room temperature for the same hour that the grill is getting ready. When ready to grill, place the steak on the center of the hot grill and rotate left and right to get proper grill marks. Do this for both sides, about 10 minutes. When this is done, move the steak to a cooler part of the grill and cook to rare, 25 to 30 minutes. You will have to test it with your fingers by pressing gently. When done, place the steak on a rack set inside a sheet pan so the steak does not sit in its own juices. Then place a knob of French butter on top and lightly tent it with tin foil to rest for at least 15 minutes before carving. For the romaine marmalade and watercress: In a blender or food processor, combine the watercress, romaine, garlic, cilantro, parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Add the oil and puree until smooth.

Pulse again just until incorporated. Dollop the compound butter towards 1 side of a piece of natural parchment paper or plastic wrap. Roll into a log, twisting opposite ways on both ends to create a tightly wrapped log of butter. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to set. (Can be stored up to 1 week in the refrigerator and up to 1 month in the freezer.) This could be made into 2 logs, as you will only need half this recipe for the steaks. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Once butter log is set, slice 1/2 the whole log into 1/4-inch disks. Cut a slit in the side of each fillet, and stuff with a butter disk. Tie each fillet with kitchen twine to keep it shape and sprinkle pepper each side. Add the olive oil to a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, sear each fillet until brown on both sides, about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Move skillet into the preheated oven to cook to desired doneness. Put another disk of the compound butter on top of each fillet just about 3 minutes before removing from oven, to just begin to melt but not melted completely.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Arrange the veal bones and scraps in a single layer on 2 or 3 baking sheets lined with foil. Put the trays in the oven and cook until the bones brown, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Heat a large skillet and add 1 tablespoon of the oil. When it begins to smoke lightly, add the 2 skin-on onion halves, cut side down. We want them to turn black. Combine the remaining sliced onion, carrots and celery. When the flesh part of the onion halves turn black, remove them from the pan. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and stir in the vegetables. Season with salt and cook, stirring from time to time, until the vegetables soften, about 5 to 8 minutes. When the bones are roasted and browned, drain off any excess grease and add to a large pot. Cover with cold water, (warm water makes a cloudy stock) and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and use a ladle to skim any foam or impurities from the top. Add the vegetables, the cheesecloth containing the thyme, bay leaves and black peppercorns and the black onion halves (which will add flavor and enrich the color). Stir in a pinch of salt, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 6 to 8 hours. Shut the off the heat and allow the stock to rest. Taste it! If it tastes watery or has an undeveloped flavor, cook it longer! I have made stock that has taken 12 to 16 hours to come to fruition. Strain the stock and return it to the pot. Gently simmer the stock over low to medium heat to reduce and intensify the flavors. Use a ladle to skim any impurities as the stock reduces.

Add the cranberries and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook until reduced and syrupy and the cranberries are plump, 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature. For the cauliflower puree: Bring the cream to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the cauliflower and bring to a medium simmer. Cook until the cream is reduced by a third and the cauliflower is fork tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the cauliflower and half of the reduced cream to a food processor and process until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste. If you want a thinner puree, add more cream. For the fried Brussels sprouts: Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer. Add the Brussels sprouts and fry until light golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain well and toss with salt and pepper to taste. For the duck breasts: Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Whisk together the five-spice powder, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, brown sugar, thyme and 2 tablespoons each salt and pepper. Liberally coat the duck breasts on both sides with the spice mixture. Grill skin-side down until crispy and the fat is rendered, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the breasts and continue cooking to an internal temperature of 140 to 150 degrees F, about another 3 minutes. Let rest for 5 to 7 minutes before slicing into 1/2-inch medallions. To serve: Arrange some slices of duck breast atop a smear of cauliflower puree. Top with compote and scatter fried Brussels sprouts around the plate. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 55702,&quot;Blanched Asparagus 1/2 pound asparagus Salt Water Instructions: Place asparagus in a medium pot filled with boiling salted water for 40 seconds. Remove asparagus and serve with sea bass. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55703,&quot;Chocolate Pavlova with Sorbet 1/2 cup egg whites, at room temperature (from about 4 eggs) 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 tablespoon raspberry vinegar or red wine vinegar 1/4 cup cocoa powder, sifted 1 pint orange or raspberry sorbet 2 kiwis, peeled and thinly sliced or 1 cup of another ripe fruit, such as sliced peaches or nectarines 10 strawberries, hulled (green parts trimmed off) and thinly sliced or other berries, such as raspberries or blackberries Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in a clean, dry bowl until foamy. Add the granulated sugar, cornstarch, vanilla, and vinegar and continue whipping until stiff, smooth, and glossy, about 5 minutes more. Add the sifted cocoa powder and mix 10 to 20 more seconds. On a sheet of parchment paper cut to fit a sheet pan, use a pencil to draw or trace a circle 9-inches in diameter. Line the sheet pan with the parchment, pencil side down (you should still be able to see the circle). Spoon the egg whites into the circle, using the back of the spoon to smooth the top and sides of the disk. Bake in the center of the oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 300 degrees F and bake until the meringue has puffed up and cracked on the top, about 45 minutes more. Turn off the oven, prop the oven door open, and let the pavlova cool in the oven at least 30 minutes, to room temperature. This ensures a gradual cooling, which protects the delicate meringue. Before you are ready to serve, place the meringue on a serving platter and scoop the sorbet over the top of the meringue. Then put it back into the freezer until ready to serve. When ready to serve, arrange the fruit decoratively. To serve, slice into wedges with a serrated knife. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55704,&quot;Whole-Grain Chocolate-Cherry Bread Twists 2 tablespoons whole-grain bulgur 2 tablespoons quinoa 1 tablespoon flaxseed 3/4 cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees F) 1 teaspoon agave syrup or honey 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 1 1/2 cups white whole-wheat flour (6 ounces), plus more for kneading Kosher salt 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon toasted sunflower seeds 1/4 cup finely chopped dried cherries 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions: Bring 2 cups of water to boil in a small pot. Add the bulgur and quinoa and simmer for 10 minutes. Place the grains in a fine-mesh strainer and run under cold water to stop the cooking. Let the grains drain in the strainer for 15 minutes, then spread out on a thick layer of paper towels to absorb any extra moisture. Meanwhile, coarsely grind the flaxseed in a spice grinder, just to break them open. Stir together the warm water, agave and yeast in a measuring cup or small bowl. Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, about 3-5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Whisk the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl. Add the foamy yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour and mix together with a stiff rubber spatula. When the dough starts to come together, mix in the cooked grains, crushed flaxseeds, sunflower seeds, cherries and chocolate. Form into a uniform ball in the center of the bowl. Be sure to scrape and use any dough stuck to the sides. The dough will be very sticky at this stage. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Sprinkle a generous amount of flour on a clean, dry work surface. Scrape the dough out of the bowl and knead for a couple of minutes, working in just enough flour to make the dough less sticky but still moist to the tough. Flour your hands periodically to prevent sticking. Roll the dough out into a 10-inch square; cut the square in half and then cut each half into 6 crosswise strips about 5 inches long. Brush the strips all over with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle half over the butter. Take the ends of one strip and twist in opposite directions until fully twisted. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining strips, spaced about 1 inch apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest in a warm place until puffed slightly, about 30 minutes.<br> Uncover the strips and bake until the bottoms are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove them from the oven; brush with the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon-sugar. Serve warm or at room temperature. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 day. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chianti]&quot; 55705,&quot;Pork Chops with Baked Apples 2 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 medium turnip, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 red onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 small cooking apples (such as Gala), halved and seeded 1/4 cup apricot preserves 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage 4 bone-in pork loin chops (1/2 inch thick; about 1 1/2 pounds total) 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Toss the parsnips, turnip and onion with the olive oil, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper on a rimmed baking sheet. Arrange the apples on top, cut-side up; brush with 2 tablespoons apricot preserves and season with pepper. Roast until the vegetables and apples soften, 20 minutes. Switch the oven to broil; broil until the vegetables are golden brown, 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the remaining 2 tablespoons preserves, 1/2 cup water, the Worcestershire sauce and sage in a large bowl; season with pepper. Pierce the pork all over with a fork; add to the bowl. Marinate 10 minutes. Remove the pork chops from the marinade (reserve the marinade); arrange on a wire rack set on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Broil until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the marinade to a saucepan and boil over medium-high heat until thickened, 3 minutes. Whisk in the butter. Drizzle over the pork; serve with the vegetables and apples. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 55706,&quot;Quinoa With Shiitakes and Snow Peas 1 cup quinoa, rinsed 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded, caps thinly sliced (about 2 cups) 4 ounces snow peas, thinly sliced on an angle Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce 1 scallion, white and green, sliced Instructions: Place the quinoa and 2 cups water in a small saucepan.

Pour in only enough cold water to cover (about 3 quarts); too much will make the broth taste weak. Toss in the thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns, and allow it to slowly come to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, partially covered, until the chicken is done. As it cooks, skim any impurities that rise to the surface; add a little more water if necessary to keep the chicken covered while simmering. Carefully remove the chicken to a cutting board. When its cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones; hand-shred the meat into a storage container. Carefully strain the stock through a fine sieve into another pot to remove the vegetable solids. Use the stock immediately or if you plan on storing it, place the pot in a sink full of ice water and stir to cool down the stock. Cover and refrigerate for up to one week or freeze. Makes: 2 quarts For the soup: Bring 4 cups of stock to a boil over medium heat in a soup pot. Add the lime leaves, chiles, garlic, ginger and lemongrass. Lower the heat to medium-low; cover the pot and gently simmer to let the spices infuse the broth, about 10 minutes. Uncover the pot and stir in the chicken, coconut milk, mushrooms, fish sauce, sugar and lime juice. Simmer to heat the chicken through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into a soup tureen or individual serving bowls. Garnish with the cilantro.

(If your grill has a thermometer, it should reach about 450 degrees F.) Put the flour and yogurt in a large bowl and mix with a fork until a shaggy dough forms. (The dough may appear dry and crumbly at first, but it will come together as you mix it.) Work the dough in the bowl with your hands into a cohesive ball, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of water if it is too crumbly to come together. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until the dough is smooth and slightly elastic, 7 to 8 minutes, dusting with a little more flour as necessary. Divide the dough in half. Roll each ball on a piece of parchment into a 10- to 11-inch round. Brush the tops of the rounds with olive oil. Slide your hand under each parchment sheet, then invert the dough round onto the grill, peeling away (but not discarding) the parchment.

Add the marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from the heat and add the cereal and dried fruit. Stir until well coated. Line six 2- to 3-cup cereal bowls with plastic wrap. Divide the cereal treat mixture among the bowls (about 1 1/2 cups per bowl) and press down to mold it to the inside of the bowl with a spatula or sprayed hands. Place the bowls into the fridge to chill for about an hour while you make the rest of your toppings. For the maraschino cherry whipped topping: Add the heavy cream and maraschino cherry juice to a large bowl and whip to soft peaks with a hand mixer, about 3 minutes. For the candied cinnamon bacon: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and lightly spray with cooking spray. Add 3 tablespoons of the brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon and a pinch of black pepper to a large resealable bag. Gently toss to mix. Add half of the bacon to the bag. Seal the bag, leaving an air pocket in the bag. Toss the bag until all the bacon is covered. Remove to one of the prepared baking sheets, leaving some space in between each slice. Repeat with the remaining 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, pinch of black pepper and bacon. Bake until the sugar is melted and the bacon is slightly crispy, rotating the pans halfway through, 17 minutes to 22 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. When the bacon cools completely, it will harden a bit. This makes it easier to cut into small pieces. For the cheater caramel sauce: Add the caramel candies and heavy cream to a small saucepan over low heat and stir until they melt together and is the consistency of a thick, pourable sauce. Remove from the heat and stir in the sea salt. To serve: Remove the cereal bowls from the fridge and carefully unmold them, peeling off the plastic wrap. Scoop out vanilla ice cream into each bowl. Have everyone build their own sundaes with the caramel sauce, cherry whipped cream, candied bacon, sprinkles, nuts, and crumbled cookies! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 55725,&quot;Chicken Pie 1/2 teaspoon pepper 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted 3 cups cooked, shredded chicken 2 cups chicken broth One 10-ounce can cream of chicken soup 1 cup self-rising flour 1 cup buttermilk, well shaken Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat and pour in 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add celery and shallots and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, until soft. Stir in rice, making sure to coat all the rice grains with the oil. Add wine and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Ladle in 1 cup of hot stock. Using a wooden spoon, stir gently until most of the stock has been absorbed. Keep adding stock, a cup at a time, and stirring. After about 10 to 15 minutes, test the rice. It should be cooked and creamy but still have a slight bite to it. (You may not need all of the stock.) Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the butter and Parmesan. Gently fold in the pea puree and remaining 1 cup whole peas. Taste for seasoning. Remove from the heat and cover while you sear the scallops. Set a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Pat the scallops with paper towels to make sure they are very dry. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Add scallops to pan, making sure not to overcrowd, and cook until they are nicely browned on both sides, about 4 to 8 minutes depending on the size of your scallops. Check the risotto and add a bit more stock if it has gotten too thick. In a shallow bowl or plate, make a nice mound of risotto and top with 3 or 4 scallops. Garnish with the Spring Green Salad, Parmesan, and olive oil.

Place the pan over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Continue boiling, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes (this cooks out the raw flour taste). Remove the pan from the heat and scrape the frosting base into a shallow bowl. Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface and refrigerate until chilled and thick, at least 2 hours. For the cake: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the cups of two 12-cup muffin pans with cupcake liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and cloves in a bowl until evenly combined. Combine the sugar, butter, vanilla and orange zest in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, until smooth. Alternately, add the flour mixture and the hefeweizen, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, until the batter is smooth. Divide the batter among the muffin cups (about scant 1/4 cup per muffin cup) then bake until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cupcakes comes out clean, about 25 minutes.<br> Let the cupcakes cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack and let cool completely. Remove the frosting base from the refrigerator and let stand for 10 minutes to come to room temperature. Beat the butter for the frosting on medium speed until lightened and creamy, about 3 minutes. Mash the frosting base with the back of a spoon until it is spreadable, then add a third of the frosting base to the butter and beat until evenly incorporated. Add half of the remaining frosting base, beat until smooth, then add the remaining frosting base and the vanilla and beat until the frosting is fluffy and light, about 2 minutes. Frost the cupcakes with a spoon or transfer the frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch-wide fluted tip and pipe mounds onto the top of each cupcake.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are a rich golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl and cool slightly. Add the spinach, cheese and egg to the mushrooms and stir together to combine (it&#39;s nice if there are pockets of cheese in the mixture). Using a 1/4 cup dry measuring cup as a mold, tightly pack some of the mixture into the cup to make a cake. Tap the cake out of the cup on to the prepared pan. Repeat with the remaining mixture to make 8 cakes. Bake until the cheese is golden, about 12 minutes. Serve hot with whole-grain mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chianti]&quot; 55770,&quot;Sourdough Crepes 1/2 cup split urad dhal 1 1/2 cups long grain rice (not basmati) 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda Gingelly oil or vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Place the urad dhal in a large bowl and rinse with many changes of water until the water no longer appears cloudy. Drain. In a large bowl, combine the drained urad dhal with the rice, fenugreek seeds, and 2 1/2 cups water. Soak the ingredients together for 4 hours at room temperature, until the dhal and rice expand and soften. When a grain of rice just breaks under the pressure of your fingernail, the ingredients have soaked long enough. Drain the urad dhal and rice, reserving the liquid. Place roughly half of the solids and half of the liquid in a blender and grind them long enough to get a smooth consistency with some graininess remaining, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Test by rubbing a little batter between your fingers. The largest grains should be the size of granulated sugar. Pour the mixture into a large bowl. Repeat the process with the remaining solids and liquid, and add the mixture to the bowl. Stir in the salt. The mixture should be very thick, so it will be necessary to thin it with approximately 1/4 cup water to get the consistency of pancake batter. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and place in an oven, kept warm to a temperature of 90 degrees for 12 to 15 hours. This can be achieved with the help of a trouble light or floodlight fitted with a 25-watt bulb. Plug the power cord into an outlet close enough to the oven so that the bulb can rest on a rack in the oven. Turn on the light and prop the oven door open about 1 inch with the handle of a wooden spoon. Check the temperature periodically to be sure it stays at 90 degrees. During warm summer months it may not be necessary to use the lightbulb. The batter should nearly double in volume and smell a little sour. Remove the bowl from the oven and stir the contents. The batter will be thick and foamy. If you choose not to fry the crepes immediately, refrigerate the batter at this point. Remove it from refrigerator 1/2 hour before frying. When ready to fry the crepes, check the consistency of the batter: it should pour smoothly like pancake batter. Add the baking soda and a little more water if needed. Heat a nonstick griddle or frying pan over medium low heat (2 pans will speed up the process). Spread about 1/4 teaspoon oil evenly over the griddle. Ladle 1/4 cup of the batter into the center of the hot griddle, and immediately, using the back of the ladle, gently but steadily spread the batter in a circular motion from the center out, creating a thin pancake. If the batter does not spread easily into a thin layer, thin it with a little more water. As the crepe cooks, small holes will form on the surface. Sprinkle a few drops of oil on top, to help make it crisp. When the bottom turns a golden color (about 1 minute) turn it over and fry the other side 30 seconds or until lightly browned. Fold the crepe in half, golden side out, and place it on a platter. Keep the fried crepes warm as you repeat the process, oiling the griddle each time. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55771,&quot;Eggs Poached in Tomato-Olive Sauce 4 cloves garlic 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 4 sprigs fresh thyme 1/4 cup gin or white wine One 28- to 32-ounce can whole tomatoes in juice 1 cup pimento-stuffed olives, sliced 1/4 cup olive brine Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 large eggs 4 slices toasted country bread Instructions: Smash 3 of the cloves of garlic.

Add the yeast and sugar and stir with a fork; let sit 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and it will smell very yeasty-this is what you want!<br> Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the olive oil and the yeast mixture.<br> Using a fork, gradually stir the flour into the yeast mixture until mostly combined, then mix with your hands to bring the dough together. Turn out onto a clean surface.<br> Knead the dough until smooth, dusting with flour as needed. Lightly oil a bowl; add the dough, cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.<br> Prep the toppings: For prosciutto-arugula pizzas, make the cl oil: Bring the chiles and olive oil to a simmer; remove from the heat and let steep 1 hour. (This makes extra oil; store in a sealed container for up to 1 week.)<br> For puttanesca pizzas, make the topping: Mix the tomatoes, olives, capers and red pepper flakes in a bowl; add salt and drizzle with olive oil.<br> Preheat the grill: Preheat a grill to medium high (you don&#39;t want it to be too hot or the crusts will burn before the cheese melts). Brush the grill to remove any crud. Roll out the dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.<br> Use a rolling pin to roll out each ball into an irregular oval, dusting with flour as needed.<br> For cracker-thin crusts, use your hands to gently stretch the dough even more.<br> Stack the dough between layers of plastic wrap and head to the grill (or wrap and refrigerate overnight).<br> Grill the crusts: Oil the grill (Anne uses a rolled-up towel and tongs), then carefully add a few pieces of dough.<br> Grill until the top is bubbly and the bottom is marked, about 2 minutes.<br> Flip with tongs and grill until just marked on the other side. Remove from the grill and transfer to baking sheets; repeat with the remaining dough.<br> Add the toppings: Working on the baking sheets, top the crusts with parmigiano and prosciutto, or top with taleggio and the puttanesca mixture; return to the grill. Crack an egg directly onto each prosciutto pizza, if you want. Cover the grill and cook until the cheese melts and the eggs are set, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> Finish the pizzas: Remove from the grill and top the prosciutto pizzas with arugula; drizzle with the prepared cl oil.

Cut the lobster in half lengthwise; make sure to collect the juices that will run out. Remove the claws and tail pieces and set aside. Remove the head sac and liver and discard them; cut the body into pieces. Alternately, you can have your fishmonger do this. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat and melt 3 tablespoons butter in it. Add the chopped lobster bodies and heads and their juices, the leeks, 1 onion, celery, carrots, 1/2 the thyme, 1/2 the orange zest and the tomato paste. Cook until the shells are red and the vegetables are soft, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour in 1/4 cup cognac. Ignite the cognac with a long kitchen match and let the alcohol burn off. Return to the heat, sprinkle in the flour, stir, and cook for another 2 minutes. Add water to cover and stir up all the browned bits on the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Add the cream and bring to a boil. Immediately decrease the heat and gently simmer until the soup is reduced and thickened, about 30 to 45 minutes. Strain this into a clean pot and season with salt and pepper if needed; keep warm. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add remaining onion, thyme, bay leaf, and orange zest along with the peppercorns and let this mixture cook for about 5 minutes. Add the lobster claws and tails; toss to coat with the fat and flavors. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour in the remaining 1/4 cup cognac. Ignite the cognac with a long kitchen match and let the alcohol burn off.

Instructions: Combine the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix very well with a fork or a whisk. Set a plate by the stove. Heat a small (about 6 inches) seasoned omelet pan or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is warm, add the butter (it should sizzle gently). Swirl the pan to distribute the butter as it melts. When the butter stops sizzling and the foam subsides add the eggs. Pause to let the eggs heat slightly and then stir vigorously, with a heatproof spatula, making sure you include the sides of the egg mixture occasionally so the omelet cooks evenly. Once the eggs are just set, bang the pan gently on the burner to release the omelet from the pan. Check to see that it is not sticking to the sides or bottom of the pan, if so release the omelet with a heat proof spatula. Hold the pan at a 45-degree angle to the stove and carefully fold the omelet like a business letter. Cook just until the desired degree of doneness lifting the pan or reducing the heat to prevent browning. (A classic omelet doesn&#39;t have any browning on it.) Transfer to a warm plate and serve. Omelet Filling Suggestions: There are many omelet fillings, both raw and cooked, sweet and savory. Here is a starting point, but feel free to improvise. Once the eggs are set add any of these ingredients before folding. An alternative method, to use with delicate fillings, like creme fraiche and herbs, fresh fruits or caviar; is it to roll the omelet and then slice the top open, as you would a baked potato, and then fill it.</p><ul><li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh herbs, like Italian parsley, basil, dill, tarragon, chives, thyme, and chervil.

Line the bottoms of both cake pans with parchment paper and butter the sides. Put the cocoa and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar into a bowl with a bit of space to spare, and pour in the boiling water. Whisk to mix, then set aside. Cream the butter and superfine sugar together, beating well until pale and fluffy; I find this easiest with a free-standing mixer, but by hand wouldn&#39;t kill you. While this is going on - or as soon as you stop if you&#39;re mixing by hand - stir the flour, baking powder and baking soda together in another bowl, and set aside for a moment. Dribble in the vanilla extract into the creamed butter and sugar - mixing all the while - and then drop in an egg, quickly followed by a scoopful of the flour mixture, then add the second egg. Keep mixing and incorporate the rest of the dried ingredients for the cake then finally mix and fold in the cocoa mixture, scraping its bowl out well with a spatula. Divide this fabulously chocolatey batter between the two prepared pans and put in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Take the pans out and put them on a wire rack for 5 to 10 minutes, before turning the cakes out to cool. But as soon as the cakes are in the oven, get started on your frosting: put the water, 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar and 1 1/2 sticks butter in a pan over low heat to melt. When this mixture begins to bubble, take the pan off the heat and add the chopped chocolate, swirling the pan so that all the chocolate is hit with heat, then leave for a minute to melt before whisking till smooth and glossy. Let it stand for about 1 hour, whisking now and again - when you&#39;re passing the pan - by which time the cakes will be cooled, and ready for the frosting. Set one of the cooled cakes, with its top side down, on a cake stand or plate, and spread about a third of the frosting, then top with the second cake, regular way up, and spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides, swirling away with your spatula.

Wash under cold water, then drain and pat dry with paper towel. Grate the rind of the lemon onto a small plate and set it aside. Cut the lemon in half and juice it into a medium bowl, using 1 hand to catch any falling seeds. Cut the strawberries into slices and add to the bowl along with 3 tablespoons sugar. Toss until the sugar has dissolved. Do this at least 1 hour (or up to 4 hours) before you serve them so that the berries get nice and juicy. Refrigerate them. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream and remaining sugar with a good-size whisk or an electric mixer until the cream starts to thicken. Add the brandy and lemon zest, and keep beating until the whipped cream holds little soft peaks. You can whip the cream up to 1 hour before you serve the shortcakes. Keep it refrigerated. Just before serving the shortcakes, add the berries and their juice to the bowl of whipped cream. Stir them together gently until the berries are distributed throughout the cream. The whipped cream will get soft and a little runny, which is exactly what you want.

Pound the veal cutlets to an even, approximately 1/8-inch thickness, or have your butcher do this for you. In a dish, sprinkle the cutlets with lemon juice and let stand for 30 minutes. Season both sides with salt. Place the flour on a flat plate, and place the egg/water mixture in a wide, shallow bowl. Add the oil to the egg mixture and beat in with a fork. Spread the bread crumbs on a large plate. Dip the cutlets lightly into the flour, making sure to coat all surfaces, then gently shake off the excess flour. Dip the cutlets into the egg mixture, letting the excess drip away, and then dredge them in the bread crumbs. Let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. Heat your largest, heavy skillets over medium-high heat and add the butter. When the butter is quite hot and the foam starts to subside, add the veal (cook in batches if necessary - but don&#39;t crowd them in the pan). If the butter browns too much after cooking the first batch, you may need to discard it, wipe out the pan, and add more butter for the next batch. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, until golden brown, and turn with a spatula (don&#39;t use a fork or tongs, or the breading may be pierced). When the second side is golden, the schnitzels should be cooked through.

Place the tomato and jalapeno and cook, turning frequently, until the skin of the tomato and cl is blackened and blistered all over, about 15 minutes. Remove the tomato into a bowl to hold the juices. Place the cl in a small plastic or paper bag; let rest 10 minutes. When they are cool enough to handle, peel off the charred skin. If some tiny blackened bits remain, they will just add to the flavor. Be sure to save all the delicious juices. Place tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro and jalapeno cl in the blender or food processor and process until almost smooth, about 1 minute. Reserve. Place the oil in a small Dutch oven or medium saucepan; heat over medium-high heat until rippling. Add the pasta and cook, stirring constantly, until golden. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add pureed tomato mixture and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low; add chicken stock and bring to a simmer.

Add the zucchini and remaining teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until parts of the zucchini turn deep brown while some parts remain al dente, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes less than package directions, about 8 minutes. Add 1/3 cup pasta water to the skillet with the zucchini and stir to deglaze. Use a pair of tongs to remove the pasta directly to the skillet. Sprinkle the bare pasta with the Parmesan and toss well to coat the pasta with the zucchini sauce. (Some of the zucchini should have gotten rather soft, which helps to create a silky sauce.) Add another 1/2 cup pasta water if needed to maintain the sauce. Top the pasta with the herbs and feta and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 55834,&quot;Blackberry-White Chocolate Fool with Toasted Hazelnuts 4 cups fresh blackberries 1/4 cup sugar, plus 3 tablespoons 1/4 cup cassis 1 1/2 cups very cold heavy cream 3 ounces white chocolate, melted 1/4 cup hazelnuts, toasted and chopped Mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: Place berries in a large bowl.

Place a folded clean kitchen towel or canning rack in the bottom of a stockpot (this keeps the jars from rattling); fill about halfway with water. Add the jars, making sure they&#39;re submerged. Bring to a boil and boil 10 minutes; remove with a jar lifter and place on a clean towel. Turn off the heat; reserve the pot of water. Put the lids and bands in a saucepan of simmering water until ready to use (do not boil). Cook the tomatoes: Bring another stockpot of water to a boil. Add the onion, celery and garlic and cook until just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes (in batches, if necessary) and cook until they split and rise to the top, about 5 minutes. Strain the vegetables; discard the celery stalks but keep the leaves for flavor. Puree the tomatoes: Set a food mill over a large bowl. Working in batches, puree the tomatoes and vegetables through the mill, scraping the bottom occasionally with a fork. Stir in 2 tablespoons salt, then the citric acid-this ensures a safe acidity level for canning. Fill the jars: Remove the lids and bands from the hot water with tongs and place on a clean towel to dry. Put 3 basil leaves in each sterilized jar (make sure your hands are clean). Use a ladle or funnel to fill the jars with the tomato puree to about 1/2 inch from the top. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel, then screw on the lids (do not overtighten). Process the jars: Bring the stockpot of water to a simmer (keep the towel in the pot). Lower the filled jars into the pot, bring to a boil and process 45 minutes. Use the jar lifter to remove the jars and transfer to a towel; let sit overnight. Don&#39;t overfill the jars-you need to leave some space. Check the seals: Press the tops of the jars: The lidsshould not pop up and down. Store in a cool dark place for up to 1 year.

Heat an outdoor grill over high heat. Kill a lobster by splitting the head in half with a large chef&#39;s knife. Then split the lobster in half down the middle. Repeat with the other lobster. Snap the claws off from both lobsters and boil for 5 minutes. Remove and submerge in ice water to stop the cooking. Careful to keep whole, crack the claws and remove from the shell. Use half of the sunflower oil to brush the meat of each lobster tail half, sprinkle with salt and pepper and grill, flesh-side down, moving as needed, until well-marked and the meat is firm and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Let rest for a minute, pull the meat from the shell so its loose and easy to eat out of the shell, squeeze with lemon juice and keep warm. Meanwhile, brush the claws with the remaining oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill, until just marked and warmed through, about 1 minute per side. Keep warm. For the steak and warm mushroom salad: Coat a medium cast-iron skillet with sunflower oil and heat over medium-high. Sprinkle the filet mignons generously with salt and pepper. Sear the steaks until nicely browned, about 3 minutes. Turn the steaks over and add the butter and thyme. Baste the steaks with the butter (to infuse flavor into the steak) and cook until medium-rare, about 3 minutes more. Remove the steak from skillet and allow to rest. Turn the heat down to medium. Add the zucchini, cauliflower and mushrooms and cook, stirring gently, until just about tender, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and spinach and stir gently until the spinach is just wilted.

In a large bowl, cream the butter and granulated sugar. Blend until the grains of sugar are no longer visible. Beat in the vanilla. Then add the eggs and flour alternately. Grease and flour 2 loaf pans or a 9- by 9-inch cake pan. Pour the batter into the pan(s) and bake for 1 hour. Then remove and let cool on a wire rack. For the syllabub: In a large bowl, combine the heavy cream and granulated sugar. Whip with a whisk or hand mixer until the cream is whipped and fluffy. Slowly fold in the sherry, brandy, vanilla extract and lemon zest. Place the bowl in the refrigerator to set up. For the berries: In a large bowl, combine the berries and wine. Add the granulated sugar and mix. Cover and let sit to bring to room temperature. (You can put it in the refrigerator, I just happen to like the berries at room temp. Whatever floats your boat.) To serve: Preheat a grill, grill pan or broiler. Cut the pound cake into 1/2-inch thick slices. Stir the brown sugar into the warm melted butter. Brush both sides of the pound cake slices with the melted butter and brown sugar. Place the slices on the hot grill or under the broiler. If using a grill, get grill marks on both sides. If using a broiler, get some golden brown color on both sides. Cut the pound cake slices on a diagonal or in strips, and arrange in a creative way in the center of a dessert plate. Try and get some height. With a slotted spoon, ladle a good scoop of berries over the pound cake.

Add the garlic, shallot, ginger, and chiles; saute for a few minutes to release the flavor. Remove from heat to cool slightly. In a mixing bowl, combine the salmon, bread crumbs, cilantro, mayonnaise, lemon juice and egg white. Scrape the garlic/ginger oil into the salmon mixture; season with salt and pepper. Fold the ingredients together gently but thoroughly, taking care not to mash the salmon too much. Using your hands, form the mixture into 4 salmon cakes, they should be moist and just hold together. Coat a non-stick skillet with the 2 tablespoons of peanut oil and bring it to a slight smoke over medium heat. Fry the salmon cakes until brown, about 4 minutes on each side, turning carefully with a spatula. Keep warm on a plate lined with paper towels. To make the bok choy: Return the skillet to the heat and coat with the 2 tablespoons of peanut oil and heat until almost smoking. Split the piece of ginger open with a knife then whack it with the flat side of the knife. Lay the ginger pieces in the oil, cut-side down to let it start to perfume. Pan-fry the bok choy, cut-side down, for a couple of minutes to give it some color. Add the water and cook another minute to steam the bok choy; carefully remove it to a plate. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, lemon juice, and brown sugar. Cook and stir for 3 minutes until the sauce is the consistency of syrup. Serve the salmon cakes with the bok choy, and drizzle the brown sauce over the whole thing.

Spread a layer of kosher salt on a baking sheet and arrange the potatoes on top (see Cook&#39;s Note). Bake until a bit overcooked, about 45 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle, cut in half, and scoop out the flesh. Reserve the potato skins, if desired, for another use. Pass the potatoes through a potato ricer or grate them on the large holes of a box grater. You should have about 2 cups. Make a mound of potatoes on the counter with a well in the middle, add 3 of the egg yolks, the cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix in the potatoes and mix well with hands. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the flour over the potatoes and, using your knuckles, press it into the potatoes. Fold the mass over on itself and press down again. Sprinkle on more flour, little by little, folding and pressing the dough until it just holds together, (try not to knead it.) Work any dough clinging to your fingers back into the dough. If the mixture is too dry, add another egg yolk or a little water. The dough should give under slight pressure. It will feel firm but yielding. To test if the dough is the correct consistency, take a piece and roll it with your hands on a well-floured board into a rope 1/2-inch in diameter. If the dough holds together, it is ready. If not, add more flour, fold and press the dough several more times, and test again. Keeping your work surface and the dough lightly floured, cut the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 1/2-inch in diameter. Cut into 1/2-inch-long pieces. Lightly flour the gnocchi as you cut them. You can cook these as is or form them into the classic gnocchi shape with a gnocchi board, ridged butter paddle, or the tines of a large fork turned upside down. Rest the bottom edge of the gnocchi board on the work surface, then tilt it at about a 45 degree angle. Take each piece and squish it lightly with your thumb against the board while simultaneously pushing it away from you. It will roll away and around your thumb, taking on a cupped shape -- with ridges on the outer curve from the board and a smooth surface on the inner curve where your thumb was. (Shaping them takes some time and dexterity. You might make a batch just for practice.) The indentation holds the sauce and helps gnocchi cook faster. As you shape the gnocchi, dust them lightly with flour and scatter them on baking sheets lined with parchment paper or waxed paper. Set gnocchi filled cookie sheet in front of a fan on low for 1/2 hour (turning gnocchi after 15 minutes). If you will not cook the gnocchi until the next day or later, freeze them. Alternatively, you can poach them now, drain and toss with a little olive oil, let cool, then refrigerate several hours or overnight. To reheat, dip in hot water for 10 to 15 seconds, then toss with browned butter until hot. When ready to cook, bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Drop in the gnocchi and cook for about 90 seconds from the time they rise to the surface. Remove the cooked gnocchi with a skimmer, shake off the excess water, and serve as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 55894,&quot;Pan Roasted Double Veal Rib with Bouquet of Vegetables 1 baby artichoke, trimmed 10 pearl onions, peeled 1/4 cup shelled fava beans 1/4 cup shelled English peas 6 to 8 asparagus spears, cut into 2-inch lengths 1/4 cup small diced carrots, zucchini, and yellow squash 3 to 4 fingerling potatoes, scrubbed Salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil 1 (20-ounce) double cut veal rib chop, trimmed to 1 bone 1/4 pound mushrooms, quartered 6 to 8 cloves roasted garlic 2 sprigs fresh thyme 2 sprigs fresh sage 2 ounces Madeira 1/2 cup veal stock (or canned chicken broth) 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Remember to just blanch them until tender. Place scrubbed fingerling potatoes on baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with a teaspoon of olive oil. Place in oven and roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. The potatoes should still be quite firm. Cut them into 1/2-inch dice and set aside. Roast the Veal: Place a 12-inch, ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Season the veal chop on both sides with salt and pepper. Add olive oil to the pan and heat. Place the veal in the pan and cook over medium heat for 4 minutes. Turn the chop over and continue cooking on the other side for 4 more minutes. The meat should be well browned. Add mushrooms, artichokes, potatoes, roasted garlic, and pearl onions to the pan. Place the thyme and sage sprigs on top of the veal and place in the preheated oven. Roast the veal and vegetables for 12 minutes. Using a kitchen towel or oven mitt, remove the pan from the oven. Remove the veal from the pan and place it on a cutting board. Allow the veal to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Prepare the Sauce: Place the pan with the vegetables over high heat and saute the vegetables that were cooked with the veal for 1 minute.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with 2 teaspoons of the olive oil. Add the sweet potato cubes to a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Pulse until coarsely ground, similar to the texture of coarse salt. Add the ground sweet potato, almond flour, Parmesan, salt, garlic powder and egg to a bowl and stir until combined. Transfer the sweet potato mixture to the prepared baking sheet and form into a 12-inch circle about 1/4 inch thick. Brush with remaining tablespoon olive oil. Bake until browned around the edges, 25 to 30 minutes. For the toppings: Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare an ice water bath. Blanch the broccoli rabe in the boiling water, then transfer to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside. Set a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon into crumbles, until browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a plate with a slotted spoon. Remove the crust from the oven and top with the pizza sauce, broccoli rabe, sausage, goat cheese and pepper flakes. Place back in the oven and cook until the toppings are warmed through and cheese is melted, another 8 to 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 55922,&quot;Laurel Chenel Goat Cheese Mac n&#39; Cheese 9 large artichokes 3 Meyer lemons 2 1/2 cups white wine 2 1/2 cups water 1 cup pure olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons* 3 garlic cloves, peeled 1 teaspoon coriander seed 2 bay leaves 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns 2 teaspoons sliced green garlic 3 cups heavy cream 6 ounces pennette 9 ounces goat cheese 1 teaspoon chopped fresh lemon thyme 1 pinch lavender 1 pinch ground pink peppercorns Kosher salt Ground black pepper 3/4 cup water, as needed 1 loaf rustic bread 3 tablespoons pure olive oil 3 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley leaves 3 lemons, zested (from artichoke recipe) 3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan Kosher salt Ground black pepper 2 bunches arugula, cleaned Olive oil, as needed 1/2 Meyer lemon Kosher salt Ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Trim the artichokes. Using a serrated knife, cut off the top inch of each artichoke and cut off the stem to create a flat surface for the artichoke to sit on the plate. Place in a Dutch oven. Zest the Meyer lemons and set aside for the topping. Cut 2 of the lemons in half and squeeze the juice over the artichokes and place the juiced lemons in the baking dish. Add the white wine, water, 1 cup of the oil, garlic cloves, coriander, bay leaves and peppercorns. On a burner on high heat, bring the liquid to a boil. Cover and cook in the oven until tender (leaves are removed easily), about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool and when cool enough to handle, carefully remove the center choke (heart) and smaller leaves from 6 of the artichokes, using a spoon. Then remove and discard all the leaves in the remaining 3 artichokes. Puree the remaining 3 artichokes in a food processor or blender. In a small saute pan on high heat, saute the green garlic in 2 tablespoons of the oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the 6 artichoke hearts and saute another few minutes.. Juice 1/2 a lemon and season the artichoke hearts with the lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Spoon a little of the puree mixture into each of the 6 intact artichokes. In a medium nonreactive saucepan on medium-high heat, bring the cream to a simmer. Once it is simmering, add the pasta and stir often until pasta is just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Stir in the goat cheese, thyme, lavender, and pink peppercorns. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Adjust to desired consistency by adding water. Spoon pasta into each of the 6 artichokes on top of the artichoke puree. Remove the crust from the rustic loaf and place the insides in a food processor. Pulse until you get fine crumbs. Saute 2 cups of the crumbs with 3 tablespoons olive oil on medium-high heat until golden and crunchy. Let cool. Once cool, toss the bread crumbs with parsley, reserved zest and Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Generously sprinkle on top of the filled artichokes. Place the artichokes in an oven-proof dish with a little water in the bottom and place in oven until bubbly and hot through, about 10 minutes. Toss the arugula in a sprinkle of olive oil and the juice of the remaining 1/2 of a lemon. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. To plate, make an arugula nest for the artichoke on each plate. Place a warmed artichoke in the center. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 55923,&quot;Spanakopita Hand Pies 2 small Yukon gold potatoes (about 8 ounces) Kosher salt 1 bunch spinach (about 12 ounces), tough stems removed 1 bunch Swiss chard (about 1 pound), stems and leaves separated, stems chopped 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 1 small onion, chopped Pinch of red pepper flakes Freshly ground pepper 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup grated kefalotyri cheese (about 4 ounces) 1 cup crumbled feta cheese (about 4 ounces) 1 cup fresh mint, finely chopped 1/2 cup fresh dill, finely chopped 1 large egg 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 8 sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed 1/4 cup breadcrumbs Instructions: Pierce the potatoes a few times with a fork. Microwave until softened but not completely cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool slightly, then peel and finely chop; transfer to a medium bowl and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spinach and Swiss chard leaves and cook until wilted, about 3 minutes. Drain, then let cool in the colander, tossing occasionally and lightly pressing with a rubber spatula to remove the excess liquid. When cool enough to handle, transfer the greens to a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Coarsely chop and add to the bowl with the potatoes. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the Swiss chard stems, onion, red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and the spinach-chard mixture; cook, stirring, until well incorporated, 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool to room temperature. Add the cheeses, mint, dill, egg and lemon zest; stir to combine. (You can make the filling 1 day ahead; cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble.) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F; line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay out 1 sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a long side facing you (keep the remaining sheets covered with a damp towel). Lightly brush with olive oil and lightly sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Fold in half like a book and brush with more olive oil and sprinkle with more breadcrumbs, then fold the top half down. Place 1/2 cup filling in the center and brush the edges with a little water. Bring the top two corners together over the filling and pinch the edges together to seal. Repeat with the bottom two corners; pinch closed. Pinch the two remaining edges closed. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and brush with olive oil. Repeat to make 8 hand pies. Transfer the hand pies to the oven and bake until golden brown and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes.

Melt 8 tablespoons butter in a 9-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until soft but not browned. Stir in the tarragon and parsley. If using raw shrimp or scallops, add them with the herbs and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. If using cooked lobster or crabmeat, remove the pan from the heat as soon as you stir in the herbs, let cool, and then add the lobster or crabmeat. Season with salt and pepper. With a cleaver of chef&#39;s knife, split the lobsters in half lengthwise. Remove and discard the head sac and intestine. Remove the tomalley and the roe if present and place in a small bowl. Break into small pieces using a fork. With the back side of a knife, crack the center of each claw on 1 side only. Season the lobsters lightly with salt and pepper. On a large roasting pan or baking sheet, place the halves together to resemble a butterfly. The tomalley and roe are optional for the stuffing. If you want to include them, mix them into the seafood mixture. Gently fold the crumbled crackers into the mixture. Divide the mixture evenly between 2 lobsters. If you are serving 1 lobster per person, spread the stuffing over the center so that the lobsters look whole again. Do not pack the stuffing tightly, or it will affect the even baking of the lobster. Brush the 3 tablespoons melted butter over the exposed meat tail, stuffing and claws. Bake until the lobster is cooked through and the stuffing is crisp and golden. Bake 17 minutes for a 1 1/2 pound lobster and 24 minutes for a 2-pound lobster. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 55926,&quot;Apple Parmesan Pie 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 14 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed and chilled<br> 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br> 1/2 cup ice water<br> 2 pounds apples, such as Granny Smith, peeled, cored and cut into 1/3-inch wedges 1/4 cup sugar<br> 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 large egg, beaten<br> 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br> Instructions: Chill the bowl and blade of a food processor for 1 hour before starting. For the dough: To the food processor, add the flour and salt and pulse to combine. Add the cold butter and the cheese and pulse 3 or 4 times or until chickpea-sized pieces of butter remain. With the machine running, drizzle in the ice water until the dough just starts to come together. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and form into a flat disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for at least an hour and up to 2 days. Position an oven rack on the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the apples, sugar, lemon juice, flour, salt and cinnamon. Toss well to coat evenly. Divide the dough in half. Roll out one of the dough pieces to an approximately 11-inch round and line the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate. Fill the pie crust with the apple mixture. Roll out the remaining dough into another 11-inch round and place on top. Trim the edges so there is a 1/2-inch overhang around the plate. Tuck the overhang under itself and press down to seal the edge. Using 2 knuckles and the tip of your finger, crimp the edges to make a decorative edge. Cut an X in the center of the top pie crust and open the corners to make a small hole in the center of the pie. Brush the pie evenly with the egg and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the crust is deep golden brown and the mixture inside is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and cool for at least 2 hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 55927,&quot;Salted Caramel Brownies 4 ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate<br> 1 cup sugar<br> 2 eggs<br> 1/2 cup flour<br> 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder<br> Pinch salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br> 2/3 cup sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons flaky sea salt<br> Ice cream, for serving<br> Instructions: For the brownies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment. Melt the butter and chocolate together in a shallow heatproof bowl set over a saucepan with 1 or 2 inches of simmering water. Stir until completely melted and smooth. Transfer the melted chocolate mixture to a medium bowl and stir in the sugar. Let cool, then whisk in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the flour, espresso powder, salt and vanilla, and pour into the prepared baking pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely. For the caramel: While the brownies are baking, heat the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, swirling the pan but not stirring; cook until the mixture turns a golden amber color. Remove from the heat and immediately add the butter, swirling to combine; take great care to keep the pan at a distance when adding the butter, as the caramel will bubble up and foam. When the bubbling has subsided and the butter and caramel are combined, add the cream and vanilla and stir to incorporate. Set aside to cool. Lift the cooled brownies out of the pan, cut into squares and place on a serving platter. Drizzle with the caramel and sprinkle with the sea salt. Serve with ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 55928,&quot;Ahi Tuna Pot Stickers 1-pound ahi tuna, sushi grade 1-ounce fresh ginger 1 bunch green onion 3 large eggs, whites only 2 ounces sherry 2 ounces soy sauce 20 round wonton wrappers (see Cook&#39;s Note) Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: For the filling: Place the tuna on a cutting board. Remove the skin, if any, and dice the fish into 1/4-inch cubes and place in a large bowl. Mince the ginger and green onions and add to the tuna. Blend in the egg whites sherry and the soy sauce. Toss, and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. To assemble: Keep a cup of water, your filling, and your wrappers handy. Lay a few wrappers out flat on a countertop. Place about 1-ounce of filling into the center of a wrapper using a tablespoon. Dip your finger in the water (or use a wet brush) and run your wet finger (or wet brush) along 2 connected edges of the wrapper. (Say, for example, the left side and the bottom.) The area you are creating here is a moist strip along the half of the perimeter where water is applied. Fold the wrapper over on the diagonal. The 2 moist sides will bond to their dry counterparts to make a nice little triangular pocket. Remember that the water acts like a glue. Thus, if wet edges are folded to the dry edges, all is well; otherwise, your pot stickers will come open. (If you get pulled away in the process of assembling, cover the wrappers with a kitchen towel to keep them moist until you get back.) To give the folded-over wrappers that traditional pot sticker look, pick up the wrapper and fold over the sides that have been joined with water in a pleating action. Make 3 or 4 pleats. Put the assembled wrappers on a parchment-lined pan, but make sure that they do not touch each other. If they are left touching, they will stick together, which is bad news because, when you go to separate them, you will have pot stickers with holes. However, this is less of a problem if you use traditional pot sticker wrappers, as they are thicker. When all of the pot stickers are assembled in wrappers, you can cook them immediately at this point or you can freeze them for future cooking. We freeze them by the hundreds at the Diner, placing them in airtight containers more suited for freezer storage. For the potstickers: Heat a griddle, wok, or pan over medium-high heat. When hot, cover the bottom with nonstick spray. Put the potstickers in the pan and cover with a tight-fitting lid (or, if you are working on a griddle, use a pan to cover the pot stickers). Lift the lid, toss in about a quarter of a cup of water, and quickly close the lid. Let the potstickers steam for about 4 minutes. If you really need to satisfy your curiosity and take a peek, just be sure to add more water. The end result should be that the pot stickers have a crispy golden brown bottom and a soft pasta top. We serve them at the Diner on a bed of garlic-sauteed spinach with a soy dipping sauce. (Chopsticks are provided.) I also recommend them with any good commercial spicy chili oil. To make the soy dipping sauce, mix equal parts soy and rice wine vinegar.

Butter a 9-by-13-inch cake pan. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. Combine the butter and brown sugar together in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the red wine, beginning and ending with the flour, mixing until just incorporated. Spoon the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with an offset spatula. Bake until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool completely on a rack. For the buttercream: Place the butter in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar in 3 batches, beating until each batch is incorporated. After adding the last batch, continue to beat until very smooth and lightened, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and 1 tablespoon of the half-and-half and beat until incorporated. Add more half-and-half as needed to make the icing a smooth, spreadable consistency. Keep at room temperature until ready to use. Spoon the buttercream onto the cake and smooth with an offset spatula.

For the caramel, heat 1 1/2 cups of the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan until the sugar dissolves. Cook over medium heat until the syrup turns a warm caramel color. Don&#39;t stir, just swirl it in the pan. Off the heat, add 1/2 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla; be careful, the syrup will bubble violently. Stir and cook over high heat until the caramel reaches 230 degrees F (thread stage) on a candy thermometer. Set aside. For the praline, combine the almonds with 1/4 cup of the caramel and spread them on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the almonds are lightly browned. Allow to cool at room temperature and then break up in pieces. Lower the oven to 250 degrees F. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. For the meringues, beat the egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed until frothy. Turn the mixer on high speed and add the remaining 1 cup of sugar. Beat until the egg whites are very stiff and glossy. Whisk in the remaining teaspoon of vanilla. With dessert spoons place 12 mounds of meringue on the parchment paper and bake for 20 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. For serving, pour creme anglaise on the bottom of individual plates. Place a meringue on top of each serving, drizzle with caramel sauce, sprinkle with praline, and serve. To make a day or two ahead, leave the caramel and praline at room temperature and refrigerate the creme anglaise. Bake the meringues before guests arrive and assemble the desserts just before serving. Beat the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed for 3 minutes, or until very thick. Reduce to low speed, and add the cornstarch. With the mixer still on low, slowly pour the hot milk into the eggs. Pour the custard mixture into a saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thickened. The custard will coat the spoon like heavy cream. Don&#39;t cook it above 180 degrees F or the eggs will scramble! Pour the sauce through a fine strainer, add the vanilla extract, Cognac, and vanilla seeds, if using, and chill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 55933,&quot;Raspberry-White Chocolate Cheesecake Cookie Bars 1 cup (2 sticks/225 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup (110 g) brown sugar 1 1/2 cups (300 g) granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 1/2 cups (315 g) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 1/4 cups (205 g) white chocolate chips 1 cup (125 g) fresh raspberries 8 ounces (225 g) cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: To make the cookie layer: In a stand mixer, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar for 3 minutes, until smooth.

If using a charcoal grill, build the coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only. Allow the temperature to reach 300 degrees F. For the potatoes: Lay out 2 pieces of parchment paper on top of 2 pieces of heavy-duty aluminum foil, making an X. Add the potatoes to the center along with the rosemary, garlic and olive oil. Season with sea salt and pepper, then bring up all 4 edges of the foil. Pour in the white wine and seal the foil and parchment, making a packet. Place the potato packet onto the indirect heat side of the grill. Close the lid and cook until the potatoes are cooked through and tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the grill when ready and set aside. They will keep warm in the packet. For the steak: Mix together the kosher salt, pepper and chopped rosemary. Season the steaks liberally with the seasoning mix, patting down to ensure the seasoning really sticks. Place the steaks on the indirect side of the grill, close the lid, and cook until the internal temperature reaches 110 to 120 degrees F, or rare, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the steaks from the grill, then carefully remove the grill grate and set aside. Brush the steaks with olive oil and place directly onto the coals. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until the desired temperature. Remove the steaks to a cutting board to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.

Refrigerate until ready to serve. (Makes about 1 cup.) For the fish: Put the corn cereal flakes in a large resealable plastic bag. Crush with your hands or a rolling pin to make medium size crumbs (the mixture should be a little finer than oatmeal). Pour into a shallow bowl and stir in the paprika. Spread the flour in a second bowl and beat the eggs in a third bowl with 1 teaspoon of salt. Season the fish all over with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. Dredge in the flour, then the eggs, then roll in the cereal crumbs, patting them on to coat evenly. Heat about 1/2 inch of neutral oil in a large skillet (cast iron or otherwise) over medium heat. The oil is ready when a cereal crumb sizzles on contact. Standing a safe distance away from the stovetop, slide the breaded fish into the oil and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and cook the second side until golden, 2 to 3 minutes more. Drain on paper towels and season with salt. Serve hot with the tartar sauce and lemon wedges. The fish is best eaten right away but leftover tartar sauce will keep, covered, in the fridge for 2 to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 55947,&quot;Other Worldly Sticky Buns 2 tablespoons dry yeast 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 to 115 degrees F), divided 1 cup granulated sugar, plus a pinch 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup dry nonfat milk powder 1 teaspoons fine sea salt 2 large eggs 5 1/4 to 5 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for pan, plus 1/2 stick, melted 3 tablespoons honey, local preferred 1/3 cup dark corn syrup 1 cup packed brown sugar 1 1/2 cups pecans 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon granulated sugar Confectioners&#39; sugar Water Instructions: For the dough: Add the yeast into 1/2 cup of the warm water (think bathtub temperature) and give it a nice stir. It needs to foam up. If it doesn&#39;t, it means it&#39;s not active, it&#39;s dead and your bread won&#39;t rise. Add a pinch of sugar to help the yeast grow. Let sit 5 minutes or so. Add the butter to your mixer, turn on to begin creaming and add the 1 cup sugar. When it&#39;s light and fluffy, add the milk powder and salt. Add your eggs, incorporating 1 before adding the other. Turn off and scrape down the bowl, making sure to get any batter off the bottom and that there are no lumps. Add the remaining 1 cup warm water and then the yeast. Add the flour in stages, it should start to look like dough. Beat for 5 to 10 minutes. Turn off the mixer. Flour a work surface so the dough doesn&#39;t stick. Dump out the dough, adding more flour if sticky. Begin kneading by folding the dough in on itself, and keep pushing it out. Keep kneading until it&#39;s lump-free and no longer sticky. Put in a nicely greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Put in a warm place until it doubles, 2 1/2 hours or so. While the dough is growing, make your glaze: Put your butter in a bowl. (Having the butter at room temperature means that the sugar will incorporate better and make easier to stir.) Add your honey, dark corn syrup and brown sugar. Give it a good stir and add 1/4 cup water. The butter might separate, and that&#39;s fine. It won&#39;t look pretty, but it will taste good when done baking! Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a deep pie plate with fluted edges. Pour the glaze in the bottom of your dish, sprinkle the pecans over top and set aside while you roll out the dough. Flour your work surface. Punch the dough down to deflate it and then cut in half. Put the first piece on the floured surface, adding more flour if it&#39;s still sticky. Flour your rolling pin as well and roll the dough out into a square about 10 inches. Combine your cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl, brush with half the melted butter and sprinkle with half the cinnamon sugar. Take the long side and fold and roll it up in on itself. Cut the dough in half, then divide the halves into thirds, ending up with 6 pieces. Stick them right onto the glaze and nuts in your pan. Repeat with the second piece of dough. Cover with plastic and let rise about 1 hour or so in a warm space. Bake until the buns are a nice golden brown, about 30 minutes. Mix together the confectioners&#39; sugar and water to desired consistency. Invert your cake stand or a plate on top of the buns, then flip the pan over. Tap the bottom of the pan to loosen the buns and lift the pan away.

Brown the beef with the optional onion, optional garlic, herbs, and salt and pepper in a large, ovenproof skillet (I use one that&#39;s made of castiron). When the meat is thoroughly cooked -- it will take 8 to 10 minutes -- drain off any fat and take everything out of the pan. Now put the still-frozen ravioli into the pan, breaking them up if they are clumped. Spread the ground beef mixture evenly over the ravioli, and ladle the spaghetti sauce evenly over the ground beef mixture. Over medium heat, without stirring, cook until the ravioli is heated through and beginning to brown on the bottom -- about 10 minutes. Take the skillet off the heat, lay the provolone slices over the ground beef mixture, and sprinkle the whole thing with the Parmesan. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.

Place the turkey legs skin-side up in the baking dish and cover with foil. Roast the turkey legs on the bottom oven rack until just tender when pierced with a sharp knife, about 2 hours. Uncover the legs and continue to roast until the skin is golden and the legs are completely tender, 1 to 1 1/2 more hours.<br> Meanwhile, for the turkey breast: Set a rack in a large roasting pan. Place the turkey breast breast-side up on the rack; let sit at room temperature 30 minutes.

If it does, remove some of the water.\\u202fRemove the steamer basket and bring the water to a simmer.<br> Meanwhile, line the steamer basket with two layers of damp cheesecloth. Place the soaked rice in the basket, spread it in an even layer and poke a few holes halfway through the rice to help it cook evenly. When the water is simmering, put the basket in the skillet, cover and steam until the rice is just past the al dente stage, about 50 minutes (see Cook\\u2019s Note).<br> Meanwhile, soak the goji berries with enough cold water to cover in a small bowl until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.<br> Lightly spray a 24-ounce heatproof ceramic or metal bowl with nonstick cooking spray, then cover the entire bowl with a piece of damp cheesecloth, letting the ends fall over the sides of the bowl. Lightly spray the cheesecloth with nonstick cooking spray. Set the prepared bowl aside.<br> When the rice has finished steaming, transfer it to a large bowl and discard the cheesecloth. (Keep the skillet and steamer for a later step.) Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar, the butter and 3 tablespoons water to the rice and stir until the sugar has dissolved and the butter is equally distributed. Keep the rice covered to prevent it from drying out as you proceed with the recipe.<br> Fill a small bowl with water and dip your fingers in it, as needed, when working with the rice to keep it from sticking to your skin. Place the soaked lotus seed in the center of the prepared cheesecloth-lined bowl.

Stir in the hazelnuts and freeze until firm, 15 to 20 minutes. For the pistachio marzipan: Blend the pistachios in a food processor until they&#39;re finely ground (but don&#39;t overblend or you&#39;ll end up with pistachio butter). Add the powdered sugar, almond extract and salt and pulse to combine. With the motor running, drizzle in the corn syrup and blend to form a dough. (It may still look crumbly in the food processor, but if you squeeze it in your hand it should stick together.) Pile it into a ball and wrap it in plastic. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, or up to overnight. For the almond marzipan: Combine the almond meal, powdered sugar, almond extract and salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. With the motor running, drizzle in the corn syrup and blend to form a dough. (It may still look crumbly in the food processor, but if you squeeze it in your hand it should stick together.) Pile it into a ball and wrap it in plastic. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, or up to overnight. To assemble, divide both the almond marzipan and the pistachio marzipan into 12 equal portions. Keep the marzipan covered with plastic wrap when you&#39;re not working with it. Take one of the pistachio marzipan portions and smash it with your palm to make a flat round. Fold it over a rounded 1/4 teaspoon hazelnut filling and roll it into a ball. Smash one of the almond marzipan portions with your palm and fold that over the pistachio ball. Roll it into a ball and place it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining marzipan and filling and freeze the balls for 15 minutes. For the coating: Melt the dark chocolate either in a double boiler or microwave, heating in 30-second increments and stirring after each, until it is smooth and melted. Continue stirring until it is no longer hot to the touch. One by one, dip the marzipan balls in the chocolate to fully coat. Allow the excess chocolate to drip off, and then place back on the parchment. Sprinkle with some sanding sugar.

Stir in 3 cups flour and the salt, stirring until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups flour; continue adding flour 1 tablespoon at a time (up to 1/2 cup), stirring until the dough comes away from the bowl but is still sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead with lightly floured hands. Start by slapping the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself (use a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape the dough from the surface). Repeat until it&#39;s easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading normally until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with plastic and let rise in a warm place until it doubles in volume, about 3 hours. Press it with your finger to see if it&#39;s done; an indent should remain.

Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake until the cake bounces back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool completely in the cake pans on a rack. For the frosting: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a heatproof stand mixer&#39;s bowl above the water. Add the sugar, lemon juice, salt and egg whites to the mixer bowl and whisk together by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar completely dissolves. Transfer to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until cool and the whites hold stiff peaks, 10 to 15 minutes. Toss in a couple of chunks of butter at a time, making sure the pieces are incorporated before adding more. After all the butter is added, continue beating on medium-high speed. The mixture will deflate and appear curdled. Continue beating until the frosting comes back together to a smooth and spreadable consistency. (If the frosting is very soft or begins to break, refrigerate until set but still spreadable, then beat until light before using.) For the filling and decoration: Dye the coconut: Have ready 5 resealable plastic bags or plastic containers. Put 1 1/2 cups of the coconut in one container with 6 to 8 drops of blue food coloring. Put 1 cup of coconut in the second container with 5 to 6 drops of orange food coloring, 1 cup of coconut in the third with 5 to 6 drops yellow food coloring and 1 cup of coconut in the fourth with 6 to 8 drops purple food coloring. Put the remaining 1/2 cup coconut in the fifth container with 4 to 5 drops pink food coloring. Seal each container and shake vigorously until the coconut is evenly dyed. Add more food coloring 1 drop at a time as needed to get bright, vibrant colors. Assemble the cake: Cut a 4-inch circle out of the center of each cake (reserve the small cut-out cake rounds). Put one of the cake rings on a cake stand or serving platter and frost with about 1 cup of frosting. Put the other cake ring on top and push down slightly. Fill the hole with candy. Cut one of the reserved cake rounds in half horizontally to make 2 thinner rounds. Use one to fill the hole on top of the cake. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Cut a strip of parchment about 30 inches long and 3 inches wide. Wrap this parchment around the cake like a collar, leaving 1 inch of frosting exposed around the bottom perimeter of the cake. Pack some of the blue coconut onto the exposed frosting to make your first strip of color. Lift the collar up another 1 inch and do the same with the orange coconut. Remove the collar and fill the remaining inch of frosting with the yellow coconut. For the top, make 1-inch-wide rings, starting on the outside and working your way in, with the purple, pink, blue and orange coconut until the top is completely covered. Let sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 56002,&quot;Whole Roasted Arctic Char with Fennel and Pistou 1 (2 to 3 pound) whole arctic char, gutted and scaled, gills and fins removed, head and tail intact Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 handfuls mixed fresh herbs (basil, thyme, tarragon) 1 small bulb fennel, sliced, fronds reserved 4 bay leaves 1 lemon, cut into 4 slices Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed 1 recipe Pistou, recipe follows 2 anchovy fillets 2 garlic cloves 1 cup packed fresh basil leaves 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 vine-ripe tomato, seeded, and chopped Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the onions, celery, carrots, parsnips, and leeks and saute them just until glossy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the bay leaves, peppercorns, allspice, and beef stock. Bring to a boil, skimming away the froth that rises to the surface. Add the beef and reduce the heat to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Cook the beef until tender, 2 to 3 hours. Remove the beef from the stockpot and let it rest for 15 minutes. Cut the meat crosswise, against the grain, into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Spread a thin layer of mustard on one side of each slice of beef. On a plate, stir together the breadcrumbs and minced parsley. Dip the mustard side of the beef slices into the mixture and press to thickly coat with crumbs. In 2 separate saucepans, gently reheat the Pickled Vegetables and Pickled Pumpkin. In each of 2 separate medium saute pans, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Carefully place the beef slices in the pan, crumb side down, and saute until golden in color, 30 seconds to 1 minute. With a spatula, carefully turn the slices over and cook just until reheated, 30 seconds to 1 minute more. To serve, place a generous spoonful of the heated pickled vegetables and pumpkin on each heated serving plate. Arrange 2 to 3 slices of beef on top, crumb-sides up. Drizzle pumpkin seed oil around the beef slices and sprinkle with toasted pumpkin seeds. Garnish with alfalfa sprouts or micro greens. Serve immediately. To make the Pickled Vegetables: In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and shallots and sweat them for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the red and yellow bell peppers and zucchini and cook until the onions are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes more. Add the vinegar and stir and scrape to deglaze the pan deposits. Add the bay leaves, rosemary, honey, and water. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture into a sterilized jar, cover, and refrigerate for at least 3 days. To make the Pickled Pumpkin: In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the shallots and sweat them for 1 minute. Add the pumpkin and cook for 2 minutes more. Add with vinegar and stir and scrape to deglaze the pan deposits. Add the bay leaves, rosemary, honey, and water. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and simmer just until the squash cubes are al dente, about 15 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture into a sterilized jar, cover, and refrigerate for at least 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 56004,&quot;Roasted Potatoes with Garlic 2 pounds small potatoes: Red Bliss, small whites, Yukon Gold, Yellow Finns, or Fingerling potatoes 1/4 cup olive oil 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 cloves garlic, peeled and finely minced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Instructions: Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Leaving their skins on, scrub the potatoes with a brush to remove any dirt or blemishes. Dry the potatoes with paper towels or a cloth. Leave whole, cut in half or in quarters, depending on the size of the potatoes. Pour the olive oil into a roasting pan or large cast iron skillet and heat in a 350 degree oven for ten minutes before adding the potatoes. Roast the potatoes for 45 minutes, until crisp. Shake the pan several times during cooking, so that the potatoes roll around to brown evenly. Remove from the oven. Drain the potatoes on paper towels or a cloth to absorb the excess oil, then place in a serving dish. In a saute pan, melt the butter, add the garlic, and saute until light golden-brown. Add the chopped herbs to the garlic butter, stir together quickly, and remove from the heat. Pour the garlic-herb butter over the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, and serve.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 56005,&quot;Honey-Glazed Carrots with Radicchio and Thyme 1/4 cup honey 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for finishing 1 lemon, zested and juiced Kosher salt 2 pounds heirloom carrots, peeled and cut into thirds on the bias 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon ground sumac, plus more for finishing 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves 1 small head radicchio, leaves separated 3 tablespoons chopped salted roasted almonds, for garnish Flaky salt Chopped parsley, for garnish Instructions: To make the glaze: In a glass measuring cup or small bowl, whisk together the honey, kosher salt, red pepper flakes and lemon zest and juice.

Butter the bottoms and sides of two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. To make the cake: Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until soft and fluffy. Add the vanilla and one egg and beat the mixture like mad, then add another egg and beat it well. Add a couple of tablespoons of the flour, stir, then repeat, adding two more eggs, one by one, beating well between each addition. Add the rest of the flour and mix well to combine. Divide the mixture between the two prepared pans, smoothing out the tops. Bake on the middle shelf for 25 to 30 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. The cake will feel springy to the touch, be golden brown and will smell cooked. Remove the cakes from the oven and immediately brush with the sugar syrup, see below. Cool completely in the pans. Make the sugar syrup: While the cakes are cooking, put the sugar and water into a small pan over medium-low heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Turn up the heat and let the mixture boil for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Make the buttercream: While the cakes are cooling, put the butter and vanilla into a large bowl and beat well with a wooden spoon until it is light and creamy. Add the powdered sugar a little at a time, beating until the mixture is combined and becomes lighter. Set aside. To ice the cakes: When the cakes are completely cool, remove them from the pans. To make icing them easier, put them into the freezer for 20 minutes to get them nice and hard. Put a cardboard cake round, if you have one, onto a plate. Put a small dollop of buttercream onto the round and place one of the cakes on top. Spread the cake with buttercream and place the other cake on top. Now the fun bit: spread lots of the buttercream over the sides and top of the cake; spread it quite liberally at first, then smooth it out round the edges and over the top to give a neat first layer. Put it into the refrigerator or use the freezer if you, like me, are a little impatient when it comes to cake, and let it harden. Once it is hard, remove it from the refrigerator or freezer and spread over another layer of buttercream. Try to get it smooth so the edges are really sharp. Put the cake into the refrigerator to set. Make the graffiti: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Have a measuring cup, a cup of cold water with a spoon and a cup of cold water with a small pastry brush. Put the sugar into a heavy-based medium pot together with the water and liquid glucose over medium heat. Swirl the mixture a little rather than stir it, otherwise the glucose can stick to the spoon. Once the sugar has dissolved, turn up the heat and let it boil away. If there is any sugar stuck to the side of the pan, brush it off with the wet pastry brush. The sugar needs to be cooked for 10 to 15 minutes, but check it every 5 minutes to see if it&#39;s ready. To check, take the teaspoon from the cup and dip it into the hot mixture, carefully scooping out a small amount, then put the spoon back into the cup and leave it there for a minute or so to cool down. Pick up the spoon and feel the sugar mixture on the end of the spoon. If it has disappeared, that shows the mixture is in the very early stages of cooking. Let it boil again and test using the same method; if the mixture is soft, it is still not ready. It will go through various stages until the hard crack stage: the sugar mixture will be rock hard on the end of the spoon when a bit is scooped out and plunged into water and left there for a minute or two. The mixture in the pan will also start to go a very light brownish color. Once the mixture reaches this stage, turn off the heat and add a few drops of food coloring and vanilla. Stir as little as you can so it is just combined and then extremely carefully pour the sugar into the jug. Use oven gloves when handling the pan, as hot sugar can spit and burn you. Leave to cool for a minute or so, then drizzle a long band of graffiti squiggle shapes on the baking parchment. Use a hair dryer to keep the sugar syrup pliable if necessary. The graffiti can be as long as you like, but needs to be at least as high as your cake. Once you are satisfied you have enough bands (and it is good to have a few, as they do break), set the jug down and wait for a few moments for the sugar to harden a little. Remove the cake from the refrigerator. When the graffiti is firm but still pliable, carefully peel off the back for the baking parchment and stick the graffiti around the cake. If you have one long piece that can go around that&#39;s great, but small pieces done patchwork style look good too. Once the sides of the cake are covered, you could arrange berries of your choice or chocolate shavings on top. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Pinot Noir, Grenache]&quot; 56010,&quot;Tomato and Bibb Lettuce Salad 1/3 cup mayonnaise 2 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh parsley<br> 1 head bibb lettuce, separated into leaves<br> 2 ripe beefsteak tomatoes, cut into wedges<br> 1/2 small red onion, cut into rings<br> 2 tablespoons pitted Kalamata olives, halved<br> Instructions: Combine the mayonnaise and vinegar in a medium bowl with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.

Toss the live crabs into salted boiling water for 2 minutes. Next, place the crabs top-side up, and stick your thumb under the edge of the top shell, pull forward and lift the shell up and off, and reserve. Scrape out the gills that are found on top of the body. Now, turn the crabs over and on the underbelly you will find the \\apron,\\ a slightly-lifted triangular flap, pull this off too. Finally, rinse the crabs of all the grey or green spongy stuff (the soft yellow matter is fat or crab butter and considered desirable by many, keep it if you wish.) Divide the crabs into quarters with a big knife, leaving the legs attached to the 4 sections. Heat the peanut oil in a wok over high heat until almost smoking. Add the garlic, ginger, chiles, and bok choy. Stir-fry for 1 minute, then remove to a side platter. Toss in the crab pieces, including the top shells. Take the top shells out after 1 minute, continue to stir-fry the crab for 3 minutes. With a big spoon or spatula, remove the crab pieces to the side platter. Now on to the sauce, pour 1 cup of water into the wok, along with the brown sugar, soy sauce, lemon juice, and sake. Stir for 2 minutes to dissolve the sugar. Stir in the cornstarch slurry and cook another minute until the sauce thickens. Return the crabs and bok choy to the pan, toss everything together to coat. Cover, and cook for 3 minutes. To serve, line a large platter with butter lettuce leaves, and arrange the crabs with the top shell back on top so it looks roughly like a whole crab again - cool right?! Put the bok choy around the crab and pour the sauce all over the top. Garnish with the green onions and peanuts. You&#39;ll need crab crackers, mini forks, a side bowl for the shells, a stack of napkins, and bowls of warm lemon water to clean your hands.

Add the shrimp, onion, carrot, cabbage and mushrooms and quickly stir fry while combining the ingredients. Add the pepper flakes, sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar, adjust the seasoning and pour out onto a cookie sheet to cool. When the mixture is cool, begin making the potstickers. Lay out one wonton, brush the edge with water and put 1 teaspoon of the filling into the middle of the wonton. Fold the edge over on the diagonal to form a packet. Trim the edges to eliminate any square corners. Dust the finished potstickers with a light coating of cornstarch to prevent sticking before cooking. Potstickers may be frozen at this point. Using a bamboo steamer over a wok or pot, heat 1 cup of water to a boil. Place the potstickers in the oiled steamer basket and steam them until the dough becomes translucent, about 3 minutes. Remove from the basket and proceed to the skillet cooking process. Heat a non-stick skillet with 3 tablespoons vegetable oil. When the pan is hot, add enough potstickers to cover the bottom of the pan, but do not crowd them. Cook both sides until well browned and crisp. Continue in this manner until all of the potstickers are cooked. Keep them warm in a low oven while finishing the last batches. Serve with sweet mustard dip. Sweet mustard dip: Combine water, honey, vinegar, soy and mustard in a saucepan over low heat. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes to blend the flavors.

Add 1 tablespoon of the butter and melt. While the butter is melting, break the eggs into a large bowl. Add the melted butter and whisk well. Season with salt and pepper. Return the pan to medium-low heat. Add the olive oil and the remaining butter and heat. Add the egg mixture and grasp the pan by its handle (using a potholder if necessary to protect your hand). Start shaking the pan forward and back while stirring the eggs slowly with the back of a fork, gently lifting a moving the cooked egg so that the liquid egg slips beneath it. After about 30 seconds, the egg will have formed a uniformly cooked but still fairly moist \\pancake\\ shape. At this time, add any filling of your choice, the tomato and goat cheese, or leave the omelet unfilled in the classic French style. To fold the omelet, immediately tilt the pan to about a 45-degree angle by raising the handle, so that the cooked eggs nearest the handle begin to fall and fold over; you may use the fork or spatula to help this happen. Hold the far edge of the pan over a heated serving plate and continue tipping the handle up, so that the omelet folds over on itself and rolls out of the pan onto the plate. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 56018,&quot;Roasted Garlic Burger 2 pounds ground chuck Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup Roasted Garlic Paste, recipe follows 4 small loaves levain bread Sliced tomatoes, for serving Sliced dill pickles, for serving Blue cheese, for serving Dijon Garlic Sauce, recipe follows Sauteed Portobello Mushroom Caps, recipe follows 1/2 cup peeled garlic cloves 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1/2 cup Roasted Garlic Paste 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1 teaspoon salt 6 dill pickles, diced small 2 tablespoons dill pickle juice, from the jar 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 pounds whole portobello mushroom caps, cut into 1/2-inch dice 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Sea salt, preferably gray salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup sliced shallots or red onion 2 tablespoons sliced garlic 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme leaves 1 cup dry red wine 1/2 cups flat-leaf parsley, chopped Instructions: Preheat a grill, or preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a bowl, mix together the meat, salt and pepper, and Roasted Garlic Paste. Using your hands, form 4 individual burgers. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to grill. Cook the burgers over a hot fire or roast in the oven until desired internal temperature is reached, about 160 degrees for medium. Split each loaf of levain bread and pull out some of the soft center to make a hole for the burger. Place the bread face down on the grill to toast. Place the burger in the bread and serve with garnishes. Combine the garlic and oil. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium. Simmer until garlic is brown and soft. Smash garlic with the back of a spoon; keep some chunks. Mix all ingredients together. Cover and refrigerate. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, arrange the mushrooms in a single layer. Don&#39;t stir! Let them sizzle until they have caramelized on the bottom, about 2 minutes. If you toss them too soon, they will release their liquid and begin to steam. When the bottoms are caramelized, toss the mushrooms and continue to cook over high heat for about 5 minutes. Add the butter. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are beautifully browned, about 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add the shallots and garlic. Saute until the garlic is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the thyme. Add the wine, reduce the heat slightly, and simmer until the mushrooms are glazed with the sauce. Add the parsley, transfer to a warmed bowl, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 56019,&quot;Giobbi&#39;s Primavera Pasta 1 pound ripe tomatoes (2 or 3 tomatoes) 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic cloves 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup shredded basil leaves Salt 8 cups water 1 pound penne or bow-tie pasta 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Instructions: For the Tomato Salad/Sauce: Cut the tomatoes in 1/2 crosswise, parallel to the stems, and gently press the seeds out.

Then add 2 tablespoons olive oil, the raw sugar and sea salt. Whisk and set aside. In a large bowl, sift together the all-purpose and whole-wheat flour. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture. Using your hands, mix in the flour until all the liquid is absorbed. Now sprinkle a clean surface with flour and knead the dough until it&#39;s smooth. If the dough is too sticky, add some more flour as needed. Once it&#39;s smooth, shape the dough into a ball. Coat a large ceramic bowl with a tablespoon of olive oil. Place the dough in the ceramic bowl and flip it over a few times to lightly coat the dough with oil. Loosely cover the top of the dough with plastic wrap and completely cover the top of the ceramic bowl with a dish towel. Let it rise for 2 hours, until the dough has doubled in size. Then punch down the dough and let it rise for another hour. Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a large bowl, hand crush the tomatoes. Add the olive oil, garlic, fresh basil, parsley, dried basil, dried oregano, cl flakes, Parmigiano, sea salt and lots of cracked pepper. Mix. Cover and let sit in the fridge for 3 hours, or overnight. Use a fine wire-mesh sieve to drain all the liquid from the tomato sauce. Roughly chop the drained tomato chunks into little pieces and set aside. Dust a clean surface with flour. Roll out the dough 1/8 inch thick. If the dough is too sticky, dust with more flour. Once the dough is rolled out, use a 5-inch-round cookie cutter to cut about 10 to 12 circles of dough. On one half of each circle, place 1 tablespoon mozzarella, 1 tablespoon of drained tomato pieces, 1/4 teaspoon capers and 1 chopped anchovy and sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon Romano cheese. Fold the circles over and completely seal the edges with a fork. In a heavy pot, heat 6 inches of vegetable oil to 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Deep-fry the panzarotti until golden, crispy and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Place them on paper towels to drain the excess oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 56024,&quot;Loin of Lamb in Salt Crust Freshly ground pepper, to taste Olive oil, for brushing baking sheet 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 (14-ounce) boneless, trimmed lamb loins 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 2 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Salt Crust Dough (about 1/2 recipe) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

F. Butter and flour two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Put the cocoa powder and chocolate in a medium bowl. Add the boiling water and whisk until the chocolate is melted. Whisk in the sour cream until smooth; let cool to room temperature. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, then the vanilla, beating well after each addition. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Beat in the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the cocoa mixture in 2 additions. Finish mixing gently with a rubber spatula, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl. Divide the batter evenly between the cake pans. Tap the pans against the counter to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake until the cakes spring back in the center when gently pressed, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula around the edges and turn out the cakes onto a rack to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Make the frosting: Bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk the egg whites, granulated sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Set the bowl over the saucepan (do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water); cook, whisking, until the sugar dissolves, the egg whites are frothy and the mixture is warm, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form and the mixture cools to room temperature, about 5 minutes. With the mixer running, add the butter a few pieces at a time, waiting for them to incorporate before adding more. (The mixture will become liquidy, then it will get thick and shiny once the butter emulsifies. It may also look curdled as you add the butter. It\\u2019s OK: Keep adding butter and beating.) Add the vanilla and beat until combined and fluffy, 3 to 5 more minutes. Cut each cake in half horizontally to create 4 layers. Place 1 layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread about 2/3 cup frosting on top, then repeat with the remaining cake layers, spreading more frosting in between them. Spread a thin layer of frosting on the top and sides of the cake (this is the crumb coat \\u2014 it doesn\\u2019t have to be perfect), then refrigerate until the frosting sets, about 30 minutes. Spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides of the cake, smoothing it with a bench scraper. Make the ganache: Heat the heavy cream in a saucepan over medium-high heat until steaming, then pour over the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Set aside until cool but still pourable, 20 to 40 minutes (the time will vary depending on the temperature and bowl). Pour the ganache on top of the cake and spread with a small offset spatula, letting it drip down the sides. Let the ganache set 20 to 30 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 56029,&quot;Alpine Baked Pasta 6 quarts water and 2 tablespoons salt 1 pound dry penne pasta 1 leek, well washed, chopped, about 1 cup 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage 1 tablespoon poppy seeds 1 bunch spinach, washed and coarsely chopped, about 2 cups 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/2 cup grated Fontina cheese 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Place the flour in a shallow dish large enough for the whole fish. Season the flour with salt and pepper. Dredge the fish to lightly coat and set aside. In a saute pan large enough to fit the whole fish, heat the clarified butter over medium-high heat. When the fat begins to lightly smoke, place the fish in the pan and cook, without moving, until browned, about 4 minutes. Turn the fish over and repeat on the other side. Transfer the fish to the oven on a sheet tray fitted with a rack. Cook until tender and cooked through at the thickest part of the spine, 8 to 10 minutes. Heat the same saute pan with the high-fat butter it butter begins to lightly brown. Add the lemon juice (as much or as little as you like) to stop the cooking. Add the capers and finish with the parsley. Taste the sauce and season if necessary with more pepper but not salt because of the capers. Rest the fish, then serve whole with the sauce poured over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 56038,&quot;Pasta Alla Norma: Norma&#39;s Pasta 1 pound/450 g penne rigate pasta 4 tablespoons/5 ml, extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for deep-frying eggplant 1/2 white onion, chopped 1 (14-ounce/400 g) can peeled plum tomatoes Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 medium-size eggplant, cubed Fresh basil leaves, torn Ricotta salata cheese, freshly grated Instructions: Cook the penne in a pot of boiling salted water. Stir to prevent the pasta from sticking together. While the pasta is cooking, make the sauce.<br> To make the sauce: In a saucepan, heat up 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Gently saute the chopped onions until tender, then add the plum tomatoes and liquid from the can. With the back of a wooden spoon, break up the tomatoes into little chunks. Season the sauce with salt, and pepper, to taste. Cook the tomato sauce for a few minutes, until the sauce has thickened.<br> In another pan, heat olive oil and fry the eggplant cubes until golden.<br> Drain the eggplant cubes on a paper towel to remove the excess oil. Drain the pasta approximately 2 minutes before the &#39;al dente&#39; stage and add the pasta to the saucepan. Finish cooking the pasta in the sauce. Add the fried eggplant, basil leaves and sprinkle with ricotta salata. Mix the ingredients together well in the saucepan so that the pasta and the sauce are well amalgamated or combined. Be careful not to overcook the pasta. Transfer the pasta to a warm serving bowl or divide the pasta among warm plates and sprinkle extra ricotta salata on top and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Nebbiolo, Barbera, Aglianico, Tempranillo]&quot; 56039,&quot;Make-Ahead Turkey Gravy Kosher salt 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon dried sage 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 turkey wings (about 2 pounds) 2 large carrots 2 celery stalks 1 onion 6 cups low-sodium chicken stock 2 bay leaves 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine 2 teaspoons salt, the garlic powder, onion powder, sage and pepper. Use to generously season the turkey wings on all sides and use any extra to season the carrots, celery and onion.<br> Place the turkey wings and vegetables in a Dutch oven and bake, uncovered, 1 hour and 15 minutes.<br> Transfer the Dutch oven to the stovetop on medium-high heat. Add the stock and bay leaves. Use a wooden spoon to break up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Bring to a low boil, reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer 1 1/2 hours.<br> Remove the turkey wings and use a mesh strainer to separate the vegetables from the broth. Use a spoon to press out any liquid from the vegetables. Use a gravy fat separator (optional, but I like to do this step because I find the extra fat can cause the gravy to separate) or skim off the excess fat.<br> In the same Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook until it starts to turn golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in the reserved broth, sherry and Worcestershire. Simmer until it thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper if necessary. If you have any lumps, pass through a fine mesh sieve. Let cool completely and refrigerate or freeze until use.<br> Reheating Instructions: You may need to add a few tablespoons of stock and whisk vigorously to thin out the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56040,&quot;Party Platter with Pickle Dip 1 cup shredded aged Havarti cheese (136 grams) 1 cup (238 grams) ranch dressing 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons sriracha<br> 4 whole kosher dill pickles, quartered and chopped (about 1 cup or 180 grams) plus 1/4 cup pickle juice<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill<br> Crudites, for serving<br> Instructions: Mix the Havarti, ranch, cream cheese, sriracha, pickles, pickle juice and dill in a medium bowl until smooth and combined.

Boil your potatoes in salted water until perfectly cooked (don&#39;t overcook). Drain and allow to cool. Remove any fat from inside the chicken cavity. Wash and pat dry with kitchen paper. Slice your potatoes thickly, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, add your freshly torn herbs and enough olive oil just to coat. Toss over and then stuff your chickens with the potatoes. Place them into the tray with about 12 cloves of garlic and cook for 30 minutes. After this time the chicken should be looking as handsome as its inventor and the skin should be crisp and golden. At this point lay your streaky bacon snugly over the breast meat and add a 1/2 cup of wine to the pan to get some sticky marmitey juices happening. Cook for another 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven. Take them out of the tray and allow them to rest for 5 minutes while you make a quick bit of gravy. I normally remove as much fat as possible from the tray before placing on gentle heat. Splash the remaining 1 cup of white wine into it. Then boil up and scrape away all the goodness from the sides of the tray. Simmer this for a couple of minutes until tasty. It&#39;s not a thick, robust gravy, just a tasty gesture. (Another nice option at this point is to add a little cream to the gravy which works really well.)

In a large pot, add the potatoes and cover amply with cold water. Bring the water up to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Add a generous pinch of salt to the water and allow the potatoes to cook until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour the water and potatoes into a colander placed in the sink to drain off all of the water. Return the same pot to the heat and add the milk. Bring the milk to a simmer and gingerly add the potatoes back into the pot. Season with salt. Whisk in the stick of butter. Whisk until all of the ingredients meld together. Taste for seasoning. Remove from the heat. Use the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to \\grease\\ the sides and bottom of the baking dish. Add in the breadcrumbs and roll them around inside the dish so it creates a butter/breadcrumb topping. Using a whisk (or an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), whip the heavy cream until fairly firm. Season with salt. With a rubber spatula, gently fold the whipped cream and about 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into the mashed potatoes. Taste for seasoning. Transfer the potatoes to a baking dish and top with remaining Parmesan. Place in the center of the oven and bake, undisturbed, for 15 to 20 minutes. The top should be light brown from the cheese and the potatoes hot.

Using a wire whisk, pour in sugar and emulsify. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 56082,&quot;Chocolate Leaves 16 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered Instructions: Place the metal leaf template onto parchment paper. Using a small offset spatula, spread bittersweet chocolate over the template. Remove the stencil and allow to harden. If you don&#39;t have a stencil, use a paintbrush to spread bittersweet chocolate over a real leaf on the shiny side, keeping the thickness to about 1/8-inch. Allow the chocolate to set completely then gently peel back the leaf from the chocolate. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 56083,&quot;BBQ Grill Cubed Sirloin Steak with Jalapeno BBQ Sauce 1 pound (4 pieces) \\cubed\\ sirloin steak 2 cups your favorite hickory smoked BBQ sauce 1/4 cup scallions, chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh garlic 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves 1 whole jalapeno pepper, sliced thin 1/4 cup canola oil, plus 2 tablespoons, plus more oil for grill 1 large Vidalia onion, sliced 1/4-inch thick 4 kaiser rolls, split in half 2 tablespoons butter, melted 8 slices Cheddar Coleslaw and dill pickles, as an accompaniment Instructions: Pierce the steaks with a fork to make numerous holes.

Wash thoroughly inside and out and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the cavity with a little salt. Cut off the two ends of the oranges, stand them on end and carefully slice off the skin (once you have removed one piece of skin you can see where the flesh meets the skin). Slice the oranges into five or six rounds each. Remove the tougher outside ribs of the celery until you reach the white, dense bulb and slice across thinly.<br> Put in a bowl, mix in the thyme and a small pinch of salt and pepper, then stuff the cavity of each guinea fowl with this filling. Pull the skin at the front of each guinea fowl&#39;s cavity forward, to cover the filling, and tightly tie/truss up.<br> Heat a thick-bottomed pan and add the olive oil and the guinea fowl, the skin of which has been rubbed in sea salt and pepper. Cook until lightly golden on all sides, then add the garlic, butter and sage and cook for 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Add the wine at intervals, enough to keep the pan slightly moist at all times. Place in the oven for 45 minutes, checking every 10-15 minutes and just topping up the wine as necessary. The guinea fowl will be roasted and partially steamed.<br> When cooked, carefully remove from the oven and place upside down on a dish, allowing all the juices and moisture to relax back into the breast meat for at least 5 minutes. While your meat is resting, make the gravy. Remove all the fat from the roasting pan and place the pan on gentle heat. In the bottom of the pan will be your cooked, soft, sweet, whole garlic cloves and some gorgeous sticky stuff--when this gets hot, scoop out the stuffing from the guinea fowl cavity and add to the pan with about 2/3 cup of wine. As the wine boils and steams, scrape all the goodness with a spoon from the bottom of the pan into the liquor. When it has all dissolved, leave to simmer gently. Squash the cooked garlic out of their skins with a spoon (discard the skins); this will also thicken the gravy slightly, as well as give it flavor. Pour any of the juices that have drained out of the rested birds into the pan with the gravy, simmer and season to taste. Serve the guinea fowl with roast potatoes and any simply cooked green vegetable--spinach, kale, bok choy or broccoli. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 56099,&quot;Cobia Poached in Olive Oil with Jicama, Avocado and Lemon Basil Granita 3 cardamom pods, cracked 2 large shallots, peeled and thinly sliced 1 serrano cl, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/4 cup sugar 8 ounces lemon basil leaves Zest of 3 lemons 1/2 cup cucumber juice (from peeled cucumber), made with a juicer 1/4 cup Champagne vinegar 1 cup white wine vinegar 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 4 cups extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups sliced shallots<br> 1/4 cup minced garlic<br> 1 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon sugar<br> 2 tablespoons chopped thyme<br> 1/2 tablespoon tarragon leaves<br> 1 ripe avocado, pit and skin removed Juice of 2 limes 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 pound cobia loin, bloodline and bones removed 1 tablespoon kosher salt 3 blood oranges, peeled and sliced into 24 segments (\\supremes) 1 avocado, pit and skin removed, thinly sliced 2 cups julienned jicama cl oil, for dressing Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Fresh lemon basil leaves, for garnish Jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced, for garnish Instructions: For the lemon basil granita: Place the cardamom, shallots, cl, salt, sugar and 2 cups water in a pot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.

Add diced potato, chunked pumpkin flesh and stock and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes until potatoes and pumpkin are completely soft. Pass soup through a food mill fitted with the fine blade into a clean pot. Whisk in cream, taste and adjust seasoning and set aside. Roasted pumpkins and soup should be done at about the same time. To serve, remove tops from pumpkins and use a melon baller to scoop balls of pumpkin flesh, leaving them in their respective pumpkins. Carefully ladle soup into each pumpkin, filling about 2/3 full. Replace pumpkin tops, place each pumpkin on a plate, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56123,&quot;Beet, Strawberry, Cranberry Smoothie 3/4 cup (180 ml) cranberry juice, chilled 1/4 cup (24 g) cranberries, fresh or frozen 1 (50 g) small beet, steamed 1/3 cup (50 g) frozen strawberries 2 teaspoons honey or other sweetener, to taste 2/3 cup (160 ml) ice cubes Instructions: 1.Place all ingredients into the Vitamix container in the order listed and secure lid. 2.Select Variable 1. 3.Turn machine on and slowly increase speed to Variable 10, then to High. 4.Blend for 1 minute or until desired consistency is reached.

Press into a 9-inch (23cm) pie plate or flan dish. Form a lip of biscuit dough a little higher than the plate or dish if you can. This process takes patience as you need, ideally, to form a smooth even layer. Sorry. Freeze this biscuit-lined layer for about 1 hour so it gets really hard. In the meantime, let your ice cream soften, in the refrigerator, just until it can be scooped. Spread the ice cream into the hard biscuit-lined dish to form a layer. Then cover in cling film and return to the freezer. Put the syrup, sugar, remaining 3 ounces of butter and the salt, if using, into a saucepan and let it melt over low to medium heat, before turning it up and boiling for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the bourbon, letting it hiss in the pan. Add the cream and stir to mix into a sauce, then remove from the heat and let cool. Once the sauce is cool, but not set cold, pour it over the pie to cover the ice cream layer and then put it back in the freezer. Once frozen, cover with cling film again. When ready to serve, remove the pie from the freezer, take the whole pie out of its dish and cut into slices. Should you have any pie leftover, slip it quickly back into the dish and return, covered with cling film, to the freezer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 56131,&quot;Goat Cheese, Lentil and Brown Rice Rolls Butter, for greasing the baking dish 6 large Swiss chard leaves (about 1 1/4 pounds) Salt 2 cups cooked short grain brown rice 1 packed cup baby arugula leaves, chopped 1 cup goat cheese, at room temperature (8 ounces) 1 cup cooked green lentils 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus extra for seasoning 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra for seasoning 2 cloves garlic, minced One 26-ounce jar marinara or tomato-basil sauce 1/2 cup grated Parmesan (2 ounces) 2 tablespoons olive oil, or unsalted butter diced into 1/4-inch pieces Instructions: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven.

Mix in the Cheddar and Parmesan and knead lightly to combine. Form the mixture into a disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Unwrap the dough, take a small piece and cover an olive, making sure the pastry surrounds the olive and there are no gaps. Flour your hands and roll the olive-encased pastry into a ball; put it on an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining pastry and olives. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. (Can be made a day ahead and held in the refrigerator.) Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put the baking sheets on the middle shelf of the oven and bake until the pastries are light golden, about 10 minutes.

In a medium pot, combine the cherries, 1 cup of sugar, lemon juice, kirsch, and 3/4 cup of water. Simmer over medium-high heat until the juice from the cherries is released and the fruit is soft, about 20 minutes. Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water to make a slurry and add it to the cherry mixture. Simmer, stirring, for another 2 minutes to thicken. Remove the cherry sauce from the heat, you should have about 4 cups. Put the cherry sauce in the freezer or in an ice bath to chill until cold. Using a wire whisk, beat 2 cups of the heavy cream, the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, and vanilla together until soft peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, fold the whipped cream into half of the cherry mixture (2 cups) to make a light mousse \\u2013 don&#39;t overdo it, it&#39;s ok if there are streaks of cream in the filling. Gently fold in the pistachios. Take the plastic-lined bowl out of the freezer and spoon the cherry mousse into it, filling it all the way to the top, and spreading evenly around the rim. Freeze again for at least 8 hours, so the mousse sets up firm. Heat the remaining 1 cup of cream and the chocolate in a pot over medium-low flame. Stir to melt the chocolate completely and smooth it out into the cream. Cool until warm to the touch, the chocolate should still be pourable. Take the bowl of cherry mousse out of the freezer and invert it, bottom-side up, on a wire rack set over a sheet pan. Carefully peel off the plastic and pour the chocolate ganache over the bombe to cover it completely, allowing the excess to drip down into the sheet pan. Stick the chocolate cherry bombe back in the freezer to chill. Using a couple of flat spatulas, carefully remove the bombe from the rack and put in on a chilled platter.

Reduce the mixer speed to low, add the flour, little by little, and the salt, and process until just combined. Turn the dough out onto a slightly floured surface and knead lightly. Form the dough into a disk, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to overnight. Heat 1 teaspoon of the reserved bacon drippings in a medium nonstick skillet and, when hot, add the spinach. Cook, stirring frequently, until the spinach is wilted and has released its liquid, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the spinach to a colander to drain. When the spinach has cooled enough to handle, squeeze to release any excess water, then transfer to a cutting board and finely chop. Set aside. Add 2 more teaspoons of the bacon drippings to the same skillet, then add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until soft but not browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the reserved spinach, crumbled bacon, cottage cheese, salt and pepper to taste and nutmeg and mix thoroughly. Transfer to a mixing bowl and allow to cool thoroughly. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and lightly grease a baking sheet. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and, working on a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough to a thickness of about 1/8-inch thick. Using a small bowl or saucer as a guide, cut the dough into as many 5-inch circles as possible. Gather the scraps of dough together and knead lightly to reform the dough into a disk. Roll out as before and again cut as many rounds as you can. You should be able to get 10 to 12 rounds. Divide the spinach filling evenly among the dough circles. Using your fingers, lightly moisten the edges with some of the beaten egg, then fold 1 side over so that the edges meet, and press to seal. Crimp the edges using the tines of a fork and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all of the empanadas are assembled. Brush the tops of each empanada with some of the beaten egg and bake uncovered until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Serve either warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 56136,&quot;Octopus alla Karvouna (Charcoal-Grilled Octopus) 1 medium red onion 4 cups rice vinegar 4 cups granulated pure cane sugar 3 to 4 pounds raw Spanish octopus, frozen or fresh (thawed if frozen) 3 tablespoons baking soda 1 cup plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup dry white wine (save the cork for cooking) 1/4 cup whole black peppercorns 2 dried bay leaves 2 cloves garlic 2 lemons, halved, plus additional lemon wedges for serving 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper 8 ounces wild arugula 2 ounces cabernet sauvignon vinegar 2 ounces Picual olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme Instructions: For the pickled red onion: Slice the red onion into 1/8-inch strips and place in a large, heat-safe container. Bring the rice vinegar and sugar to a boil, stirring on occasion, until the sugar is completely dissolved, then turn off the heat. Let the liquid cool for 5 minutes, then pour the mixture into the container with the onions and let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate. When the onions turn bright pink and fluffy, they are ready (4 to 24 hours). Octopus preparation: Spread out the octopus on a cutting board and cover completely with plastic wrap. Tenderize the octopus with a mallet, starting from the middle body extending down the tentacles. Transfer to a pan and lightly sprinkle the baking soda over both sides of the octopus, then let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Poaching liquid: In a 10-quart pot, add 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, wine and wine cork, peppercorns, bay leaves, garlic, lemons and 6 to 8 cups water. (The water line should be around 1 inch above the octopus once dropped into the pot.) Cooking the octopus: Bring the poaching liquid to just about a simmer, 180 to 190 degrees F. Rinse the resting octopus in the sink to remove the excess baking soda. Transfer the octopus to the pot and continue to simmer until the internal temperature reaches 175 degrees F, 60 to 70 minutes. Breaking down the octopus: Place the octopus on a cutting board, and separate each tentacle from the body using a knife. Using the back of the knife, gently remove the gelatinous skin from each tentacle. (If your knife skills are limited, you can use paper towels and gently wipe the skin from the tentacles.) Grilling the octopus: Light your back patio grill and bring it up to 450 to 500 degrees F. Lightly cover the octopus tentacle in 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. Place on the grill and sear, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Pull off the grill and let rest for a few minutes. Meanwhile, build the accompaniment salad by tossing the arugula with some pickled red onions, the remaining teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, salt and pepper. Plating: On a clean cutting board, place the grilled octopus and slice the tentacles into 1-inch pinwheels. Arrange on a plate. Drizzle with some cabernet vinegar and Picual olive oil, then sprinkle with the herbs. To finish the plate, add a small handful of the dressed greens, and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 56137,&quot;Open Faced Smoked Chicken and Mustard Fruits Sandwich Eight 3/8-inch thick slices pumpkin bread 2 ounces apricot jam 2 ounces mustard fruits, cut in a small dice* 2 ounces smoked chicken, cut in a small dice 2 plums, halved, pitted and cut into fans, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

With a sharp French knife or boning knife, score the skin side of the fish in a oneinch diagonal pattern. The best equipment for steaming this fish is a wok and a large bamboo steamer. Shallow, heat resilient ceramic bowls that fit inside the steamer are perfect. You may have to steam the fish in waves, or you can stack an additional steamer onto the original to create a layered steamer tower. If you do not have heat resistant bowls to serve the fish in, any shallow stainless pan will work and then you just will have to transfer the fish into serving bowls. Peel the shrimp, leaving heads intact. Slice shrimp down the middle, beginning at the base of the head and continuing to the beginning of the tail. Remove the vein. Hold the shrimp by the tail and then pull the tail through the slit, going under so the tail stands upright. For steaming in individual bowls: Place one piece of lightly salted fish in the center of the bowl. Combine in a stainless steel bowl, 3 to 4 cups of water, julienned ginger, tomato sections, cup of cilantro sprigs, and 4 to 5 umeboshi plums, seeds removed and lightly mashed between your fingers. In each bowl, place two shrimp and ladle two pieces of tomato and about 6 to 8 cups of the liquid around the fish, making sure to get equal amounts of ginger and plum in the bowl. Sprinkle cracked white pepper on top of the fish. While you are preparing the bowls, set up wok with water and steamer(s). Turn on heat, bringing it up to full steam. Carefully place bowl(s) in steamer, then cover and cook till fish is done. The cooking time will vary according to the thickness of the fish and the intensity of the steam. An average piece of bass, approximately one inch thick, will cook in approximately six to seven minutes. Cautiously remove bowl(s) and garnish with fresh cilantro sprigs. Serve with ample steamed rice. If you have a rice steamer, proceed as you would to steam any rice. A banana leaf placed in the steamer will impart a wonderfully fragrant perfume. To cook jasmine rice: Bring four cups water to a boil. Add rice, salt and oil and boil hard until you see big rounds of boiling rice, approximately three to four minutes. Reduce heat to simmer, cover pot and cook for 15 minutes. Check rice with a fork, taste. If it is a little al dente, leave covered on stove with the heat off for three to four more minutes. Serve in individual bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 56142,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Easy BK Currywurst 2 cups ketchup 1/2 cup honey<br> 2 tablespoons mild yellow curry powder<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 links knackwurst (white pork bratwurst) or weisswurst (white pork and veal sausage) 2 cups chicken stock<br> Olive oil, for grilling 2 large sweet onions, sliced 1/2 inch thick<br> 8 German-style brotchen rolls or hard-shell rolls (ciabatta is a great substitute!)

Add 3 to 5 drops of food coloring, one drop at a time. Shake until it is completely covered and the desired color is evenly distributed. For the cupcakes: Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 18 cupcake cups with paper liners. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the sugar, flour, baking soda and sea salt. Let the mixer run on low for 2 to 3 minutes to incorporate air without sifting.<br> Meanwhile, place the chocolate in a medium bowl, and pour the hot coffee and vanilla extract over the chocolate. Let the chocolate and coffee mixture stand for about 2 minutes to melt the chocolate, then stir until smooth. Set aside.<br> In another medium bowl, whisk the oil and eggs together quickly so that they combine thoroughly. They will be thick and satiny, and light in color. Whisk in the sour cream but leave some visible streaks of white, being careful not to over mix. Pour in the melted chocolate mixture and mix until just combined. Add the chocolate and sour cream mixture to the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed adding in thirds until just combined, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Remove the bowl from the mixer and incorporate with a rubber spatula any ingredients that may be hiding at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be very wet and chocolaty, so it helps to transfer the batter into a liquid measuring cup to make it easier to pour.<br> Pour the batter into the prepared cupcake pan, filling each baking cup about two-thirds full. Refill the measuring cup as needed and repeat until all of the cupcake cups are filled. Bake the cupcakes until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside to cool for at least 20 minutes. Once the cupcakes are cooled, remove them from the paper liners. For the creamy coconut buttercream frosting: Combine the flour, 1/2 cup of the milk and vanilla extract in a small saucepan, and whisk until incorporated. Over medium heat, gradually add the remaining 1 1/2 cups milk and whisk constantly. Continue to cook the mixture until it comes to a low boil. Reduce the heat to low and continue to whisk until the mixture begins to thicken and starts to burp, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> Remove the mixture from the heat and transfer it to a small heat-proof bowl to cool. Stir the mixture occasionally as it continues to cool to keep it lump free. If you do get few lumps, don&#39;t worry, you can whisk the mixture to dissolve the lumps, or pass the mixture through a mesh sieve to get a completely smooth consistency. Set the mixture aside to cool to room temperature.<br> In a stand mixer or with an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the butter on medium speed until it is soft and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually add in the sugar and beat on high speed until light and fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes. Gradually add in the cooled milk mixture and increase the mixer to medium-high speed and whip until the frosting is light and fluffy, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure the frosting is thoroughly mixed. The frosting can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.<br> To assemble the cupcakes: Use an apple corer or a paring knife to scoop out a hole in the middle of the cupcake about 1 inch deep. (The extra cake is yours for the snacking.) Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch pastry tip with the buttercream frosting and fill the hole of each cupcake with frosting. Frost the cupcakes all over with the frosting. Place the coconut in a small bowl. Roll the frosted cupcakes in the tinted coconut and decorate with Crystallized Flowers, if desired. Store the cupcakes in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Dilute the meringue powder with 4 tablespoons warm water.<br> Pick some pesticide free, fresh. fully opened edible flowers such as Johnny-jump-ups, pansies, violets, marigolds and roses. Gently give the flowers a water bath in a small bowl of water with a pinch of salt. Next, dunk them in a bowl filled with ice cubes to perk the petals up. Gently remove the flowers and set aside to air dry on paper towels.<br> Working over a small bowl, apply a thin layer of the meringue powder mixture with the paint brush. Sprinkle the sugar over the flowers shaking off the excess. Use the tweezers to make sure the delicate flower is completely covered with sugar. Set aside to dry in a cool dry place for 2 to 4 hours. The flowers will take a bit longer to dry in humid weather. Store the dry flowers in an airtight container for up to 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 56171,&quot;Onion Soup with Raisins and Madeira 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 pounds sweet yellow onions, peeled and sliced very thin 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 garlic cloves, minced or pureed 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1 teaspoon paprika 2 tablespoons golden raisins 1/4 cup dry Madeira 5 cups rich chicken or beef stock 4 slices hearty country bread, toasted and brushed with 2 teaspoons olive oil.

Cutting from top to bottom and following the contours of the fruit, cut off the peel and white pith in 1-inch-wide strips. Scrape off any pulp adhering to the strips, but leave the pith intact. You should have several 1-inch wide strips of lemon peel and pith. Cut each one into long strips, about 1/4-inch by 3 inches each. Meanwhile, boil a kettleful of water. Pour about 2 cups of the boiling water into a small saucepan, bring back to a boil, add all the lemon rind, and boil 30 seconds. Drain in a strainer and rinse under cold running water. Repeat 2 times more, using fresh boiling water each time. Combine the sugar and 2 cups of water in the saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the blanched rind and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer until tender, about 1 hour. Drain in a strainer (reserve the sweet, lemony syrup for sweetening drinks, if you like). Arrange the strips on a wire rack, using your fingers to gently spread them out so that they do not touch each other. Let cool and store in an airtight container.

Butter 2 mini-muffin tins and then lay a large piece of plastic wrap over the tin. Push the plastic wrap down into each cup (this is to line it very well). Do not worry, the plastic wrap will not burn or melt in the oven. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Filling: Whip the cream cheese until light and fluffy in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the sugar and mix. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, then the flour and salt. Divide the filling among the lined cups, filling each one all the way up. Bake for 20 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, then chill. When ready to serve, cut the plastic wrap so you can remove each cup of cheesecake individually. Lift each one out of the cup and invert onto a cornmeal crust. Peel off the plastic wrap.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside. Bring a pot of salted water containing the lemons, quartered onion, and bouquet garni to a boil. Add the lobsters and cook until red and firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the lobsters to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. When the lobsters are cool enough to handle, cut in half lengthwise with a heavy sharp knife and carefully extract the tail meat. Remove the large claws from the body and gently crack with the back of a heavy knife to extract the meat. Gently pull the front legs from the shell and discard. Dice the tail meat and claw meat and set aside. Place the halved lobster shells on a baking sheet, cut sides down, and roast until dry, 5 to 6 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook, stirring constantly with a heavy wooden spoon to make a light roux, about 2 minutes. Add the cognac and cook, stirring, for 10 seconds. Add the milk slowly, stirring constantly to incorporate. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly add the cream, stirring constantly, until all is incorporated. Cook, stirring, over medium heat for 1 minute. (The mixture will be very thick.) Add the salt and pepper and stir well. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese, the mustard, tarragon, and parsley. Fold in the lobster meat. Divide the mixture among the lobster shells and place stuffed side up on a clean baking sheet. Sprinkle the top of each lobster with a portion of the remaining cheese and broil until the top is golden brown, 5 minutes. Place 1 lobster half on each of 4 large plates, garnish with additional parsley, and serve immediately. Place the bay leaf, thyme, parsley sprigs, and peppercorns in the center of a 6-inch square piece of cheesecloth or a large paper coffee filter. Draw up the sides to form a pouch and tie with kitchen twine or unflavored dental floss. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 56194,&quot;Red Beans and Rice with Elk Andouille 8 ounces dry red kidney beans 8 ounces smoked bacon, roughly chopped 8 ounces ham, diced 1 cup finely chopped yellow onion 1 cup finely chopped bell pepper 3 bay leaves 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 8 cups chicken broth Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound elk sausage links 2 cups cooked rice 3 green onions, sliced Instructions: Cover the beans with 2-inches of water and refrigerate overnight. Cook the bacon over medium heat in a large pot until crispy. Add the ham and cook until browned, about 4 minutes. Stir in the onion and bell peppers and cook until soft, about 5 mintues. Add the bay leaves, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Continue to cook for 3 minutes. Drain the beans and add to the pot. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beans are very tender. Once the beans are tender, mash them against the side of the pot. Repeat approximately 10 times. Stir to distribute the mashed beans. Simmer about 20 more minutes. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Slice the elk sausage links lengthwise. In a medium skillet, sear the sausage until golden brown, about 7 to 10 minutes per side. To serve, scoop cooked rice into the middle of a serving bowl. Ladle the red beans around the rice. Place a sausage link on top. Garnish with green onions. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 56195,&quot;Heinz 57 Chicken Turnovers 1 Package (13.8 oz.) refrigerated pizza crust dough 1/2 cup Heinz 57? 1/2 cup Prepared spinach dip 2 cups Frozen cooked fajita-style chicken strips, thawed and chopped 1/2 cup Chopped red bell pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle work surface with a pinch of flour or cornmeal to prevent dough from sticking if desired. Unroll dough onto work surface and cut into 4 pieces. In a small bowl, mix together Heinz 57® and spinach dip until smooth. Spread about 1/4 cup of Sauce mixture evenly on each piece of dough, leaving 1/2-in. around the edge. Arrange 1/2 cup of chicken and 2 Tbsp. of pepper onto one half of a dough piece. Gently fold dough over the filling to form a triangle shape. Seal the edges by crimping with fingertips or with a fork. Cut 1 or 2 slits on top of crust. Repeat with remaining dough pieces. Transfer turnovers to baking sheet and lightly coat with nonstick cooking spray. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve immediately. TIP: If desired, add your favorite vegetables such as chopped tomatoes, sliced onions, roasted peppers or sliced mushrooms, to the filling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56196,&quot;Brown Butter Buttermilk Donuts 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups cake flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup almond flour<br> 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> Zest of 1/2 lemon (1 to 2 teaspoons zest)<br> 1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1 large egg plus 1 yolk<br> 1/3 cup buttermilk<br> 2 to 3 quarts neutral oil (vegetable or peanut are good)<br> 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar 1/4 cup buttermilk<br> 1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon (1 to 2 tablespoons juice; include the pulp) Instructions: For the donuts: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Let it cook on low heat, swirling occasionally while it crackles and hisses, until the crackling stops and the milk solids in the butter smell toasty and nutty and have turned golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the stove and let cool to room temperature. Combine the cake flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a bowl, whisk together and set aside. In a mixer with the paddle attachment, beat together the melted butter, granulated sugar and lemon zest. Add the almond extract, whole egg and egg yolk and beat until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the dry ingredients and buttermilk and mix just until a soft dough forms. Remove onto a piece of plastic wrap, flatten out to a disc, cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight if you want to make the night before and finish in the morning). Unwrap the dough onto a liberally floured surface and pat out with your hands (or you can use a rolling pin) to 3/4 inch thick. Using a 3- to 4-inch glass or round cutter, punch out as many dough circles as you can and place on a baking sheet. Reroll until all the dough is cut. Using a small bottle cap or a round pastry tip, cut a hole in the center of each donut (you can use these pieces to test the oil or to have as snacks). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour. It is important that the dough is cold when frying (chilled dough is easier to handle and results in a nicer crust with well-defined cracks). Heat 2 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot to 350 degrees F. For the glaze: Right before frying the donuts, combine the powdered sugar, buttermilk, almond extract, salt and lemon juice in a medium bowl and whisk until smooth. When the oil is hot, carefully drop the donuts in the oil (2 to 3 at a time; do not crowd the pot). They will sink to the bottom but pop up after 15 to 20 seconds (don\\u2019t disturb them during this time). Fry, flipping frequently, until deep golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oil onto a rack. While still warm but cool enough to handle, drop each donut into the glaze, flip to coat the entire thing, then let set on the rack. These are the best right away, but they actually keep pretty well for a day or two because they are very moist. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56197,&quot;Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks 2 tablespoons milk 2 tablespoons coarse sugar 1 1/4 pounds rhubarb 2 pints strawberries 1 cup granulated sugar 2 heaping tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch of salt 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Juice of 1/2 lemon Instructions: Make the crust. Combine the flour, salt and butter in a large bowl. Gently cut the butter into the flour using 2 sharp knives in a crisscross motion until the butter is about the size of small peas. (The lighter the hand, the flakier the crust.) Slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup ice water and fold into the mixture with a fork until the dough comes together-you want to work the dough as little as possible. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the dough is too dry. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide into 2 balls. Form each into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, trim the rhubarb and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Hull the strawberries and slice. Combine the rhubarb, strawberries, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt, vanilla and lemon juice in a large bowl; toss. Prepare the bottom crust. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roll out 1 disk of dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch round. Roll the dough onto the rolling pin, then carefully unroll it over a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the dough into the plate with your fingers. Add the strawberry-rhubarb filling. Do not trim the overhanging dough. Make the lattice. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round. With an old-fashioned crimper, sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut into 1-inch-wide strips. Lay about half of the strips on the pie in one direction, about 1/2 inch apart. Fold back every other strip halfway. Lay a strip perpendicular to the first ones. Unfold the strips back over the new strip, then fold alternate strips back halfway. Add another perpendicular strip; unfold the strips back over it. Repeat to form a lattice. Pinch the overhanging top and bottom crusts together, trimming as needed, then fold the dough under itself and crimp with your fingers. Bake the pie. Using your fingers, pat the lattice top with milk and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Put the pie on a baking sheet and place in the preheated oven. Bake 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 50 more minutes.

Add the oil and swirl to coat the pan. When the oil is hot, add the garlic, ginger, and chiles and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Do not allow the aromatics to burn. Add the pork and stir-fry until just cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the cabbage, bamboo shoots, soy sauce, mushrooms, wine and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the cornstarch slurry. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Transfer the filling mixture to a medium bowl and add the scallions and the bean threads to the cooled mixture. Sir to blend. Dampen a kitchen towel. Place 5 wrappers on a work surface with 1 point each near you and cover the remainder with the cloth to prevent drying. Place about 1/4 cup of the filling on the wrappers, just above the near corners. Bring the corner nearest you up over the filling and roll halfway; brush the edges with the egg wash, then fold in the side corners and continue rolling to enclose the filling completely. Roll as tightly as possible. Cover with the cloth and allow the rolls to rest, seam side down; this allows the egg to set. Fill and roll the remaining wrappers, cover, and allow the rolls to rest at least 2 minutes. Fill a fryer or heavy medium pot 1/3 full with the oil and heat to 350 degrees over high heat. Add the egg rolls 4 to 6 at a time and fry them until light golden, turning as needed, about 5 minutes. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Fry again at 350 degrees (until golden) just before serving for extra crispiness. To Serve: Place a spoonful of the Sweet and Sour Sauce in the middle of a serving plate. Slice the rolls on the diagonal and arrange 3 of them around the sauce. Drizzle the spicy mustard around the outside of the plate and serve. In a saucepan over medium high heat, add the vinegar, soy sauce, wine, pineapple juice, and sugar. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium.

Open up the chicken and use the tip of a knife to score alongside the keel bone (the dark oblong bone in the middle of the breast); this makes it easier to flatten. Turn the chicken breast-side up and press down strongly with the heel of your hand on the center of the breast. You should hear a crack and feel the bones give way. Refrigerate the chicken, skin-side up and uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours to air-dry. Remove and allow to air-dry at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Halve the lemons, then slice one of the lemon halves into rounds. Using your index finger, separate the skin of the chicken from the meat and slide the lemon slices underneath the skin. Season the chicken with salt and lots of freshly ground pepper. In a large cast-iron pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken skin-side down and cook until the skin is well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Scatter the thyme and rosemary on top (leave the chicken skin-side down) and place the 3 remaining lemon halves in the pan cut-side down. Transfer to the oven and roast until the juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted in a thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Rest the chicken on a plate or baking sheet skin-side up for 20 minutes before carving. Squeeze the roasted lemons over as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 56206,&quot;Salmon Croquettes 2 cups cooked and flaked salmon 2 eggs 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 onion, chopped 1 teaspoon black pepper 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt 1 cup cornmeal Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Pour the cream over the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and stir until smooth. Allow to cool 10 minutes before using. Butter a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with a parchment paper circle. Cover the bottom of the prepared pan with the brownies, using any extra pieces to line the sides of the pan if desired. Spread the chocolate ganache on top. Scoop the ice cream onto the ganache layer, packing it in tightly. Spread with an offset spatula to make a smooth top. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Unmold the cake by running a knife around the edge of it, then unhinge the springform and remove. Invert the cake onto a sheet of plastic wrap and remove the bottom of the pan and the parchment. Place a plate on the bottom and invert once more. For the chocolate whipped cream frosting: Add the heavy cream, chocolate syrup, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla to a large bowl and whip with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. (This makes enough frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake with additional to pipe decorations if desired.) Frost the top and sides of the cake with the chocolate whipped cream frosting, sprinkle with the cookies and drizzle with chocolate sauce. If the cake begins to get too soft, put it back into the freezer for a few minutes. Freeze another 1 1/2 to 2 hours or overnight. Before serving, let the cake sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 56224,&quot;Mama&#39;s Little Helper 1 cucumber</p>",108)]))}const m=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
