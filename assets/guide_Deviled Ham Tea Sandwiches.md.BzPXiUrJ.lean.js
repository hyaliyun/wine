Place in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning. Heat the oil in a large, deep pot over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 325 degrees F. Remove the potatoes to paper towels and dry well. Working in batches, fry the potatoes until cooked through and tender but not yet colored, 4 to 5 minutes. Be sure the potatoes have plenty of room and gently swish them around as they are frying. Drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and increase the temperature of the cooking oil to 375 degrees F. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, seafood boil seasoning, baking soda and a pinch of salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and gently stir in the cold beer. Mix until just combined. When the oil is at temperature, dip the monkfish fillets in the batter, coating the fish generously. To add the fish to the oil, carefully dip about one-third to one-half of a fillet into the oil and allow the batter to start puffing up before gently sliding it in. In batches, fry the fillets until golden brown and crispy, turning once, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels to blot the excess oil. Arrange the fish on a baking sheet lined with a cooling rack and keep warm in the oven until ready to serve. Again working in batches, fry the potatoes a second time, at 375 degrees F, until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels and immediately toss with kosher salt. Transfer the fish to a platter and serve with the fries and remoulade. Combine the mayonnaise, cornichons, mustard, malt vinegar, celery salt, cayenne and shallots in a bowl. Season with salt, if needed. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 26893,&quot;Warm Lentil Salad with Roasted Beets and Goat Cheese 1 medium Spanish onion, peeled and quartered 1 carrot, quartered 1 stalk celery, quartered 1 fresh or dried bay leaf 4 sprigs fresh thyme 4 cups chicken stock 1 1/4 cups dried French green lentils Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 pound slab bacon, diced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 small carrot, peeled and finely diced 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar 4 cups frisee or mixed greens Sherry Vinaigrette, recipe follows 4 slices goat cheese French bread, for serving Roasted Beets, recipe follows 3 medium beets (red or gold), scrubbed, leaves trimmed Olive oil 1/4 cup sherry vinegar 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup olive oil Instructions: Begin by roasting the beets. Tie onion, carrot, celery, bay leaf, and thyme sprigs together in cheesecloth. Place chicken stock in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir in the lentils, season with salt and pepper, and reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the lentils are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well and discard the cheesecloth bag of aromatics. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until lightly golden brown. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a dish lined with paper towels. Add the garlic and carrot to the pan and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the cooked lentils and bacon to the pan and stir to combine. Stir in the chopped thyme and 1 tablespoon of sherry vinegar. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Keep warm. To assemble, place the frisee in a large bowl, toss with half of the vinaigrette, and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the roasted beets around the outside of 4 dinner plates. Divide the greens among each plate in the center. Top the frisee with some of the warm lentils and place a slice of the goat cheese on top. Drizzle each salad with the remaining vinaigrette. Serve with slices of French bread. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat beets lightly with oil. Wrap beets in aluminum foil, place on a baking sheet, and roast in the oven until cooked through, approximately 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool for 10 minutes, and then peel and slice into 1/4-inch thick slices. Whisk together the vinegar, mustard, thyme and salt and pepper in a small bowl. Slowly drizzle in the oil and whisk until emulsified. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 26894,&quot;Bloody Brain Shooter 1 1/4 ounces strawberry vodka 1/8 ounce Rose&#39;s lime juice 3/4 ounce Bailey&#39;s Irish Cream Splash of grenadine Instructions: Chill vodka for better smoothness. Add vodka and lime juice to a shaker, shake and strain into a shot glass. Using a straw, dip some Bailey&#39;s Irish Cream into the shot. Once you submerge the straw into the Bailey&#39;s put your finger on top of the straw to hold the Bailey&#39;s in the straw. Dip the straw tip into the vodka and slowly release your top finger. The Bailey&#39;s will curdle a little bit due to the lime juice and you should be able to make strands of Bailey&#39;s. Repeat the straw/Bailey&#39;s process to build a \\brain\\ in the shot glass. Add a splash of grenadine to the concoction to add the &#39;blood&#39; to the mix.

Add the garlic, onions and thyme and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Cook until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes, and then add 1/2 cup water. Continue cooking until the onions are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. If the liquid reduces too much, add a little more water. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper as needed. Stir in the ginger. Remove from the heat and discard the thyme. For the shrimp: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Toss the shrimp with the paprika and salt in a bowl, stirring to coat. When the oil begins to smoke, shut off the heat, add the shrimp to the skillet and toss around with a metal spatula so they are coated with oil and cook more evenly. Stir in the sherry. Turn the heat back on to medium-high and cook until the shrimp are no longer translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with more salt and pepper. Squeeze the lemon juice over and remove from the heat. Reserve any cooking liquid (if there is any). Stir the onion mixture into the shrimp. For the vinaigrette: Whisk together the olive oil, vinegar and lemon juice and zest in a small bowl. Add in any cooking liquid from the shrimp. Whisk to blend. Season with salt and pepper. For assembly: Spoon a little of the onion and shrimp mixture onto the bottom of each Bibb leaf. Top each with a sprinkle of the peanuts and drizzle with the vinaigrette. Serve any remaining vinaigrette on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 26896,&quot;Whole30 Ranch Dressing 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 large egg<br> 1/2 cup hazelnut, mild olive or avocado oil<br> 1/2 cup plain unsweetened cashew or other nut milk, without carrageenan<br> 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon dried minced onion or onion powder<br> 1 clove garlic, grated<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill<br> Instructions: Puree the mustard and egg in a blender on low speed until completely combined.

Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners; set aside. Make the cupcakes: Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Combine the granulated sugar and eggs in a large bowl; beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and thick, about 2 minutes. Beat in the melted butter and vanilla until smooth. Reduce the mixer to low speed; beat in half of the flour mixture, the milk, then the remaining flour mixture until smooth. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups and bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pan, then remove to a rack to cool completely. Make the frosting: Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until smooth, then beat in the vanilla and raspberry extracts. Beat in the milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until creamy. Transfer half of the frosting to a separate bowl and tint red with food coloring. Put the white and red frosting in separate zip-top bags; snip a corner of each. Snip a corner of a larger zip-top bag; put both frosting bags in the larger bag and twist so that they pipe out of the snipped corner. Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes. Make the candy stars: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Microwave the candy melts in a microwave-safe bowl in 45-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Transfer to a small zip-top bag and snip a small corner. Pipe twelve 2- to 3-inch stars onto the parchment, piping double or triple lines for stability. Refrigerate until set, about 10 minutes. Carefully lift the stars from the parchment and insert into the frosting on each cupcake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 26899,&quot;Mushroom and Three Cheese Pizza 1 recipe Pizza Dough, recipe follows 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 slices prosciutto, sliced in strips 2 garlic cloves, chopped 2 fresh rosemary sprigs, needles striped from the stem 1 pound assorted wild mushrooms, such as crimini, portobello, shiitake, and oyster, coarsely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 (4-ounce) logs goat cheese 2 cups shredded fontina 1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino 1 package active dry yeast 1 teaspoon sugar 1 cup warm water 1 tablespoon kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 3 cups 00 flour, plus more for dusting Instructions: Make the pizza dough as directed in the master recipe. Stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees F. Coat a saute pan with the olive oil and place over medium heat. When the oil gets hazy, add the prosciutto strips, stir to render out the ham&#39;s fat and flavor. Toss in the garlic and rosemary, saute for a minute until fragrant. Add the mushrooms, cook and stir until they&#39;ve released their moisture and are nicely browned, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. Crumble goat cheese evenly on the crust, scatter sauteed mushrooms all around, and top with shredded fontina. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp, and the cheese is bubbly. Before cutting the pizza into slices, grate pecorino over the whole damn thing! In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water; stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the mixer on low and add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium; stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough by squeezing a small amount together: if it&#39;s crumbly, add more water; if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour - 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix until the dough gathers into a ball, this should take about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times; kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a round and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it over to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e. over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. This is a good time to stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees F. Once the dough is domed and spongy, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter. Roll and stretch the dough into a cylinder and divide into 3 equal pieces. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes so it will be easier to roll out. Roll or pat out a piece of dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Dust a pizza paddle with flour and slide it under the pizza dough. Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and top with your favorite flavors. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp. Repeat with the remaining dough. Yield: 3 pizza crusts &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 26900,&quot;Chocolate Toffee Popcorn 4 teaspoons vegetable oil 6 tablespoons popcorn kernels 1 cup coarsely chopped pecans 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for the pans 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped Instructions: In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add the popcorn kernels and cover the pot. Once the popcorn starts to pop, reduce the heat to medium. Hold the lid on the pot and shake the pot until the popping stops. Transfer the popped popcorn to a large bowl and discard any unpopped kernels. Add the pecans. Butter two large rimmed baking sheets. In a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot with a candy thermometer attached, heat the butter, sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons water over medium heat, swirling the pot occasionally, until the butter has melted. Cook the mixture until the candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F. Then remove the pot from the heat and quickly stir in the vanilla. Be careful; it will spatter a bit. Stir in the baking soda.<br> Carefully pour the mixture over the popcorn, and immediately stir the popcorn well to coat it in the warm toffee. Spread the coated popcorn out on the prepared baking sheets, and sprinkle with salt. Let the popcorn stand until it is completely cool.<br> Transfer the chocolate to a double boiler or large heat-proof bowl set over a pot of barely simmering water. Melt the chocolate, stirring it occasionally. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment.<br> Carefully drop a few pieces of popcorn into the melted chocolate and flip it around with two forks. Lift the coated popcorn out, tap it against the side of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate, and transfer it to the parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with half of the remaining popcorn. Transfer the chocolate-dipped popcorn to the fridge until set, about 20 minutes. Extra chocolate can be cooled, wrapped in plastic, and used again.<br> When the chocolate popcorn has set, toss it with the plain toffee popcorn in a large bowl, and serve. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 26901,&quot;Korean Fried Chicken with Soy-Garlic Glaze 3 pounds chicken drumsticks or split wings (tips removed) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup plus 1/3 cup cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for frying (about 10 cups) 4 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons grated peeled fresh ginger 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons honey 2 teaspoons rice vinegar 1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean red cl flakes) or Asian chili sauce 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup vodka Toasted sesame seeds, for sprinkling Instructions: Toss the chicken with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Whisk 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/4 teaspoon baking powder in a medium bowl. Coat the chicken in the cornstarch mixture, shaking off any excess. Transfer to a rack set on a baking sheet and let sit, uncovered, to set the coating, 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until just softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, rice vinegar, gochujang and sesame oil; bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Set the sauce aside. Fill a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot with 2 to 3 inches of vegetable oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Whisk the flour, remaining 1/3 cup cornstarch and 1/4 teaspoon baking powder and 2 pinches of salt in a medium bowl. Add the vodka and 1/3 cup cold water and whisk until the batter is smooth and very thin (about the consistency of half-and-half). If needed, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin the batter. One at a time, dip about half the chicken pieces in the batter, letting any excess drip off. Then, using tongs, hold the chicken halfway in the hot oil for 1 to 2 seconds before letting go completely (this will prevent the chicken from sticking to the bottom of the pot). If any pieces stick together, gently separate them with the tongs. The oil temperature will drop; adjust the heat as necessary to maintain a temperature between 300 degrees F and 325 degrees F. Fry the chicken until the coating is crisp but not browned, about 6 minutes. Remove to a rack set on a baking sheet to drain. (The chicken will not be fully cooked at this stage.) Let the oil temperature return to 350 degrees F before frying the remaining chicken. Double-fry the chicken: Increase the oil temperature to 375 degrees F. Working in two batches, fry the chicken again until the coating is browned and very crisp, 4 to 6 minutes for wings and 6 to 8 minutes for drumsticks. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain a temperature of 350 degrees F. Remove with tongs and transfer to a clean rack set on a baking sheet; brush all over with the sauce. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26902,&quot;Fiesta Guacamole 1 container (8 ounces) sour cream 1 packet (1 ounce) Hidden Valley?

Place sausages in a cast iron skillet, add 1/2-inch of water and a drizzle of oil. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium and let the sausages heat through as the water evaporates. Shake pan and let the casings crisp up until they burst, 3 to 4 minutes, and are golden brown. Remove from the heat and set aside. While sausages and potatoes cook, cut cabbage half into half again and trim away the core with an angled cut. Shred the cabbage very thinly with your knife and reserve. Place the shredder blade in your food processor. Peel the carrots and trim the root end. Trim the celery, and peel and quarter the red onion lengthwise. Peel the apple and quarter lengthwise then cut away the core as you did the cabbage. Using the processor, shred the carrots, celery, onion and apple, through the feed tube, removing from bowl as necessary. In a large skillet heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add cabbage and vegetable mixture and toss to combine. Season the mixture with bay leaf, grill seasoning or coarse salt and pepper, and caraway seeds. Saute 7 to 8 minutes, tossing frequently.

Heat the vegetable oil in a tall sided skillet to 350 degrees F. Add the tortilla strips and fry until they are golden brown. Remove to a paper towel lined plate and season with 1 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of chili powder. Combine the sour cream, 2 tablespoons tequila, and the remaining lime zest in a small bowl and season with salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper. To serve, put some of the shredded chicken in the bottom of each bowl and pour in the hot soup base. Top with diced avocado, fried tortilla strips, the tequila crema, and cilantro.

Find a heatproof mixing bowl that will fit over the top of the pan, but not sink it all the way in. (Do-it-yourself double boiler!) Put the egg yolks in the mixing bowl. Add the granulated sugar and whisk until the yolks start to turn pale. Place the mixing bowl on top of the saucepan with the simmering water. Slowly add the bourbon and whisk to combine. Cook over the simmering water, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl, until thick, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool, 20 to 25 minutes. Place the mascarpone cheese and pumpkin puree in a bowl and stir until smooth. Combine the whipping cream, brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon in a separate mixing bowl and whip until not quite stiff. Add the mascarpone and pumpkin mixture to the whipped cream mixture, followed by the chilled egg mixture. Fold gently until mixed well. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. For the pumpkin pie espresso syrup: Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove the pan from the heat and slowly add the instant espresso, then stir until dissolved. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and stir until the sugar has dissolved completely, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside. To assemble: Arrange the ladyfingers in a single layer in a 9-by-13-inch pan, breaking as necessary to fit. Spoon 2 teaspoons of the espresso syrup over each ladyfinger. Plop a third of the chilled mascarpone/pumpkin mixture on top and spread it into a thin layer. Grate over a thin layer of chocolate and sprinkle over 1/2 cup of the crushed gingersnaps. Repeat the process 2 more times, finishing with the crushed gingersnaps. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours or up to overnight before serving. This will allow for more moisture to soften the cookies and for the whole mixture to meld together. The tiramisu is best consumed within 24 to 36 hours after assembling, as the components will begin to break down and become soupy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 26928,&quot;PB and J Bread Crust Pudding 4 cups whole milk 6 large eggs, at room temperature 1 cup creamy peanut butter 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup of your favorite jelly, jam, or preserves 8 cups coarsely chopped bread crust, from 1 (20-ounce) loaf white bread (or the same amount of day-old bread) Unsalted butter, for greasing pan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Pulse until it resembles coarse sand. Add the egg yolk and a tablespoon of water. Pulse until the mixture forms a crumbly dough, but holds its shape when pinched. (If too crumbly, add a little bit more water.) Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface. Knead very lightly until the dough comes together. Pat into a disc, then roll into a 1/4-inch-thick circle, turning the dough regularly and flouring as needed to ensure it doesn&#39;t stick. Spray six 4-inch ring molds with the nonstick spray. Cut out 4 dough rounds slightly larger than 4 inches, then transfer a piece of dough to the center of each ring mold, bringing it up the edges to make a rustic tart crust. Slide a spatula underneath to transfer to a half-sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Place in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brown the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, cooking until it is light brown in color and smells nutty. Transfer the browned butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the granulated sugar and vanilla extract. Turn on the mixer and gradually add the flour. Add 3 eggs, one at a time. Scrape down the sides and mix to combine. Remove the dough from the fridge. Fill the tarts evenly with the filling and top with the grapes. Make an egg wash by beating the remaining egg in a bowl with a bit of water and brush the crusts. Sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20 minutes.

Soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator. Drain the soaked beans, place them in a large pot and cover with fresh cold water. Put the beans over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Toss in the bay leaves and garlic. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 11/2 hours until tender. Drain the cooked beans and spread them out on a sheet pan to cool slightly. Put about 1/2 cup of flour in a shallow platter and season it with salt and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly. Toss the beans in the seasoned flour to coat completely. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and coat with the oil. When the oil is hot, add the pancetta, fry for a couple of minutes to crisp it up. Toss in the sage leaves and fry for about 1 minute. Remove the pancetta and sage to some paper towels; now you have a flavor base. Shake off excess flour from the beans and put them in the pan in a single layer. Fry the beans for a good 10 minutes to form a golden crust on the outside of the beans, tossing to cook both sides. Return the pancetta and fried sage to the pan, stir everything together, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 26966,&quot;Peppermint Mocha Cheesecake 2 cups ground chocolate-mint sandwich cookies (such as Oreos Mint N&#39; Cream) 3 pkgs.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. When the pan is hot, cook the tortillas until toasted and the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, removing each to a plate. If your skillet is large enough, feel free to cook 2 at once. Working 1 at a time, remove a quesadilla to a cutting board. Using kitchen shears or a pizza cutter, trim the folded side so its curve matches the open side of the tortilla. Put the quesadilla on a plate and lay the cut pieces on the end to make a fish tail. Arrange 4 to 5 avocado slices below the quesadilla to look like waves. Use a slice of black olive to make a fish eye and a matchstick carrot for the mouth. Place a rounded tablespoon of cream cheese on the top left part of the plate and insert carrots into it, making an \\anemone\\ to go with your fish. Place a rounded tablespoon of pimento cheese on the top right part of the plate and put a few goldfish around it, with a few nose-down in the \\fish food.<br> Combine all of the ingredients in a small glass jar with an airtight lid and shake to blend. Store in a cool, dry place for up to 2 weeks. Season chicken with the adobo seasoning. Heat a grill pan to medium heat and spray with nonstick cooking spray or drizzle with oil. Place the chicken on the grill pan and cook for 3 to 5 minutes on each side depending on the size of the breasts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 26972,&quot;Striped Bass with Oyster Stew 6 (6-ounce) wild striped bass or rockfish fillets, skin on and scaled Salt and pepper, to taste Peanut oil, for sauteing 1 pint shucked oysters 2 ounces country ham, sliced thin and cut into 1/4-inch dice 2 tablespoons peanut oil 1/2 cup onion, cut into small dice 1/4 cup red bell pepper, seeded and cut into small dice 1/4 cup celery, cut into small dice 2 tablespoons garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 bay leaf 1/4 cup bourbon 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/2 cup white wine 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 2 tablespoons heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon chopped sage Salt, pepper and lemon juice, to taste 1/2 cup scallions, sliced crosswise, using white and green parts Instructions: PREPARATION FOR THE STEW: Strain the oysters and reserve the oyster liquor; refrigerate the oysters until ready to use for final assembly. In a medium saucepan, cook the ham in the peanut oil until lightly caramelized. Add the onion, red bell pepper, and celery and cook until caramelized. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, and bay leaf; cook 1 minute. Add the bourbon, lemon juice, wine, and reserved oyster liquor. Cook until greatly reduced and nearly syrupy, stirring frequently. Add the chicken stock and simmer over medium heat, skimming as necessary, until reduced by 1/2. Cool and reserve until preparing the bass. Remove the bay leaf. ASSEMBLY: Remove the bass from refrigeration and dry thoroughly with paper towels. With a sharp knife, score an X in the skin side to prevent it from curling when the fish is cooking. Season the flesh side with salt and pepper; rub the skin side with some of the softened butter. If serving with tomato gumbo, heat the gumbo and stir in the cooked rice as indicated in the last step of the recipe. Keep warm. Return the stew to a low heat and add the heavy cream; bring to a slow simmer. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add a film of peanut oil, then carefully lay the fillets in the pan, skin-side down. Reduce the heat to medium and press firmly on the fillets with the back of a metal spatula to flatten slightly and aid in the searing; cook 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. When the edges of the fillets begin to show doneness, turn carefully and cook 1 minute longer. Remove the fillets and keep warm. Raise the heat on the stew to medium-high, stir in the oysters and butter, and cook just until the oysters are plumped and beginning to curl. Remove from the heat, stir in the sage, and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste. Warm 6 wide, shallow bowls. Place a fillet in each bowl. Spoon the stew around the fillets, dividing the oysters equally between the bowls. Sprinkle liberally with scallions and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 26973,&quot;Quick and Creamy Eggless Caesar Dressing 5 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 large cloves garlic, peeled 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 ounce can anchovy fillets, drained 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: In the bowl of a food processor combine the mustard, Worcestershire, garlic, vinegar, lemon juice and anchovy fillets.

Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Let cool completely in the skillet. The pineapple filling can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment and coat lightly with nonstick spray. For the macaroons: Whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until frothy. Toss the coconut, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon salt together with your hands in another large bowl. Add the coconut mixture to the egg whites and combine with your hands; the mixture should pack together tightly when squeezed. Divide the mixture into 24 slightly heaping tablespoons and roll each into a smooth ball (slightly wet hands can help with rolling). Hold a ball in the palm of your hand and use your thumb to make a slight indentation in the middle. Reshape the edges of the macaroon back into a round if it cracks. Arrange about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, rotating the tray as needed for even browning, 20 to 24 minutes. Let cool completely on the tray. Set up a cooling rack over a baking sheet. Combine the chocolate and butter in a small bowl and microwave for 30 seconds; stir. Repeat until all of the chocolate is melted and smooth. Dip the bottom of each macaroon into the chocolate and press into the chocolate about halfway up the macaroon. Use a fork to help lift it out of the chocolate. Transfer to the cooling rack and allow to sit at room temperature until the chocolate hardens and sets up, about 20 minutes. Fill each macaroon with about 1 teaspoon of the pineapple filling. Store and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 26990,&quot;Crab Salad with Mango and Mint 7 ounces fresh crab meat 1 ripe mango 4 pink radishs. sliced 1 sprig mint, leaves cut fine julienne 1 lemon, juiced 2 ounces olive oil Salt and pepper 1 pint mesclun Instructions: Clean the crab meat to remove all the remaining shells.

Instructions: For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the butter, powdered sugar and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer equipped with a paddle attachment (the one that looks like a peace sign). Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla together until creamy and homogeneous, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, fold in the flour and salt. Try to do this briskly without mixing the batter too much-mix until the flour is just combined. Working in batches, transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe the dough onto an ungreased baking sheet in 2-inch circles. Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden. Let them cool completely. For the Caramel Dipper: In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, lemon juice and 1/4 cup water. Bring the pot to a boil (BTB). Be careful not to swish the pan around too much at this point because it can cause the sugar to recrystallize. As the sugar mixture boils, the water will evaporate and the sugar will begin to turn brown, or caramelize. Be patient, this will take some time, 12 to 15 minutes. DO NOT take your eyes off the sugar! The sauce can go from golden to ruined very quickly. Relax and enjoy it-you&#39;re living on the edge and that&#39;s exciting! Gradually the sugar will begin to turn gold, then light brown and then one shade past light brown-this is when you want to remove the pan from the heat and immediately add the heavy cream. As you do this, the mixture will bubble up like crazy. Whisk the cream until things settle down, then add the butter, two pats at a time. Be sure the butter is completely incorporated before adding more. Once all the butter has been added, let the caramel cool. To serve, put 4 or 5 cookies on each plate with a little dipping dish of about 1/4 cup of the sauce. Sprinkle the sauce with a few grains of rock salt. Try not to eat them all at once! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 27010,&quot;Lamb Soup with Curried Cucumber Salad 4 lamb racks from above 1 quart chicken stock or vegetable stock 1 cup diced carrots 1 cup diced celery 1 cup diced onions 1 bay leaf Salt and black pepper to taste 1 cup cucumber julienned 1/2 cup plain yogurt 1 tablespoon madras curry powder Salt and black pepper to taste Instructions: In a saucepan, saute carrots, celery and onions until soft.

Place the Alfredo mix, the powdered milk and the water in a saucepan and mix until blended. Over medium heat, stir constantly while bringing mixture to a boil. While tortellini and Alfredo sauce are cooking, pour hot water over the sun-dried tomatoes and rehydrate them until soft (about the same time as the tortellini takes to cook). When cooked, drain tortellini and add to Alfredo sauce. Add sun-dried tomatoes and prosciutto, toss and sprinkle with Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 27014,&quot;Fettuccine all&#39;Alfredo con Prosciutto di Parma 1 (12 ounce) package egg fettuccine 1/3 pound prosciutto di Parma 2 tablespoons butter 1 to 1 1/4 cups half-and-half 1 cup (3 healthy handfuls) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 2 pinches ground nutmeg or about 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Coarse ground black pepper A pinch coarse salt Instructions: Bring salted water to a rolling boil for the pasta and cook to package directions for al dente pasta.

Mangia! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 27015,&quot;Salt-Baked Spatchcock Chicken with Ginger Scallion Sauce One 3-pound box coarse kosher salt 1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon sand ginger powder (aka ground galangal; available at Chinese markets and online) 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper One 3-pound whole chicken, spatchcocked, large pieces of fat trimmed and reserved (see Cook\\u2019s Note) 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine Two 2-inch pieces fresh ginger, scrubbed, 1 sliced into 1/2-inch-thick coins and 1 finely grated 4 large scallions, 2 cut into 2-inch lengths and 2 minced Two 3-foot-long pieces kitchen twine 1/4 teaspoon sugar Up to 1/2 cup store-bought rendered chicken fat (or neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola) Instructions: Measure out 1 tablespoon salt from the box into a small bowl; add the 1 tablespoon sand ginger powder and the white pepper and mix well until combined. Measure out 1/4 teaspoon salt from the box into a medium heatproof bowl. Set both bowls aside. Pat the chicken dry all over with paper towels then transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Brush both sides of the chicken with the Shaoxing wine; evenly sprinkle both sides with the sand ginger mixture and rub in. Let sit, skin-side up, in a cool place away from direct sunlight for 1 hour. During the last 30 minutes of the hour, pour the remaining salt from the box into a Dutch oven. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the temperature of the salt reaches 450 to 500 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. It\\u2019s okay if the salt darkens slightly. Lower the heat to low. Prepare two 2 1/2-foot-long sheets of parchment paper on a work surface. Add the ginger slices and scallion segments in an even layer to one of the sheets; place the chicken on top with the legs pointing toward a short side of the parchment. Fold the long sides of the parchment over the chicken, followed by the short sides to fully wrap the bird. Feel free to roll the short sides for a tighter seal. Slide the twine under the parchment and tie up the package like a gift, crossing the ends across the middle lengthwise and crosswise. Repeat wrapping and tying the chicken with the second sheet of parchment and second piece of twine. Carefully transfer half of the hot salt from the Dutch oven into another medium heatproof bowl and set aside. Level the remaining salt in the Dutch oven with a wooden spoon to create an even layer at least 1/4 inch deep. Nestle in the wrapped chicken, breast-side up. Pour the reserved hot salt directly on top. Cook, covered, over medium-high heat for 50 minutes. Remove the Dutch oven from the heat and let sit, covered, for 30 minutes. The residual heat will continue to cook the chicken. Meanwhile, add the sugar, grated ginger, minced scallions and remaining 1/4 teaspoon sand ginger powder to the reserved 1/4 teaspoon salt; mix until well combined then set aside. Add any reserved fat from the chicken to a small saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until the fat is rendered and any solids are dark brown and crispy, 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the amount of chicken fat). If rendering the fat does not yield 1/2 cup of liquid, make up the difference with the store-bought rendered fat or neutral oil and heat until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of the hot fat at a time to the ginger scallion mixture; if it bubbles up, let it settle for about 15 seconds after each addition. Stir until everything is combined. Set aside until ready to serve. When the 30 minutes are up for the chicken, remove the lid and brush off as much salt as possible with a wooden spoon. Carefully transfer the parchment package to a large cutting board or rimmed baking sheet. Cut the twine and unwrap the chicken. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken should reach 165 degrees F and the juices should run clear. Allow it to rest, unwrapped, for 15 minutes. To carve the chicken, remove the legs and cut each into drumsticks and thighs. Carve out the wings then remove each breast and slice it to your desired thickness. Arrange the chicken on a serving platter. Feel free to pour any accumulated juices over the chicken or serve on the side in a bowl. Serve with the ginger scallion sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 27016,&quot;Pumpkin Nut Cake With Maple Glaze 3 cups cake flour 1 Tbsp. baking powder 1 tsp. baking soda 1/2 tsp. salt 3/4 cup STAR Extra Light Olive Oil 3 eggs 1 (30-oz) can pre-sweetened pumpkin pie mix 1/2 cup, plus 4-5 tsps. light evaporated milk 1 cup chopped walnuts 1 cup powdered sugar 1/2 tsp. maple flavoring 6-12 walnut halves Instructions: Cake: Combine flour, baking powder, soda and salt in bowl and toss with fork to blend thoroughly.

Fold the remaining dough over the filling until the edges line up and pinch the edges together to seal. Gently roll the pinched edges under to form a decorative rim. Place the calzone on a baking sheet dusted with cornmeal and brush the top with olive oil. Bake until golden brown and the center is hot and melted, 25 minutes, rotating midway through cooking. Basic Pizza Dough: 1 package active dry yeast 3/4 cup warm water, about 110 degrees F 1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for kneading 1 teaspoon salt In a small mixing bowl, whisk together yeast, warm water, sugar and olive oil. Let sit for about 3 minutes to fully dissolve and activate the yeast. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour and salt. With a rubber spatula, gradually mix the yeast mixture into the flour until just combined and dough barely holds together. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter surface dusted with flour. Knead the dough with flour-dusted hands until the dough has become smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. The surface should be tight and silky and bounce back slightly when pressed. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough in it. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Once doubled, punch the dough down and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Knead each 1 slightly to form a uniform ball. Set aside and cover them with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap to rest for 30 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: Dough can be made the day before and refrigerated overnight once it is divided. Keep covered tightly in plastic wrap or in a sealed food storage bag.

Let sit until the yeast appears foamy, about 15 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, the salt and ajwain and stir with a fork until it comes together in a shaggy ball. Knead it a few times in the bowl to incorporate the flour on the sides of the bowl, and then turn it out onto a work surface. Continue to knead the dough for a few minutes, adding the 2 tablespoons flour if it seems wet and sticky. Do not add a lot of extra flour here as the dough should be very soft and pliable. Pour a little olive oil into a clean bowl and smear it around the edges. Rub it over the surface of the dough and then place the dough in the bowl. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. For the pizza: Put the olive oil into a large skillet and add the onions, garlic and ginger. Saute until golden and soft, and then add the garam masala, turmeric, smoked paprika and salt and pepper. Add the spinach and stir until completely wilted. Let cool slightly, and then add to a food processor and puree until smooth. When the dough is ready, pick it up and begin to stretch and pull it into a circle. Press it onto a pizza pan, stretching the dough to the edges. Spread the spinach mixture evenly over the entire pizza. Sprinkle the cilantro and green onions over it, and then add the tomato halves. Cover with the shredded cheese. Place the pizza on the bottom rack of the oven and bake until the crust is golden and crispy and the cheese is bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.

When the skillet is hot, use a pair of metal tongs to arrange the sausages in a single layer. (There is no need for oil as the sausages will soon start to render their grease.) Turn the heat to medium and brown the sausages on all sides, taking care that they are cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes total. Remove the sausages to a medium bowl. Pour off the grease and add the wine, simmering over medium heat to reduce to about 1/4 cup liquid, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the reduced wine over the sausages and wipe the skillet clean. Cook the pork chops: Add the canola oil to the same skillet. Sprinkle the pork chops on all sides with salt. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, add the pork chops in a single layer and brown on all sides over medium heat, 5 to 8 minutes total. Remove the pork chops to the bowl with the sausages. Leave the grease in the skillet. Make the sauce: Stir the onions and garlic into the same skillet and cook over medium-low heat until translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with salt. Stir in the canned and cherry tomatoes with 1/2 cup water and simmer gently until the sauce is somewhat thick and tasty, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir the sausages and pork (and any meat juices) back into the sauce and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, then stir in the cheese, red wine vinegar and basil leaves. Taste for seasoning. Cook the pasta: Bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add a generous handful of salt and bring the water back to a boil. Taste the water. It should be salty like seawater. Add the pasta and stir with a large slotted spoon to ensure the pasta does not stick as it cooks. Cook until still quite firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain. Finish the dish: Spoon the meat over the pasta in individual bowls or serve in a large bowl, family style. You can also just leave the pot of meat and sauce and the pasta separate and let people serve themselves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 27062,&quot;Sausage Pancakes-on-Sticks 16 breakfast sausage links 3 cups pancake mix 1 cup yellow cornmeal Sprinkle of cinnamon 1 whole egg, slightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 3 cups water Canola oil, for frying Warm pancake syrup, for serving Instructions: Cook the breakfast sausage links in a cast-iron skillet, turning occasionally until done. In a large bowl, combine the pancake mix, cornmeal and cinnamon. Stir to combine. Add the eggs, vanilla and water, adding more water as needed for the batter to become slightly thick (but not overly gloopy.) Start out by adding 1 cup, then work your way up to 3 cups or more. Heat some canola oil in a large pot over medium-high heat to about 350 degrees F. Drop in a bit of batter to see if it&#39;s ready; the batter should immediately start to sizzle but should not immediately brown/burn. Insert chopsticks into the cooked breakfast sausages so that they&#39;re two-thirds of the way through. Dip the sausages into the batter and allow any excess to drip off for a couple of seconds. Carefully drop into the oil (stick and all) and use tongs or a spoon to make sure it doesn&#39;t hit the bottom of the pan and stick. Flip it here and there to ensure even browning, and remove it from the oil when the outside is deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.

Chill until the meat is very cold but not yet frozen. For the andouille blend: With a meat grinder, grind the chilled pork using the No. 2 dial. Transfer to a mixing bowl with the smoked paprika, sweet paprika, garlic, chili powder, salt, cumin, black pepper, crushed red pepper and cayenne. Mix well, then place in fridge to firm up. For the vegetables: Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, celery, onions and a pinch of salt. Saute until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant but not yet browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Meanwhile, preheat the oven (or a grill) to 350 degrees F. For the brisket meatloaf blend: Grind the chilled brisket and sirloin using the No. 2 dial. Add to a large mixing bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Add the breadcrumbs and let soak. Add the breadcrumb mixture to the bowl with the brisket and sirloin. Add the cooled sauteed vegetables and the ketchup, 2 tablespoons BBQ sauce, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Mix thoroughly, being careful not to overwork. Place a large sheet of foil (at least 24 inches) on a cutting board. Place the meatloaf blend on the foil and press into a roughly 8-by-12-by-1-inch rectangle. With your hands, roll the andouille blend into a cylinder the width (lengthwise) of the meatloaf. Place the cylinder on the meatloaf rectangle and form so the ends are flush with the sides of the rectangle. Starting from one of the long edges, roll the meatloaf over the andouille to encase it completely; press firmly to seal. Roll up the foil and seal by twisting the ends. Transfer the meatloaf to a baking sheet. Bake on the center oven rack for 1 hour. Peel back the foil, spoon the 1/4 cup BBQ sauce over the top of the meatloaf, and return to the oven, uncovered. Cook for another 30 minutes so the meatloaf gets a nice crust and turns brown on the outside. To serve, slice into thick medallions and serve with extra BBQ sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 27125,&quot;Bronzed Red Snapper with Lime Chipotle Cream Sauce 1 egg 1 1/2 ounces heavy cream<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon granulated garlic<br> 1 teaspoon ground white pepper<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1 ounce dry ranch dressing mix<br> 1/4 cup Cajun-style blackfish seasoning 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup yellow corn flour One 8-ounce fillet red snapper or similar fish, skin and bones removed 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/4 cup diced green onion, for garnish. 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose white flour<br> 1 teaspoon minced shallots<br> 1 teaspoon minced garlic<br> 1/2 cup white wine<br> 1 tablespoon diced chipotles in adobo sauce, plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice<br> 2 cups heavy cream<br> 1/2 ounce chicken base or stock<br> 1/2 ounce hot sauce<br> Salt and pepper Instructions: For the crepe batter: Whisk together the egg and cream in a small bowl and set aside.

Lower heat to medium. Cook 5 minutes until all liquid is evaporated. Remove mix from stove. Add herbs and cool. Season with salt and pepper. To Assemble: Defrost phyllo in refrigerator overnight. Lay one sheet of pyhllo out on a clean surface and brush lightly with olive oil. Cover the first sheet with a second sheet of phyllo and brush again with olive oil. Repeat one more time so you have a total of 3 sheets of phyllo (this will line 2 molds). Using a sharp paring knife, cut the phyllo down the center so you have 2 equal sheets. Cut each sheet in 2 equal parts again so you have 4 equal sheets. Repeat one more time so you have 8 equal strips, each approximately 1-inch wide. Using a 3-ounce souffle dish as a mold, lay one strip of phyllo over the mold and press it down to line the mold. Leave excess phyllo hanging over on each side of the mold. Lay a second strip of phyllo across the mold, slightly overlapping the first, and press it down as before. Repeat this procedure until you have a total of 4 strips completely lining the mold with phyllo. Spoon the horta and onion filling into the mold, gently packing down to fill the mold 3/4 full. Enclose the filling in the phyllo by folding the overhanging strips into the center of the mold (cover one at a time). Trim any excess phyllo. Make small slits in the phyllo and brush with olive oil.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lemon juice to the boiling water and cook the pasta according to the package directions for al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain the pasta and return it to the pot; set aside. Pierce the eggplant a few times with a fork or knife. Place on the grill, cover and cook, turning every 8 to 10 minutes, until completely charred all over and the flesh is soft when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool slightly for 10 minutes. While the eggplant cooks, prepare 2 sheets of foil, each 12-by-12-inches, and stack them together. Place the tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in the center of the foil. Fold over 2 opposite sides of the foil then fold in the remaining sides to create a tight seal. When 15 minutes of cooking time remain for the eggplant, add the foil pack to the grill and cook until juices start to bubble out of the top (this means the tomatoes and garlic are sufficiently cooked without having to open the pack), 13 to 15 minutes. Remove the eggplant to a cutting board (keeping any juices that accumulated in the bowl) and squeeze gently to crack the skin and expose the flesh. Use a spoon to remove the flesh, transfer to the large bowl and mash lightly with the spoon or a potato masher (you should have about 1 cup of flesh); discard the skin. Stir in the ricotta and Pecorino Romano until smooth then pour into the pot with the pasta and mix until combined. Fold in the contents of the foil pack (including any juices that accumulated), the basil, parsley, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper; stir until combined, adding the reserved pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin out the sauce if needed. Serve with more basil, parsley, Pecorino Romano and crushed red pepper flakes if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 27166,&quot;Watermelon Jam 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar, depending on the sweetness of the watermelon 2 tablespoons instant pectin (see Cook\\u2019s Note) 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 12 ounces cubed seedless watermelon 2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Instructions: Stir together the sugar (starting with 1/3 cup if your melon is perfectly ripe and sweet and up to 1/2 cup if it isn&#39;t), pectin and salt in a medium bowl until combined.\\u202f Add the watermelon to a blender or food processor and blend or pulse to the desired consistency.

Whisk until salt and sugar are dissolved. Add the chicken to the bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight. If the brine does not fully cover the chicken, rotate the chicken halfway through the brining process. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl add half of the BBQ Rub and the butter. Mix until well combined. Refrigerate for a few minutes if the butter begins to melt after mixing. Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Use your fingers to gently release the skin from the flesh of the breasts and legs. Spread the butter mixture evenly under the skin and over the breast and legs. Pat the remaining BBQ rub mixture all over the bird. Transfer the chicken to a roasting pan fitted with a roasting rack and bake until golden and the juices run clear, basting frequently, for about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and raise the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Baste the chicken thoroughly with the drippings in pan, return to the oven, and let bake until the skin is brown and crispy, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before cutting. Carve the meat and arrange on a serving platter. Serve with Lemon and Walnut Waffles, if desired. Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. In a large bowl sift to combine the flour, baking powder, 2 tablespoons of the sugar and salt. In small bowl whisk the egg yolks until smooth, then add the milk, vegetable oil, lemon extract, and lemon zest. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour in the liquid ingredients and gently stir the batter, with a wooden spoon, until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. You can use a hand beater or a stand mixer on low speed, if desired. In a very clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until foamy. Add the remaining sugar and beat until soft peaks form. Gently fold the whites into the batter. Pour about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup batter into an oiled waffle iron, sprinkle with walnuts, then close the iron. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes, depending on waffle iron settings. Transfer to a serving platter and keep warm in a low oven. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm with maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 27171,&quot;Roasted Turkey Lasagna 2 cloves garlic, sliced 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil One 28-ounce can whole plum tomatoes, crushed by hand 1/4 cup tomato paste 1/2 cup loosely-packed fresh basil leaves Kosher salt 1/2 pound sweet Italian sausage, removed from the casings 2 cups whole milk ricotta cheese 1 cup loosely packed fresh parsley leaves, chopped 1 large egg 1 pound lasagna noodles (about 20) 3 cups leftover turkey meat, white and dark, chopped or shredded 2 cups shredded mozzarella 2/3 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat the garlic and 2 tablespoons of the oil together in a large skillet over medium heat until the garlic begins to brown around the edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. Fill the empty tomato can with 1 1/2 cups of water , swish it around and add it to the pan. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, 20 to 24 minutes. (You should have about 4 cups.) Allow the sauce to cool. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up with a slotted spoon into smaller pieces no more than 1 inch long. Cook until browned, about 7 minutes. Transfer the cooked sausage with the spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Add the lasagna noodles one at a time to the boiling water and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Stir very gently with a wooden spoon to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain into a colander and rinse under cold water until they are cool enough to handle; drape over the side of the colander. (This will also help to separate the sheets so they do not stick together.) Mix the ricotta, parsley and egg with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until well combined. Add the turkey and sausage and stir to combine. Set aside. Spoon a very scant layer of sauce, about 1/4 cup, into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and spread to coat the bottom. Line the bottom with one layer of lasagna noodles, slightly overlapping and cutting to fit if necessary. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then a third of the tomato sauce, followed by a third of the mozzarella and a third of the Parmesan. Cover with a third of the lasagna noodles, again arranged so they are overlapping slightly. Top with the other half of the ricotta mixture, then another third of the sauce. Add another third of the mozzarella and third of the Parmesan. Finish with the remaining lasagna sheets and top the lasagna with the remaining sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan. Cover with foil and bake until hot throughout and the cheese is melted, about 30 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until slightly golden brown, about 10 minutes more.

Roast at 400 degrees F until soft and caramelized golden. Take out and leave at room temperature. In a 350 degrees F degree oven, roast hazelnuts until lightly browned, for approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool. Reserve for later. Melt 4 ounces of butter in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add diced onions and cook over medium to high heat, stirring until uniformly caramelized. While the onions are cooking, bring the stock up to a simmer in a separate pot. It is always best to add hot stock to your risotto. Add the rice to the onions and stir. Coat all kernels well. Add the verjus and stir. Add 4 cups of hot stock and stir well. Turn the heat down to medium. When the rice has absorbed most of stock, begin adding 1/2 cup more at a time. Stir every minute or two until the stock is absorbed. Continue until about 7 cups total have been added to the rice. Taste and add more stock if not cooked through. When rice is just done and still very moist, turn off the heat and let rest for 2 minutes off the burner. Divide the remaining butter into three portions. Add one portion at a time into the risotto, beating with a wooden spoon until well incorporated. Add one-half wheel of the La Tur cheese and stir vigorously.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Unroll one of the pie crusts onto a cutting board. Using a 2 1/2-inch plain-edged round cutter, cut out 8 circles from the crust. Place the circles on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Discard the remaining dough. Unroll the second pie crust onto the cutting board. Using the same 2 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out 8 more circles. Then, use a 2-inch plain-edged round cutter and cut out 8 smaller circles from the larger circles on the board. Set aside the rings. Using a 1 1/2-inch Christmas tree cutter, cut out 8 small trees from the smaller full circles. You should now have eight 2 1/2-inch full circles, eight 2 1/2-inch rings and eight small Christmas trees of dough. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon of water. Use your finger or a brush to brush the edge of the 2 1/2-inch circles. This will help the rings adhere during baking. Lay the rings on top of the egg-washed circles. Working carefully, spoon 3 cherries into the center of each tart. Place a tiny tree on top of each tart over the cherries. The trunk of the tree should be touching the outer ring. Using your finger or a pastry brush, brush the pie-crust ring and tree with the egg wash. Bake the tarts until the dough is golden brown, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool completely. Create a bed of rosemary on a platter or cake stand and arrange the baked tarts on top of the rosemary.

Trim excess fat from the beef and cut it into about 3-inch cubes. Measure out all the dry spices (garlic powder, mustard powder, onion powder, salt, celery seed, ginger powder and pepper) and mix together in a large mixing bowl. Coat the beef cubes liberally in the spice mix. Bring a saute pan to medium heat and add the oil (a sufficient amount to shallow fry the beef). Fry the beef cubes, 2 or 3 pieces at a time, turning onto each side, until a deep golden brown. Place the browned beef in a deep casserole dish. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the leftover spice mix over the cooked beef (omit this step if all the spice mix was used to coat the beef before cooking). Roughly chop the garlic and onion and add to the casserole dish with the beef. Tie the thyme, bay leaves and rosemary together with kitchen string (or you can use one of the thyme sprigs to do this). Pour the red wine over the beef (enough to submerge all the beef, and reserving 1/3 cup for later). Wrap plastic film over the casserole dish and then wrap in aluminum foil and ensure a tight seal all around. Place the beef in the oven and cook until tender, about 3 hours. Remove the beef and roughly chop into about 1/2-inch cubes. Remove the fresh herbs and discard. Place the liquid from the casserole dish, including the onions and garlic, into a food processor and blend until smooth; this will become the gravy for the pies. Return the liquid to a saucepan and bring to a slow boil. Add the cornstarch to the water and whisk. Add to the boiling gravy, whisking while adding to avoid lumps forming. Add the reserved 1/3 cup red wine and cook the gravy, stirring regularly to avoid burning, for about 10 minutes. The gravy should be relatively thick in consistency. Add more cornstarch and water mixture if the gravy is not thick enough. Pour the gravy over the chopped beef to liberally coat the beef cubes; you may not need all the gravy you have made. Allow to cool. Meanwhile, for the pie dough: Add the flour and salt to an electric food mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix on slow speed so the flour doesn&#39;t spray out of the bowl, about 1 minute. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes and add several cubes at a time to the flour with the mixer on slow speed. Mix until pea-size crumbs have formed. Mix the water and vinegar together in a small bowl. Change the attachment to the dough hook on the mixer and mix on slow speed while pouring in the water and vinegar mixture. Continue mixing until a dough ball has formed on the hook, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the dough ball, wrap in plastic film and chill in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes. Remove the dough ball and sprinkle liberally with flour, as well as the work surface (countertop). Roll out the dough with a rolling pin until it is approximately 1/16-inch thick. Use a 10-inch ring cutter to cut out circles of dough. Take the dough circles and place into six to eight 4 1/2-to- 5-inch foil pie tins (at least 1-inch deep). Work the dough around to ensure it is neatly covering the pie tin and slightly overlaps the edges. For the cheesy potato top: Peel and cube the potatoes. Boil until soft, then drain the water and mash while adding the cubed butter. When at a smooth consistency, add the cheeses and mix thoroughly to incorporate. Add some cream if needed to ensure the mash is of a smooth consistency. Add salt to desired taste. Spoon the beef and gravy into the dough-lined pie tins. Using a large cooking spoon, spoon the mashed potato over the filled pies, scraping down against the rim of the foil pie tin to ensure a smooth surface of the potato topping. Place the pies onto a baking tray and place the oven on fan or convection setting (if available) and cook for 15 minutes. Turn the tray and continue cooking until the pastry is cooked all the way through, 10 to 15 minutes (gently lift the pie out of the foil pie tin to check that the bottom of the pastry is fully cooked). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot]&quot; 27223,&quot;Hemingway Daiquiri 6 dried bing cherries Maraschino liqueur White grapefruit, cut in half, divided 1 1/2 ounces simple syrup 1 1/2 ounces freshly squeezed lime juice 1/2 ounce aged rum 2 ounces white rum Instructions: Place the cherries in a small bowl and add enough maraschino liqueur to cover.

When hot, put a cast-iron skillet in the oven to preheat, about 5 minutes. Dry the chicken with paper towels. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper and garlic powder. Generously season the chicken inside and out with the salt mixture. Stuff the chicken cavity with the thyme, rosemary, garlic and onion. Slice the baguette on the bias into five 2-inch-thick slices. Spread some butter on one side of each slice. Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven and arrange the baguette slices buttered-side down in the center of the skillet. Place the chicken on the baguette slices, making sure all of the bread is covered by the chicken. Pour a1/4 cup of broth into the skillet. Roast the chicken for an hour, then add the remaining 1/4 cup of broth and turn the oven temperature down to 375 degrees F. Continue roasting until the chicken is golden brown, an instant-read thermometer reads 165 degrees F and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and tent with foil. Let rest for 10 minutes before carving. Remove the baguette slices from the skillet and reserve. For the pan sauce: While the chicken is resting, put the skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the wine and scrape with a wooden spoon to remove all the brown bits. Add the chicken stock and cook until the liquid is slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. If any juices from the chicken have collected on the cutting board, pour them into the skillet now. Add in the butter piece by piece, waiting for each to melt before stirring in the next piece. Stir in the rosemary and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. For serving: Carve the chicken and serve with the baguette slices, pan sauce, Dijon mustard and Bistro Salad. Combine the lettuce and herbs in a medium bowl. In a glass jar or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid, combine the olive oil, vinegar, shallots, mustard, salt and pepper. Shake to combine. Pour over the salad and toss.

Cook the bacon in a medium skillet set over medium heat until crispy, about 8 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Add the garlic and 2/3 cup of the oil to the skillet with the bacon drippings. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and slice the potato skins into very thin strips (the thinner you cut the strips, the crispier they will be). Toss the strips with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a small bowl. Spread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, stirring once, until golden and crispy, about 15 minutes. Cut the peeled potatoes into 1-inch chunks and put in a saucepan. Cover with cold water by about 2 inches and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly. Pass the potatoes through a ricer into a medium bowl or mash with a potato masher until smooth. Pour the oil and garlic mixture into the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Add the potatoes, vinegar, 1/3 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and pulse until just creamy and combined; do not overprocess or the potatoes will become gluey. Add up to 3 tablespoons more water if necessary so that the dip is soft and spreadable. Season with additional salt and pepper. Transfer the dip to a serving bowl and top with the sour cream. Crumble the bacon and sprinkle it over the dip. Top with the Cheddar, crispy potato skins and scallions. Serve warm or at room temperature with potato chips, red bell pepper strips and celery sticks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]&quot; 27239,&quot;Crunchy Sunflower-Butter, Bacon and Banana Pinwheels 1 teaspoon honey 1/4 cup freeze-dried banana slices, roughly chopped, plus 6 slices whole One 9-inch flour tortilla wrap 3 tablespoons sunflower butter 2 slices cooked bacon, chopped Instructions: Put the wrap on a work surface, and spread the sunflower butter to the edges.

Place all fruit, including the raisins, in a large bowl. Reserve. Wash the glutinous rice 4 times in room-temperature water and drain well. Place in a cake pan. Add 2 1/2 cups cold water to the rice. Place the cake pan in a steamer, cover, and steam for 30 to 40 minutes, until the rice is cooked. It will acquire a glaze and be translucent. Turn off the heat. Scoop out the rice, add to the bowl of fruit, and mix well to combine all ingredients thoroughly. Coat a steamproof bowl, 1 1/2-quart size, with 1 1/2 teaspoons of peanut oil, making certain the bowl in well coated. Coat the hands as well, so the glutinous rice may be handled. Pick up half of the rice-fruit mixture, coat it with the remainder of the peanut oil, and pack it into the bowl, pressing it to the sides. Place the red bean paste in the center of the rice mixture and spread it a bit. Place the remainder of rice on top and press down gently. Place the bowl in a steamer, cover, and steam for 45 minutes. Turn off the heat. Remove the bowl and allow to cool for about 5 minutes. Pass a blunt dinner knife around the edge of the rice to loosen it. Place a serving plate, inverted, on top of the bowl, and upend it. The cake should slip out easily. Its fruit-dotted texture will glisten. Use a large spoon to divide among individual bowls. Because of its texture, the steamed glutinous rice is virtually impossible to slice as one might a cake. Often a sugar syrup is poured over Eight-Treasure Glutinous Rice Cake when served. It is not at all necessary, because the various fruits, their sugars concentrated from drying, and the red bean paste are sufficiently sweet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 27246,&quot;Braised Pork Shanks with Mushroom Dumplings 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons cracked black pepper 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 3 pork shanks (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds each) 2 cups grapeseed oil 1 large onion, diced small 2 ribs celery, diced small 3 large carrots, chopped 4 cloves garlic, peeled 1 sprig fresh rosemary 2 sprigs fresh thyme 1 cup sherry wine 2 cups chicken broth 2 cups beef stock 1 1/4 cups self-rising flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives 1 (10.5-ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup 1 cup chicken stock Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Place 2 sheet trays in oven to warm. To make the curry butter: Combine ingredients in a food processor and pulse until smooth. To prepare the Salmon and Mussels: Begin by making a seasoning with fennel and coriander seed and salt and pepper. Pound spices in a mortar and pestle, or grind with a coffee grinder, until you have a rough powder. In a large mixing bowl combine couscous, cilantro, lemon zest and half the spice mix. Stir well to combine, drizzle with olive oil, then divide evenly among 4 large pieces of parchment (big enough to create a folded pocket for the salmon). Nestle into the couscous 1 frozen chicken stock cube for each portion. Top with the piece of salmon and then sprinkle with remaining spice mix. Squeeze lemon juice over the top of each piece of fish and couscous then set 4 mussels around the fish in each packet. Fold over the parchment to create a pocket and trim paper to make a heart shape. Crimp over the edges, working from one end to the other to secure the paper tightly then brush with olive oil so the paper doesn&#39;t burn. Carefully transfer the parchment pockets to the hot sheet trays (you will probably need to put 2 per tray) then bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. When done, the paper will puff up.

When all the ingredients are incorporated, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and quickly knead the dough into a disc. Do not work dough too much. Gently roll the dough out and fit it into a 9-inch pie pan. Trim the edges, or shape the edges as desired. Poke several holes in the bottom of the dough with a fork.<br> Put the peaches into the pie pan, and bake for about 12 to 18 minutes, depending on the color of the edges of the pie crust. When the edges are a beautiful brown, take the pie out of oven and cool.<br> Whipped topping:<br> Put all of the ingredients into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer, until a silky whipped cream is formed; this should take about 3 minutes or so.<br> When pie has cooled, use a spatula to spread the whipped topping over the surface of the pie. This pie is a picture perfect masterpiece that even Mom would be proud of. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27274,&quot;Romaine Hearts with Greek Dressing 4 small hearts romaine lettuce 12 rings thinly sliced red onion (about 1/4 medium onion) 20 kalamata olives 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Cut each of the romaine hearts in half, leaving the stem end intact so the leaves stay together.

In a food processor, pulse 2 tablespoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, the granulated garlic, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary and orange zest until uniform but still coarse, about 10 times. Rub the inside of the turkey with the salt mix, then carefully slip your fingers under the breast skin and rub a liberal amount under the skin. Flip the turkey on its side and sprinkle more of the salt mixture on the thigh, wing and leg. Repeat on the other side. Place the bird in a large zip-top bag or brining bag. (If neither is available, cover with plastic wrap.) Place the bird breast-side up on a wire rack on a sheet pan and then place in the fridge away from any raw food (on a lower shelf). Leave in the fridge for 2 days. The night before cooking, remove the turkey from the fridge and take it out of the plastic. The skin should be mostly dry and the salt should be dissolved; if any large patches of moisture are present, wipe with paper towels. Place back in the fridge, uncovered, for another 8 hours to dry out completely. On the day of, take the turkey out of the fridge 1 hour before cooking. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Fit a roasting pan with a wire V-rack. Put the turkey on the rack and brush with one-quarter of the melted butter. Roast 30 minutes. Turn the heat down to 325 and continue roasting, basting occasionally with the remaining melted butter, until a thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F, about another 2 hours.

Put the slices in tepid water, to cover, and soak for 30 minutes.<br> Fill a tall heavy-bottomed pot, like a stockpot, about a third full with the oil. (Don&#39;t over fill the pot with oil, since it bubbles up during frying.)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put all the cake ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder and soda, cocoa, butter, eggs, vanilla, and sour cream into a food processor and process until you have a smooth, thick batter. If you want to go the long way around, just mix the flour, sugar and leavening agents in a large bowl and beat in the soft butter until you have a combined and creamy mixture. Now whisk together the cocoa, sour cream, vanilla, and eggs and beat this into your bowl of mixture. Divide this batter, using a rubber spatula to help you scrape and spread, into the prepared tins and bake until a cake tester comes out clean, which should be about 35 minutes, but it is wise to start checking at 25 minutes. Also, it might make sense to switch the 2 cakes around in the oven halfway through cooking time. Remove the cakes, in their tins, to a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes before turning out of their tins. Don&#39;t worry about any cracks as they will easily be covered by the frosting later. To make this icing, melt the chocolate and butter in a good-sized bowl either in the microwave or suspended over a pan of simmering water. Go slowly either way: you don&#39;t want any burning or seizing. While the chocolate and butter is cooling a little, sieve the confectioners&#39; sugar into another bowl. Or, easier still, put the icing sugar into the food processor and blitz to remove lumps. Add the corn syrup to the cooled chocolate mixture, followed by the sour cream and vanilla and then when all this is combined whisk in the sieved confectioners&#39; sugar. Or just pour this mixture down the funnel of the food processor onto the powdered sugar, with the motor running. You may need to add a little boiling water, say a teaspoon or so, or indeed some more confectioners&#39; sugar, depending on whether you need the frosting to be thiner or thicker. It should be liquid enough to coat easily, but thick enough not to drip off. Choose your cake stand or plate and cut 4 strips of baking parchment to form a square and sit 1 of the cakes, uppermost (i.e. slightly domed) side down. Spoon about 1/3 of the frosting onto the center of the cake-half and spread with a knife or spatula until you cover the top of it evenly. Sit the other cake on top, normal way up, pressing gently to sandwich the 2 together. Spoon another 1/3 of the frosting onto the top of the cake and spread it in a swirly, textured way (though you can go for a smooth finish if you prefer, and have the patience). Spread the sides of the cake with icing and leave a few minutes until set, then carefully pull away the paper strips. I love to dot the top of this with sugar pansies, and you must admit, they do look enchanting, but there really is no need to make a shopping expedition out of it. Anything, or indeed nothing, will do. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 27291,&quot;Pretzel-Crusted Pickle Chips with Mustard Sauce 1 1/4-inch-thick slice red onion, finely diced 3 tablespoons spicy brown mustard 11/2 tablespoons yellow mustard 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 1/2 teaspoon paprika 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder Kosher salt Vegetable oil, for frying 6 large dill pickles, sliced diagonally into 1/4-inch-thick rounds 2 cups salted mini pretzels 2 large eggs 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Celery salt, for sprinkling (optional) Instructions: Make the sauce: Mix the onion, both mustards, the mayonnaise, paprika, garlic powder and salt to taste in a bowl. Set the sauce aside. Make the chips: Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Gently pat the pickle slices dry with a paper towel.

Just prior to each grain becoming tender, season with salt and pepper. When just fully cooked pour any excess water from each pot and spread grains out on a shallow baking pan and cool quickly. Season and steep couscous in an equal volume of cold water or even better a combination of orange juice and water. Allow to rehydrate then rub grains between your hands to fluff them.

Meanwhile reduce vegetable stock and wine by 2/3. Add cream and bring to boil, reduce slightly. Add cheese and melt to thicken. Season and add thyme. Season (you may not need any salt depending on the feta you are using, but freshly cracked pepper in the sauce is a must). Shape the hot grains in a timbale mold. Pour the sauce around. Accompany with a saute of asparagus spears (start with approximately 1 pound, trimmed and blanched) and mixed wild mushrooms (again, start with a scant pound, trimmed and cut into different shapes).

Brown the sausage, breaking it up into smaller pieces as it cooks, until no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the onions and turn the heat down to medium-low. Cook until the onions are fully softened, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a saucepan and keep warm on low heat. Add the rice to the onions and increase the heat to medium. Toast the rice, stirring often, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the white wine and reduce until almost dry. Reduce the heat to medium, then add 6 ounces of hot stock at a time, stirring the risotto throughout. When the liquid evaporates, add more stock. Continue in this manner until the rice is al dente, then cook out most of the liquid until thick. Turn off the heat and add the Parmesan, chives and butter. Spread the mixture on a sheet tray lined with parchment to cool completely in the refrigerator, 3 to 4 hours, or up to overnight. Roll the risotto into 1-ounce balls, to make about 35 in total. Preheat several inches vegetable oil in a pot or fryer to 350 degrees F. Roll the balls in the flour, followed by the egg, then the panko. Fry the arancini in batches until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the arancini to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Place the arancini on a platter and garnish with Pecorino-Romano and chives and serve with the spicy marinara and/or the Chimichurri, if desired. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Lightly dress the scallions with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill, flipping as needed, until charred and wilted, about 8 minutes. Chop the scallions really well and add to a bowl with the remaining olive oil. Fold in the sherry vinegar, chives, parsley, shallots and garlic. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 27297,&quot;Grilled Peaches 4 ripe medium peaches 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon almond extract 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 1 to 2 pints frozen vanilla yogurt Suggested toppings: toasted sliced almonds Instructions: Cut the peaches in half and remove the pit.

When they have a rich dark color, add tomato paste, mirepoix, bouquet garni and 2 1/3 quarts water, and cook for 1 hour. In another pan, saute the shallot in a little more olive oil until translucent. Remove from the heat and add the wine and port. Return to the heat and let the liquid reduce until it is almost evaporated. Be careful as the liquid may ignite. Then add the stock from the other saute pan to the wine reduction. Cook for another 40 minutes. Pass through the chinois. Add salt and pepper, to taste. This amount of sauce will serve 8 to 10 people. To prepare and present the fallow deer, salt and pepper the medallions. Saute in a little olive oil and cook over a medium high heat until rare to medium rare. Let rest. In another saute pan, put clarified butter and saute the apples with powdered sugar for 25 seconds until they are a golden color. Check the tenderness with a pairing knife.

Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook for a few minutes until the onions are softened slightly but not brown. Stir in the garlic, sugar and red pepper flakes. (If the onions begin to brown, add a splash of water.) Stir in the grated carrots and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and continue to cook until the carrots soften, about 2 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes and use a wooden spoon to break up some of the whole tomatoes. Cook over medium heat, stirring from time to time, until the tomatoes are fairly broken down and the sauce has thickened, at least 30 minutes. Season to taste and add water as necessary. Stir in the basil leaves. Keep the sauce warm. For the chicken: Lay a piece of chicken between two pieces of plastic wrap and use the smooth side of a meat mallet to pound into a 1/4-inch-thick cutlet. Repeat with remaining cutlet then slice both pieces in half. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. Combine the breadcrumbs and garlic powder in a shallow dish. Crack the eggs in a second shallow dish and whisk to blend. Sprinkle the chicken pieces on both sides with salt and dip each thoroughly in the eggs; transfer to the breadcrumbs to thoroughly coat. Place the chicken on the paper towels. For the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add a generous amount of salt. (The pasta water should taste like seawater.) Add the pasta to the pot and stir so it doesn&#39;t stick. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente (chewy but not hard or raw tasting). Drain well and set aside. To finish the chicken: Fill a medium cast-iron skillet with about 1/3 to 1/2 cup canola oil (to come about 1/4 of the way up the sides) and heat over medium until the oil is just barely starting to smoke. Sprinkle the top of each cutlet with salt and gently place in the oil, salted-side down. Add the butter to the pan and as it begins to foam, shake the pan gently. Cook on the first side until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Gently flip to the second side, sprinkle with salt and carefully spoon some of the hot oil mixture on top. Cook until golden brown and cooked through, an additional 2 to 3 minutes, then remove from the pan with a slotted spatula to clean paper towels to drain slightly. Preheat the broiler with the rack in the highest position. Divide the sauce between 2 medium bowls, one for the pasta and one for the chicken Parmesan. To assemble the chicken Parmesan, add some tomato sauce to a small cast-iron skillet or baking dish. Layer with a couple mozzarella slices and the basil. Put one of the fried chicken cutlets on top of the basil, followed by another spoonful of sauce, then a second layer of mozzarella. Place the second chicken cutlet next, followed by a third layer of sauce, more mozzarella and a large sprinkle of Parmesan. Repeat with the remaining pieces of chicken and other ingredients in a second small cast-iron skillet.

On a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, combine the garlic, sesame seeds, oregano, thyme, peppercorns, cloves, ginger, cumin and bay leaves. Bake until the sesame seeds are lightly browned (but not blackened) and the spices are lightly toasted and aromatic, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium heatproof bowl, cover the chiles with boiling water; let sit until softened, about 20 minutes. Transfer the spices, chiles (reserve the soaking water), beer, and vinegar to a blender and blend, adding a little of the soaking water as needed to form a smooth, thick paste. The adobo will keep, refrigerated, for up to 1 week. For the salsa: Raise the oven heat to 350 degrees F. Place the tomatoes and garlic on a baking sheet or in a roasting pan and roast for 30 minutes. Remove and let cool slightly. For the birria: A half day to a full day before you plan to serve, sprinkle the short ribs heavily with salt; let sit 30 minutes. Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the meat in a single layer, working in batches as needed to avoid crowding the pot; cook, turning occasionally, until some of the fat is rendered and the meat is golden brown on all sides, then remove to a platter. Marinate the meat in half of the birria adobo and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lay the banana leaf across the bottom of a pot or Dutch oven, then place the meat and marinade on top. Cut the onion half into four pieces and arrange the pieces over the meat along with the garlic, bay leaves and peppercorns. Add enough water to cover the meat by 1 inch. Fold the ends of the banana leaf over the meat to cover. Seal the pan with aluminum foil or a lid and transfer to the oven. Cook until very tender, about 3 hours. Drain the meat, reserving the braising liquid. (If not serving immediately, you can refrigerate the liquid and meat until ready to serve, up to 2 days.) For the salsa: Meanwhile, heat a medium skillet to medium heat and add the cascabel chiles; cook, turning occasionally, until the chiles turn bright red and charred in places, 1 to 2 minutes total. Transfer the chiles, roasted tomatoes and garlic, and the remaining half of the birria adobo to a blender, working in batches if needed, and blend until very smooth. In a large pot, combine the salsa with half of the braising liquid, or more as needed to achieve a rich but still runny consistency; bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let cook for 30 minutes. Cut the short ribs into large chunks (about 3 inches) and add the meat to the sauce; taste and adjust the salt as necessary. For serving: Serve the birria with warm tortillas, cilantro, onions and hot sauce, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 27323,&quot;Zuccotto Nonstick cooking spray 1 (12-ounce) loaf pound cake 1/4 cup brandy 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 2 cups chilled whipping cream 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract 1/4 cup powdered sugar 1/2 cup sliced almonds, toasted, coarsely crumbled Unsweetened cocoa powder Instructions: Spray a 1 1/2-quart bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Line the bowl with plastic wrap. Cut the pound cake crosswise into 1/3-inch-thick slices. Cut each slice diagonally in half, forming 2 triangles. Line the bottom and sides of the prepared bowl with the cake triangles. Brush some of the brandy over the cake triangles lining the bowl. Reserve the extra triangles. Stir the chocolate in a large metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until the chocolate melts. Allow the chocolate to cool slightly. Using an electric mixer, beat 1 cup of cream in another large bowl until it is thick and fluffy. Fold 1/4 of the whipped cream into the chocolate. Fold half of the remaining whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. Fold in the remaining whipped cream. Spread the chocolate cream over the cake, covering completely and creating a well in the center. Cover and refrigerate if not assembling cake right away. In another clean large bowl, add the remaining 1 cup of cream and almond extract. Using an electric mixer with clean beaters, beat on medium speed and gradually add the powdered sugar. Beat until firm peaks form. Fold in the nuts. Spoon the cream mixture into the center of the well of the filling.

Blend until smooth, adding more olive oil if necessary. Set aside. To build the sandwiches: Line up the sandwich bread on a baking sheet into 2 rows of 4. Spread 1 tablespoon pesto on each slice. On 4 of the slices, place 1 piece mozzarella in the middle of each, then 1 slice provolone. Finish building the sandwiches with the top pieces of bread, placing them on the cheese pesto-side facing down. Gently press down on each sandwich to lightly flatten. Cut each into a bunny shape with a 4-by-3-inch bunny-shaped cookie cutter. In a 9-inch square baking dish, vigorously whisk the eggs and milk until the yolks are fully incorporated into the whites to make a batter (you shouldn&#39;t see blotches of bright yellow yolks, rather a homogenous light yellow mixture). Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and whisk to combine. In a second 9-inch square baking dish, mix together the breadcrumbs, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and few cracks of black pepper. Heat a thin layer of neutral oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat (the oil should reach 1/4-inch up the side of the skillet). Line a baking sheet with a cooling rack. Meanwhile, carefully place the sandwiches, one at a time, into the egg batter: Coat a sandwich on all sides, allowing the excess egg to drip off before transferring to the breadcrumbs. Dredge the sandwich in the crumbs and transfer back to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining 3 sandwiches. Using a metal spatula, gently place each sandwich into the hot oil. Fry until the crust is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, then carefully flip the sandwich away from you to fry for another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the sandwiches to the cooling rack to drain of excess oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 27325,&quot;Sorrel Drink 5 to 6 (1-inch) slices ginger 1 cup dried sorrel leaves<br> 1 tablespoon cloves<br> Brown sugar<br> Red wine sherry, optional<br> Instructions: Let cut ginger sit for 2 to 3 hours.

Remove the seared turkey pieces to a large stovetop pressure cooker and set aside. Add another 2 tablespoons oil to the same large saute pan and add the celery, carrot and onion. Cook, over medium-high heat, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and saute for an additional few minutes. Add the Japanese curry powder and stir to combine. Deglaze the pan with 2 cups turkey stock and 1 cup water. Carefully pour the contents of the saute pan into the pressure cooker. Add the garlic, apple and ginger and toss to combine. Add the soy sauce, remaining 2 cups turkey stock and more water as needed to come halfway up the sides of the pressure cooker. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Seal the lid and bring to pressure, then cook for 45 minutes. Carefully release the pressure and remove the meat. Strain the cooked stock into a large measuring cup with a spout and set aside. Pick the meat from the leg and thigh and reserve. Melt the butter in the bottom of a Dutch oven and add the flour. Stir the roux base and cook for several minutes over medium-low heat until blonde in color. Whisk in the turkey stock, adding the liquid slowly to avoid lumps. Add the picked meat from the leg and thigh. Simmer to thicken the sauce and cook out the raw flour flavor, an additional 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. For the rice pilaf: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until hot, then add the onion and saute until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir to combine. Allow the rice to toast, about 3 minutes. Carefully pour in 2 cups water and season with salt. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce to simmer and cover with a lid. Allow to cook until the water has fully absorbed, about 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 10 minutes before fluffing with fork. For the charred cabbage: Preheat a charcoal grill over medium-high heat. Place the cabbage cut-side down on the grill and allow to sear until charred, about 5 minutes. Place the charred cabbage on a work surface until cool enough to handle. Tear the cabbage apart and add to a large bowl. Add the mustard greens, olive oil and vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Carefully toss to combine and gently wilt the mustard greens. Set aside until ready to plate. For the katsu: Place the breast between two large pieces of plastic wrap. Use a mallet to pound the breast flat to 1/4-inch-thick all over and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Fill three large casserole dishes: the first with the flour, the second with the beaten eggs and the third with the panko and nori powder. Stir to combine the panko and nori powder so that the nori is evenly distributed. Place the pounded breast in each dish to ensure even coating, starting with the flour, then eggs and ending with the breadcrumbs. Heat 2 inches canola oil over medium-high heat in the largest cast-iron skillet or paella pan you have until the oil begins to shimmer. Line a sheet tray with a wire rack. Fry the turkey breast until crisp and golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove to the wire rack. Once cool enough to handle, slice into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Line the bottom of a very large serving platter with the rice pilaf. Ladle a base of curry sauce over the rice, then top with the turkey katsu breast slices and finish with the charred cabbage salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 27327,&quot;Spanish Nibbles: Hot Olives with Citrus and Spice, Marcona Almonds, Paprika Toasted Chick Peas 4 cups mixed good quality olives 3 to 4 strips orange peel<br> 3 to 4 strips lemon peel 1 teaspoon crushed red chili pepper flakes<br> 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, 1/3 palm full 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 cups Marcona almonds* or toasted peeled whole almonds (See Cook&#39;s Note) 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained<br> 2 teaspoons smoked paprika Salt and pepper Instructions: Make a double layer pouch of foil for the olives.

No matter which you use, you need simple syrup. When using fruit, it is often necessary to slightly vary the amount of simple syrup to balance the sweetness. A refractometer is a piece of equipment used by wine makers to determine the amount of sugar in grapes. It is also used to measure the sugar content in sorbet. It works by measuring light as it is reflected off the sugar crystals contained in the sorbet mix. Most ice cream machines work in the same way. The cold source comes from the outside of the container. The ice cream machine blade continually scrapes the sides of the container where the mix has frozen and mixes the frozen particles throughout. The continuous motion of the blade keeps the ice crystals small. If properly spun, sorbet and ice cream should not be icy. The motion of the blade also traps air in the mix as it thickens and gains volume. The PACOJET?Y allows you to mix, freeze, and spin the exact number of portions needed. This is a versatile, although expensive, machine that makes great ice creams, sorbets, soups, mousses and purees. Make the simple syrup: Combine the sugar and water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. All the sugar crystals should completely dissolve. Remove from the heat and pour into a clean medium-size bowl. Let cool completely before using. Simple syrup can be stored in the refrigerator indefinitely if kept in an airtight container. The technique for the orange or pineapple sorbet is exactly the same. Use a refractometer to balance the sugar in the fruit juice. It may not be necessary to add very much simple syrup to the fruit juice if using commercially prepared fruit juice. It is often very sweet. The fruit juice and simple syrup combination should balance to a measure of 24 to 26 degrees Brix on the refractometer. Pour the fruit juice and syrup combination into the PACOJET?Y beaker and freeze until completely frozen. When frozen, remove from the freezer and place the beaker in the PACOJET?Y container. Insert and spin as many servings as you would like to make. The sorbet is ready to serve.

Using a sharp knife, cut parallel lines across the skin and fat, about a 1/2 inch apart, making sure not to cut down into the meat. Mix the salt, baking powder and pepper in a small bowl. Rub the pork all over with the salt mixture, making sure to get it into the grooves on the skin. Place the pork skin-side up on a rack in a roasting pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> About an hour before cooking the pork, allow it to come to room temperature.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Pour 4 cups of water into the roasting pan with the pork (this will prevent the drippings from burning). Cook until the meat is tender but not falling apart, about 3 hours.<br> For the cabbage: Meanwhile, add the cabbage, vinegar, jam, sugar and salt to a large high-sided skillet and mix to combine. Cover, place over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally to make sure the cabbage is not browning, until softened and no longer crisp, about 20 minutes. The cabbage will release some moisture, but if it starts to stick to the bottom of the skillet or seems dry, add water 1 tablespoon at a time to moisten. Keep warm.<br> For the potatoes: Put the potatoes in a medium pot, cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until the potatoes are tender but not too soft, about 15 minutes. Drain into a colander and set aside for about 10 minutes. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them with your hands or a paring knife.<br> Meanwhile, add the sugar to a large skillet and set over medium heat. Cook, without stirring, until the sugar is completely melted, about 3 minutes. When the edges start to turn brown, after about another 3 minutes, add the butter and kosher salt. Using a rubber spatula, stir carefully to combine. Continue to cook until the mixture is amber, about 5 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring gently to coat them with the browned sugar, until heated through, about 4 minutes. (Don&#39;t worry if the sugar hardens when you first add the potatoes; it will melt again.) Sprinkle with flaky sea salt before serving.<br> After the pork belly has cooked for 3 hours, increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F and continue to cook until the skin is crisp and brown, about 20 minutes more. Let rest for 15 minutes before slicing.

Spray the bottom and sides of two 8-inch round aluminum cake pans with nonstick cooking spray. In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, oil, 8 ounces water, buttermilk, vanilla, sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Whisk by hand until completely smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and whisk once more to ensure no lumps. Pour the cake batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake until the cakes are firm and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. For the meringue frosting: Mix the sugar with about 1 cup water in a medium saucepan. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, whip the egg whites in a stand mixer until they just reach medium peaks. Adjust to low speed and leave running. Continue cooking the sugar until it reaches the soft-boil stage--the bubbles on the surface will start to pop more often but the sugar should not change color and caramelize. Adjust the mixer to high speed and slowly pour the cooked sugar into the whipped egg whites. Gradually add the butter, whipping until smooth. (Makes 28 ounces.) For the ganache: Bring the cream to a simmer in a saucepan, and then stir in the chocolate and cayenne. (Makes 3/4 cup.) For the turtle filling: Combine the sugar in a large saucepot and mix with just enough water until it resembles wet sand. Bring to a boil and cook until the mixture begins to caramelize. Allow the sugar to cook until it reaches a dark brown color. As soon as it JUST starts to smoke, remove from the heat and immediately add the cream, CAREFUL, the mixture will boil and bubble and is very hot. Once all the cream is added, whisk the mixture and then add the butter, whisking until fully incorporated. Toast the pecans in a 425-degree oven for 10 minutes, and sprinkle with salt as soon as they come out. Mix the pecans into the caramel and let cool to room temperature. (Makes 1 pound.) To assemble the cake: Slice the cakes in half horizontally to make 4 even cake layers. Pipe a ring of frosting around the edge of one of the bottom layers and fill the center with turtle filling--the buttercream ring will prevent the turtle filling from oozing out the sides of the cake. Spread a thin layer of ganache on top of the turtle filling and repeat with the remaining cake layers. Frost the entire cake as desired with the frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 27400,&quot;A Potato Soup with Flaky Potato Knish 1/4 cup unsalted butter 1 small onion, coarsely chopped 1 medium leek, white part only, coarsely chopped 1 rib celery, coarsely chopped 1 sprig fresh thyme 4 cloves garlic, crushed with a chef&#39;s knife 1 slice apple-smoked bacon or other smoky bacon 1 bay leaf 3 Idaho potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 3 tablespoons creme fraiche Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 package frozen puff pastry, thawed according to package directions Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 large Idaho potato, peeled and quartered 1 cup milk 1 cup water 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped yellow onion 1 tablespoon finely chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley 1 egg, lightly beaten Instructions: For the soup: In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat and add onion, leek, celery, thyme, garlic, bacon, and bay leaf.

In medium saucepan, combine potato with milk and water and bring to a simmer over medium high heat. Simmer, partially covered, for about 20 minutes or until potato is tender. Drain. Meanwhile, in small saute pan, heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat and add onion. Saute 3 to 4 minutes, until softened, then remove from heat and stir in parsley. Put potato through a food mill or mash with a masher or hand blender and stir in butter and parsley mixture. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Rinse a large baking sheet with cold water. Set the 4 smaller circles of puff pastry on baking sheet and mound about 2 tablespoons of mashed potato in center of each circle, leaving edges clear for attaching pastry tops. Brush edges of circles with a little beaten egg. Score each of the 4 larger circles with the back of a knife in a lattice pattern, and using a 1/4-inch aspic or biscuit cutter, cut a small circular vent hole in the center. Form these circles into domes with hands and fit over the mashed potatoes, pressing down firmly around egg-washed edges to form a good seal. Brush knishes with remaining beaten egg and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Assembly: Place a knish in each of 4 heated soup bowls. Reheat soup gently, if necessary, and ladle some hot soup into each bowl around the knish. Or if you prefer, you can serve the knish on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27401,&quot;Persimmon Muffins 2 to 3 very ripe Fuyu or Hachiya persimmons (or 1 cup smooth applesauce plus 1/4 cup carrot baby food) 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2/3 cup whole-wheat flour 1 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon ground ginger 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 2 large eggs plus 1 egg white 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or vegetable oil 2/3 cup plain yogurt or sour cream Turbinado sugar, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

The short marinade will result in a milder tasting meat which is more palatable to many not-too-hot taste buds. Follow directions on packaged rice and get it simmering, it will take 18 to 20 minutes. Heat a grill pan to high heat and sear the flank steak 4 minutes on each side. Reduce heat and cook meat 6 to 8 minutes longer, turning occasionally. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over high heat. Blister tortillas 30 seconds on each side and stack them on a plate. Loosely wrap tortillas with foil and place them on the dinner table. Add oil to hot pan and sear sliced peppers and onions for fajitas. Season peppers and onions with salt and pepper. Char edges and stir-fry the peppers and onions until just tender, 2 or 3 minutes. Transfer to a platter and cover with loose foil to keep hot. Add another tablespoon oil, garlic, jalapeno and chopped onion; saute for 2 minutes. Add black beans and spices to the pan and heat through for another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer beans to a serving dish. Top beans with cilantro and scallions. Remove meat from grill pan and let it rest 5 minutes for juices to distribute. Transfer peppers and onions to grill to get the sizzle effect going. Slice meat very thin on an angle against the grain. Pile meat on top of cooked peppers and onions and take the hot grill to the table, letting rest on trivets or a cool wire rack. Stack meat and veggies in warm tortillas and enjoy with a side of spicy black beans. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 27419,&quot;Breakfast Parfaits with Fig Compote 1/2 cup blackberries 1/2 cup blueberries<br> 1/2 cup thinly sliced strawberries<br> 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons Fig Compote, recipe follows 3 cups 2% Greek yogurt<br> 3/4 cup Fruit-and-Nut Trail Mix, recipe follows 3 cups fresh black mission figs (about 20 ounces), roughly chopped 1/2 cup coconut sugar<br> 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon orange zest 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (from about 2 oranges)<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> Kosher salt 1 tablespoon honey<br> 3 cups walnuts (about 12 ounces) 2 cups cashews with sea salt (about 10 ounces)<br> 1 cup coconut flakes<br> 1/2 cup pepitas (about 2 1/2 ounces)<br> 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil<br> Kosher salt 1/2 cup banana chips<br> 1/2 cup goji berries<br> 1/2 cup chopped dried pineapple 1/4 cup carob chips, optional<br> Instructions: Mix together the blackberries, blueberries and strawberries in a bowl.

Gently heat the pan, stirring constantly, to create a dry caramel. Stop the cooking process by adding the champagne vinegar. Cook and reduce by half. Add white port, and again reduce by half. Add white wine, and again reduce by half. Add the orange and lemon zest, cinnamon sticks, and pomegranate juice. Cook and reduce by half. Strain. Transfer liquid to a clean saucepot and reduce until it is a syrupy consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the vegetables: Heat 2 saute pans, and put 1 tablespoon of corn oil in each. Add the plantains to 1, and toss to coat. Add the butter to the pan, and sprinkle with sugar and a dash each of salt and pepper. Note: If the plantains are extremely ripe, which is ideal, you can omit the sugar: the plantains will contain enough. Continue to cook until the plaintains are golden, then remove them to a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Next, heat the other tablespoon of oil in the other pan and add the long beans. Coat them with the oil. Add the shallots and bacon, and cook all until tender. Add the carmelized plaintains to the pan, toss everything together, and cook for about 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside. For the squab liver: In a saute pan, heat corn oil. Pan sear the liver to a rosy hue. Remove from heat. For the squab: Season the squab with salt and pepper. Heat a small rondeau, add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil and heat to the oil&#39;s smoking point. Place the squab in the pan, and cook on each side until a golden brown color is achieved. Remove from the pan and allow to rest for 12 minutes. Debone the squab so that you have 2 sections of meat, each consisting of half the breast meat and the meat of 1 leg. Heat a clean rondeau, and add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil. Cook the squab meat until the fat is rendered and the skin is crisp. After 2 minutes, add the butter. When all steam has evaporated and the butter begins to bubble, baste the squab for 3 minutes. Remove from the rondeau and allow to rest. With a kitchen brush, coat the squab with the pomegranate glaze. Plate with warmed vegetables, and garnish with mint. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27423,&quot;Rainbow Trout with Black-eyed Peas and Country Ham 4 fillets rainbow trout 3/4 cup cornmeal 6 tablespoons butter Salt and pepper 1 carrot, diced 1 onion, diced 2 stalks celery, diced 1 pound dried black-eyed peas 1 bay leaf 2 sprigs fresh thyme 2 ounces country ham, cut into thin strips Instructions: In a shallow dish, coat the trout with the cornmeal. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 3 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter begins to melt, place the trout, skin-side down, and cook over medium heat until the skin turns brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Gently turn the trout over and continue to cook another 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Reserve the pan juices. Melt the remaining butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the carrot and onion and cook until the onion is just translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the celery, black-eyed peas, bay leaf, and thyme. Cook for 5 more minutes. Add just enough water to cover the mixture and lower the heat. Cook until the black-eyed peas are tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Add the strips of country ham. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove thyme sprigs. Place the warm black-eyed peas in the center of a plate. Arrange the trout on top.

Remove from heat and let cool. Cook&#39;s Note: Mango and cl are a classic combination. The sweet works beautifully with the heat. In cities where there are large Latino populations, it&#39;s common to see fruit carts selling chopped up mangos in plastic bags sprinkled with cl powder. &quot;,&quot;[Mencia, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 27425,&quot;Grilled Red Potato Salad 7 small to medium red potatoes, scrubbed and quartered 1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons onion powder 2 teaspoons garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Bacon-Green Onion Vinaigrette, recipe follows 1 slice bacon, cut into lardons 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 2 green onions, chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Preheat the grill. Place the red potatoes in a large saucepan and fill with cold water, covering the potatoes by 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water begins to boil, about 8 minutes, add the sweet potatoes. Return to boil and cook for 8 more minutes. Drain the potatoes and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, onion and garlic powders, cayenne and some salt and pepper. When the potatoes are cool to the touch, toss them in the mayonnaise mixture and stir gently to coat. Using tongs, place the potato pieces on the hot grill, and cook on all sides long enough to make grill marks, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Handle gently so they don&#39;t fall apart. In a large bowl, place the Bacon-Green Onion Vinaigrette. As the potatoes are cooked through, remove them from the grill and place the hot potatoes in the bowl with the dressing. Gently toss the potatoes in the dressing to coat completely and serve, warm or cold. In a small saute pan, cook the bacon until crisp. Then set aside to cool. Once cooled, pour the bacon and fat into a small bowl along with the olive oil.<br> In another small bowl, whisk together the vinegar and mustard.

Place the bacon on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until golden brown but not completely crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Keep warm for the burgers. For the beer cheese sauce: Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy-bottom saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, until the roux starts to brown, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the beer until smooth. Reduce the heat and cook until the beer begins to reduce and the alcohol is cooked out, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the cream and garlic and continue to cook, stirring continuously, until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper; gradually whisk in the cheeses until melted completely. Keep warm. Note: This recipe makes about 4 cups of cheese sauce, more than needed for the burgers. Refrigerate the extra for up to 3 days. To make the burgers, cut the butter into four 1/2-inch thick pieces and set aside, taking care to keep them cold. In a medium bowl, gently fold the ground beef with 1 to 2 teaspoons salt and some pepper to season, and divide into four equal portions. Form each portion of meat into a ball and press your thumb into the center. Place a cold slice of butter into each indent and cover over with some meat, pressing each ball into a patty so the butter is in the center. Hold the patties on a plate for cooking. Heat a grill pan over medium high heat, and brush with oil. When the pan is hot, add the patties, spacing them evenly. Cook on one side until browned, about 5 minutes, and then flip the patties and cook to desired doneness, adding the cheese slices in the last 2 minutes. Butter both sides of the pretzel buns and place on the grill pan, cut-side down. Grill until golden brown and toasted. Place the buns onto plates, and place the patties onto the toasted buns. Top each burger with 2 bacon slices and 1/4 cup beer cheese sauce.

For the burgers: Mix beef with Worcestershire, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl until blended. Form four 1/2-pound patties. Preheat a large cast-iron pan or simply turn on your grill. Place your patties in the pan or on the grill and cook, flipping after 4 to 5 minutes, to your desired doneness (I recommend medium, about 140 degrees F). Meanwhile, lightly toast the buns. Place mixed field greens in a small bowl and gently toss them with some of the lemon vinaigrette. Place bun bottoms on 4 plates and evenly top each with the mixed greens. Once your patties are just about done, place 1 slice prosciutto on top of each, allowing the heat of the patties to warm the prosciutto. Add 2 ounces goat cheese (slightly crumbled) to cover each patty. (You do not need the goat cheese to melt. We just want it to get soft.) Remove patties from the heat and place them on top of the greens. Crush candied walnuts in the bag they come in with a small mallet or by hand. Sprinkle the crushed walnuts atop the burgers. Drizzle the balsamic glaze over the burgers, being as generous as you wish, but do not smother the burgers. Spread the fig jam across the bun tops.

Prepare a 9-inch spring form pan: Cut a circle of parchment the size of the removable bottom of the pan. Fit the parchment circle into the bottom of the pan. Tear off an 18-inch length of aluminum foil. Center the pan over the sheet of foil and crumple and crimp the foil all around the sides of the pan. (The foil will prevent water from seeping into the pan during baking.) Set the pan aside. In a medium saucepan, bring the espresso, brown sugar and the cinnamon sticks to a simmer over very low heat. Simmer until the syrup is very fragrant, about 20 minutes. Stir in the butter until melted, and then stir in the cayenne pepper. Set aside. Pulse the chocolate in the food processor until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a deep bowl. Pour in the warm coffee syrup and whisk until the chocolate is completely melted.

Once warm, remove from the heat, discard any remaining liquid and keep the meat warm to build the tacos. Construction: Drain the cabbage from the marinade and add 1 tablespoon slaw to each tortilla. Then add the bison and finish with 1 tablespoon tomato avocado dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 27464,&quot;Eggnog Meringue Cake Cooking spray 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 5 large eggs, separated 1 1/2 cups superfine sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/3 cup blanched sliced almonds For the filling 4 ounces white chocolate, chopped 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons cold heavy cream 2 tablespoons superfine sugar 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Instructions: Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two 8-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Lightly coat the parchment with cooking spray and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess. Sift the flour, cornstarch, salt and pumpkin pie spice together into a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the egg yolks and 1/2 cup superfine sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until very thick and light in color, 3 to 5 minutes. (The yolks should fall in a thick ribbon when the beaters are lifted.) Add half of the flour mixture and fold in with a rubber spatula until just incorporated. Add the melted butter, vanilla and the remaining flour mixture and fold until the batter is smooth and elastic. Divide the batter between the prepared pans, spreading it to the edges (the layers will be thin). Make the meringue: Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar in a separate large bowl with the mixer (and clean beaters) on medium speed until foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high and beat, slowly adding the remaining 1 cup superfine sugar, until stiff glossy peaks form, about 5 more minutes. Divide the meringue between the pans on top of the cake batter, spreading it to the edges; sprinkle with the almonds. Bake until the meringue is browned and crisp, 35 to 40 minutes. (The layers will puff and then collapse as they bake.) Transfer to a rack and let cool in the pans. Meanwhile, make the filling: Put the white chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth and melted; set aside. Beat 2/3 cup heavy cream and 1 tablespoon superfine sugar in a medium bowl with a whisk until stiff peaks form; set aside. In a separate medium bowl, combine the cream cheese and the remaining 1 tablespoon superfine sugar with a rubber spatula; mix in the remaining 2 tablespoons heavy cream, the vanilla and nutmeg, then stir in the melted white chocolate. Fold in the whipped cream. Refrigerate until firm but not completely set, 30 to 45 minutes. Run a thin knife around the edges of the cakes and invert onto a cutting board; peel off the parchment. Place 1 cake, meringue-side down, on a flat platter. Spread the filling on the cake, then top with the second cake layer, meringue-side up, pressing gently. (If you&#39;re not serving it right away, refrigerate up to 1 day; bring to room temperature before serving.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sparkling wine, Brut Ros]&quot; 27465,&quot;Triple Berry Pie with Granola Crunchy Crumb Topping 1 premade deep-dish frozen pie crust 3 (12-ounce) bags frozen mixed berries, thawed (recommended: Dole) 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons instant tapioca 3/4 cup flour 1/4 cup packed brown sugar 4 tablespoons cold butter, cubed 1 cup granola 1 (8-ounce) container whipped topping 2 tablespoons maple syrup Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

In a large bowl, combine the berries with the lemon zest and juice, the sugar and instant tapioca. Stir together to completely combine and set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour and brown sugar. Using a fork or a pastry cutter, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in the granola. Pour the berry mixture into the pie crust and top with the granola crumb topping. Bake until the inside of the pie is bubbling and the top is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. (If the top browns too quickly, cover loosely with aluminum foil.) Remove from the oven and cool at least 1 hour on a wire cooling rack before serving. Combine the whipped topping and maple syrup and mix until well blended. Serve with the pie. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27466,&quot;Baby Clams Steamed in a Cataplana with White Wine and Tomato Sauce: Almeijoas Na Cataplana 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut in thin strips 1 green bell pepper cored, seeded, and cut in thin strips 2 large ripe tomatoes, seeded and diced 2 medium white onions, sliced thin 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/4 pound dry-cured ham, such as presunto or prosciutto, diced 1 pound hard, smoked sausage, such as linguica or chorizo, removed from the casing 1 generous tablespoon paprika Pinch red pepper flakes 2 bay leaves 1 cup dry white wine 4 pounds small littleneck clams or cockles, scrubbed and rinsed well 1 lemon, juiced 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Portuguese bread, as accompaniment Instructions: Coat a large Dutch oven with the olive oil and set over medium heat. When the oil forms a little haze, add the bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, and garlic; cook and stir for about 7 minutes until the vegetables are soft, but not browned. Add the ham and sausage and stir for 2 minutes to release some of the flavorful fat. Stir in the paprika, pepper flakes, bay leaves, and wine. Simmer and stir for 10 minutes to cook down the liquid a bit. (If using a cataplana, transfer the sauce into the vessel, and proceed as directed.) Lay the clams in the sauce and toss with a large spoon so they are well coated and some of the sauce is on the top. Squeeze in the lemon juice and shower with chopped parsley. Tightly close the Dutch oven or cataplana and simmer over moderate heat for 15 minutes until the clams open ? no peeking. Discard any clams that haven&#39;t opened at that point. Remove the cataplana from the stove and open it at the table.

Pat the turkey dry. Rub the vegetable oil all over the turkey, then rub with the spice mixture. Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes before grilling. Preheat a grill to medium high and prepare for indirect grilling: On a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side; on a gas grill, turn off half the burners. Brush the grill grates with vegetable oil. Lay the turkey on the grates skin-side up with the legs closest to the direct-heat side (the dark meat needs more heat). Cover the grill and cook until the turkey is deep golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the chutney: Combine the plums, shallot, dried apricots, brown sugar, vinegar, fresh ginger, thyme, mustard seeds, allspice, coriander, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the plums are tender and the juices thicken, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Serve the turkey with the chutney. If you&#39;re making the turkey on a charcoal grill, you&#39;ll need 4 to 5 pounds of charcoal. Add several new briquettes to the coals every 30 minutes to maintain the heat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 27474,&quot;Beef Bourguignonne Potpie 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon tomato paste 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 cup cognac or brandy 1 750-ml bottle dry red wine 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 pound white button mushrooms, halved 1 1-pound bag frozen pearl onions, thawed 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Kosher salt 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes 1 large egg 2 bay leaves 8 sprigs thyme 1/4 cup vegetable oil 3 pounds cubed beef chuck stew meat Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 slices thick-cut bacon (about 5 ounces), chopped 1 pound carrots, halved lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 large onion, chopped Instructions: Place the bay leaves and thyme on a small piece of cheesecloth and tie the corners together tightly to form a bundle; set aside. Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the beef with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Working in batches, add the beef to the pot and cook, turning, until browned all over, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and add the bacon to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots, onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are coated, about 1 minute. Add the flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the cognac to the pot and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until the liquid has mostly evaporated, about 1 minute. Add the wine, chicken broth, cheesecloth bundle, browned meat and any juices and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer, stirring and scraping up the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the beef is tender and the sauce is thick, about 2 hours. Discard the cheesecloth bundle. Meanwhile, make the crust: Combine the flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the parsley and chives and pulse to combine, then add the butter and pulse 8 to 10 times until it looks like coarse meal. Add 1/2 cup ice water and pulse until the dough just starts coming together, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons more ice water if necessary. Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap and form into a disk; wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes or overnight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Finish the stew: Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are lightly browned, about 7 minutes. Add to the pot with the stew along with the pearl onions and butter; stir. Transfer the mixture to a 3-to-4-quart oval or 9-by-13-inch baking dish and set aside to cool. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 12-by-15-inch rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water; brush the edges and outside of the baking dish with the egg wash. Drape the dough over the filling and press it against the sides of the dish; trim any excess to leave a 1-inch overhang. Cut a few slits in the top to vent. Brush the crust with more of the egg wash.

Butter and lightly flour three 8-inch round cake pans. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, ground ginger and salt in medium bowl. Mix together the buttermilk, maple syrup and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the grated ginger and then the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Gradually add the dry and wet ingredients, alternating, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being careful not to over mix. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 to 15 minutes, and then remove to a wire rack to finish cooling. For the maple buttercream: Beat the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until combined. Add the maple syrup and beat until smooth. To assemble: Place one cake onto a serving plate or cake stand and fill the center with 1/2 cup of the cherry jam. Add the buttercream to a pastry bag or re-sealable bag with the corner snipped off and pipe it around outside of the jam to seal the jam in the center of the cake. Top with another cake and the remaining 1/2 cup cherry jam and pipe to seal. Top with the last cake. Crumb coat and frost the cake with the remaining frosting. Refrigerate until the frosting is set, about 20 minutes. Put the ganache into a squeeze bottle and drip it down the edge of the cake. Squeeze a small amount on top of the cake and spread to cover (or leave the top uncovered). Stick chocolate shards into the top of the cake and scatter chocolate malt balls about the top. Sprinkle with edible glitter. Place the chips into a heat resistant bowl (glass or metal). Warm the heavy whipping cream in a saucepan over medium-high heat until it just starts to boil. I always look for small bubbles forming around the edge and a soft boil starting in the middle. When you see that it&#39;s just starting to boil, pour it into your bowl of chips and let sit for 1 minute. Then whisk it together until it&#39;s uniform in consistency and there are no bits of chips left on your whisk. Cool the ganache at room temperature for about 30 minutes (or until the ganache itself is room temperature). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27476,&quot;Ensalada de Pulpo: Octopus Salad 1 (5 pound) octopus 2 bay leaves 2 lemons, cut in half, plus 2 more juiced 3 peppercorns 1/2 cup white wine Hot pepper sauce 1 pound squid, cleaned, tubes only, tentacles reserved for another dish 1 red tomato, medium dice 1 yellow tomato, medium dice 1 red onion, small dice 4 scallions, sliced 2 cups cooked garbanzo beans (chickpeas) 1/4 cup pitted Kalamata olives, sliced 1/4 cup olive oil, plus 1/4 cup 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon chopped basil 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro Salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 annatto seeds 4 garlic cloves, sliced 2 (14-ounce) cans hearts of palm, drained and quartered lengthwise Instructions: In a large stockpot, combine octopus with bay leaves, halved lemons, peppercorns, white wine, hot pepper sauce.

Remove from the heat and whisk in the peanut butter, corn syrup, sea salt and 1/8 teaspoon of vanilla extract until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and let cool until thickened at room temperature, about 30 minutes. Put a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a 9 by 13-inch baking pan with foil, leaving an overhang on the narrow ends. Spray the foil and pan with nonstick spray. Combine the butter, unsweetened chocolate, 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate and espresso powder in a medium bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Let the chocolate melt over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, both sugars, vanilla and salt until smooth. Whisk in the melted chocolate mixture until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the flour in 2 additions (the batter will be thick). Stir in the remaining 4 ounces of chopped bittersweet chocolate. Scrape half of the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Using a tablespoon, drop dollops of half of the peanut butter caramel every 2 inches over the top of the batter. Carefully add the remaining batter and smooth over the caramel. Smooth the top and dollop the remaining caramel over the top. Use a butter knife to swirl through the batter to get a marbleized effect. Bake until the top is set but still soft and the edges are puffed and just beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 23 to 25 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the center will come out still gooey (be brave!--underbaking the brownies is one of the secrets to their fudgy texture). Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. For the neatest cuts, refrigerate the pan for about 20 minutes before cutting the brownies. Using the foil, lift the brownie slab out of the pan. Carefully peel off the foil and put the brownie on a large cutting board. With a large sharp knife, cut the brownies into 48 squares. (The brownies can be stored in an airtight container, at room temperature, for up to 3 days; they can also be frozen, well wrapped, for up to 2 weeks.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 27479,&quot;Stovetop Mac and Cheese 4 ounces (about 3 to 4 slices) smoky bacon, cut into small dice Salt, for pasta water<br> 1/2 pound pasta, such as fusilli<br> 2 tablespoons butter<br> 2 ounces American cheese, shredded (about 3/4 cup)<br> 2 ounces aged cheddar, shredded (about 3/4 cup)<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons milk<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, optional Instructions: Heat a small skillet over medium heat; add the bacon and cook, stirring, until lightly crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside; reserve the bacon fat for another use. Bring a 2-quart pot of water to a boil. Salt the water generously; it should taste like light seawater. Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender to the bite, or al dente. Before draining, use a heavy liquid measuring cup to pull out 3/4 cup of the pasta water; set aside. Drain the pasta and return the pot to the heat. Heat the butter in the pasta pot, then add the cooked pasta. Stir in 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water. Add the American cheese and stir until smooth. Add the cheddar, milk, pepper and the cooked bacon and mix well. Dribble in extra pasta water as needed to make a soft, creamy sauce. Garnish with parsley if using. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 27480,&quot;Caribbean Jerk Sliders 1 pound ground beef chuck 1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano 1 1/2 teaspoons packed light brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Cooking spray<br> 8 standard slices mild cheddar cheese 8 brioche slider buns 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Jerk Ketchup<br> Red Ale Onion Rings<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. In a large bowl, combine the beef, allspice, cayenne, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, brown sugar, thyme, salt and black pepper and gently mix just until combined. Form the meat into eight 2-ounce patties, then press the center of each with your thumb to create an indent. Coat the grill pan with cooking spray. Grill the sliders until the internal temperature reads 150?, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place a slice of cheese on each patty once you flip them. The cheese will melt over the sides of the patties. Remove the patties to a plate and cover loosely with foil to rest.<br> While the patties rest, brush the buns with the melted butter and grill until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Assemble the sliders by putting a tablespoon-size dollop of the ketchup on the top and bottom buns, topping the bottom bun with the patty and finishing with an onion ring on top of each. Serve with the remaining onion rings and ketchup on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 27481,&quot;Tomatillo Scallop Ceviche 1 small shallot, thinly sliced 8 ounces tomatillos, husked and halved 1/4 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves and stems, plus 1/4 cup chopped leaves<br> 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (about 3 limes) 1 teaspoon kosher salt 8 ounces small sea scallops, cut into thin rounds Corn tortillas, optional Instructions: Preheat the broiler and line a baking sheet with foil.

Add 1/2 cup of the simmering broth and stir until almost completely absorbed, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking the rice, adding the broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition of the broth to absorb before adding the next, until the rice is tender but still firm to the bite and the mixture is creamy, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter, 2 tablespoons of Parmesan, mascarpone cheese, the lemon zest and juice, and the salt and pepper. To serve, cut 1/4-inch off the bottom of each lemon so they stand on their own. Take 1-inch off the stem end. Using a grapefruit spoon scoop out the flesh of the lemon and discard.

Add the onion and cook, stirring, until golden, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until softened, 1 minute. Stir in the coriander, paprika, garam masala, cumin and cayenne and cook for another minute. Stir in the tomatoes until well mixed. Add the beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until the meat is no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Add 1 cup water and season with salt and black pepper. Add the peas, stir well and simmer, partially covered, until tender, about 10 minutes for fresh peas or 5 minutes for thawed frozen peas. Stir in the vinegar and chopped cilantro. Garnish with torn cilantro and serve with warm chapatis. Combine both flours and the salt in a large bowl. Slowly pour in the water, moving your other hand through the flour in circular motions, until it starts to come together (you may not need all the water). Then, either in the bowl or on your counter (which you might want to lightly flour to prevent sticking), knead the dough for about 10 minutes. The dough should be soft and pliable. Return the ball of dough to the bowl and rub the surface with a little oil to keep it from drying out. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and allow to rest about 30 minutes. Fill a shallow bowl with whole-wheat flour. Fill a small bowl with the oil or melted butter or ghee and put a spoon in it. Line a plate or baking sheet with paper towels for the finished breads. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, on a lightly floured surface, work the ball of dough into a 12- to 14-inch-long log. Cut into 12 equal pieces by cutting it in half, and then in half again; cut each of the quarters into 3 equal pieces. Return to the bowl and cover with a damp towel to prevent the dough from drying out. Roll the chapatis: Roll a piece of dough between your palms to form a ball, and then flatten with your palm. Dunk this puck in the bowl of whole-wheat flour, and then start rolling it out with a rolling pin, turning a quarter turn after each roll, until it\\u2019s about 6 inches wide with an even thickness. After some practice you\\u2019ll be able to roll the chapati and rotate it without picking it up; I do this by weighing down a little on my right hand and pushing the chapati around that way. Test the skillet by sprinkling a little flour on it; if it turns brown immediately, it\\u2019s ready. Flap the chapati between your hands to remove any excess flour, then slap the chapati onto the skillet. It should start darkening almost immediately. When small bubbles start to form, 1 to 2 minutes, spread a little oil over the surface of the chapati, then flip. It should start to puff up. Spoon a little oil over this side too, and when it\\u2019s puffed up a little more, about 1 minute more, flip. Press down on the edges of the chapati with your spatula or (if you\\u2019re brave!) with a dry rag. This will seal the edges and encourage the entire chapati to puff up. If you spot any holes, press down on those too so the air doesn\\u2019t escape. Allowing the air to stay inside the whole chapati makes it flaky and light. Don\\u2019t fret if your first few don\\u2019t puff up; it takes practice! They will still taste delicious. Remove the chapati to the paper towels. Repeat with the remaining dough, taking care to wipe any excess flour or oil from your pan occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed. Serve the chapatis warm. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Barbera, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 27502,&quot;Spiced Candied Almonds Peanut or canola oil 4 cups almonds 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted and divided 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon cocoa powder Pinch salt, or more to taste 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat about 1-inch of oil to 350 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add almonds and blanch for 30 seconds. Drain and transfer nuts to a medium bowl. While nuts are still hot and slightly wet, add 1 cup sugar and toss to coat nuts. Stir and toss until all the sugar has melted into the nuts; if bits of un-melted sugar remain on the nuts, they will not fry properly. Stir the nuts again before frying. Using a large slotted spoon, transfer a few nuts to the hot oil, allowing the foam to subside before adding another spoonful. (Otherwise, the oil could foam over and burn you.) Fry in small batches until the nuts are medium brown, about 45 seconds; be careful not to overcook. Scatter on an unlined baking sheet to cool slightly. In a small bowl, stir together cayenne, cinnamon, cocoa, remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, a pinch of salt, and pepper. While the nuts are still warm, transfer them to a bowl and sprinkle evenly with about half of the spice mix. Toss well to distribute the spices and then taste a nut. Add more spice mix, to taste, and toss well after each addition. When cool, pack in an airtight jar. They will keep at room temperature for at least 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27503,&quot;Raspberry Orange Freeze 1 cup orange juice 1 (12-ounce) package frozen raspberries 1 tablespoon sugar</p>",113)]))}const m=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
