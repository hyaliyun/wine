It's easy to drink, featuring exotic notes of mango and banana balanced by citrus blossom and chalk.","designation":"Pfalz"},{"country":"es","description":"Cabernet Sauvignon from Navarra is always going to be vintage-dependent, so in a perfect year like 2005 a wine like this shows its best. The nose offers coconut, dill and cedar, which sets the stage for a lengthy, honest palate of roasted berry, cola, herb and tobacco flavors. Not a sweet or fruity style per se, but a cut above and a good terroir wine that reflects its year.","designation":"Northern es"},{"country":"it","description":"This vineyard-designate Riserva is a delicate and medium-bodied wine with aromas of wild berry, white mineral and violets.

A substantial effort, this ranks at the top of the list of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon priced under $10.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Very dense, very rich, and really too thick in primary fruit flavors to enjoy now. Almost like a blackberry, cassis and chocolate-filled pastry, with the oaky overlay playing the role of sweet, smoky crust, and the alcohol providing heat. Soft, too. Not particularly elegant now, but might age, if you want to roll the dice on this pricey 100% Cab.","designation":"California"},{"country":"za","description":"This complex, assertive dessert wine starts with aromas of orange marmalade, honey and tobacco spice, and on the palate, its smooth, integrated flavors of honey, citrus, cigarbox and spice are both elegant and unique. Its spicy, dry finish is an extra boost.","designation":"Stellenbosch"},{"country":"US","description":"With its 10% alcohol, bright fruit and lush, round mouthfeel, this is more mainstream (and main meal) than the late harvest label would suggest. The sweetness is perfectly balanced against firm acids, and the fruit flavors combine citrus and peach with light streaks of honey.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"fr","description":"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine, which reveals great structure to go with its black berry fruits.

Like a kiss from the sea.","designation":"Andalucia"},{"country":"es","description":"Nicely done and racy for an oloroso, with quince, baked peach and honey on the nose and then apricot and mocha flavors taking over in the mouth.

An elegant and refined wine, with a lengthy finish that displays cassis and earth flavors, and moderate, even tannins. Not a heavy or fat wine, it shows very good balance and should be cellared for three to five years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Meaty and also jammy, with popcorn and cedar aromas. Dry and complex, typical of the winery's style, and mildly astringent. The tannins are starching at this point, but should fade.

A black beauty needing three to five years to develop.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Swan Song indicates that this is the last vintage of Cabernet to be produced from this vineyard block.

Our critique is that this is an excellent final.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Deep, pungent dark-berry aromas open this round, inviting cherry and raspberry flavored wine.

Not a light-hearted cuve; rather it's drying, concentrated and strong. With a few years of aging it could show additional subtleties.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A power-packed heavyweight from Sonoma, this delivers a piercing black-fruit aroma and flavor profile.

Floral on the nose, with bright citrusy fruit on the palate and almost ephemerally light, this is an ideal aperitif wine.","designation":"Martinborough"},{"country":"au","description":"Understated stone fruit and mineral flavors dominate the palate, with peach-pit and citrus notes on the finish. Round and resinous in the mouth; nose offers a white peppery, plasticy bite.","designation":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"A lighter style of Napa Cabernet, with pretty spice, cherry, cedar,vanilla, plum and anise notes. Tannins are mild, with medium body. The finish is also moderate in length. -J.M.","designation":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"A fresh and crisp, though unusual, wine. It has pleasing flavors yet tastes like it's made from flowers rather than fruit. There's jasmine, honeysuckleyou name iton both the nose and the palate. Lean in the mouth, with a hint of apple skin toward the finish.","designation":"Tasmania"},{"country":"za","description":"Notes of cedar, paper and leather carry to the cassis laden palate, with meat juices and a hint of plum. Light in weight, with talcy tannins, this wine is straightforward and an easy drinking entertainer.","designation":"Robertson"},{"country":"za","description":"The sweet, easy-drinking flavors of cherry and plum are countered by pipe tobacco, with gentle layers of oak throughout and some eucalyptus on the finish. The acids lend a pleasant bite and are well offset by the tannins which have some grip.","designation":"Robertson"},{"country":"US","description":"On the sweet side, but it's also crisp, with enough zesty acidity to provide balance. Floral, apple-y and refreshingly light, this is a fine picnic wine. A chalky note gives added depth to the finish.","designation":"New York"},{"country":"US","description":"Hard, lean and minerally, with mouth-tingling acidity and flavors of stone, herbs and citrus fruits. This is not one of your fat, hedonistic monsters, but will pair better with foods. The finish turns honeyed, with hints of peaches.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The bright gold color and botrytis aromas tell you right off the bat that this is late-harvest juice. In the mouth, the extract and thickness are that of Vendanges Tardives Alsace whites, and flavor-wise, there's quince, peach and cinnamon, along with more botrytis and white raisins. Quite interesting for the region and a solid take on European-style late-harvest Gewurz. Possibly best with blue cheese or foie gras.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"au","description":"This medium-bodied Chard has nice oregano and thyme notes on the nose, with more fresh herbal accents on the palate. Cream and nutmeg flavors are most prevalent in the mouth; finishes with pleasant floury-nutmeg notes.","designation":"South au"},{"country":"au","description":"Made without the influence of oak maturation, and it shows.  A very good, clean, interesting wine with fresh peach and citrus flavors, medium body and pretty floral aromas. Not complicated, but pleasant. Finishes with chalk and a little sweetness.","designation":"au Other"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry Creek Chards ask for a certain indulgence. They're never opulent or over the top, and have rather earthy flavors that bring to mind sweet, cured tobacco. This wine, which is a fine example, features winemaker interventions, like lees and oak, and finishes with some tannins. If you're adventurous, try aging it.","designation":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"Smooth on the palate, though perhaps not as crisp and dry as some of its countrymen. Still, it has fragrant thyme and rose notes on the nose, with white pepper and sweet yellow fruit flavors. A thread of white pepper from beginning to end holds it all together.","designation":"Tasmania"},{"country":"US","description":"A dark, young wine, rich in sharp acids and fresh youthful fruit, with deep flavors of dark stone tree fruits and berries, such as plums and loganberries. It's very dry, and the tannins, while vigorous, are negotiable. Will mellow with a few years of bottle age.","designation":"California"},{"country":"za","description":"The sheer layers of oak wrap up round plum, light cherry, dried tobacco and herbs. The acidity is a refreshing counterweight to the tannins and the style is elegantly simple.","designation":"Western Cape"},{"country":"nz","description":"A racy, lean version of nz Riesling, with crushed limestone, tart apples and fresh limes combining on the palate. Citrusy acids on the finish bring it sharply into focus. Worth a try with shellfish or as an aperitif.","designation":"Marlborough"},{"country":"hu","description":"An elegant nose of pepper and deeper berry/mocha aromas gives the nose of this wine a more mysterious character than the typical Cab Franc, adding to its appeal. On the palate, it's a medium-bodied, slightly spicy red with a touch of bitter tobacco on the finish. Friendly and flavorful.","designation":"Villny"},{"country":"ar","description":"Certain Argentine wines have a rustic, foxy character to them that reminds us that winemaking isn't a factory-proven science. This fits the bill; it's murky and sharp on the nose, with brambly raspberry sitting in wait. Feelwise, it's a bit too piercing and choppy.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"ar","description":"The bouquet resembles fresh apple cider. There's more apple and the addition of citrus on the palate, while the finish is ripe, fruity and soft. More chunky than upright.","designation":"Other"},{"country":"ar","description":"Incongruous but with good intentions. The nose features cherry LifeSaver aromas but also hints of cheese and leather. The palate is modest and fairly acute as it delivers tangy, stretched-out plum and raspberry flavors.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"Hot in the mouth and sweet on this finish, this blackberry, coffee and spice-flavored Zin is rustic.

It's cleanly made, showing just a hint of warmth on the finish.","designation":"au Other"},{"country":"hu","description":"The black pepper and anise qualities lead the way, offering a combination of brood and kick that's unique. The wine tends toward a tartness but a dry finish gives it a food-friendly advantage. Not terribly impressive but good overall.","designation":"Villny"},{"country":"US","description":"This Cab is a bit sweet in raisin and currant fruit and astringent in dry, hard tannins. Together, they give a rustic feeling. Not going anywhere, so drink now.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Sugary and simple, with sweet cola, licorice, blackberry and cherry jam flavors. The tannins are very finely structured, but the wine is just too sweet.","designation":"California"},{"country":"ar","description":"Too heavy, murky and pruney on the nose; this wine has a lot of size but little freshness. It's big and bust-out, but with no direction or finesse it comes across earthy and oily. Only 250 cases made.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"A disappointment. After a string of better vintages, Titus' 2004 Cab had a funky, reduced aroma, and tasted strangely flat and muted, with lots of smoky oak. Tasted twice, with consistent results.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A bit rough and hot, this Syrah has very ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice and Asian spice flavors. Drink it with easy fare, like pizza or burgers.","designation":"California"},{"country":"hu","description":"The nose on this red blend from hu is so inviting with its balanced wave of warming spices, red berry and pepper.

It's not really dry, but has many interesting tastes.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Hard and dry in tannins, this Merlot has cherry and red currant flavors. It's properly clean, but the astringency is really tough, and the wine seems unlikely to age through it.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The winery's single-vineyard bottling, released a few months earlier, was much better. This regional bottling is simple and rustic. The blackberries and currants are rich, but there's a stubborn undertow of asparagus.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The fruit comes from the cool climate Den Hoed vineyard. It was barrel fermented in neutral French oak Burgundy barrels, yielding a racy, razor-sharp, spicy, detailed, delicious wine. Lovely fruit is highlighted with peppery notes, running the gamut from cucumber on through to tropical flavors. Ripe, full, lingering.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"fr","description":"Big, ripe and opulent, its ripe tannins balanced by perfumed red fruits. There is a solid core of dark and smoky dryness, a center that promises good aging. Already, though, the wine is showing its concentration and richness.","designation":"Beaujolais"},{"country":"US","description":"A big, deep, impressive wine that feels flashy from the first sniff to the last swallow. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, with a splash of Petite Sirah, it's enormously rich in berries, cherries and dark chocolate, with a pleasantly earthy note of olives and herbs. The finish is bone dry. This is a very fine value in a full-bodied red wine of such charm.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A great year for this wine, it's lush, satiny, spicy and ripe. Loaded with luscious fruit flavors of cherries and plums, dressed up in cocoa and cinnamon highlights. Hints of violets, licorice and coffee elevate the finish and the aromatics. A sensual delight.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"There's no oak on this Chardonnay, but you won't miss it at all. It's so decadent in long hangtime pineapple, tangerine, mango and spice flavors, superripe and just delicious. The alcohol is fairly high, but that's the price of all this richness.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"From Don Sebastiani & Sons, a dramatically ripe, concentrated Cabernet, with fine, firm tannins framing blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors. Really easy to drink now, and the price is quite good for the quality.","designation":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Dense from the start, with ripe berry, plum and a pinch of lemon peel on a studly bouquet.

Supple purple fruits combine with clove and other spices in a svelte wine with a full spectrum of flavors, from flower to fruit to cocoa powder.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"A sweet blend of red Sangiovese grapes and white Trebbiano (aged nine years in small caratelli barrels), this thick dessert wine very much resembles Tuscany's Vin Santo. It opens with dense concentration and a copperish color with deep aromas of butterscotch, toasted almond and gingersnap.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"Even though this Pinot Noir is instantly likeable for satisfying richness, it has some nuances. Flatters right off the bat with a soft texture housing lush raspberry and cherry pie filling, cola and sandalwood flavors that are easy to appreciate. But there are interesting mineral complexities. Drink soon.","designation":"California"},{"country":"hr","description":"A kaleidescope of scents and flavors, Korta Katarina's premiere bottling is a fascinating study of Plavac Mali at its best. Sweet on the nose and palate with hints of dark chocolate, caf au lait, dried herbs and preserved fruit, it's a richly textured wine with a beautifully feminine profile. Big, bold tannins on the finish smooth out considerably with aeration.","designation":"Peljesac"},{"country":"US","description":"A brut-style sparkler, at the age of eight years it's still fresh and crisp, with yeasty flavors of limes, strawberries, vanilla and toast. Feels dry and austere despite a honeyed richness, just what you want in a great sparkling wine. Seems best over the next six years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Aged for 22 months in French oakone third newthis is 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot. Nota Bene's wines are not shy about high alcohol, but here the fruit stands up well to the oak treatment and shows no sign of over-ripeness. A good spine supports a rich wine with black fruits, balanced acids, and a big streak of espresso.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"fr","description":"This standout from the Costires has all the ingredients to age. It starts off with gorgeous aromas of garrigue, baking spices and black cherries, then delivers a rich mouthful of drying tannins. And at the end, the fruit comes through on the lengthy finish.

This vintage incorporates fruit from several Red Mountain vineyards, though not Col Solare itself, along with lots from elsewhere around the state. Toasty and full-bodied, two-thirds Cabernet, the rest Merlot, Cab Franc and Syrah, this is a nicely blended wine but not yet showing the precision and structural detail of the superTuscans it is modeled upon.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"An interesting and even a bold wine that will challenge diehard California Pinot lovers. The wine is quite low in alcohol and exceptionally silky and light in the mouth, with an elegant feeling. It's strongly extracted in raspberry fruit, and has lots of sharp, zingy acidity. Doesn't feel knit together at all, but could be a sleeper. Try aging until 2015.","designation":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Here's a beautifully crisp and golden Passito dessert wine that seems to shine bright with Italian sunlight intensity. The velvety wine is redolent of dried apricot, peach cobbler and almond honey.","designation":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"Another very nice Chardonnay from Durell. It's almost too oaky, with charred, buttered toast aromas and flavors dominating. But the underlying tropical fruit, orange cream and mineral flavors are fine, and so is the zesty acidity. The winemaker might want to lower the amount of new oak, or the level of toast, because the wine really doesn't need that much.","designation":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"Showing more of the spicy side of Blaufr?nkisch, which dominates the blend, this is a wine that also brings out ripe tannins, juicy red fruit, acidity and a dense core of dryness. It is still young, the fruit still bursting to get out.","designation":"Burgenland"},{"country":"US","description":"The previous vintage of this sweet Pinot Gris was finished at 30 g/L residual sugar; this drops it down to half that.

Right now it's just simple and sweet.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"This blend of 70% Nero d'Avola and 30% Syrah opens with aromas of blackberry and blue flower.

The evolved palate is framed by astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.","designation":"Southern it"},{"country":"fr","description":"Rich and soft, it offers a ripe cushion of Chardonnay and a warm, rounded personality. While it misses out on a more structured character, the yellow fruits and light spice from wood aging give immediate drinkability.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"This unassuming red mixes six grapes together, with Tempranillo and Sangiovese comprising almost two-thirds of the blend. Nicely spicy and balanced, it has enough substance for the transition from late summer to early fall meals, and could carry into November-centric holiday meals as well.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"Compost, tomato leaf and gritty berry aromas control the nose on this underripe and tannic Rioja. Stalky flavors of tomato and berry fruits are definitively herbal, while the finish is toasty due to oak covering but also rough and stalky.","designation":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"Looming in huge black fruit, this is a dark, heavy Zin intense in toasty oak and brambly, dusty amounts of ripe blackberry and strawberry jam.

Drink nowC2020.","designation":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"it","description":"A blend of Pinot Nero and Chardonnay, this stunning sparkler shows its Piedmont pedigree, boasting structure and finesse. Dosed with the firm's own 1967 Barolo, it opens with delicate scents of perfumed red cherry, juicy strawberry, rose, cake spice and a whiff of baked bread that follow over to the vibrant palate. A blast of tangerine zest closes the crisp finish. Delicious!","designation":"Piedmont"},{"country":"at","description":"An immensely savory nose immediately hints at an intense wine, with salty miso and tangy, peppery arugula. The palate turns the flavor volume up, with the spicy intensity brightened by lemon freshness and a textured but toned body. A stony saltiness edged with white pepper makes this moreish and irresistible for a lasting, powerful but very authentic Grner experience.","designation":"Kremstal"},{"country":"at","description":"Promising aromatics include lifted scents of ripe redcurrant, blood-orange peel and a wild streak of elderberry. These fruit notions carry through on the slinky and smooth palate. Elderberry notes are joined by something more resonant and earthy, reminiscent of truffle and autumn. The structure has light feet but is sure-footed, and the purity of the fruit indicates that it will continue developing. It's a subtle, convincing wine.","designation":"Thermenregion"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a Pinot Noir for lovers of lush expressions.

A very fruity and somewhat simple style, yet executed perfectly.","designation":"Gisborne"},{"country":"za","description":"Named after Danie de Wet's wife, this elegant Chardonnay balances smooth fruit with crisp acidity and a spice-and-toast finish. There have been better, more concentrated, vintages of this winenotably the 1998 and 1993but it will develop well over the next four or five years.","designation":"Robertson"},{"country":"cl","description":"The nose is a little closed, but there's a lot to like about this Pinot, particularly its gravelly tannins. Blackberry, black plum and metallic-mineral flavors are lovely, but really, it's all about the texture.","designation":"Bo Bo Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"This is very appealing when first popped, with plenty of forward  butter and caramel scents livening up the fresh fruit. Ready to drink right now, it retains enough acid to stand up to food, though the finish is a little bitter from all the new oak.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"au","description":"This peach- and pear-scented wine was bottled with screw caps so you needn't fear TCA.

Goes down so easily that you just might forget that wine has alcohol in it. Best Buy.","designation":"Rapel Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"This fine wine straddles the border between good and complex. The elements are terrific: pedigreed blackberry and cassis fruit, fine oak nuances, and soft Sonoma tannins. It's just a tad thin in the middle. Drink it with meat.","designation":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Cream, plus jammy blackberry and blueberry aromas may trick you into believing that this wine's a Syrah, but the truth comes through on the palate, where sturdy, brambly blackberry flavors dominate. Finishes dry, with medium length.","designation":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"A very nice wine, with good, ripe black-currant fruit; dry and balancedwith aromas and flavors of sweet, smoky oak. The flash is on the surface and it's a little sharp, so it's not an ager. But it's a tasty wine.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"For Calera's least expensive Pinot, this is pretty darned nice stuff. It's packed with true varietal character, from the pale color to the spicy, fruity, tomato-infused flavors to the silky tannins and crisp acids. It's what people want in a delicate yet assertive wine, and defines Central Coast Pinot in a general sense.","designation":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"This weighty California lookalike nevertheless comes across as balanced, thanks to a long, mouthwatering finish. Citrus and yellow-plum flavors stand up well to a hefty dose of vanilla and buttered toast.","designation":"Victoria"},{"country":"pt","description":"Sweet and mild aromas are highlighted by a touch of fresh prune. The mouthfeel is buttery, with plenty of toffee/coffee flavors poking through.

The palate offers some nice orange flavors, along with a dose of ripe tropical fruit. The mouthfeel isright on, with proper acids providing necessary balance. The finish is clean and smooth, although a little sweet.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"au","description":"The aromas are so promising, redolent of toast and pears, butter and nectarines, that expectations are high. And make no mistakethis is very good wine. It's just that a slightly resinous veneer of spicy oak largely dominates the palate and finish.","designation":"Western au"},{"country":"US","description":"Lightish in color, it opens with earthy, tobacco aromas, a hint of mint and, if you really concentrate, blackberries. It's very limpid in the mouth, light as a feather, but the fruit is great. The concentrated blackberry taste is dry and flavorful, with wonderful acids. This is a very individualistic wine, and fun to drink.","designation":"California"},{"country":"au","description":"There's a distinct hardness to this wine, so that the fruit comes across more as a tough-skinned yellow-plum than as a soft, ripe peach. It's a little stingy on the midpalate, but there are plenty of other things to make up for it. Melon and pineapple flavors add layers of interest, as does the toasty, nutty finish.","designation":"South au"},{"country":"za","description":"The Finlaysons, father and son, have made some impressive Chardonnays in the dozen years since they took over this Paarl estate. This is not as fine as some (1995 was exceptional), but it has many of the same characteristics: ripe, tropical, fat fruit, with an element of complexity provided by the lees. Yet, the high toast flavors tend to spoil and dominate the fruit.","designation":"Coastal Region"},{"country":"US","description":"No mistaking the brambly, wild-berry character of this rugged but likeable wine.

Tannins are chalky; bouquet and finish are more subtle and a little oakier.","designation":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"au","description":"A richer, yet no better, style than the 2000 Limestone Coast bottling.
