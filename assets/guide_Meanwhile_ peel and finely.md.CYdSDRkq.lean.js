When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a large Dutch oven, heat the canola oil over medium-high heat. Season the chuck roast again with salt and pepper and dust with flour, shaking off the excess. Sear on all sides, browning the meat evenly, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Remove the roast to a plate, then add the carrots, turnips and onion to the pot. Lower the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are caramelized, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, garlic, thyme and bay leaves and cook another 2 minutes. Add the roast back to the pot, then add the beer and beef stock. Nestle the roast down among the vegetables so that it is mostly submerged in the liquid. Bring to a simmer. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and place in the oven to cook under very tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours, testing with a small knife for tenderness after 3 hours. Meanwhile, heat the butter in saucepot over medium-low heat, add the pearl onions and peas and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions and peas are warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes. Once the roast is done, remove it from the pot and cut off the string. Discard the thyme and bay leaves. If you&#39;d like the sauce thicker, place the Dutch oven back on the stove and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced to the desired thickness (you&#39;re looking for a rich and smooth sauce). To plate, slice the roast into thick slices. Place the vegetables on a platter, then the beef, then ladle the sauce over. Spoon the peas and onions on top and sprinkle with the chives and tarragon. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</li></ol><p>&quot; 70562,&quot;Crab and Guacamole Salad 3 avocados, halved, pitted and flesh diced 1 small red onion, finely diced 2 jalapenos, chopped 2 Roma tomatoes, chopped 1 lime, juiced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (1-pound) container jumbo lump crabmeat 1/2 cup chopped hearts of palm 1 cup frozen edamame, thawed 1/2 cup finely diced fresh pineapple 1/4 cup fresh pineapple juice 1 bag mixed greens 2 cups pineapple juice 2 cups orange juice 1/2 cup canola oil Instructions: Guacamole: Combine the avocados, red onions, jalapenos, tomatoes and lime juice in a medium bowl.

Remove from the heat, discard the vanilla bean and add the chocolate, stirring to melt. Let sit until ready to serve (the sauce will thicken as it sits). For the churros: Whisk together the cinnamon and 1 cup of the organic sugar in a medium bowl; set aside. Scrape the vanilla seeds into a medium saucepan; add the vanilla bean, milk, butter, salt and remaining tablespoon organic sugar and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove and discard the vanilla bean, add the flour and use a wooden spoon to vigorously mix until the dough comes together, about 30 seconds. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Fit the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and beat the mixture on medium-low speed. Add the eggs to the dough one at a time, making sure to incorporate each egg before adding the next. (The dough will look broken at first.) Continue to beat, scraping the bowl occasionally, until the dough is smooth, glossy and somewhat stretchy (pull off a small piece of dough and stretch it--it shouldn&#39;t break). Spoon the dough into a pastry bag fitted with a large closed star tip. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Pour the oil into a large pot until it comes halfway up the sides. Fit the pot with a deep-frying thermometer and heat the oil over medium-high heat until the thermometer registers 350 degrees F.<br> Holding the pastry bag at an angle so the tip is a few inches above the surface of the oil, squeeze out the dough, moving the bag as you squeeze so the dough is piped in a 6-inch length into the oil (use a paring knife to cut off the dough at the tip to release it into the oil). Repeat the process to make 4 more churros. Fry the churros, turning once and adjusting the heat as needed to maintain the oil temperature, until deep golden brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the lined baking sheet for a moment, then toss in the reserved cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat with the remaining dough. Serve the churros with the warm chocolate sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 70567,&quot;Roasted Vegetable Sauce 2 pounds tomatillos, husked, washed, halved 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded (use rubber gloves) 1 medium onions, halved 12 cloves garlic 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 3/4 cup vegetable stock Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Keep warm. In a large 3 to 4-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and sweat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until the grains are translucent around the edges. Be careful not to allow the grains or the onions to brown. Reduce the heat to low. Add enough of the wine and chicken stock just to cover the top of the rice. Stir or move the pan often, until the liquid is completely absorbed into rice. Once absorbed, add another amount of liquid just to cover the rice and continue stirring or moving as before. There should be just enough liquid left to repeat 1 more time. It should take approximately 35 to 40 minutes for all of the liquid to be absorbed. After the last addition of liquid has been mostly absorbed, add the mushrooms and asparagus and stir until risotto is creamy and asparagus is heated through. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan, lemon zest, and nutmeg.

Whisk together the eggs, oil, and 2 tablespoons water in a separate bowl. Pour the flour mixture onto a clean dry work surface and form a small well in the center. Pour half of the egg mixture into the well and, using a fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture. Once absorbed, incorporate the remaining egg mixture and knead by hand until all of the liquid is absorbed, 5 to 6 minutes, flouring your work surface as needed to ensure the dough doesn&#39;t stick. Roll the dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour. For the filling: Mix together all of the ingredients until fully incorporated in a bowl. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes, or up to 1 hour. To assemble: Divide the rested dough into 2 equal-size pieces and roll out on a floured work surface to a thickness of 1/8-inch. On 1 dough sheet, distribute tablespoon-sized portions of the filling, at least 2 inches apart. Brush the edges of the dough with the egg wash. Carefully lay the second sheet of dough on top and press the edges shut with your fingertips. Use a round 1 1/2-inch ravioli cutter to portion out ravioli pieces, pinching the edges shut to ensure no air is trapped inside. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Whisk the remaining 3 eggs and cream in a shallow bowl. Place the breadcrumbs and Parmesan into another shallow bowl and stir to combine. Dredge the ravioli in the egg mixture, followed by the breadcrumb mixture. Working in batches, carefully drop the ravioli into the saucepan and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, making sure that the oil comes back up to temperature in between batches. Place directly onto a cooling rack lined with aluminum foil to drain any excess oil. Serve with warm tomato sauce and freshly grated Parmesan.; Serving suggestion: tomato sauce and freshly grated Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 70576,&quot;Gamja Hot Dog 6 hot dogs One 32-ounce bag frozen crinkle-cut French fries, thawed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces Canola oil, for frying 3 1/4 cups bread flour, plus more for dredging (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup cornmeal 1 tablespoon baking powder Kosher salt 1 1/2 cups whole milk, plus more if needed for thinning 2 large eggs Ketchup and mustard, for serving Instructions: Pat dry the hot dogs and thread each three-quarters of the way onto an 8-inch wooden skewer. Set aside. Spread the fries in a large shallow dish or baking sheet. Heat 3 to 4 inches of oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepot over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees F.<br> Meanwhile, whisk the flour, sugar, cornmeal, baking powder and 1 tablespoon salt in a large bowl. Whisk the milk and eggs in a medium bowl. Add the liquid to the flour mixture and whisk until combined. Add a tablespoon of milk if needed to loosen the batter. Pour the batter into a tall drinking glass, reserving any extra batter. Put some flour on a plate for dredging the hot dogs.<br> Dredge a hot dog first in the flour, then dip into the glass of batter and swirl and twist up slowly to pull out; let the excess drip back into the glass. (Be careful when lifting back up, as the batter is very sticky.) Once the hot dog is completely covered with batter, lay it on the bed of fries and sprinkle some fries on top until mostly covered. Roll the hot dog and then secure the fries in place by patting and packing them in gently. Repeat with a second hot dog.<br> Lower both hot dogs into the hot oil one at a time and fry, turning, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per batch. Remove the hot dogs with tongs and drain on a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate; season with salt. Continue to coat and fry the hot dogs in batches of 2, refilling the glass with batter as needed. Serve with ketchup and mustard for dipping.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70577,&quot;Roasted Cinnamon Plums 6 to 8 ripe purple prune plums 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Pinch salt Zest of 1/2 lemon Instructions: Preheat oven at 350 degrees F.

Butter the bottom of the springform pan and line with parchment or waxed paper. Set aside.<br> To make the base: Beat together the butter and sugar by hand until light and fluffy. Beat in the yolk until smooth. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. With a rubber spatula, gently fold into the butter mixture. The mixture will be crumbly.<br> Place the dough in the pan and use your hands to pat it down evenly and firmly over the bottom. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the crust is golden and baked through. Transfer to a rack and reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F.<br> To make the batter: In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on the lowest speed just until smooth, no more than 30 seconds. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl and beater. Add the sugar in a stream, mixing for no more than 30 seconds. Stop and scrape again. Add 1 cup of sour cream and mix only until it is absorbed, no more than 30 seconds. Repeat with the remaining sour cream. Add the eggs 1 at a time, mixing only until each is absorbed; stop and scrape after each addition. Beat in the vanilla extract.<br> Wrap heavy-duty aluminum foil around the bottom of the springform pan so it comes at least 1 inch up the sides. Pour the batter into the pan. Place the pan in a jellyroll pan or roasting pan and pour warm water into the pan to a depth of 1/2-inch.<br> Bake the cheesecake for about 55 minutes, or until it is lightly colored and firm except for the very center. Remove from the oven and lift the cheesecake out of the hot water. Remove the foil and let cool completely on a rack. Wrap the cheesecake and chill overnight.<br> To unmold the cheesecake, run a knife or thin spatula around the inside of the pan pressing the knife against the pan, not the cake. Unbuckle the pan side and lift off. Leave the cake on the base, or run a spatula under the cake base and slide the cake onto a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70579,&quot;Savory Crepes 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 eggs 1 1/2 cups whole milk, divided use 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus whole butter for cooking crepes Instructions: Whisk together the flour, eggs, 1/2 cup milk, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Continue whisking until you have a smooth batter. Add the remaining cup of milk and stir well to combine. Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator to chill the batter for at least 30 minutes or several hours. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Just before you are ready to make the crepes, whisk in the melted butter. The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream; if it is too thick, add milk slowly while whisking constantly until it is the right texture. Heat a 9-inch non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Melt a teaspoon of butter in the pan or spray with vegetable spray and heat the pan until a drop of water \\dances\\ across the surface. Using a ladle or a measuring cup with a lip, pour about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the batter into the pan. Hold the pan with 1 hand and pour the batter in with the other. Swirl the pan while pouring so that the batter covers the pan thinly and evenly for each crepe. Pour off any excess batter. Try not to leave any holes. After the first few crepes you will know exactly how much batter your pan will hold. Cook the crepe over medium-high heat until the edges turn brown, about 15 seconds. Flip the crepe using a small spatula and your fingers. Cook on the second side for another 10 to 15 seconds. The second side will not be as evenly browned as the first side. Remove the pan from the heat and invert it over a warm plate to stack the crepes. Keep warm until ready to use. Continue making crepes with remaining batter, adjusting the heat as needed. If not using immediately, place a square of waxed paper between each 1, place in a resealable plastic bag and store in the refrigerator. Crepes can be refrigerated for up to 2 days or frozen for several months. Reheat uncovered in a low oven (250 degrees) for 15 minutes or until warm. Fill with your favorite filling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70580,&quot;Portuguese Stew 2 large Spanish onions, chopped 1 head garlic, divided into cloves, peeled, and chopped 5 to 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 pounds Portuguese chourico (linguica is the milder sausage for the faint of heart.) 6 tablespoons crushed red pepper in vinegar 4 cups of water 2 (16-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes or vegetable tomato juice 1/4 cup ketchup 1 teaspoon Portuguese allspice, optional 1/4 cup chopped parsley 3 to 5 red bliss potatoes 1 bunch garden green beans or pea pods 1/4 to 1/2 cup of any wine or vermouth 3 to 5 lobster tails 1 pound Cherrystone clams 1 pound mussels 1 pound cod or sea bass Instructions: You will need two large saucepots.

Add the flour and whisk for 3 minutes. Whisk in the milk. Increase the heat to medium-high. Whisk the sauce until it comes to a simmer and is thick and smooth, about 3 minutes. Whisk the salt, pepper, and nutmeg into the bechamel sauce. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Whisk the ricotta, spinach, 1 cup Parmesan, prosciutto, egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl to blend. Add a tablespoon or 2 of oil to a large pot of boiling salted water. Boil the noodles until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Arrange the noodles in a single layer on a baking sheet to prevent them from sticking. Butter a 13-by-9-by-2-inch glass baking dish. Pour the bechamel sauce over the bottom of the prepared dish. Lay out 4 lasagna noodles on a work surface, then spread a large spoonful (about 3 tablespoons worth) of ricotta mixture evenly over each noodle. Starting at 1 end, roll each noodle like a jelly roll. Lay the lasagna rolls seam side down, without touching, atop the bechamel sauce in the dish. Repeat with the remaining noodles and ricotta mixture. Spoon 1 cup of marinara sauce over the lasagna rolls. Sprinkle the mozzarella and remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan over the lasagna rolls. Cover tightly with foil. Bake until heated through and the sauce bubbles, about 20 minutes. Uncover and bake until the cheese on top becomes golden, about 15 minutes longer. Let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining marinara sauce in a heavy small saucepan over medium heat until hot, and serve alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 70600,&quot;Lemon Icebox Bars 14 whole-grain graham cracker squares (7 full sheets) 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt Nonstick cooking spray 1 (8-ounce) package 1/3 less-fat cream cheese, softened at room temperature 1 (14-ounce) can fat-free sweetened condensed milk 1/4 cup pasteurized egg product (such as egg beaters) 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons powdered gelatin 3 tablespoons boiling water Instructions: For the Crust:<br> Place graham crackers in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until crumbs are formed.

Stir in the soy sauce and remove from the heat. Let cool. Put the drained beans, chickpea flour, onion-mushroom mixture and 1 tablespoon oil in a food processor and pulse until the beans are finely chopped and hold together when squeezed, but not a smooth paste. Add the sage, thyme, maple syrup, rosemary, nutmeg, red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and pulse until combined. Divide the bean mixture into 12 even portions. Roll each out into a cylinder about 4 inches long, then roll up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to secure. Set up a steamer and arrange the rolled up sausages in it (you may have to do this in batches).

Stir well for a few minutes to obtain a smooth paste. Let this batter sit on the countertop for 15 to 20 minutes. Warm the oil for deep-frying in a wok or deep fryer over medium-high heat. Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the wok; fry them in batches. Adjust the heat. If the oil is too hot, the ball will fry too quickly, and if it is not hot enough, they will disintegrate. They should take about 3 minutes to become golden brown on all sides. Try frying a test ball, and if it disintegrates, add one more tablespoonful of flour to the batter. Don&#39;t be in a hurry to flip the balls; spoon some hot oil over them to cook the tops and then turn gently after a few seconds. When you put the batter into the hot oil, it will soon spread and flatten a bit and rise to the top. When the balls are golden all over, drain them on many layers of paper towels and set aside. To make the syrup, combine the water and sugar in a large deep saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and crush the saffron into the syrup. Cool to room temperature. Remove the skins from the cardamom and powder the seeds finely in a mortar and pestle, or between two sheets of wax paper with a rolling pin. Mix the crushed cardamom seeds into the syrup. Gently mix in the fried balls, making sure they are all immersed in syrup. Cover and let them soak for at least an hour. When ready to serve, lift them gently out of the syrup and lay them attractively in a serving dish. Sprinkle with powdered pistachios if desired. Refrigerate unused portions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 70612,&quot;Coleslaw 1/2 head green cabbage, thinly sliced 1/2 head red cabbage, thinly sliced 1 carrot, thinly sliced 1/2 cup buttermilk 2 fluid ounces plain yogurt 2 fluid ounces mayonnaise 1 tablespoon pickle juice 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1 tablespoon chives, chopped Kosher salt, as needed 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper Instructions: Generously salt the cabbage and drain in colander for 3 hours.

Lightly spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Spread the almonds on the prepared baking sheet, then transfer to the oven and toast lightly, 8 minutes. Combine the honey, sugar, allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sugar melts. Put the toasted almonds in a small bowl and toss with half of the honey mixture until evenly coated; reserve the remaining spiced syrup. Using a heat-proof spatula (the mixture will be hot), spread the coated almonds in an even layer on the baking sheet. Set aside until hardened, 15 minutes to 1 hour--the almonds will remain slightly sticky. Once hardened, coarsely chop or use whole. For the grilled stone fruit: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Brush the cut sides of the fruit with a bit of oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the fruit, cut-side down, to mark and caramelize slightly, about 2 minutes.

Lay out 2 sheets of plastic wrap; divide the dough between the sheets and pat each into a disk. Wrap the disks tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Roll 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface (or between 2 pieces of floured parchment paper). Ease into a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish glass pie plate. Add the filling, mounding it slightly, and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Chill the pie while you roll the remaining dough into a 12-inch round. Lay the dough over the filling and press the 2 crusts together around the edges. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl and brush over the top crust; sprinkle with sugar. Pierce the top with a knife a few times to let steam escape. Chill 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pie on a baking sheet; bake until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly, 55 to 60 minutes. (Cover the edges with foil if they brown too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and cool until set, 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70626,&quot;Crab Louis 2 cups lump crabmeat (about 1 pound) 1 cup prepared mayonnaise 4 teaspoons chili sauce 1 tablespoon finely chopped green bell pepper 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste 2 scallions, finely chopped Worcestershire sauce, to taste Hot sauce, to taste Freshly ground pepper 1 hard-boiled egg 4 to 8 Bibb lettuce leaves, washed and dried 4 thick slices beefsteak tomatoes 1 ripe avocado, seeded, peeled, and quartered lengthwise Instructions: Using your finger, carefully pick through the crab and discard any bits of shell or hard cartilage. Try to leave the lumps as intact as possible. Put the meat in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, chili sauce, bell pepper, lemon juice, 1/2-teaspoon salt, scallion, a couple dashes Worcestershire, and hot sauce.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, sugar, salt and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat and dump the flour directly into the pan. Stir the mixture into a paste with a wooden spoon. Return the pan to medium heat. Stir the mixture until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and is slightly shiny, about 3 minutes. Transfer the paste to a medium bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until slightly cooled, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, incorporating each one thoroughly before adding the next. Before adding the last egg, beat it in a small bowl. Add it by tablespoons to the mixture, just until the batter is smooth and tight. If the batter starts to get loose, do not add all of the last egg. Fill a large pastry bag fitted with an open tip with the batter. Pipe twelve 1-inch circular mounds about 2 inches apart onto the baking sheet. (Alternatively, use a large spoon to form the dough into mounds.) Dab the tops of each puff with a fingertip dipped in water to smooth. Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes. Remove the puffs from the oven and use a sharp paring knife to pierce each side. Return the puffs to the oven until dry and crisp, another 5 minutes. Let cool on a rack. Repeat with the remaining batter. For the meringue frosting: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a mixing bowl above the water. Whisk the sugar, lemon zest and juice, egg whites, cream of tarter and salt by hand in the mixing bowl. Set the bowl above the boiling water and continue whisking until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until the meringue is cool and holds a soft peak, about 5 minutes. Add a few drops of desired food coloring if using and continue beating until it holds stiff peaks. To assemble: Fit a pastry bag with a 1/4-inch round tip (a long eclair filling tip works great for this) and add the frosting to the bag. Insert the tip into the slit in the side of each puff and fill with frosting. Melt the white chocolate in a bowl over a pot of simmering water or in a microwave. Start by dipping a small bit of each puff into the melted white chocolate. Create an even round layer with the puffs on a 12- to 14-inch serving platter, using the chocolate to adhere. Place the platter in the refrigerator and allow to set for 10 minutes. Repeat with additional layer of puffs on top of the first, decreasing in size to create a \\tower\\ effect and reheating the white chocolate to melt as needed. In between each layer, place the plate back in the fridge and allow to set for 10 minutes. When you reach the top, use the remaining white chocolate to drizzle over the top of the tower. Return the platter to the fridge and remove 20 minutes before you are ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70645,&quot;Chickpea Stew 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons Hungarian paprika 4 teaspoons ground ginger<br> 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 teaspoons ground turmeric<br> 1/2 cup olive oil, plus more for serving<br> 3 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1 large onion, chopped<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 carrots, peeled and cut on the bias into 1-inch pieces<br> 1 small poblano pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped<br> One 14-ounce can diced tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted<br> 2/3 cup Castelvetrano olives, pitted<br> Two 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained and chickpea liquid reserved<br> 1 small bunch curly kale, stemmed and torn into 3-inch pieces<br> Serving suggestions: labneh, chopped fresh parsley, Aleppo pepper, lemon wedges and toasted pita<br> Instructions: Mix the paprika, ginger, pepper and turmeric in a small bowl until combined; set aside.

Cook the tomato paste, stirring, until it darkens slightly, about 1 minute. Add the vinegar, honey and thyme, then stir in 1 cup of the boiling water from the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook until the apples are tender and the sauce thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Add a little more water, if needed. Meanwhile, add the pierogi to the pot of boiling water and cook as the label directs. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to the skillet; nestle the pork chops in the mixture. Cut the remaining 1 tablespoon butter into small pieces and stir into the sauce. Cook, stirring, until the pierogi are coated in the sauce and the pork is just cooked through, about 2 minutes.

Stir to moisten the sugar and insert a thermometer. Cook until the temperature reaches 220 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat and allow to cool. Follow the method for Master Ganache, adding the cream fraiche to the cream before bring the cream to a boil. Add the Tia Maria and simple syrup and stir for 1 one minute, or until smooth and thoroughly combined. Cover the sauce and keep it warm near the stove until it is served. Can deep, dark, intense, rich, velvety smooth chocolate be a spiritual experience? It certainly is heavenly when mixed with cream. Praise the pastry angels and pass the bonbons! This is the basic ganache recipe. Use it for truffles, tarts, fillings, you name it. Follow the same technique when adjusting the recipe for firm and soft ganache. An alternative food processor method is given, which can be applied to any ganache recipe in this chapter. My desire is not only to introduce you to ganache but also to make it a staple in your refrigerator. As long as you don&#39;t eat it all as a midnight snack, it can be available to help you throw together dessert at a moment&#39;s notice. Using a serrated knife, finely chop the chocolate into 1/4-inch pieces. Don&#39;t be lazy here. Big chunks will not melt. Traditional method: Place the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boiling means the cream will actually rise up in the pan and threaten to boil over. Immediately pour the boiling cream over the chopped chocolate. Tap the bowl on the counter to settle the chocolate into the cream, then let it sit for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, slowly stir in a circular motion, starting from the center of the bowl, and working out to the sides. Be careful not to add too much air to the ganache. Stir until all the chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. It may look done after 1 minute of stirring, but keep going to be sure it&#39;s emulsified. Food processor method: Place the chopped chocolate in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat (or bring to a boil in the microwave.) Immediately pour the hot cream into the food processor, on top of the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute, then pulse the machine 3 times. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and pulse 3 more times, until all the chocolate is melted. This smooth, silky chocolate is now ganache. Transfer the ganache to a bowl. Let the ganache sit at room temperature until it cools to 70 degrees F. In a 65 degree F room, this will take approximately 4 hours or 2 hours in the refrigerator. You can speed up the process by pouring the ganache out onto a clean baking sheet (thinner layers cool faster.) Once the ganache reaches 70 degrees F, it is ready to be used. At this point it can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Malbec]&quot; 70650,&quot;Beef Enchilada-Burritos 1 1/2 10-to-12-ounce packages broccoli florets 1 cup grape tomatoes 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Nonstick cooking spray 8 ounces lean ground beef 1 10-ounce can enchilada sauce (about 1 1/4 cups) 1 15-ounce can no-salt-added black beans, drained and rinsed 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 3/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend (3 ounces) 4 large (burrito-size) flour tortillas Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

For the Crust: In a mixing bowl, combine the ingredients with a fork until evenly moistened. Lightly coat the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with non-stick cooking spray. Pour the crumbs into the pan and, using the bottom of a measuring cup or the smooth bottom of a glass, press the crumbs down into the base and 1-inch up the sides. Refrigerate for 5 minutes. For the Filling: In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese on low speed for 1 minute until smooth and free of any lumps. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to beat slowly until combined. Gradually add sugar and beat until creamy, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add sour cream, lemon zest, and vanilla. Periodically scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters. The batter should be well-mixed but not over-beaten. Pour the filling into the crust-lined pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Set the cheesecake pan on a large piece of aluminum foil and fold up the sides around it. Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until the water is about halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan; the foil will keep the water from seeping into the cheesecake. Bake for 45 minutes. The cheesecake should still jiggle (it will firm up after chilling), so be careful not to overcook. Let cool in pan for 30 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for at least 4 hours. Loosen the cheesecake from the sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the inside rim. Unmold and transfer to a cake plate. Using a spatula spread a layer of Warm Lemon Blueberry topping over the surface. Slice the cheesecake with a thin, non-serrated knife that has been dipped in hot water. Wipe dry after each cut. In a small saucepan add all the ingredients and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes or so until the fruit begins to break down slightly. Leave to cool before spreading on cheesecake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70699,&quot;Spider&#39;s Nest Dip 2 (8-ounce) package cream cheese 1 (1.25-ounce) package taco seasoning mix 1 1/2 cups sour cream 1 (16-ounce) can black refried beans 1 (12-ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese 1/2 cup fresh chunky salsa (from your grocery&#39;s deli section) 1 (2.25-ounce) can chopped black olives 1 cup guacamole (from your grocery&#39;s deli section) 1 (15-ounce) can whole black beans, drained and rinsed 4 to 6 bags blue tortilla chips Instructions: In a small bowl, mix cream cheese and 1/2 packet of taco seasoning with 1 cup of the sour cream (hold the rest of the sour cream to decorate).

Have a GH (grown-up helper) do this for you. WHACK the garlic with a fist or the palm of your hand. Separate the skins from the smashed garlic and throw just the skins away into the garbage bowl. WHACK the 3 cloves of garlic with the bottom of a small saucepan. Add extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, to the soup pot. Throw in the garlic and 2 stems each of the rosemary and fresh thyme herbs. The leaves will fall off the stems and give a delicious and really cool flavor to your special stew. Add the mushrooms, too and help stir as the mushrooms cook 3 to 5 minutes. Season the mushrooms up with a little salt and pepper as they&#39;re cooking. Next, have the GH open the can of tomatoes and pour into the soup pot. Use a sharp, small knife to chop the red roasted bell peppers. Keep your fingers on the hand that is not holding the knife curled under so you don&#39;t chop off a whole finger! You just want to cut up those peppers into pieces as big as your mouth, that&#39;s what they call \\bite-size.\\ Add the chopped up roasted red peppers to the tomatoes and stir. Squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the spinach. Add spinach, tomato sauce and chicken broth to the pot.. Stir really slowly or the soup will slosh out of your pot! Stir until the spinach is all broken up in the broth. Have the GH cover the soup and raise the heat to high. Have the GH cut up the chicken for you on a separate cutting board from the one you cut up the vegetables on. Tell them to use a plastic board. Cut the chicken tenders into 1-inch pieces across and add them to the stew. Tell the GH to go wash up right away with lots of soap and hot water so that the raw chicken doesn&#39;t get on anything else in the kitchen or any other food. When the stew comes up to a boil again, add the ravioli and leave the lid off. Cook stew until the ravioli is almost done, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the stew cool down a little bit. Have your GH serve up the stew and pass cheese and bread at the table to go with it. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 70707,&quot;Spaghetti with Olives and Tomato Sauce 1 pound dried spaghetti 1/4 cup olive oil 1 1/4 cups mixed olives, pitted and halved 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes, plus more if desired 3 cups tomato sauce, recipe follows 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 cup basil leaves, shredded 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 small onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 stalk celery, chopped 1 carrot, chopped Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes 2 dried bay leaves 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional Instructions: In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil.

Suspend the chicken in the oil for a couple of seconds for it to set before letting it slip completely into the oil, otherwise the chicken will fall and stick to the bottom of the pot. Fry the chicken until golden brown and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes per batch. Transfer to a wire rack to drain as done. Serve with the sauces on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70714,&quot;Pickled Cauliflower Salad with Chanterelles and Fennel 1/2 head cauliflower, cut into very small florets 1 cup champagne vinegar 1/2 cup water 3 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons sugar 2 big shakes hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco) 2 cloves garlic, smashed 3 bay leaves 1/2 pound chanterelles, cleaned and pulled into bite-size pieces Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Crushed red pepper flakes 1 small bulb fennel, sliced very thin on the mandoline, reserve fronds for serving 1 small spring onion, julienned 2 cups washed baby arugula Good quality finishing oil Instructions: Pickled cauliflower: Combine all the ingredients in covered container and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Salad: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small baking pan add the mushrooms, oil, salt, and crushed red pepper, to taste, and toss to coat. Roast until the mushrooms are soft and golden around the edges, about 12 to 15 minutes Toss together the mushrooms, fennel, onion, arugula, fennel fronds, and pickled cauliflower in a large bowl. Toss with some big fat finishing oil and a little of the pickling liquid. Taste and add salt, if needed. The salad should be very flavorful without being soggy. Arrange on individual serving plates and serve. What a salad- it&#39;s springtime on a plate! The pickled cauliflower adds a lot to this salad but it is a MUST DO ahead. Also, a big batch of these can be made and reserved in the refrigerator &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 70715,&quot;Fabulous Focaccia 2 teaspoons rapid-rising dry yeast 1 cup warm water 2 tablespoons sugar 3 1/2 to 4 cups flour 1 tablespoon coarse salt 1/4 cup olive oil Cornmeal, for dusting 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 onion, diced 2 garlic cloves, minced 10 Kalamata olives, pitted and quartered 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan 1 tablespoon coarse salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary Instructions: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook, proof the yeast by combining it with the warm water and sugar. Stir gently to dissolve. Let stand 3 minutes until foam appears. Turn mixer on low and slowly add the flour to the bowl. Dissolve salt in 2 tablespoons of water and add it to the mixture. Pour in 1/4 cup olive oil. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Mix until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, adding flour as necessary. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and fold over itself a few times. Form the dough into a round and place in an oiled bowl, turn to coat the entire ball with oil so it doesn&#39;t form a skin. Cover with plastic wrap or damp towel and let rise over a gas pilot light on the stovetop or other warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Coat a sheet pan with a little olive oil and corn meal. Once the dough is doubled and domed, turn it out onto the counter. Roll and stretch the dough out to an oblong shape about 1/2-inch thick. Lay the flattened dough on the pan and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest for 15 minutes. In the meantime, coat a small saute pan with olive oil, add the onion, and cook over low heat for 15 minutes until the onions caramelize. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Uncover the dough and dimple with your fingertips. Brush the surface with more olive oil and then add caramelized onions, garlic, olives, cheese, salt, pepper, and rosemary. Bake on the bottom rack for 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 70716,&quot;Grilled Brussels Sprouts 1 pound Brussels sprouts, as uniform in size as possible (See Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat a grill to medium. Cut off the stem end of the Brussels sprouts and remove any yellowing outer leaves. Place the Brussels sprouts into a large, microwave safe mixing bowl and heat in the microwave on high for 3 minutes. Add the olive oil, garlic, mustard, paprika and salt and toss to combine. Allow the sprouts to cool until you can handle them. Skewer 4 to 5 Brussels sprouts onto each metal skewer with the stem ends facing in the same direction, leaving at least 1/2-inch in between each sprout. Place the skewers onto the grill with stem end closest to the flame. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Turn the skewers over and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. Serve as is or for additional flavor, remove the sprouts from the skewers, return them to the original mixing bowl and toss with any of the remaining oil and garlic mixture before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70717,&quot;Corned Beef and Cabbage Soup 1 medium onion, quartered 3 stalks celery, quartered 3 medium carrots, quartered 3 tablespoons unsalted butter Heaping 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1 pound plum tomatoes, halved 3 cups low-sodium beef broth 4 cups chopped green cabbage (about 1/4 medium head) 1/2 pound Yukon gold potatoes, chopped 3/4 cup quick-cooking barley 1/4 pound corned beef, cut into thin strips (use leftovers or deli meat)<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Pulse the onion, celery and carrots in a food processor until they are pea-size pieces.<br> Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat.

Put a scoop of rice on a medium oval plate. Put the cabbage on one end of the oval and put the Papaya Pok Pok salad next to or on top of the cabbage. Put Muu Waan Sweet Pork on top of the rice in a strip and garnish with shallots and cilantro. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Clean the excess fat and gristle from the pork butt and cut it into 1-inch thick pieces. Cut along the grain of meat so that long strands will form when the meat is shredded. Marinate the pork pieces in sweet soy. Put the pork in a rondeau, or another round straight-walled pan. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower the heat, cover the pot and cook slowly until pork is almost tender. Turn the heat to high and reduce the liquid until relatively dry, leaving more of a glaze than a liquid. Roughly shred the pork with a stiff whisk and spatula. Do not wait until pork is already falling apart to reduce the liquid. This will produce a dry and tough product. If the pork is accidentally cooked all the way before reducing the liquid, remove the meat from liquid and reduce separately, then return the meat to the pot. Adjust water amount according to the newness of the rice (if the rice is newer then less water will be required). In a rice cooker, combine the water, coconut milk or coconut cream, sugar and salt and mix until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Add the drained rice, and mix thoroughly, making sure the rice is level in the cooker. Cook the rice according to the cooker instructions.<br> Fresh Coconut Milk: Thaw grated coconut. Remove the coconut from the bags, and add to a large bowl. Add 3 cups water per 16-ounce bag of grated coconut. Allow to sit until the water is absorbed, about 1/2 hour. Press the coconut twice through a fine strainer, using the milk from the first pressing to moisten the coconut again, then strain for the last time. Smash the chiles, garlic and palm sugar in a mortar and pestle until the garlic is well ground; do this firmly but not violently. Add the shrimp, mash lightly and then add the long beans. Smash them gently, just to break them up. Add the dressing and the papaya. Combine the ingredients thoroughly without mashing the papaya. Add the tomatoes and crush to release their juices. Stir in the peanuts and combine well. The taste should be sour, salty, sweet and spicy in good balance. The texture should be crunchy and slightly pink in color. Make no more than two servings at a time! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 70719,&quot;Crispy Roasted Porchetta 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup stemmed rosemary 2 tablespoons chopped garlic 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper One 1 1/2- to 2-pound pork belly One 2-pound pork tenderloin 1 cup white wine Aioli, recipe follows 1 clove garlic 1 tablespoon turmeric 2 cups mayonnaise Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the oil, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper in a bowl; mix and set aside. Butterfly and open the pork belly like a book so you can roll the pork tenderloin in two rotations. Smother the pork belly in some of the spice mixture and set the pork belly aside. Smother the pork tenderloin in the spice mixture. Place the pork tenderloin at one end of the pork belly and roll until the pork belly ends meet or overlap. Tie off the porchetta with baker\\u2019s twine or pull baker\\u2019s netting over the porchetta and tie off the ends. Wrap the porchetta in aluminum foil and place on a grill insert inside a deep roasting pan. Pour the wine into the bottom of the roasting pan and cover with foil. Roast for 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the foil. Remove the porchetta from the roasting pan and remove the foil. Place the porchetta on the insert and place back into the oven, uncovered (this will make the pork belly skin crispy). Continue to roast until the pork belly skin has reached the desired crispness, about 1 hour. Remove the porchetta to a cutting board. Slice and serve with the Aioli. Place the garlic in a food processor and mince finely. Add the turmeric and mix. Add the mayonnaise and mix; do not overmix, as the mayonnaise can separate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 70720,&quot;Salami, Bacon and Spinach Hash 8 ounces apple-smoked bacon (5 to 6 slices), cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 medium russet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and chopped into 1-inch cubes 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 3 cups baby spinach leaves 5 ounces dry salami, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg Zest of 1/2 medium orange 4 large eggs, at room temperature Instructions: Cook the bacon over medium-high heat in a 12-inch nonstick skillet, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes.

Line a 10-inch circular springform cake pan with parchment paper. Combine the potato starch, cocoa powder, and flour in a small bowl. Set aside. Melt the chocolate chips, half-and-half together in a double boiler. If you don&#39;t have a double boiler, then bring a pot of water to a simmer, turn the heat off, and melt the chocolate and half-and-half in a bowl set over the hot water, being careful not to get any water into the mixture. Add the brandy, stir to combine, and set aside. Make a meringue by combining 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water in a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then continue cooking until the syrup reaches 240 degrees F. With the wire whip attachment, whip the egg whites in an electric mixer until they form stiff peaks. Pour the hot syrup over the meringue with the mixer running. Continue whipping until cool, and then set aside. Scrape the seeds of the vanilla bean into a large bowl. Alternatively, you may substitute 1 teaspoon vanilla extract for the vanilla bean, but the flavor will not be as spectacular. Add the egg yolks and 1/3 cup sugar to the bowl and whisk until the ingredients have developed some body. Add the melted chocolate mixture and blend. Add the potato starch mixture, and stir until just combined. Fold in 1/3 of the meringue with a rubber spatula, and then fold in remaining meringue. Pour batter into the prepared pan, and bake for 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake has crusted, it does not jiggle, and the cake sticks to a toothpick when inserted in the center of the cake. Let cake cool completely on a wire rack. Pulse the almonds in a food processor until they form large crumbles. Leave the ground almonds in the food processor. Bring heavy cream to a simmer in a double boiler or in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Melt the sugar in a copper pot, and then slowly drizzle in the cream, stirring with wooden spoon. Continue stirring, as the mixture will bubble rapidly. When the cream and sugar are combined, pour into the food processor through the feed tube while it is running. Stop processing when the mixture forms a ball. Using hands well dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar, roll almond mixture into a ball, and place it between 2 sheets of dusted parchment paper. With a rolling pin, and using a very gentle motion, roll from the center in a direction away from you until you have a disk about 10 inches in diameter. Remove 1 layer of parchment paper, invert the cooled cake, remove the other layer of parchment paper, place it onto a cake board, flip over the cake, and remove the parchment from the top of the cake. Dust the sides of the cake with powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 70724,&quot;Mixed Baby Greens With Mustard Vinaigrette 1/2 small shallot, chopped 1 tablespoon dry mustard 3 tablespoon red wine vinegar Salt and pepper 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound mixed baby greens, rinsed and spun dry Instructions: In a bowl, combine the shallot, mustard, vinegar and season with salt and pepper.

Coat two 9-inch cake pans and one 9-inch pie dish with cooking spray, then line with parchment and spray the parchment. Combine the cake mix and pudding mix in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed to blend. With the speed still on low, add the oil, egg whites and 1 1/2 cups water and mix until combined. Raise the speed to medium and mix until increased in volume, lighter in color and smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the tops with an offset spatula or butter knife. Bake until golden on top and the edges pull away from the pans, about 20 minutes for the pie pan and 25 minutes for the cake pans. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely in the pans, then unmold, remove the parchment and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.<br> For the Swiss buttercream: Meanwhile, bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a heatproof stand mixer bowl above the water without the bottom of the bowl touching it. Add the sugar, lemon juice, salt and egg whites to the mixer bowl and whisk together by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and heat, whisking, until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar is dissolved. Transfer to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until cool and the whites hold stiff peaks, 10 to 15 minutes. With the motor running on medium-high speed, add the butter a couple of pieces at a time, making sure the pieces are completely incorporated before adding more. After all the butter is added, continue beating on medium-high speed. The mixture will deflate and appear curdled. Continue beating until the buttercream comes back together to form a smooth and spreadable consistency. Slowly drizzle in the vanilla while beating until smooth and light. (If the frosting is very soft or begins to break, refrigerate until set but still spreadable and then beat until light before using.) Scoop 2 cups of the buttercream into a medium bowl and mix in 3 drops of deep pink gel food coloring; the buttercream should be the same color as the pink animal crackers. Transfer 1/4 cup of the pink buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a small round piping tip. Cover the remaining pink buttercream in the bowl with plastic wrap. Scoop 1/2 cup of the white buttercream into a medium bowl and mix in 1 drop royal blue and 2 drops neon brite green gel food coloring to make teal. Transfer to a piping bag with a small star tip. Transfer 1/4 cup white buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Cover the remaining white buttercream in the bowl with plastic wrap. For the assembly: Mix 1 drop pink food coloring into the melted candy. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Put 8 animal crackers--both pink and white--on the baking sheet flat-side up. Spoon a small amount of melted candy onto each cracker and press on a chocolate-covered biscuit stick so the cracker is glued to the top third of the stick. Repeat with 8 more sticks and crackers, attaching the crackers to the bottom third of the sticks. Refrigerate until set, about 5 minutes.<br> For the carousel base: If the tops of the cakes have domed, carefully trim them with a long serrated knife so that they are flat on top. Place one of the cake rounds on a 10-inch cake board. Spread the top with 1 cup white buttercream and cover with 3 tablespoons sprinkles. Top with the second cake round. Frost the whole cake with 1 cup white buttercream to crumb coat. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.<br> Frost the cake with the reserved pink buttercream. Pipe white lines of buttercream down the sides of the cake every 2 inches to create panels. Press white animal crackers into every other panel. Pipe a shell border around the top and bottom edge of the cake with the teal buttercream and top the border with sprinkles. Refrigerate the cake until ready to assemble.<br> For the carousel top: Wrap a 10-inch cake board with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic on one side is smooth and taut. Place the pie-shaped cake layer on the white side of a 6-inch cake board with the wider side of the cake facing up. Frost the cake with a thick layer of white buttercream. Put the smooth side of the 10-inch board against the top of the cake and flip it over so the 6-inch board is now on top. Frost the angled sides of the cake with white buttercream. Pipe pink buttercream lines down the angled sides every 2 inches, creating panels. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.<br> Place a second 10-inch cake board on top of the 6-inch board and flip the carousel top back over. Gently peel the plastic-covered board off the top. (If you have difficulty doing this, chill the cake 15 minutes more. You can also gently loosen the edge of the buttercream from the plastic using a warm offset spatula). The top of your cake should be flat and smooth.<br> Re-melt the melted candy. Pipe a shell border around the edge of the pie-shaped cake with the teal buttercream and top with sprinkles. With kitchen shears, trim 4 strawberry cream-covered biscuit sticks to 3 inches, gather them in a bundle and press them into the top of the center of the cake; they should stand upright like a column. Dip the coated ends of 10 strawberry biscuits in the melted candy and insert the uncoated ends around the rim of the cake, angling the sticks toward the center column like the spokes of a wheel. Dip the bottom of the gumdrop in the melted candy and affix to the top of the column. Refrigerate until ready to assemble. For the center column: Spread 1 teaspoon of white buttercream in the center of a second 6-inch cake board and top with a doughnut. Spread it with buttercream, add another doughnut, more buttercream and the last doughnut. Insert 3 chocolate biscuit sticks through the center holes of the doughnuts and trim to the height of the doughnut stack. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.<br> Frost the doughnut stack with white buttercream. Press 8 strawberry biscuit sticks against the side of the doughnut stack 1 inch apart. Press 6 animal crackers into the buttercream between the biscuit sticks, using a little buttercream to get them to adhere if necessary. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.<br> To assemble: Carefully transfer the doughnut stack to the middle of the carousel base. Insert the cookie sticks with the animal crackers around the rim of the cake, alternating heights and pushing them 1 inch into the cake. Carefully transfer the top of the carousel to rest on top of the doughnuts (leave the 6-inch board on the underside for support).<br> Serve the cake on a lazy Susan or rotating cake stand. To serve, remove the carousel top and cut the base into wedges.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70726,&quot;Kid-Friendly Chicken Fingers 1 lb. chicken tenders 1 cup low-fat buttermilk 1 teaspoon salt, divided 1 teaspoon pepper, divided 1/2 box shredded wheat cereal, crushed (cornflakes or textured soy protein can be substituted) 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1/2 cup honey 1 cup light sour cream or non-fat Greek yogurt 1 tablespoon packaged ranch dressing seasoning Canola oil Instructions: Combine the buttermilk, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.

Set aside. Saute the onions and leeks in the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed 16 to 20 quart stockpot over medium heat for 15 minutes, until the onions start to brown. Layer the ingredients on top of the onions in the stockpot in this order: first the potatoes, salt, and pepper; then the kielbasa, little neck clams, steamer clams, mussels, shrimp, and lobsters. Pour in the white wine. Cover the pot tightly and cook over medium-high heat until steam just begins to escape from the lid, about 15 minutes. Lower the heat to medium and cook another 15 minutes. The clambake should be done. Test to be sure the potatoes are tender, the lobsters are cooked, and the clams and mussels are open. Remove the lobsters to a wooden board, cut them up, and crack the claws. With large slotted spoons, remove the seafood, potatoes, and sausages to a large bowl and top with the lobsters. Season the broth in the pot to taste, and ladle over the seafood, being very careful to avoid any sand in the bottom. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 70728,&quot;Pan Seared Salmon with Haricots Verts Salad 1 pound haricots verts (very thin string beans) 2 limes 1/4 cup fresh rosemary leaves 1/8 cup fresh tarragon leaves 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves 3 tablespoons stone-ground mustard 1/8 cup rice wine vinegar 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger 1/2 cup grapeseed oil (or your choice of olive or canola oil), plus 1/4 cup 1/8 cup bottled water 2 tomatoes, seeds removed and finely diced 1 medium red onion, finely diced Six 6-ounce salmon fillets, skin on Salt and pepper or adobo seasoning Instructions: First blanch the haricots verts in salted boiling water until al dente (or cooked to your liking). Once this is done, drain the beans into a strainer or colander and then they should be shocked by dunking the strainer of beans into a waiting bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process, which will also help them retain a great color. Drain and set aside in refrigerator until needed.<br> Place 1 of the limes in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave it until the essential oils in the skin are released. These limes will be hot coming from the microwave, so you can let them cool before squeezing them. Turn on the blender and through the feed tube, add the rosemary, tarragon, cilantro, stone-ground mustard, rice wine vinegar, and fresh ginger, and blend together until a smooth paste has formed. At this point the limes should be cool enough to squeeze. With the power on, add the lime juice through the blender feed-tube, and then very slowly add the oil and water until the mixture thickens and can coat the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside in refrigerator until needed. (When chilled, the dressing should resemble something like mayonnaise.)<br> Reserve some of the dressing to drizzle on the plate later. Then, mix the beans, tomato, and onions with the dressing (adjusting the amount to your preference) and refrigerate for only a couple of hours. (Don&#39;t mix too far ahead, because the salad ingredients will bleed and you will have a very runny dressing).<br> Heat a large saute pan or heavy skillet for about 3 minutes over high heat. Season the salmon fillets with your choice of seasoning. Add the oil carefully, a little bit at a time, to the pan swirling it around to coat the sides. Place the salmon, flesh side down, and leave untouched for about 3 minutes. (Do not shake the pan! You are trying to get the fish&#39;s natural sugars to come to the surface in this browning process.) After about 3 minutes, use a spatula to turn the fish over and cook the other side. The fish will cook quickly, although cooking time will vary according to the thickness of the fillet. Do not overcook it. When you touch the flesh and it springs back, it is done. Remove the fish to a platter and let it rest for a couple of minutes. This rest time is very important; it will allow the juices to flow back into the fish.

To make the spice rub: Mix the ras el hanout, cumin, cinnamon, ginger, paprika, salt, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Put the beef into a large bowl, massage it with the spice rub, then cover with plastic wrap or clingfilm and put into the refrigerator for a couple of hours-ideally overnight. That way the spices really penetrate and flavour the meat. When you&#39;re ready to cook, heat a generous lug of olive oil in a tagine or casserole-type pan and fry the meat over a medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the chopped onion and coriander (cilantro) stalks and fry for another 5 minutes. Tip in the chickpeas and tomatoes, then pour in 1 3/4 cups/400 ml stock and stir. Bring to the boil, then put the lid on the pan or cover with foil and reduce to a simmer for 1 1/2 hours. At this point add your squash, the prunes and the rest of the stock. Give everything a gentle stir, then pop the lid back on the pan and continue cooking for another 1 1/2 hours. Keep an eye on it and add a splash of water if it looks too dry. Once the time is up, take the lid off and check the consistency. If it seems a bit too runny, simmer for 5 to 10 minutes more with the lid off. The beef should be really tender and flaking apart now, so have a taste and season with a pinch or 2 of salt. Scatter the coriander (cilantro) leaves over the tagine along with the toasted almonds, then take it straight to the table with a big bowl of lightly seasoned couscous and dive in. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 70734,&quot;Mustard Herb Chicken Cutlets and Garlic Spinach Four 6-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons salted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 cup dry white wine<br> 2 heaping tablespoons grainy mustard<br> 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth<br> 1/2 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs, such as dill, parsley or chives, plus more for garnish<br> Garlic Spinach, recipe follows 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 garlic cloves, minced<br> Two 10-ounce packages baby spinach leaves<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> Instructions: Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally so that you have 8 thinner chicken breast cutlets. Sprinkle both sides of each cutlet with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add half the chicken cutlets and cook until golden brown and completely cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the cutlets to a plate and set aside. Cook the remaining cutlets in the same manner. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic to the skillet and stir until golden brown, about 1 minute. Carefully pour in the wine and allow it to simmer and reduce by half, 1 to 2 more minutes. Stir in the mustard, followed by the chicken broth. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and stir until the sauce begins to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes. Season the pan sauce with salt and pepper. Add the herbs and stir. Return the chicken cutlets to the skillet, turning them in the sauce to coat and to rewarm them. Serve on top of the Garlic Spinach. Spoon more sauce from the skillet over them and garnish each plate with more fresh herbs. Heat the olive oil in a large, high-sided skillet over medium-high heat until hot, then add the garlic and give it a quick stir.

Starting from the middle of the dough, and using your fingertips, push the dough out to the corners of the pan and all the way up the sides.<br> Make a pepperoni border (slightly overlapping the meat) around the bottom edge of the dough (about 8 pepperonis per side). Put 1 cheese stick on top of the pepperoni on each side, then fold down the dough from the edges of the pan to cover them. Push the dough with the pepperoni and cheese inside back tightly against the sides of the pan. Seal the dough around the pepperoni and cheese by pressing and pinching the dough together. You now have a stuffed crust. Cover the dough in the bottom of the pan (but not the crust) with the remaining pepperoni.<br> Pull each of the remaining 4 cheese sticks into 4 long pieces. Put half the cheese pieces evenly on top of the crust along the edges of the dough so that they are touching the sides of the pan. Put the remaining cheese pieces over the pepperoni in the middle. Sprinkle the entire pizza with Parmesan. Cover with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place until puffy, about 30 minutes. Position an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven, put a baking sheet on the rack and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.

Bring the remaining stock to a boil, whisk in the flour paste, and continue stirring until the soup thickens. Add the leeks, celery and peas with the sugar, salt and pepper. Cover the soup and simmer until the vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Five minutes before the end of cooking, stir in the lettuce. Croutons: Trim the crust from the bread and cut it into 1/4 inch dice. Heat enough butter or oil in a frying pan so that the croutons will float. Fry the croutons over medium heat until they are evenly browned on all sides. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels. To serve, taste the soup and adjust the seasoning. Spoon it into bowls and serve the croutons separately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70751,&quot;Salsa Marinara 1 cup minced onion 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/3 cup olive oil 2 pounds firm ripe tomatoes, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces or two 28-ounce cans peeled, whole Italian plum tomatoes Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste Instructions: In a large saucepan set over moderate heat cook the onion, garlic and oil, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and salt and pepper. Simmer, covered, stirring occasionally for 20 minutes. If desired, puree the mixture in a food processor or blender or through the disk of a food mill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 70752,&quot;Chirashizushi 2 cups sushi rice 1/3 cup rice vinegar 1 tablespoon sugar Kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds assorted sushi-grade raw fish (such as tuna, salmon, yellowtail and/or squid), cut into thin slices roughly 2-by-1 inch 1/4 cup salmon roe or 2 tablespoons flying fish roe 8 to 12 thin slices peeled Japanese or English cucumber (cut on the diagonal) Handful daikon radish sprouts Handful julienned toasted seaweed (kizami nori) 4 thin slices lemon, optional 4 shiso leaves, optional Sliced pickled ginger, for serving Wasabi, for serving Soy sauce, for serving Instructions: For the sushi rice: Rinse the rice under cold water until the water is completely clear. Place the rice and 3 cups water in a large saucepan and let it soak for 30 minutes. Bring the water and rice to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook, covered, until tender, about 20 minutes. Keep covered and remove from the heat; let sit for 10 minutes. (This process will yield about 6 cups cooked rice.) Whisk together the vinegar, sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a small bowl until the sugar and salt dissolve. Place the rice in a large bowl and evenly sprinkle the vinegar mixture over the top. While fanning the rice (see Cook\\u2019s Note), use a rice paddle or wooden spoon to quickly cut in and then gently fold the ingredients together until thoroughly combined and no more steam comes off the rice, about 10 minutes. Cover the rice with a damp towel to prevent it from drying out and set aside until just above room temperature, about 10 minutes more. For the toppings: When the rice is ready, divide it among 4 bowls or shallow vessels. (Alterna-tively, you can assemble the chirashi on 1 large platter.) Top with the fish, roe, cucumber, radish sprouts and seaweed, either in groups or scattered, leaving a small space for the shiso (if using), ginger and wasabi. For serving: Tuck a lemon slice if using along the side of each bowl. Lay a shiso leaf if using on the rice. Place some ginger and a dab of wasabi on each leaf. Serve with soy sauce in 4 very small dishes. You can mix the wasabi into the soy sauce and dip the sliced fish into it as you eat. You can also drizzle the soy-wasabi mixture over the chirashi, although that can make the rice wet and difficult to scoop up. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o, Vermentino]&quot; 70753,&quot;Lynn&#39;s Margaritas Juice of 1 lime Kosher salt, to taste 2 ounces clear tequila 1 ounce triple sec Instructions: Halve the lime and run it along the rim of a 6 to 8 ounce glass to moisten it.

Reserve. In a medium heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, water, lemon juice, lemon peel and vanilla extract. Cook, stirring, until the sugar melts. Increase the heat to high and cook until the mixture is golden amber in color. (Do not stir the mixture once you have stirred the mixture.) Remove the caramel from the heat. One at a time, dip the apples and pears in the caramel, twirling and swirling them to coat completely. Transfer the coated fruit to a wire rack and let the caramel harden, about 10 to 15 minutes. Continue dipping the apples and pears until all have been coated with the caramel. Store the caramel apples in pears in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator), wrapped in cellophane if desired, until ready to serve up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 70755,&quot;Ruthie&#39;s Potato Pancakes 1 large Idaho Baking potato 4 vegetable oil Salt and pepper Instructions: Peel and quarter potato lengthwise. Grate in food processor on course blade. Make little mounds of potato, about the size of a sliver dollar, on a baking sheet. Flatten slightly with palm of hand. Pancakes should have a spider like quality. Heat oil in medium skillet over medium high heat. Saute pancakes until golden on one side, about 3 to 5 minutes. Turn and brown on other side, another 3 to five minutes. Transfer to paper towel lined plate.

Make foil &#39;snake&#39; out of aluminum foil to use to keep oven door slightly ajar so that broiler won&#39;t turn off if it gets too hot. Brush steak with oil and salt and pepper, to taste. Place a piece of foil on the bottom rack as a drip pan. Place another rack in the position above this and put the steak directly on this rack. Cook steak in this position for 5 minutes. Flip steak and cook for another 5 minutes. Move rack with steak to top position in oven, moving rack with foil and drippings just underneath, and cook for 3 minutes. Flip 1 last time and cook for another 3 minutes. Transfer steak to wire rack and rest for 3 to 5 minutes. The above times are for medium doneness. Adjust cooking times up or down as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 70757,&quot;Panda Slice-and-Bake Cookies 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg, plus 1 egg beaten for egg wash 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract White gel food coloring Black gel food coloring 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon meringue powder Red water-based food coloring<br> Instructions: Make the cookies: Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla until incorporated. Reduce the mixer speed to low, add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Remove 3/4 cup dough and set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon white food coloring to the remaining dough in the bowl and mix on low until evenly colored white. Reserve 1 tablespoon white dough and turn the rest out into a ball and set aside. Clean out the bowl and the beaters and place the reserved 3/4 cup dough back into the bowl. Add 5 drops black food coloring and beat on low until evenly colored a deep black. Turn out into a ball.<br> Make the face: Cut one-third off the white ball of dough (about 1/2 cup). Form into a 1/2-inch-thick 10-by-2-inch rectangle. Set aside. Roll the remaining white dough into a 10-inch log. Use a ruler or your fingers to slightly flatten the top, then roll the log back and forth so that the bottom rounds out a bit. Put on a baking sheet. Roll the reserved 1 tablespoon of white dough into a thin 10-inch rope and set aside. Make the eyes and ears: Cut the black dough into three even pieces (about 1/4 cup each), then cut one piece in half. To make the ears, roll the half pieces into 10-inch ropes. Put on the baking sheet. Set aside and keep at room temperature. To make the eyes, roll the remaining two pieces of black dough into 10-inch ropes. Flatten the sides with your fingers, so that the top and bottom are still round. The ropes should be about 1/2-inch tall. Assemble the cookie: Brush the flat side of the white log with egg wash. Place the skinny white rope in the middle of the flat log. Pinch the sides so that it has a pointed top, almost like a triangle. Place the two eye ropes, flat side down, lengthwise across the flat side of the white log, on either side of the white strip, with the top of the white between them. Press the eyes down into the log (this will keep the eyes in place while assembling the rest of the cookie and give them a downturned shape).<br> Place the room temperature rectangular piece of dough on top of the two black eye ropes and press the dough down over the sides so that the entire surface is covered. Use your finger to smooth out the sides. Cut a slit down the length of an empty paper towel roll and pull it open so you can place the dough inside. Wrap the roll around the dough and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. This will help the cookies keep their round shape. Refrigerate 1 hour.<br> Brush the top of the dough log with more egg wash and adhere the ear ropes lengthwise on the outer edges of the log. Press them into the dough so that they are oval shaped. Refrigerate until hardened, about 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut 1/4 inch off each end of the log with a very sharp knife to reveal the panda face. Slice the log into cookies about 1/4-inch-thick. Arrange the slices 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until crisp and just starting to turn brown on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon water and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water if needed, about 2 minutes. Take a third of the icing and transfer to a small resealable plastic bag. Add 1/4 teaspoon black gel food coloring to the remaining icing and whisk to combine. Transfer the black icing to another small resealable plastic bag. Snip a very small piece off one corner of each bag. Pipe a nose and smile on the center of each cookie with the black icing. Use the white icing to pipe small circles in the center of each eye. Let the icing harden completely, about 20 minutes. Mix 1 drop red water-based food coloring with 2 tablespoons water. Dip your finger into the red liquid and brush a small pink circle each cheek of the pandas.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70758,&quot;Black Bean Sopes 1 (18-ounce) package prepared polenta 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained 1 1/4 cups jarred salsa 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons hot sauce 1/2 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 cup shredded lettuce Instructions: Slice the polenta in half crosswise. Then slice each half into 6 rounds, about 1/2-inch thick, so that you have 12 rounds total. Heat the canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Gently slide each polenta round into the hot oil using a spatula. If your pan is not large enough then fry 6 at a time. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper towel-lined sheet tray. In a medium bowl, combine the beans, salsa and the 2 teaspoons hot sauce. Mash the beans with a fork or potato masher. In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, remaining 1 tablespoon hot sauce and the lime juice and mix until well blended. Build the sopes by spreading about 2 tablespoons mashed black beans on top of a fried polenta round. Top with a small amount of shredded lettuce and about 1 tablespoon of the salsa and drizzle with some of the sour cream mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 70759,&quot;Drunken Angel Food Cake with Tequila and Lime 1/4 cup lime juice 1 lime, zested and juiced 1/2 cup super-fine sugar Pinch salt 1/2 cup tequila 1/2 box confectioners&#39; sugar Pinch salt 1 lime, zested 1 cup tequila 1 cup lime juice Store bought angel food cake Store bought candied lime zest Whipped cream Instructions: To make the syrup, combine all of the ingredients except the tequila in a saucepot and bring to a boil, stirring constantly until the sugar has melted. Remove syrup from heat, add the tequila, and cool to room temperature. For the icing, place the sugar, salt, and lime zest in a bowl. Add the liquids a little at a time until the mixture is just loose enough to pour. Be careful not to add too much liquid, but if you do, add more sugar as needed. To finish, hold the cake upside down and cut a little well around the bottom of the cake. Pour half of the syrup evenly over the cake. Turn the cake over, and using a pastry brush, paint the cake with the remaining syrup. Drizzle the icing over the cake. Sprinkle with candied lime zest. Slice and serve with whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Tequila Sunrise, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70760,&quot;Chocolate Mousse 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped 4 tablespoons softened salted butter<br> 2 cups heavy cream<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 4 large egg yolks<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1 tablespoon raspberry preserves<br> Marbled Chocolate Curls, recipe follows 2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate 2 ounces white chocolate<br> 4 teaspoons coconut oil<br> Instructions: For the mousse: Melt the chocolate and butter in a double boiler. Remove and allow to cool a little. Add the cream to a large bowl and start to whip using a hand mixer. Slowly add the sugar and continue to whip until you have stiff peaks, 4 to 5 minutes. Place the egg yolks in a pitcher, add the vanilla and whisk together by hand. Temper the egg yolks by adding a little of the melted chocolate to them and whisking together. Pour the yolks into the bowl of melted chocolate and stir in gently. Fold three-fourths of the whipped cream into the chocolate, reserving the rest. Divide between 4 serving glasses. Gently fold the raspberry preserves into the reserved whipped cream until you achieve a swirled appearance. Spoon some of the swirled whipped cream on top of the mousse in each glass. Place the glasses into the fridge and chill for 1 hour. Remove from the fridge and decorate with Marbled Chocolate Curls before serving. Add the semi-sweet and white chocolate to separate small microwave-safe bowls or pitchers. Add 2 teaspoons of the coconut oil to each. Pop in the microwave together for 1 minute. Stir each until smooth, microwaving for another 10 to 15 seconds, if needed, to fully melt the chocolate. Lay a sheet pan on the counter upside down. Start by pouring the white chocolate in a zig-zag pattern over the underside of the cookie sheet; do not get too close to the edges. Repeat with the semi-sweet chocolate, making sure to fill the holes where there is no white chocolate. Using an offset spatula or knife, spread the chocolates in a very thin layer, then stick the sheet pan in the freezer for 2 to 3 minutes. This step is key! After a few minutes, check the chocolate by pressing it with your finger; it should leave only the slightest mark, but not an actual depression. Using a somewhat sharp-edged spatula, scrap the chocolate from the bottom of the pan. If the chocolate is the correct temperature, it should begin to curl. If the chocolate is breaking, it is too cold so let it sit for a few seconds to warm, then try again. If it gets too soft, stick it back in the freezer for a minute. Pretty soon you will have some pretty marbled chocolate curls. Use as a garnish immediately on chilled desserts or immediately transfer to a cold plate and place back in the freezer to harden. Store in an airtight container in the freezer until you need them. The curls are perfect for topping your favorite pies, cakes or elevating a simple fruit platter. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 70761,&quot;Melting Ice Cream Cone Cake Flour-based baking spray, for greasing the cake pans 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar 5 eggs, at room temperature 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup whole milk, at room temperature 1 cup pastel rainbow confetti sprinkles 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 2 pounds confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon clear vanilla extract 1/3 to 2/3 cup heavy cream Lavender gel food color 6 ounces white chocolate, chopped (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/3 cup heavy cream Pink gel food color Reserved cake scraps 2 to 4 tablespoons reserved buttercream frosting 1 sugar cone for ice cream 1/2 cup large and small pastel rainbow confetti sprinkles Instructions: For the confetti cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease four 8-inch round cake pans with flour-based baking spray and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture alternately with the milk in three additions; begin and end with the flour. Mix on low speed until the batter is smooth and thoroughly combined. Fold in the confetti sprinkles. Bake the cakes for 25 to 35 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when pressed in their centers. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Turn out onto cooling racks. Let cool completely. Level the cakes using a large serrated knife or cake leveling tool. Transfer the cake scraps to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Reserve these for later use. For the buttercream frosting: Cream the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar together on low speed in the bowl of an electric mixer. When the mixture is combined, increase the speed to high and whip until light in color. Turn the mixer off and add the vanilla extract and 1/3 cup heavy cream. Beat again until the frosting is light and fluffy. Add additional heavy cream if the mixture is too thick to spread or pipe.<br> Remove two-thirds of the white frosting from the mixing bowl and transfer to a separate bowl; cover with a damp towel to prevent the frosting from drying out. Tint the remaining frosting with the lavender gel food color. Add a little at a time until you reach the desired color intensity. Transfer the lavender frosting to a piping bag fitted with a decorator tip with a 1/2-inch round opening (plain pastry tube 806). Transfer half of the reserved white frosting to a piping bag fitted with a decorator tip with a 1/2-inch round opening (plain pastry tube 806). Use the remaining white frosting to fill the cake layers and apply a thin crumb coat to the outside of the cake. Use an offset spatula or bench scraper to even the frosting. Place the cake in the refrigerator to chill until the frosting is firm, about 30 minutes. You will have a little frosting left over and this should be reserved for later use. After the crumb coat layer is well-chilled, use the piping bags with white and lavender frostings to apply alternating colors of frosting around the sides of the cake. Make the lines fat and even. Using a cake turntable is recommended, as it makes this job easier. Place a bench scraper or cake icing smoother vertically to the side of the frosted cake. Carefully scrape away some of the frosting in a single motion until stripes are revealed. You may need to make several passes before the frosting is completely even. Wipe frosting away from the scraper after each use. Apply frosting to the top of the cake, making it as level as possible. Transfer the cake to the refrigerator to chill while you prepare the pink ganache.<br> For the pink ganache: Place the chocolate and cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 100 percent power for 30 seconds and then stir until completely melted and smooth. Add pink food color a little at a time until the desired hue is achieved.<br> Remove the cake from the refrigerator. At this point the cake should be firm enough to transfer to a cake stand using a spatula; do this now if desired. Use a spoon to drizzle some of the ganache onto the center of the cake, avoiding the edges. Use a spoon to gently push the pooled ganache over the edges of the cake to create a drip effect. Reserve the unused ganache. For the ice cream cone cake pop and assembly: Crumble the reserved cake scraps using your fingers. Transfer the crumbs to a large bowl and add 2 tablespoons of the reserved buttercream. Mix until thoroughly combined. The mixture should hold together when squeezed in the palm of your hand. If it is too crumbly, add more buttercream 1 tablespoon at a time until the correct consistency is achieved. Pack two handfuls of the mixture into a ball the size of a scoop of ice cream (you may place the ball against the sugar cone to gauge size). Roll it until the outside is as smooth as possible. Pack more of the mixture into the sugar cone and insert a lollipop stick into the center. Thread the ball onto the lollipop stick and press it onto the top of the sugar cone. Use a spoon to cover the ball with the leftover pink ganache. If the ganache is firm, reheat at 10-second intervals in the microwave until smooth and pourable. Allow the excess ganache to drip back into the bowl.<br> Turn the ice cream pop upside down and insert it into the cake at a slight angle. Pour more ganache over the ball portion if needed to make it opaque. Cover the ice cream ball portion with sprinkles. Use a mixture of large and small confetti sprinkles to decorate the top edge and bottom edge of the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70762,&quot;Shrimp and Lobster Bangers and Mash 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined, 30 to 40 count 4 ounces lobster meat, cooked 3 cloves garlic, split 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley 1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning 3/4 teaspoon sea salt Pinch ground white pepper Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1 egg white, whisked to medium peaks Juice of 1 lemon 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 50 inches pork casing, soaked in warm water 6 large Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks, stored in water until cooking 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature Salt and ground white pepper 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 cup orange juice 2 tablespoons yellow onion, small dice 1 tablespoon horseradish 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 1/4 cup diced bacon 1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion 2 cups Brussels sprouts, split and steamed White wine, for deglazing Salt and ground pepper Chopped fresh tarragon, for garnish Instructions: For the bangers: Using a meat grinder or food mill, grind the shrimp, lobster and garlic together into a large bowl. Then add the parsley, tarragon, seafood seasoning, salt, pepper, nutmeg, egg white and lemon juice to the bowl. Mix well with a spoon, ensuring not to over mix. TIP: Take a small bit of the mix and put it in boiling water for a second, take it out and make sure the seasoning is good. If you need more salt or pepper, this is the time to do it, before you fill the casings. To prepare the sausages, poke a small hole at the end of your casing, and then tie end of casing toward end of casing. Next, fill the casing according to the instructions that come with the equipment you are using, or with a pastry bag. While filling, twist or tie the casing every 5 to 6 inches to form each link until end of the casing, and then tie off the casing. To poach the sausages, in a large saucepan, bring water to a boil, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the links and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Then remove the sausages, repeat the process with the remaining sausages and then let rest to cool. To sear or crust the sausages, in a saute pan over high heat, add 1 teaspoon of oil, sear the sausages on all four sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side, and then repeat the process until all the sausages have been cooked. While sausages are cooling, begin to prepare your potatoes. In a 1 gallon pot, bring 10 cups water to a boil. Then add the potatoes and cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes. After cooking, remove from the water and strain. Then, using a ricer, process the potatoes through the ricer (or a food mill) into a bowl. If you don&#39;t have a ricer or food mill, you can use mixer with a whisk attachment, mixing on high to smooth. After ricing the potatoes, add the butter and season with salt and pepper. Finish with heavy cream, stirring in. For the sauce: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the orange juice and onions and bring to a simmer. Reduce the juice to 1/2 cup, and then stir in the horseradish. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter to finish. Hold warm until serving.<br> For the sprouts: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the oil and warm. Then add the bacon and cook for 2 minutes, stirring throughout. Next, add the onions and again cook for 2 minutes; the onions should be softened. Next, deglaze the pan with wine. Stir and add the Brussels sprouts, cooking until browned on edges, 8 to 9 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, place potatoes on plates and top with Brussels sprouts, then sausage. Drizzle with the sauce and finish with tarragon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70763,&quot;Bitter Melon and Gin 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 cup diced bitter melon, seeds reserved<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 Granny Smith apple, thinly sliced<br> 1/3 lemon, zested<br> 5 blackberries<br> 5 blueberries<br> 2 cherries, pitted 4 ounces gin, chilled<br> 2 fresh mint sprigs, for garnish<br> Instructions: Heat up the rice wine vinegar, 1/4 cup water, the sugar and diced bitter melon in a saucepan.

Add 3 or 4 more tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix with your hands until the dough comes together. Knead until soft and pliable, then gather into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and set aside, 30 minutes. Roll the dough into Ping-Pong-size balls, moistening your hands with water to keep the dough from sticking. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap; keep covered with more plastic as you roll the rest of the dough. First, set a large griddle over two burners; heat one side to medium-low and the other to medium-high (or use two cast-iron skillets). Cut a circle slightly larger than your tortilla press from a large resealable plastic bag; include the seam of the bag in your circle so that the two circles remain attached on one side. Place a dough ball between the plastic rounds and flatten in a tortilla press into a 5-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. (If you don&#39;t have a tortilla press, use a coffee can to flatten the dough.) Peel off the top piece of plastic; flip the tortilla onto your hand and peel off the bottom piece of plastic. Ease the tortilla onto the cooler side of the griddle and cook until it is slightly dry around the edges and starts to peel away from the griddle, about 45 seconds. Transfer to the hotter side of the griddle, uncooked-side down. Cook until speckled on the bottom, about 1 minute, then flip and cook until puffed in spots, about 1 more minute. Press and cook the remaining tortillas; stack them in a cloth-lined basket and cover with the cloth, or wrap in foil and keep warm in a 250 degrees F oven. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 70783,&quot;French Buttercream 2 large eggs plus 6 large egg yolks 1 1/2 cups sugar Pinch kosher salt 12 ounces (24 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Place the whole eggs and yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until the eggs are pale yellow and thick, about 5 minutes. (The eggs will hold an indent made with your finger for a few seconds.) Meanwhile, pour the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and bring to the soft-ball stage, without stirring, 240 degrees F. Begin whipping the eggs again on medium-high speed and slowly drizzle in the hot syrup, aiming the syrup between the side of the bowl and the beaters. Continue to whip until both the bottom of the bowl and the mixture are cool, 10 to 15 minutes. The mixture should be thick, but will not form a peak at this point. Beat in the salt. While still beating on medium-high, add the butter, a few pieces at a time. As the butter is added, the buttercream may appear to thin out some, but it will thicken into firm peaks once all of the butter is added. Beat in the vanilla extract.

Add the butter and shortening. Work the butter into the flour using a dough cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. Add the egg with, 5 tablespoons cold water and the vinegar. Stir the mixture until just combined. Divide the dough in half and chill until needed. Once chilled, sprinkle the cutting board or counter liberally with flour. Roll half of the dough into a large circle and place in a standard pie pan. Crimp the edges according to desired look. Reserve the other half of dough for another use. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Next, make the filling: Mix the white sugar, brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, butter, vanilla and eggs together in a bowl. Pour the pecans in the bottom of the unbaked pie shell. Pour syrup mixture over the top. Cover top and crust lightly/gently with foil. Bake the pie for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, and then continue baking for 20 minutes, being careful not to burn the crust or pecans. The pie should not be overly jiggly when you remove it from the oven (though it will jiggle a bit). If it shakes a lot, cover with foil and bake until set, an additional 20 minutes.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and lightly butter it, set aside. If hazelnuts are raw, toast them in the oven, and then rub the skins off in a clean, dry dishtowel. Blanch toasted hazelnuts in boiling water for 30 seconds and then immediately chill them in ice water. Squeeze the nuts through the skins. Grind the hazelnuts in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade with 5 ounces confectioners&#39; sugar, until smooth and fine, approximately 10 to 15 seconds. Whisk together the hazelnut powder, 2 ounces confectioners&#39; sugar, and flour lightly. In a standing mixer, whip the egg whites on medium speed. When whites begin to foam, increase speed to high. When whites are at stiff peak, pour in the extra-fine sugar. Fold in dry ingredients in 3 additions. Pour meringue mixture into piping bag without a tip. Pipe teardrop shapes with 2-inch diameter bottoms onto prepared sheet pan. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes. Meringues will puff and begin to burst when finished baking. Meringues will be crispy on the outside but soft in the middle. Serve immediately, or let cool and fill or top with ganache. In a small sauce pan heat the heavy cream, vanilla bean, and Frangelico to a simmer. Place chocolate into a metal bowl. Once the cream simmers, remove the vanilla bean and pour it over the chocolate, stir until smooth. Let it cool to room temperature. With a rubber spatula, scrape ganache into a pastry bag fitted with a medium size star tip, and pipe into Hazelnut Meringues. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70804,&quot;Marinara Basil with Sweet Sausages 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 pound Italian sweet sausages, sliced 1/4 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, chopped 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes 1 28-ounce can pureed tomatoes Bunch parsley, chopped 1/2 cup fresh basil, leaves torn by hand Salt and pepper 1 pound bucatoni, cooked al dente Instructions: Heat oil in a large hot saucepan and brown sausages.

Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, rolling them around occasionally, until they are heated through. Transfer the nuts to a clean kitchen towel, fold the towel over and roll them around until some of the skins fall off. (Don\\u2019t worry if they don\\u2019t all fall off.) Roughly chop the hazelnuts and set aside. Wipe out the pan with a kitchen towel. Meanwhile, fill a large pot with 4 quarts water, add 1 tablespoon salt and bring to a boil. Plunge the string beans into the water and cook for 5 minutes, until just tender. Drain immediately, plunge into a large bowl of ice water and set aside. When ready to serve, heat the butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in the large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the string beans, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper and cook for 3 minutes, stirring with tongs, until heated through. Off the heat, stir in the dill and hazelnuts and taste for seasonings. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 70806,&quot;Pommes de Terre Sautees Tata Boucher (Sauteed Potatoes) 2 1/4 pounds waxy potatoes 5 tablespoons oil 3 tablespoons butter Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper Several sprigs of parsley Instructions: Peel the potatoes and cut them into small dice, about 3/4 inch and certainly no larger than 1 inch. Rinse the diced potatoes in hot water, drain well, and dry them thoroughly with a clean cloth or paper towels--this seems to prevent the potatoes from sticking together during cooking. In a very large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil and butter. Add the potatoes--the pan should be large enough to take them very comfortably more or less in a single layer, otherwise use 2 pans. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Over a low heat saute the potatoes until crisp and golden; this may take up to 1 hour. Turn the heat down if the potatoes are browning too much. Stir frequently with a wooden spatula and give the pan an occasional good shake. Snip the parsley into a bowl and add the potatoes. They won&#39;t need draining, but if they look even remotely greasy, drain them on paper towels. Check the seasoning, and sprinkle the potatoes with extra snipped parsley. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70807,&quot;Thick Bananas Foster Shake 1 cup sugar 1 stick butter, cut into cubes 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 semi-ripe bananas, peeled and cut into chunks 1 pint vanilla ice cream 1-ounce banana liqueur (recommended: 99 Bananas) 1-ounce white rum Instructions: Melt sugar in a small saucepot on medium heat. When sugar has melted to an amber color, add butter, stirring until melted. Remove from heat and slowly stir in cream being careful not to splatter. Pour half the caramel into a bowl and set aside. Fold bananas into remaining caramel in saucepot and return to medium-high heat. Stir to combine and cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Set aside and let cool slightly. Add ice cream, banana-caramel mixture, banana liqueur and rum to a blender and blitz until smooth. Drizzle remaining caramel down the sides of glass goblets. Pour in shake and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 70808,&quot;Hot Millet Cereal 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 cup millet 2 cups boiling water Fruit, milk, brown sugar to serve Instructions: In a large saute pan, heat oil.

Let stand for five minutes then serve with milk, fruit of your choice and brown sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 70809,&quot;Pumpkin Cake Genoise, recipe follows 6 gelatin sheets 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons canned pumpkin 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch nutmeg Pinch allspice 3 1/2 cups heavy cream, whipped 2 tablespoons rum Simple Syrup, recipe follows 8 large eggs 3 large egg yolks 1 cup granulated sugar 2 1/2 tablespoons honey<br> 2 cups unbleached, unbromated pastry flour, sifted 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup water 1/2 lemon, juiced Instructions: For the decoration: 2 ounces cream cheese, softened 1 cup heavy cream, whipped Raspberry Sauce, store bought Chocolate Sauce, store bought Make the Genoise according to the recipe and set aside. Bloom the gelatin in cold water to cover. Squeeze the excess water from the gelatin and set aside. Place the pumpkin, sugar and spices in a large glass bowl and stir to combine. Place about 1/4 cup of the pumpkin mixture into a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the bloomed gelatin to the pan and stir to combine. The heat will melt the gelatin. Add the warm pumpkin to the remaining pumpkin mixture. Fold in the whipped cream.<br> Use round cutters that are slightly smaller than the pumpkin mold to cut the cake. The pieces need to fit just inside the mold. Add the rum to the Simple Syrup and place the syrup in a squeeze bottle. Add a few spoons of the pumpkin Bavarian to the mold. Place a cake layer on top of the Bavarian and gently press into place. Soak the cake layer with the rum simple syrup. Repeat with another layer of pumpkin Bavarian, cake and simple syrup. Place the mold in the freezer for about 2 hours.<br> When the cake has frozen, place the cream cheese in a large mixing bowl and whip until softened. Use a rubber spatula to fold the cream cheese into the whipped cream. Place the whipped cream cheese into a piping bag fitted with a star tip. To unmold the cake, dip the mold into hot water.<br> Put raspberry and chocolate sauces in squeeze bottles. Fill the pumpkins mouth with raspberry sauce and his eyes and nose with chocolate sauce. Pipe the whipped cream cheese around the rim of the cake using any decoration. Place a 1-quart saucepan half filled with water over high heat and bring it to a simmer. Make a double boiler by setting a large mixing bowl over the simmering water. Place the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and honey in the mixing bowl and make an egg foam by whisking the mixture to 113 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 7 to 10 minutes. The egg foam passes through various stages becoming foamy, then smooth and finally it thickens. When it is thick, it will be hot to the touch, tripled in volume, and light in color and the sugar will have completely dissolved. If you dip the whisk into the mixture and pull it out, the batter should fall back into the bowl in a thick ribbon. Remove the mixing bowl from the heat and whip the batter with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until it cools, increases in volume, stiffens slightly and becomes pale yellow, about 7 to 10 minutes. Take the time to whip it well; if the mixture is underwhipped, the baked genoise will be dense. Very, very carefully, fold in the flour with a rubber spatula until the flour is no longer visible, making sure to fold to the bottom of the bowl. Do not overmix or the batter will deflate.<br> Bake the genoise on a baking sheet: Spread the batter over a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and bake in a preheated 350 degree F oven until lightly and evenly browned and springy to the touch, about 10 minutes.<br> Let the genoise cool slightly. Unmold and finish cooling on a wire rack to allow the air to circulate evenly around the cake. The baked genoise can be stored in the freezer for 2 to 3 weeks if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Return it to room temperature before using it.<br> Yield: 2 baking sheets Combine all 3 ingredients in a nonreactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. All the sugar crystals should completely dissolve. Remove from the heat and pour into a clean medium-size bowl. Let cool completely before using. If you are short on time, you can cool the syrup over an ice bath. Simple syrup can be stored in the refrigerator indefinitely if kept in an airtight container.

Stand a drumette on its wide end and, holding the narrow bone at the top, use a paring knife to push and scrape the skin and meat downward to expose the bone and make a plump \\lollipop\\ of chicken at the bottom. Repeat with the remaining drumettes. Season generously with salt and pepper and set aside. Pulse the bread in a food processor to make coarse bread crumbs, (about 12 times). Add the garlic, parsley, scallions, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, to taste, and continue to pulse until finely chopped but not a paste. Transfer the mixture to a shallow bowl and toss with melted butter. Brush each drumette with some honey mustard. Then press and roll each one in the bread crumbs to coat. Arrange the drumettes (standing up if you can) on a rack set over a baking sheet. Roast until chicken is cooked and the bread crumbs are golden brown and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve drumettes hot or at room temperature with hot sauce, if desired.

Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub them with olive oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, or until cooked through. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then remove the meat from the bones and discard the skin. Cut the chicken into large dice. You will have 4 to 6 cups of cubed chicken. In a small saucepan, heat the chicken stock and dissolve the bouillon cubes in the stock. In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter and saute the onions over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until translucent. Add the flour and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the hot chicken stock to the sauce. Simmer over low heat for 1 more minute, stirring, until thick. Add 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and the heavy cream. Add the cubed chicken, carrots, peas, onions, and parsley. Mix well. Place the stew in a 10 x 13 x 2-inch oval or rectangular baking dish. Place the baking dish on a sheet pan lined with parchment or wax paper. Bake for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the biscuits. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the butter and mix on low speed until the butter is the size of peas. Add the half-and-half and combine on low speed. Mix in the parsley. Dump the dough out on a well-floured board and, with a rolling pin, roll out to 3/8-inch thick. Cut out twelve circles with a 2 1/2-inch round cutter. Remove the stew from the oven and arrange the biscuits on top of the filling. Brush them with egg wash, and return the dish to the oven. Bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, until the biscuits are brown and the stew is bubbly. Note: To make in advance, refrigerate the chicken stew and biscuits separately.

Brush a baking sheet with olive oil and place the prosciutto in one layer on the sheet. Bake in the oven until the fat is rendered and prosciutto is crisp, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the strips to a wire rack and allow to cool completely. Once cooled, hand-crush the prosciutto and set aside in a bowl. Add the potatoes to a large pot of cold water along with a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and lower to a simmer, cooking until the potatoes are just fork tender, about 15 minutes. Keep in mind the potatoes will continue to cook when you remove them from the water and you don&#39;t want a mushy potato salad. Remove the potatoes from the heat and drain in a colander. Place the colander over the now empty pot to allow the moisture to evaporate from the potatoes. To make the dressing: In a large bowl, whisk the scallions, sugar, mayonnaise, sweet paprika, ground mustard, and apple cider vinegar together. Taste and then season with salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the potatoes and toss. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Line a foil baking sheet or other large rimmed pan with parchment paper or foil, making sure to cover the pan completely and over the rim so it catches all the juices from the mushrooms. Place the mushrooms in a single layer on the prepared pan, Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until they have started to soften and lose their juices. Carefully tip the pan to pour the liquid into a bowl; set aside. Let the mushrooms cool slightly, then chop into bite-sized pieces. In a medium bowl, toss the mushrooms with the red onion. To serve, divide the greens among the plates and top with the warm mushrooms. Scatter the feta and pecans over the mushrooms. Add the olive oil, lemon juice, and mustard to the reserved mushroom juice, mix well, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Drizzle over the salads and serve immediately. Note: To toast the nuts, place them in a skillet over medium-high heat. Toss them continuously in the skillet until they begin to turn a light golden color. Transfer the nuts to a plate and spread them out in a single layer to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 70820,&quot;Glazed Radishes 3 bunches (about 2 dozen) radishes, preferably breakfast radishes 1 cup chicken stock, beef broth or water, or as much as needed to come halfway up the sides of the radishes 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon sugar Salt, to taste 2 tablespoons water Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Cut the greens off about 1/4 inch above where they join the radishes, leaving a tiny decorative piece of green attached to each radish. Trim off the root tips. Put the radishes in a saute pan just large enough to hold them in a single layer and pour over enough broth or water, about 1 cup, to come halfway up the sides of the radishes. Add the butter to the pan and sprinkle over sugar and salt. Bring to a simmer over high heat, turn down the heat to medium, and place a sheet of aluminum foil or wax paper loosely over the radishes. Simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the radishes can be poked through with a skewer or paring knife but still offer some resistance. If they are done but there is still liquid in the pan, remove foil or paper and turn the heat up high to quickly evaporate the liquid. When all the liquid has evaporated and the radishes start to brown on 1 side, toss them, or very gently stir until they are lightly browned on all sides and a thin layer of caramelized sugar has attached to the bottom of the pan. Pour about 2 tablespoons water into the pan and quickly toss or stir the radishes over high heat to dissolve the sugar caramelized on the bottom of the pan and get it to coat the radishes in an even layer. When the water has evaporated, grind over some pepper and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70821,&quot;Ice Cream Cake 2 1/2 pints ice cream 3/4 cup honey roast peanuts 1 cup plus 1/4 cup swirled milk chocolate and peanut butter morsels or use chocolate chips of your choice (recommended: Nestle) 2 ounces Crunchie bar, broken into shards and dusty rubble (recommended: Nestle Crunch) 150g Bourbon biscuits broken up into crumbs and rubble/1 1/2 cups chocolate cookie crumbs Butterscotch sauce Chocolate sauce Instructions: Let the ice cream soften either in the refrigerator for a while, or out in the kitchen. Line a 8-inch springform tin with clingfilm/clingwrap, both in the bottom and sides of the tin so that you have some overhang at the top. Empty the slightly softened ice cream into a bowl and mix in the peanuts, 150g/1 cup chocolate and peanut morsels or chips, Crunchie shards/honeycomb shards and 100g/1 cup of the Bourbon biscuit crumbs/chocolate cookie crumbs. Scrape the ice cream mixture into the springform tin flattening the top like a cake, and cover the top with clingfilm/clingwrap and place in the freezer to firm up. Serve the cake straight from the freezer, unmould from the tin and pulling the clingfilm/clingwrap gently away before putting on a plate or cake stand. Sprinkle the top of the cake with the extra 50g/1/4 cup of chocolate and peanut morsels or chips, and the remaining Bourbon biscuit crumbs/chocolate cookie crumbs. Cut into slices and serve with the butterscotch and chocolate sauces, letting both dribble lacily over each slice. If 2 sauces sound like too much trouble - they&#39;re not - just opt for the chocolate peanut butter sauce.

Add the onions, sugar, and some salt and pepper. Cook until the onions become deep brown and sticky, about 20 minutes, stirring every 4 or 5 minutes (if the onions color too quickly, reduce the heat to medium-low). While the onions caramelize, make the rice. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the rice and stir, cooking it until the grains begin to turn opaque, about 2 minutes. Add the water, lentils, and cumin; season with salt and pepper. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the rice is tender and has absorbed all of the liquid, about 20 minutes.

Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil across each side of the steaks then season them with grill seasoning blend and reserve. Prepare chimichurri: pile the herbs together and finely chop. Coarsely chop 2 cloves of the garlic, reserving one large clove left cracked away from skin but whole. Add coarse chopped garlic to herbs and mill them together, chopping even finer, then transfer to a small bowl. Add in the finely chopped red onions and the zest of 1 lemon. Once the lemon has been zested, cut it into wedges and reserve. To the herbs and onions, add 3 tablespoons (eyeball it) red wine vinegar, a splash of water and about 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil. Stir to combine the chimichurri and reserve. Fill sink or large bowl with cold water. Remove stems from spinach and add to water. Agitate the leaves to release the grit attached to the leaves. Repeat this process, testing leaves as you go until they are free of sand. Dry in a salad spinner or on layers of paper towels. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, then add in the chipotle in abobo, sliced onions and mushrooms. If you are using powdered chipotle, add onions and mushrooms first then season with the powder. Cook the mushrooms and onions, stirring frequently, 10 minutes. Do not add salt and pepper ? the salt will draw liquid out of the mushrooms, slowing up the browning process. Heat a heavy bottomed pan and sear the steaks for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium rare to medium. Add 2 minutes for medium to medium well doneness. Once cooked, let meat rest 5 or 10 minutes for juice to redistribute. Once the mushrooms are tender, coarsely chop the spinach and fold into the pan in bunches until wilted and incorporated fully. Season the mixture with salt and pepper and remove from heat. Char bread under broiler, rub it with the remaining clove of garlic, butter the bread and sprinkle with chives.

Remove 1/4 teaspoon to a small bowl; set aside for the glaze. Add 1/4 cup granulated sugar to the remaining lavender in the spice grinder and pulse until the sugar is fine. Combine the butter, lavender sugar, the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, the confectioners&#39; sugar, salt and vanilla in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg yolks and beat, scraping down the sides of the bowl, until combined, about 1 minute. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the flour and beat until the dough comes together, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Divide the dough between 2 large sheets of plastic wrap and roll each into a compact 10-inch log. Wrap each log in the plastic and refrigerate until very firm, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Unwrap one log of dough and slice into 3/8-inch-thick rounds. Arrange 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.<br> Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are golden around the edges, 20 to 24 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the pans, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining log of dough.<br> Make the glaze: Combine the white chocolate, half-and-half and the reserved 1/4 teaspoon ground lavender in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water); stir until melted, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and let sit until the glaze thickens slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. (If the glaze gets too thick to drizzle, reheat over the simmering water, stirring.) Drizzle the glaze over the cookies and top with sprinkles.

While whisking the hot stock in a quick circular motion, \\rain\\ in the polenta by letting it stream through your fingers. (This will prevent lumping.) Reduce the polenta to a gentle simmer; it must be stirred constantly for 25 to 35 minutes to prevent lumps or scorching. Be very careful when stirring, the mixture is very hot (think lava) and can burn you if it boils and sputters. If it begins to boil cover the pot and reduce the heat until boiling stops! The polenta is cooked when it is no longer grainy and has become creamy. (My grandmother says good polenta takes 30 minutes, great polenta takes 1 hour). Stir in the Parmesan and basil and pour onto a buttered sheet pan to cool. When cool, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Cut the polenta into any shape you desire that&#39;s structurally sound. In other words, a shape that won&#39;t fall apart on the grill easily, or be difficult to remove from the sheet pan after roasting. Squares, triangles, stars etc. Make the Marinade and Vegetables: Whisk together the vinegar and garlic. While whisking, drizzle in the oil to make a smooth dressing. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Toss the vegetables with the marinade. When ready to serve, preheat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan. Brush the polenta lightly on both sides with olive oil and grill, turning once, until the edges are brown and crispy. At the same time grill the vegetables until they are tender but still firm. Pile the vegetables on top of the polenta, then stand back and wait for the applause! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 70828,&quot;Buffalo Oysters 20 slices pepperoni 1 cup crumbled blue cheese<br> Oil, for frying 2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons blackening seasoning<br> 12 oysters<br> 1 1/2 cups baby arugula<br> 1/4 cup buffalo wing sauce<br> Instructions: Turn pepperoni into chips by either deep-frying or folding in a paper towel and microwaving 10 seconds at a time until crispy.

Remove the pan from the heat and let stand 5 minutes. Skim the foam from the top and discard. Slowly pour the clear butter into a liquid measuring cup, discarding the milk solids in the bottom of pan \\u2014 you should have 1/2 cup clarified butter. In a metal bowl (or the top of a double boiler), combine the egg yolks with the cool water. Whisk until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Place the bowl over a pot filled with a few inches of simmering water (do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water) and cook, whisking, until the eggs are thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Don\\u2019t rush this step, because the sauce needs to be based on fluffy cooked eggs. Keep the heat low as well to avoid overheating and scrambling the eggs. Remove the bowl from the pot and place it on top of a kitchen towel to keep it from tipping over. Little by little, whisk in 1/2 cup clarified butter. When all the butter is added, whisk in the lemon zest and juice and a pinch each of kosher salt and pepper. Make the eggs Benedict: Place the English muffin halves on a flat surface and, one by one, roll over them with a rolling pin so they flatten and expand. Toast them lightly in a toaster oven. Fill a large wide pot with about 3 inches of water; bring to a simmer. Add the vinegar (this will help the eggs keep their shape). Crack each egg into a separate small bowl. Gently drop the eggs, one by one and at some distance from one another, into the water. Lower the heat and poach the eggs until the whites are firm and completely white, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove them to a kitchen towel to drain. Season with kosher salt and pepper. Season the avocado slices with kosher salt; place on each of the English muffin halves. Top with a poached egg, some of the hollandaise sauce, Cajun seasoning, parsley and sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70830,&quot;Three Chocolate Bark with Spiced Pecans and Dried Cherries 7 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 cups pecan pieces Salt Cayenne pepper Pinch ground nutmeg Pinch ground cinnamon 1 pound semisweet chocolate, cut into pieces 1 pound milk chocolate, cut into pieces 1 pound white chocolate, cut into pieces 2 cups dried cherries, rehydrated and chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large saute pan, melt 4 tablespoons of butter. Add the brown sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves and is bubbly. Add the pecans. Season the pecans with salt, cayenne, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar starts to caramelize and coat the pecans evenly. Cook for about 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and spread the pecans over a parchment lined baking sheet. Place the pan in the oven and roast the pecans for about 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and cool completely. Break the pecans into small pieces. Fill 3 small saucepans halfway up the pan with water. Place the pans over medium heat and bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. In three separate mixing bowls, add each type of chocolate into the individual bowls. Place the bowls over the saucepans. After about 2 minutes over the heat, the chocolate will start to melt. Stir each chocolate until totally melted. Remove the chocolate from the heat and stir 1 tablespoon of butter into each bowl of chocolate. Pour each type of chocolate over the marble or a large parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle the pecans and cherries over the chocolates. Using a metal spatula, spread the mixture out evenly back and forth to about 1/4-inch thick.

Sprinkle coconut grass around truck. For marshmallow veggies, process marshmallows and 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar in a food processor until large crumbs form. Transfer crumbs to a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high 10 seconds. Carefully (mixture may be hot) start working crumbs with 1 hand, kneading, squeezing and pulling. As mixture becomes a slightly sticky paste, gradually work in remaining 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, microwaving mixture a few times in 5 to 10 second increments to soften dough during kneading. When done, dough should be smooth and elastic. Fill a 13 by 9-inch baking pan or a tray with about 1/2-inch granulated sugar (to support and hold veggies as they dry). Break off about 1/4 cup dough at a time to knead in colors. Knead colors into the dough until completely blended. Make several shades of green for leaves (lettuce uses 3 shades, from dark to light green) and stalks, mixing in a little yellow for lighter shades. If needed, lightly moisten dough with water to make pieces stick to each other. Potatoes: Knead red and a little blue food color into dough until reddish brown. Form into ovals; make eyes with a toothpick. Carrots: Knead orange color into dough. Form carrots. Make ridges with side of a toothpick. For tops, roll green dough into thin strings. With toothpick, poke a hole in top of each carrot; insert tops. Radishes: Tint dough red. Form radishes. For leaves, press small balls of green dough flat, then score with back of a knife. Roll green dough into short stems; press onto leaves. Insert as for carrots. Turnpis: Form with white dough. Make leaves as for radishes, making longer stems. Insert as for carrots. Mix red and blue color in a cup intil violet; thin with water. Brush on top half of turnips. Lettuce: Use 3 shades of green dough. Start with a small ball of lightest shade.

In a medium bowl, stir together the walnuts, pecans, flour, granulated and brown sugars, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in the butter. The topping should form sandy clumps. Sprinkle the topping onto the baking sheet to break it up into smaller clumps. Refrigerate.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 F. Use butter to thoroughly grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch round baking pan. Make the cake batter: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together, on medium-high, scraping down the sides from time to time, for 8 minutes. Lower the speed and add the eggs, one by one, taking care that the first egg is thoroughly integrated before adding the second.<br> Sift together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. In a separate bowl, whisk together the salt, sour cream, and yogurt until smooth. Turn the mixer on low and alternate adding some of the flour mixture with some of the sour cream mixture. When all has been mixed in, give the sides and the bottom of the bowl a good scrape and blend to make sure the batter is thoroughly combined. Transfer the batter to the greased baking pan and tap it lightly on the sides so it falls evenly in the pan and to remove any air bubbles. Liberally sprinkle the cake with all of the topping. Bake the cake: Bake until a cake tester or small knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Allow the cake to cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.

Although the term cochon de lait is French, the origin of this Louisiana social event is obscure. It is know that the custom began at least a century ago and has since been popular throughout Cajun country. It is possible that the Germans who settled in St. James Parish in 1690 were the first to introduce the cochon de lait. These settlers brought pigs to the area and were skilled butchers. Local legend, however, tells that veterans of Napoleon&#39;s army brought the traditional preparation of cochon de lait to Louisiana in the early 1800s. Many of these soldiers settled in a town in Avoylles Parish they named Manusra in honor of the site of their last major campaign. Since then, Mansura, LA has been designated by the Louisiana legislature as \\La Capital du Cochon de Lait.<br> Normally, families cooked pigs in cochon de lait style as the centerpiece for holiday gatherings. The pig, usually weighing less than 30 pounds, was sometimes cooked hanging from the fireplace in the kitchen. The most common method was to cook the pig outdoors over a pecan wood and sugarcane fire. The basic process of the cochon de lait has remained the same over the years. Today, much larger pigs are cooked to feed groups of people. Pigs up to 200 pounds are regarded as excellent for open-fire cooking. When preparing a cochon de lait, season the pig well inside and out with salt, cracked black pepper, and granulated garlic. Inject the front and rear hams and tenderloin with an infused liquid made with 2 cups melted butter, 1 cup white wine, 3/4 cup Louisiana hot sauce and 1/2 cup granulated garlic. Using a meat saw, cut through the backbone at the neck and tail and lay the pig open flat. Wrap the pig in wire mesh that has been washed and cleaned thoroughly and then secure it with wire to hold it in proper form during the long cooking process. The pig should then be slowly rotated in front of a hardwood fire built 3 to 4 feet away from the pig. The fire, constantly maintained, cooks a 50-pound pig in 6 hours. Estimate 1 hour of cooking time for every 10 pounds, but keep in mind that not all pigs will cook at the same rate. After each hour of cooking, flip the pig head side down to ensure even cooking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 70859,&quot;Watermelon-and-Cucumber Smoothie One 2-inch piece English cucumber, peeled and roughly chopped (about 1/2 cup), plus one slice reserved for garnish 3 tablespoons low-fat buttermilk 1 tablespoon honey, optional 1/2 small lime, juiced (about 1 tablespoon) 2 cups cubed seedless watermelon, frozen Instructions: Put the cucumber, buttermilk, honey if using and lime juice into a blender.

Bring the remaining Seafood Bouillon back to a boil in a large stockpot. Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Put the reserved chilled Seafood Bouillon in a large bowl and add ice to make an ice bath. Add the lobsters to the boiling liquid in the stockpot and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the lobsters from the pot. Remove the claws and return them to the stockpot to cook for 6 minutes more. Put the lobster bodies in the ice bath to stop the cooking process. When the claws are cooked, transfer them to the ice bath to chill. Use a chef&#39;s knife to split the lobster bodies and tails in half down the center. Crack the claws and remove the meat. Melt half of the Pernod-Caper Butter in a small saucepan on the grill. Brush the lobster tails liberally with some of the remaining room-temperature Pernod-Caper Butter. Grill the lobsters on the shell side first for 4 minutes to melt the butter. Flip onto the flesh side, add the claw meat to the grill and cook for another 4 minutes. Remove to a platter or individual serving plates. Serve with a salad of shaved radishes and fennel, lemon wedges for squeezing and a small side of the melted Pernod-Caper Butter. Combine the salt, lemons, carrots, celery, onions, bay leaf and 24 cups (1 1/2 gallons) water in a large stockpot and bring to a boil. Use immediately for cooking lobsters or other seafood. Combine the butter, shallots, capers, dill and lemon zest in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on medium just until the ingredients are combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula, then add the Pernod and mix on high just until incorporated. Season the butter with salt and pepper.

Let cool completely, about 45 minutes. For the chocolate ganache: Heat the heavy cream to boiling. Pour over the chocolate in a heat-proof bowl. Stir until completely smooth. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes. For the buttercream: Beat the butter, shortening and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until combined and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. To assemble the cake: Level both cakes by running a sharp knife around the top edge of each cake, scoring it, then carefully cutting through the cakes along the score lines. Fill a piping back fitted with a No.12 tip with buttercream icing. Pipe a dam around the inside of the bottom layer of cake. Inside the dam, spread a very thin layer of raspberry filling, about 3 tablespoons (for this filling, less is more). Then top with a more generous layer of chocolate ganache, about a quarter-inch thick. Stack the other cake layer on top and cover the whole cake with buttercream icing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 70866,&quot;Spiced Squash Soup 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1 tablespoon minced ginger 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 4 cups chopped butternut squash 4 cups vegetable broth A pinch of salt and pepper 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon fennel seeds A pinch of salt 8 ounces asparagus, trimmed and chopped into 1-inch pieces Instructions: For the soup: Put the oil into a large saucepan and, when it is hot, add the ginger, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds and paprika and cook for 1 minute. Add the butternut squash and broth and bring to a simmer. Cook until the squash is very tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Working in small batches, puree the squash and liquid in a blender until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning. Pour into a clean pot to reheat. For the asparagus: Place a skillet over medium heat and add the butter. When it begins to foam, add the fennel seeds, salt and asparagus and saute for a few minutes until the asparagus is bright green and tender but still crunchy. To serve: Ladle the hot soup into a serving bowl and garnish with the asparagus. Cook&#39;s Note: When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 70867,&quot;Shakshouka 1/2 cup olive oil 2 onions, chopped (about 3 cups) 4 red or green bell peppers, chopped 6 garlic cloves, sliced 2 tablespoons ground dried lime (optional) 6 tablespoons sweet paprika 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 8 cups tomato puree 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar 16 large eggs Serrano chiles, thinly sliced<br> Fresh cilantro, chopped Instructions: Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil over medium in a cast iron skillet large enough to accommodate 16 poached eggs.

Fill a large bowl with ice water and salt that as well. Drop the broccoli into the boiling water and cook, uncovered, until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Scoop them out of the water and immediately plunge the broccoli into the ice water; this stops their cooking and sets their color. Cool, remove them from the ice water, and pat dry. Repeat with the asparagus, cooking 1 to 2 minutes depending on how thick they are. Arrange all the vegetables on a large serving platter and serve with the chipotle dip. For the dressing: Smash the garlic cloves, sprinkle with the salt, and, with the flat side of a large knife, mash and smear the mixture to a coarse paste. Scrape the paste into a small bowl, add the remaining ingredients, and whisk well to make a creamy dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 70871,&quot;Smoky Chicken Salad 2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds) 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 clove garlic 3 jarred piquillo peppers (2 whole, 1 thinly sliced) 1/3 cup mayonnaise Juice of 1/2 lemon 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 16 small Bibb or romaine lettuce leaves 2 stalks celery, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons salted Marcona almonds, roughly chopped Instructions: Preheat a grill to high.

Turn off the heat and carefully skim off the milk solids with a spoon; discard. Strain the remaining butter through a fine-mesh sieve and set aside (you should have about 1/4 cup clarified butter). Peel the potatoes and grate them on the large holes of a box grater into a colander. Squeeze out the excess moisture with your hands, then blot the potatoes dry with paper towels. Heat the clarified butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes to the skillet in a few piles and flatten with a spatula; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt, a few grinds of pepper and the paprika. Cook, undisturbed, until the potatoes start browning on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip, then drizzle with the cream; cook, undisturbed, until absorbed, about 2 minutes.

Sprinkle the roast beef generously on all sides with salt and coat with the pepper. Put the roast on a rack in a roasting pan. Arrange the garlic halves in a single layer of foil with some foil to spare. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Wrap the foil over the garlic into a little package and place in the oven. Roast 45 minutes, then set aside. Meanwhile, place the roasting pan in the center of the oven and cook, undisturbed, for 20 minutes. Lower the temperature to 350 degrees F, and continue to cook until a thermometer inserted in the center of the meat registers between 135 and 140 degrees F for medium-rare, about 2 hours Remove the roast beef and place it on a cutting board to rest for 20 minutes. (The roast temperature will continue to increase as it rests; the end slices will be more well done.) For the gravy: Pour off excess grease from the roasting pan, then add the wine and bring to a boil over a burner. Reduce the liquid by half and whisk in the mustard. Add the stock and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice. Season to taste. Squeeze 4 of the garlic halves like lemons over the blender to release the flesh from the skins, allowing the flesh to fall into the blender. Ladle some of the gravy into the blender and blend until smooth. Whisk the garlic back into the gravy. Squeeze the remaining garlic halves directly into the gravy and use the back of a spoon to smash them into the gravy. Taste for seasoning. Serve the roast whole on the platter to carve at the table with the gravy on the side, or arrange slices of beef on a platter and coat with a layer of the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 70878,&quot;Yorkshire Pudding 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 eggs 3/4 cup milk 1/2 cup pan drippings from roast prime rib of beef Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Or you can chop as finely as humanly possible by hand. Reserve 2 tablespoons for the meatball mixture. Warm the garlic flavoured oil in a heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, add the onion and celery mixture, along with the thyme, and cook at moderate to low heat, stirring every now and again, for about 10 minutes. Add the cans of tomato, filling up each empty can with water to add to the pan. Season with the sugar, salt and pepper, stir and then leave to come to a bubble, and then turn down to let it simmer gently while you get on with the meatballs. Put all the ingredients for the meatballs, including the reserved chopped onion and celery, and salt according to preference, into a large bowl and mix together, gently, with your hands, wearing disposable vinyl gloves if you feel so inclined. Don&#39;t over-mix, as that will make the meatballs dense-textured and heavy. When all the meatball ingredients are not too officiously amalgamated, start rolling. The easiest way really to do this is to pinch out an amount about the size of a generously heaped teaspoon and roll into a bowl between the palms of your hands. Put the meatballs on a baking tray, lined with baking parchment or greaseproof paper, as you go. You should get about 50 little meatballs. Drop these gently into the simmering sauce; I try and let these fall in concentric circles working around the pan from the outside edge inwards, in only the vaguest of fashions. Let the meatballs cook for 30 minutes, until cooked through. Serve with rice or pasta or however you so please. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 70880,&quot;Sesame Beef Burgers with Kimchi Mayo 3/4 cup chopped drained kimchi 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 1/2 pounds ground beef 2 cloves garlic, finely grated 2 tablespoons packed light or dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Vegetable oil, for the grill 4 sesame hamburger buns, split Half-sour pickle chips and/or sweet potato chips, for serving Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high.

Cook over medium heat until bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to a simmer, while you cook the eggs.<br> Meanwhile, fill a 2-quart pot with water, leaving 1-inch of space from the rim. Bring the water to a boil.<br> Set a small strainer over a bowl. Crack one egg into the strainer, and allow the loose parts of the white to drain off, 1 minute.<br> Place a chopstick or a butter knife in the center of the pot with the boiling water. Stir vigorously to create a funnel effect (it should look like a mini tornado in the center of the pot). Gently slide the egg into the center. Reduce the flame to keep the water at a gentle bubble. Cook the egg for exactly 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the egg to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat this process with the remaining egg.<br> To serve, divide the sauce into two shallow bowls. Place one poached egg in each bowl, and garnish with a piece of toasted bread if using. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 70890,&quot;Garlic Mashed Potatoes 1 Tbsp.

Add 3 cups water and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and cover to allow the chiles to steep, 30 minutes. Puree in a blender and add the vinegar and salt. In a large resealable plastic bag place the pork and the marinade and refrigerate 8 hours or up to overnight. Preheat a grill for cooking over medium heat. Reassemble the slices of pork back into its original roast shape and skewer it in several places to hold it together. Roast on the grill, turning frequently, until the pork is fully cooked and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 180 degrees F, 35 to 40 minutes. (You can also cook slices of pork directly on the grill until the pork is fully cooked, 2 to 3 minutes per side.) Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes. Combine the cilantro with the remaining onions and pineapple and mix well. Season to taste with salt. Chop the pork into bite-sized pieces and place them in a serving bowl. Serve with warm corn tortillas and the pineapple salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 70893,&quot;Olive Ladder Bread (Fougasse) 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water 1 teaspoon dry yeast 6-7 cups unbleached all purpose flour 2 tablespoons olive oil plus extra for oiling surfaces 2 teaspoons salt 1 1/2 cups pitted and chopped black olives (Nyons or Kalamata) 1/4 cup buckwheat flour Instructions: You will need a large bread bowl, four 10- by 15- inch or larger baking sheets that will fit in pairs side-by-side in your oven, a sharp knife or razor blade, and a pastry brush. Place water in a large bowl, sprinkle on yeast, then stir in 2 1/2 cups of the all purpose flour. Stir 100 times in the same direction (one minute) to develop the gluten, then leave this sponge covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes or up to two hours.Stir in olive oil, salt, olives, and buckwheat flour. Mix in remaining flour, a cup at a time, stirring always in the same direction, until dough becomes too stiff to stir. Turn dough out onto a well floured working surface. Using floured hands, knead gently until the dough has an even consistency (apart from the olives), then knead 5 minutes longer. Clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, place dough in the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 2 to 3 hours. It will have almost doubled in volume. Oil two 10 by 15 inch (or larger) baking sheets. Flatten dough down gently with your hands, then turn out onto floured working surface. Cut dough in half, return half to the bread bowl and cover. Divide remaining half in two. Knead each half into a ball and then flatten gently with the palm of your hand. Let stand five minutes to rest. Working with each piece in turn, flatten out with your palms into a rectangle or oval about 10 inches long and 5 to 6 inches wide. It will be about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Transfer each to a lightly oiled baking sheet at least 14 inches long. Let loaves rise for 20 to 30 minutes, covered with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set rack at the center of the oven or just above. (If your baking sheets do not fit side-by-side on one rack, place two racks in oven, one just above the center and one just below. One bread can go on each rack; about halfway through baking (after 10 to 12 minutes), switch the two around.) Just before placing in the oven, use a sharp knife or razor blade to make cuts through the breads: Starting two inches from the top and about an inch from the side, cut across the bread to within an inch of the other side. Make two more cuts, parallel to the first, at about 2 inch intervals (the cuts should go all the way through the dough). The dough will separate at each cut, so that the bread looks like a kind of fat-runged ladder; you can pull dough apart even more if you wish and if your baking sheets are long enough, by pulling gently on each end of the breads to make the slits gape more. Brush each loaf lightly with olive oil all over, place in the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Breads will be golden when done. Once first two loaves are in the oven, oil two more baking sheets, then flatten remaining dough, divide into two, and repeat steps required to form loaves. Breads should almost have finished rising by the time the first batch comes out of the oven. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 70894,&quot;Honey Salted Mixed Nut Tart 11 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook\\u2019s Note)<br> One 15-ounce can roasted salted mixed nuts<br> 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> Kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup honey<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 2 large eggs, lightly beaten Instructions: Cube 8 tablespoons of the butter and place it in the freezer until it is very cold and almost frozen, about 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Pulse the flour, 1/2 cup of the mixed nuts, 3 tablespoons of the granulated sugar and a pinch of salt in a food processor until the nuts are finely ground. Pulse in the cold cubed butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Pulse in 2 tablespoons ice-cold water until the dough holds together when squeezed. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap (it will still be quite crumbly), form into a disk, cover in the plastic and refrigerate for 20 minutes.<br> Put the dough in a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and press into an even layer over the bottom and up the sides of the pan with your hands or the bottom of a measuring cup. Use a fork to dock the bottom of the tart. Freeze until firm, about 10 minutes.<br> Place the tart pan on a baking sheet. Line the crust with parchment and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the edges of the crust begin turning golden, about 20 minutes. Remove the parchment and pie weights and continue baking until the crust is lightly brown and dry to the touch, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer to a rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.<br> While the crust bakes, make the filling: Combine the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar, the brown sugar, honey and a pinch of salt in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat and, stirring constantly, continue to boil for 1 minute.<br> Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.

Seasoned Salt One 3- to 4-pound chicken 2 bunches scallions, trimmed 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon lemon juice (from 1 lemon) Instructions: For the pineapple-rum glaze: Roughly chop the pineapple. Transfer to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Pass the pineapple puree through a fine-mesh sieve into a large skillet (use a rubber spatula to help push the puree through). Discard the pulp. If using the pineapple juice, just pour into a large skillet. Add the rum, vinegar, red pepper flakes and a pinch of seasoning salt to the skillet and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer, whisking, until the mixture is bubbly and reduced to about two-thirds its original volume, about 5 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup of the glaze in a small bowl. For the chicken: Use kitchen shears to cut out the backbone from the chicken. Flip the chicken, breast-side up, and push down firmly on the breastbone to flatten it. Cut the wings off at the third joint (at the wing tip). Line a plate with paper towels and put the chicken on it skin-side down to dry the skin. Season the chicken all over with 1 tablespoon seasoning salt. Prepare a grill for medium direct-heat cooking.<br> Put the chicken in a grill basket with a handle and lock the basket. Put the chicken on the grill breast-side up. Make sure the handle of the basket isn&#39;t resting on the grill grates, then close the grill. Grill the chicken, undisturbed, until the skin starts to brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Adjust the grill heat to medium low and brush the skin side with some of the glaze. Wrap a towel around the basket handle or use an oven mitt and flip the chicken over. Baste the back side of the chicken and close the grill. Continue to grill the chicken, basting, flipping and closing the grill every 4 to 5 minutes, until the deepest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 10 to 20 minutes more. During the last 5 minutes of grilling, toss the scallions with the vegetable oil and a large pinch of seasoning salt and grill, turning as needed, until charred and tender, about 5 minutes.

Drain and pat dry. With a sharp knife, cut the steak into 24 long, thin strips. Thread 1 strip onto each skewer, weaving the skewer back and forth along the length of each steak strip. Arrange the skewers on a large platter or baking tray. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed. About 30 minutes before you wish to grill the skewers, combine the soy sauce, honey, chili flakes, cumin, turmeric, and oil in a small bowl. Pour this marinade over the steak skewers, turning to coat the meat evenly. Leave the steak skewers to marinate at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Preheat a hinged grill or panini maker, according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions, or preheat a broiler, outdoor grill or stovetop grill pan. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Add the garlic cloves and blanch them in the boiling water for 30 seconds to a minute to remove some of their harshness. Drain the cloves well, pat them dry with paper towels, and chop them finely. In a small skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger and green onion and saute just until they begin to soften and smell fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the stock, soy sauce, honey, hoisin or barbecue sauce, and chili flakes and bring to a boil. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer. Pour the sauce through a strainer into a clean pan and, over medium heat, whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, a little bit at a time. Keep warm. Grill the skewers (in batches if necessary to prevent overcrowding) until cooked through and nicely browned, about 2 minutes total on a hinged grill or panini maker or 2 minutes per side in the broiler, in a grill pan, or on an outdoor grill (1 minute if you want the meat rare). Take care that the skewers don&#39;t prevent a hinged grill or panini maker from closing properly. Transfer to a platter, pour on the sauce, and serve; or serve with the sauce on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 70914,&quot;Tiramisu 3 eggs, separated* 5 tablespoons sugar 6 ounces mascarpone cheese 1 large package ladyfingers (approximately 36) 1 cup orange liqueur 1 cup espresso coffee 2 ounces bitter chocolate, grated 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder or 2 ounces grated bittersweet chocolate Instructions: Combine egg yolks and sugar in a medium-sized bowl and beat well.

Add the chili powder, cumin, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper; blend until smooth. Rub the bottom of an Instant Pot insert with the vegetable oil. Add the chicken breasts to the Instant Pot along with the pureed sauce. Stir to combine. Put on the lid, making sure the steam valve is in the sealing position, and set to cook on high pressure for 8 minutes. When the time is up, press the cancel button and let the steam release naturally, 10 to 15 minutes. (You can also cook frozen chicken breasts in an Instant Pot: Rinse the chicken briefly under cool water and cook on high pressure for 12 minutes.) Remove the lid and transfer the chicken to a bowl. Set the pot to saut at high heat. Bring the sauce to a simmer. Break the chicken into large chunks with two forks and return to the sauce; stir to coat. Simmer, stirring to prevent sticking, until the sauce thickens, about 8 minutes. Turn off the Instant Pot. When the sauce stops bubbling, stir in the chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice; season with salt and pepper. Serve the chicken on buns with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 70931,&quot;Brown Sugar Skirt Steak with Succotash 1/4 cup dark brown sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound skirt steak, trimmed and cut into 4 portions 2 medium red tomatoes (about 1 pound), cut into 1/2-inch-thick wedges 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 teaspoon cumin Zest and juice of 1 lime 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates 4 ears yellow corn, shucked 1 large red onion (about 8 ounces), sliced into 1/2-inch rounds One 15-ounce can black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed 1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley or cilantro Instructions: Prepare a grill or large grill pan for medium-high heat. Mix the brown sugar, 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper together in a small bowl. Rub the mixture into the steaks and set aside for 15 minutes. Put the tomatoes in a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Whisk together the sour cream, cumin, lime zest and juice and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl and set aside. Meanwhile, lightly oil the grill grates. Brush the corn and onions liberally with the oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and put on the grill. Grill the corn until lightly charred, turning the ears occasionally, and the onions until charred and tender, flipping as needed, 6 to 8 minutes for both. Transfer the vegetables to a cutting board to cool slightly. Grill the steaks until crisp, about 4 minutes per side for medium rare. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes. While the steaks rest, cut the corn away from the cobs and quarter the onion rounds. Add the corn, onions, black-eyed peas and half of the parsley to the bowl with the tomatoes and toss gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Slice the steaks across the grain and divide among 4 plates. Divide the succotash among the plates, top with a dollop of the reserved sour cream mixture and garnish with the remaining parsley or cilantro. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, GSM]&quot; 70932,&quot;Spice Rubbed Grilled Duck Breast 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon chili powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon five spice powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 duck breast halves Oil, for the grill Instructions: Combine the smoked paprika, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, five spice powder, dry mustard and some salt and pepper in a bowl. Using a sharp knife, score the skin of the duck so it has a 1/4-inch diamond pattern. Rub the spice mixture all over the duck. Heat a grill to medium (make sure it&#39;s not too hot since the key is to cook duck slowly to render the fat) and wipe down the grates with an oiled towel. Place the duck skin-side down on the grate and cook until the skin is seared and the fat is rendered, 4 to 5 minutes. (If there are occasional flare-ups from the fat, move the duck around on the grill to a new spot away from the flame each time.) Flip the duck over and place on a cooler part of the grill. Cook for an additional 5 minutes for medium-rare. Let rest for 5 to 7 minutes before cutting against the grain into thick slices. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 70933,&quot;Not-So-Ugly Sweater Cookies 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 pound confectioners&#39; sugar (about 3 3/4 cups) 2 tablespoons meringue powder 5 to 6 tablespoons water, plus more if needed Assorted gel food coloring, for tinting<br> Desiccated coconut, for decorating<br> Instructions: Make the cookies: Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to medium low and beat in the flour mixture in 2 batches until just combined. Divide the dough between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap. Flatten into disks and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out 1 disk of dough on a lightly floured surface until about 1/8 inch thick, dusting with more flour as needed. Cut out sweaters using a 3- to 3 1/2-inch cutter. Gather the scraps, reroll and cut out more cookies. (If the dough becomes too soft, refrigerate 15 minutes.) Arrange the cutouts 1 inch apart on the prepared pans. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350?. Bake the cookies, switching the pans halfway through, until lightly browned around the edges, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes on the pans, then remove the cookies to racks to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the icing: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Beat in 5 tablespoons water with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft, glossy peaks form, adding the remaining tablespoon water if needed. You\\u2019ll need 2 consistencies of icing: a thicker icing for outlining and a thinner, runnier icing for filling (flooding). Adjust the consistency with water as needed. Tint with food coloring, if desired. Transfer to resealable plastic bags, snip the corners and decorate the cookies. Sprinkle with coconut, if desired. Let set, at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 70934,&quot;Cheapo Pea Pesto 1 cup frozen green peas, defrosted 1/4 cup toasted walnuts<br> 1 clove garlic 1/4 cup grated domestic Parmesan Juice of 1 lemon 1/4 cup olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Serving suggestions: crostini Instructions: Combine the peas, walnuts and garlic in a food processor.

Allow the yeast and sugar to rest for 3 minutes and then mix thoroughly. Set bowl in a warm place for 10 minutes or until yeast bubbles up and mixture almost doubles in volume. Combine 3 1/2 cups flour, remaining sugar, nutmeg, mace and salt and sift into a large mixing bowl. Stir in lemon zest. Separate center of mixture to form a hole and pour in yeast mixture and milk. Add egg yolks and using a wooden spoon slowly combine dry ingredients into the yeast mixture. When mixture is smooth, beat in 8 tablespoons of butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue to beat 2 minutes or until dough can be formed into a soft ball. Place ball of dough on a lightly floured surface and knead like bread. During the kneading, add 1 cup more of flour sprinkled over dough. When dough is no longer sticky, knead 10 minutes more until shiny and elastic. Using a pastry brush, coat the inside of a large bowl with 1 tablespoon softened butter. Place dough ball in the bowl and rotate until entire surface is buttered. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and place in a draft-free space for 1 1/2 hours or until dough doubles in size. Remove the dough from the bowl and place on lightly floured surface. Punch the dough down. Sprinkle cinnamon over the top. Pat and shape dough into a cylinder. Twist dough to form a curled cylinder and loop cylinder into buttered baking sheet. Pinch the ends together to complete the circle. Cover the dough with a towel and set in draft-free space for 45 minutes until dough doubles in size. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Stir in the baking powder, taking care to mix well. Add the eggs and egg yolk and stir well. Add the flours and gently stir until a smooth ball forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and put in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet (or sheets) with parchment paper (no cooking spray). On a floured surface, roll out tennis ball-size pieces of dough to about 1/4 inch thick and cut out the shapes you want. Lay them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 1/4 inch between each cookie. Bake for 8 minutes, or until lightly golden. Let the cookies cool on a wire rack, then decorate them however you like with Royal Icing and your favorite sprinkles. Using a stand mixer and the whisk attachment, whip most of the powdered sugar with most of the other ingredients. Whip for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the royal icing holds its shape and is bright white (not translucent). If it is too soft, add more powdered sugar. If it is too stiff, add a bit more liquid, drop by drop. If you are using only one color, add a few drops of the color at this point and keep whipping until you have the shade you want; otherwise, proceed to the next step. To store royal icing, the ideal way is to scrape it out of the bowl and into a plastic, disposable piping bag, then leave it at room temperature. Don&#39;t cut the bag until you&#39;re ready to use the royal icing, and don&#39;t overfill the bag--you want enough room to tie the back of the bag off to keep the royal icing airtight. If any air comes into contact with the royal icing, it gets hard and that part of the icing is useless. Never attempt to mix the hard bits back into the royal icing--you&#39;ll ruin the whole batch. The other accepted method of storing royal icing is to scrape it into a plastic or ceramic bowl, and cover it with a wet paper towel. This method works, but it wastes both paper towels and royal icing. It&#39;s also just annoying. When you&#39;re piping small designs, you want to use very small parchment piping bags. It&#39;s easy to stick the nose of a large piping bag into a smaller one and extract exactly how much you&#39;ll need. When the icing is in a bowl, you have to use a spoon to get it out. The spoon is difficult to get into a piping bag, and you&#39;ll keep using spoons and wasting royal icing. Get with the times people. Do it right and don&#39;t waste food. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 70944,&quot;Ivory Sauce 3 tablespoons butter 3 1/2 cups chicken broth 1/3 cup flour Salt and pepper Instructions: Make a roux of butter and flour.

Bring to a simmer over high heat, then lower the heat to medium. Cover and cook, stirring frequently, until the chard is very tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the cream cheese, nutmeg and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook, whisking frequently, until the cheese melts and the mixture just bubbles around the edges. With a slotted spoon, add the cooked chard to the cheese mixture (discarding any excess liquid). Mix well and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Garnish with the pine nuts. Set aside, covered, and keep warm. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle the steaks all over with 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. When the oil is hot and shimmering, add the steaks and cook, turning once, until seared and rich mahogany, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer the steaks to a plate. Add the garlic to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until aromatic, about 1 minute. Pull the skillet from the heat, add the vinegar, and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits that cling to the pan. Add in the butter, oregano and any juices from the steak. Stir until the butter melts. Slice the meat against the grain into thin slices. Divide the steak evenly among four plates and pour the pan juices over. Divide the Swiss chard evenly among the four plates and serve each with a dinner roll and 1/2 cup of strawberries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 70950,&quot;Ras El Hanout Marinated Lamb Shawarma with Red Pepper-Walnut Tahini Sauce 1/2 cup canola oil 1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon ground cardamom<br> 1 teaspoon ground coriander<br> 1 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br> Pinch of saffron<br> 8 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1/2 red onion, roughly chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 boneless leg of lamb, butterflied and trimmed of excess fat (4 to 5 pounds)<br> 1 boneless leg of lamb, butterflied and trimmed of excess fat (4 to 5 pounds) 3/4 cup toasted walnuts, chopped 1/4 cup tahini<br> 1/4 cup Greek yogurt<br> 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/8 teaspoon cayenne powder<br> 4 red bell peppers, grilled, peeled, seeded and chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Syrian pita bread, lightly grilled to warm through, for serving<br> Instructions: For the ras el hanout marinade and lamb: Combine the canola oil, vinegar, cardamom, coriander, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, saffron, garlic, onions, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1/4 cup water in a blender and blend until smooth.

Add the ribs, seal the bag and let marinate, overnight, in the refrigerator. Apply the Worcestershire sauce generously over the ribs. Allow the sauce to penetrate the meat for 20 minutes, then remove the excess sauce from the ribs. In a large bowl, combine the remaining rub ingredients and generously cover the ribs on both sides. Finally, put the ribs in a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate for 24 hours. Put the ribs on a preheated charcoal grill with a temperature of 300 degrees F. Close the grill lid and lower the temperature to 250 degrees F. Grill the ribs on both sides for 30 minutes. The ribs will be done when you see the bones pull back at least 1/2-inch and clear juices are present! Transfer the ribs to a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 70952,&quot;Chocolate Pots de Creme 1 cup whole milk 1 cup half-and-half 1 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped<br> 1/2 cup chopped semisweet chocolate 6 eggs 1/3 cup dark cocoa powder 1/2 cup granulated sugar Whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a small pot, over low heat, bring the milk, half and half, almond extract, vanilla seeds and vanilla pod to a gentle simmer. Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler. In a large bowl, add the eggs, cocoa, and sugar and whisk to combine. Pour the heated milk mixture into the melted chocolate and whisk to combine. Temper the egg mixture into the chocolate mixture, adding it slowly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Do not overmix. You want the ingredients to be blended but not frothy or bubbly. Pour the mixture into the small cups, filling almost to the top. Put the cups in a baking pan and fill the pan with 2 inches of water. Cover the top of the pan with aluminum foil. This will prevent the custard from forming a tough skin as it cooks. Put the pan in the center of the oven and bake until the custards are set but still a little loose, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven. Carefully remove the cups from the water bath and allow them to cool for 30 minutes Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or refrigerate overnight, before serving with the whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Bordeaux Blend, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]</p><p>&quot; 70953,&quot;Pasta Salad with Roasted Peppers and Onions 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 pound pasta, small tubes or shells 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 3 large red and/or yellow bell peppers 1 medium onion, julienned 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon finely ground black pepper 2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons Hungarian or Spanish paprika 1 large tomato, seeded and diced 1/2 cup sour cream 3 dashes hot sauce Instructions: Bring 1 gallon salted water to a rolling boil in a large stockpot. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and pasta and cook until al dente, about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain in a colander, shaking vigorously, and immediately transfer to an oiled cookie sheet or clean countertop to cool. When cooled, transfer to a bowl, and toss with a little olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature. Meanwhile, roast bell peppers over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler. Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer charred peppers to a paper or plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. To peel peppers, pull off the charred skin by hand and then, only if necessary, dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits. (Do not peel the peppers under running water since that would wash away the flavorful juices.) Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins, and slice peppers into strips. Heat remaining tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add onions, salt, and pepper, and cook until golden brown. Lower heat to moderate, add garlic, cook 1 minute, then add paprika, and cook 1 minute more. Add red peppers and tomatoes, cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes, and remove from heat. Transfer to a medium bowl and combine with sour cream and hot sauce. Pour over reserved pasta, toss well, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 70954,&quot;Sauteed Swiss Chard with Bacon Olive oil, for pan 1 cup bacon, cut into 1/4-inch dice 2 cloves garlic, smashed Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 1 bunch Swiss chard, stems removed and cut into 1/2-inch lengths, leaves cut into 1 1/2-inch lengths 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable stock Kosher salt Instructions: Coat a large saute pan lightly with olive oil and add the diced bacon, garlic, and crushed red pepper.

Place salmon in dish and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Chop and combine the following in a bowl: shallots, garlic, herbs, lemon zest, cl, lemon juice, olive oil. Cover salmon with mixture, and place in a preheated 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until a fork pulls out smoothly from thickest part of the salmon. For the artichokes sauteed in herb infused butter: In a large skillet over medium high heat, add butter and oil. Saute onions, garlic, cl, herbs, reduce heat, making sure garlic doesn&#39;t burn. Once oil is infused, place artichoke, heart side down, into oil. Saute for a few minutes, and then add enough water to steam them. Cover and reduce heat. Steam artichokes gently for up to 2 hours, or until flesh removes from leaves easily. More water will need to be added to the pan periodically.

Quarter the lemon and squeeze the juice into a medium bowl of water; add the squeezed lemon quarters. One at a time, cut off the top one-quarter of each artichoke; pull off the tough outer leaves (there will be several layers). Using a paring knife, trim the stem and lightly peel around the bottom of the base where it meets the stem. Halve the artichokes lengthwise and add to the lemon water. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drain the artichokes, pat dry and place cut-side down in the skillet; add the lemon quarters. Add the 2 smashed garlic cloves and a generous pinch of salt. Cook until the artichokes soften slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the wine and bring to a simmer, then add 1 cup water. Cover, reduce the heat to medium low and cook until the artichokes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Uncover and remove from the heat. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the reserved lemon zest and the grated garlic and cook, stirring constantly, about 20 seconds. Add the breadcrumbs and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Stir in the parsley. Transfer the artichokes cut-side up to a platter and season lightly with salt.

Add the chicken thighs to the bag. Then add the garlic, shallots, vermouth, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup of the Dijon, lemon juice, thyme, crushed red pepper and 2 teaspoons salt. Close the bag tightly, squeezing out any excess air. Use your hands (on the outside of the bag) to mix all the ingredients together, making sure to completely coat the chicken in the marinade. Place the bag back in the bowl and refrigerate for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the marinated chicken from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature while you roast the vegetables. Slice the leeks into 1/2-inch rounds and place in a bowl of water to remove any dirt. Drain and dry with paper towels. To a 9-by-12-by-3-inch baking dish, add the cleaned leeks, potatoes, red onions, 1 tablespoon olive oil and a generous sprinkle of salt. Toss together so everything is evenly coated. Roast for 35 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and browned in spots but the potatoes have not split. Remove from the oven and set aside until the chicken is ready to add to the baking dish. While the vegetables are roasting, use to tongs to remove the chicken from the marinade to a baking sheet, making sure to wipe any sliced shallots or garlic back into the marinade. Next, set a large strainer over a large bowl and strain the marinade; reserve the liquid and solids. Sprinkle the chicken all over with salt. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken on both sides, 3 minutes per side; work in batches if necessary, adding more oil and butter as needed. Remove the chicken to a clean baking sheet and reserve. Degrease the saute pan, wiping out any dark bits, and then melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add all the solids from the marinade; saute until the shallots have just begun to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the flour until completely incorporated, and then stir in the reserved marinade liquid and the chicken stock. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes; for food safety reasons, it is important that the mixture comes to a full boil for a couple minutes. Pour the sauteed shallot mixture evenly over the roasted vegetables in the baking dish. Place the chicken pieces on top and return to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the chicken is almost cooked through (about 150 degrees F). Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, tarragon, crushed sea salt and melted butter. Remove the chicken from the oven, slather with the remaining 1/4 cup Dijon mustard, and top with the breadcrumb mixture. Return to the oven for an additional 12 minutes, until the chicken has finished cooking and the breadcrumbs have browned on top.

Lightly spray a large, oven-safe platter and oven-safe bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Mix the flour, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, cloves and salt in a medium bowl. In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar. Mix in the molasses and egg, and then stir in the flour mixture. Wrap in plastic wrap and let chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Carefully cover the platter and bowl with the dough, trimming the excess. Chill in the freezer for 20 minutes. Place the platter and bowl on a sheet tray and bake until just golden at the edges, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely. For the candied walnut maple mousse: Lower the oven to 325 degrees F. Toss the walnuts, egg whites, confectioners&#39; sugar, cayenne, salt and 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder in a bowl until evenly coated. Spread on a parchment-lined sheet tray and bake until crispy and brown, about 20 minutes. Place in a food processor and process until finely ground. Sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup water in a small bowl. Set aside. Heat the maple syrup in a small saucepan with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder. Add the gelatin and whisk until dissolved. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the cream on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Slowly fold in the maple syrup mixture and ground walnuts, being careful not to deflate the whipped cream. Chill in the fridge until ready to serve. For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Mix slowly until stiff enough to form peaks; keep beating until the icing is pure white, fluffy and shiny. Use a silicone spatula to transfer the icing to a pastry piping bag and hold it at room temperature until ready to decorate the gingerbread. For the cinnamon sugar tortilla chips: Preheat the oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F. Alternatively, heat 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees F in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stockpot. Mix the sugar and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Cut the tortillas lengthwise and then widthwise, creating small chips. Carefully lower the tortillas into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Depending on the size of your fryer or pot, you maybe have to make 2 batches. Remove to a paper towel-lined sheet tray and then toss in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until coated. To assemble: Using a knife or small offset spatula, remove the gingerbread from the platter and bowl. Fill the bowl with the chilled candied walnut maple mousse and arrange the cinnamon sugar tortilla chips around the bowl. Cut the tip off the pastry piping bag of royal icing and pipe festive designs around the outside of the bowl and platter, adding candies as desired.

Add the cabbage, jalapenos, parsley, pickles and scallions, stirring to combine. Cover and refrigerate until using. For the chicken: Whisk the flour, pepper, garlic salt, paprika and kosher salt in a shallow bowl. Pour the buttermilk into another shallow bowl. Dredge one piece of chicken at a time in the flour mixture, shaking off excess. Dip in the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip back into the bowl. Dredge again in the flour mixture, shaking off excess. Set aside onto a tray lined with wax paper. Repeat with all of the chicken. Fill a large heavy skillet with 1/2 inch of oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Fry the chicken until golden brown and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and season with additional salt. To assemble: Butter the rolls. Heat another large skillet over medium heat. Toast the rolls buttered-side down until browned and crisp, about 1 minute. Build the sandwiches on the rolls with the chicken and slaw. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 70974,&quot;Quick and Easy Sofrito 2 tablespoons olive oil 12 scallions, white and light green part only, finely chopped 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped 1 large tomato, cored and chopped 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the scallions, onions and tomato. Cook until the onions are soft and golden and the tomatoes have broken down, about 10 minutes, stirring often. Add cilantro, and salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl. Use warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 70975,&quot;Mini Man Burgers with Grilled Onions 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt 2 onions, finely chopped 1 pound ground beef chuck 2 tablespoons yellow mustard, plus more for serving Eight 3-inch buns or rolls, split in half 8 dill pickle chips, ice cold, finely chopped 8 slices American cheese Instructions: Combine the garlic powder, black pepper and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt in a small bowl and set aside. Combine the onions and 2 teaspoons kosher salt in a bowl and set aside for 10 minutes. Strain and reserve the juices. Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper and place the ground chuck in the middle of the pan. Cover the meat with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out the meat with a small rolling pin into a large rectangle that covers the surface of the pan; it will be very thin. Remove the plastic wrap. Add a thin layer of yellow mustard and season the meat with the spice mixture. Pick up the edge of the parchment and fold the meat in half, widthwise. Roll a couple of times just to seal the two layers. Refrigerate for 10 minutes then cut into 8 even squares with a pizza cutter. Preheat a griddle pan over medium heat. Spread the onions out on the griddle in an even layer in a rectangular shape. Put the patties on top of the onions. Resist the urge to press them with your spatula. Squeezing burger patties is the culinary equivalent of picking at a scab, and you remember what your mom told you about that. Pour over some of the remaining onion juice to create steam. Top each patty with a slice of cheese and the bottom half of a bun. Cover the griddle with foil (but do not seal) and reduce the heat to low. Steam the burgers until cooked, 3 to 5 minutes. Construct burgers thusly: Add pickles and mustard to each bun top. Using a large spatula, pick up a burger-bottom bun stack and place it on the top half of a bun. Repeat with the remaining burger stacks and bun tops until there&#39;s nothing left to build.

If you like blue cheese - as I, swooningly, do - then know that this, dribbled over sliced, sweet tomatoes along with a torn-off log of baguette is a perfect enough supper just as it is. And you can make a fabulously retro steakhouse-style starter, by cutting a head of iceberg lettuce into wedges and dribbling each crunchy wedge with this plus, perhaps, a scattering of crisp-fried bacon crumbles. And it makes a fabulous dressing to dribble over leftover rare roast beef. Put the crumbled cheese into a bowl, add the Worcestershire sauce, steak sauce, buttermilk, milk and the vinegar and mix gently until well combined. Thin if necessary with a little iced water. Chill until needed. Make Ahead Note: The dressing will keep for 3 to 4 days in covered container in fridge - store in cold part of fridge rather than in the door. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 70981,&quot;Bread Soup 1/4 cup olive oil or 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 onion, diced 2 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 ripe plantains or bananas, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices on the diagonal 5 garlic cloves, minced or pureed 1 bunch fresh oregano, leaves only, chopped, or 1/2 tablespoon dried 1/2 bunch fresh thyme, leaves only, chopped, or 1/2 tablespoon dried Small sprig of fresh rosemary, leaves only, chopped, or 1/4 teaspoon dried 1 1/2 cups canned tomatoes, diced, with the juices 6 ounces baguette (about 1/3 loaf), cut into 1/2-inch chunks (with crust) 6 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock 2 limes, cut into quarters, for garnish Instructions: Heat the olive oil or butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.

Pour into prepared pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until set. Remove from oven and let cool in the pan on a wire rack. Once cool, remove from pan, wrap in aluminum foil and freeze at least 6 hours. Put the frozen cake into a clean, deep 13 by 9-inch baking pan. Cover with crushed cookies and all but 1 cup of the strawberry puree. Cover with softened ice cream. Freeze at least 6 hours. To prepare cake top decorations: Break graham crackers along perforations to create rectangles. Use the gel to create headstones, by writing RIP for example. Lay flat to dry. Remove cake from freezer and from the pan, placing it on a serving platter. Allow to soften slightly so that the decorations can be inserted into the top. Stick the pretzels all around the edge to create the cemetery fence. Then put in the headstones and marshmallow ghosts. If the cake gets too soft during this process, place it into the freezer until it&#39;s hard enough to work with again. Store in the freezer once decorated. To serve, put about 1/4 cup of the strawberry puree into a zip top bag. Cut off the tip and squeeze over the cake. Puddle the remaining puree on the platter around the cake.

Raise the heat to high and reduce the court bouillon for about 10 minutes, or until reduced to 1/2 cup. Lower the heat, and add the butter to the pan a little at a time. Use a whisk to stir the cold butter into the sauce and season with salt and white pepper. Sprinkle the tarragon and chervil into the sauce and return the fish to the pan. Place the pan over a medium-low heat and warm the fish through, about 1 minute. In a 10-inch saute pan, set over a medium-heat, add the olive oil and 1 teaspoon of butter to the pan. Once the butter has melted, add the carrots to the pan and saute, stirring often for 1 1/2 minutes. Add the zucchini and 2 tablespoons of water to the pan and continue to cook for 2 minutes more. Season the vegetables with salt and white pepper and divide among 4 warmed entree plates. Place a sea bass fillet over the vegetables and divide the sauce among the 4 plates as well. Garnish with chervil. Combine all the ingredients into a 4-quart saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue to cook for 45 minutes. Strain the bouillon and use immediately, or cool and refrigerate for later use. The bouillon may also be frozen and kept for several months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 71011,&quot;Turkey Tonnato Salad 3 1/2-ounce can tuna packed in olive oil 4 anchovies 1 tablespoon drained capers 1/4 cup each of lemon juice and mayonnaise Salt and crushed red pepper flakes 2 to 3 cups cubed, cooked roasted turkey 1/4 cup parsley, chopped Garnish: Boston lettuce, tomato wedges and capers Instructions: In a food processor puree tuna fish with anchovies, capers, lemon juice and mayonnaise.

Put the ground chicken in a medium bowl along with the breadcrumbs, milk, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon of the spice mixture. Mix together with your hands to combine, being careful to not overmix. Set aside. Lay out the butterflied and deboned chicken, meat-side up. Rub the inside of the chicken with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 teaspoons salt and most of the remaining spice mixture (reserve about a teaspoon for the skin). Cut 4 pieces of twine, each about 18 inches long, and cut 1 piece about 3 feet long. Put the ground chicken mixture in the middle of the butterflied chicken (right where the breastbone was) and form into a fat, mini meatloaf, leaving about a 1-inch border from the top and bottom edge of the chicken. Bring the sides of the chicken together to form a roll, overlapping the skin. Tie the chicken closed with 3 of the shorter pieces of twine, about 1 inch apart along the midsection, then use the long piece of twine to tie the chicken from top to bottom. Tie the legs together with the remaining piece of twine. Pat the skin dry with a paper towel, and rub with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, another 1 teaspoon of salt and the remaining spice mixture. Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Put the chicken, breast-side up, on the indirect side of the grill, with the legs facing the hotter side of the grill. Cover and cook until an instant-read thermometer reads at least 165 degrees F in the middle of the chicken, 1 hour and 20 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes.

For the braising liquid: Combine the lime juice, sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar, wine and 1 tablespoon water together in a bowl. For the braising spices: Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Add coriander, fennel, Sichuan peppercorns, cloves, anise, cardamom and cinnamon stick to a muslin bag or tea strainer. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice shoulder into small chunks. Apply 1 1/2 cups rub to all pieces and place in an oven-safe pan. Add braising liquid and braising spices. Cover pork with foil and braise for 1 hour, then turn oven to 275 degrees F and continue to braise for another 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove pork chunks from braising liquid, then cool and shred. (Reserve liquid for anything your heart desires.) Combine rice vinegar, sesame oil and soy sauce with pork. Add cabbage, carrots, garlic, ginger, green onions and cilantro and let cool. For the dumpling dough: Combine demerara sugar, yeast, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a mixer or mixing bowl. Add flour and 3/4 cup water and mix until smooth, about 10 minutes. Divide dough into twenty-five to thirty 1.7-ounce balls. Roll into rounds with a rolling pin and place on lightly floured parchment paper. Lightly stretch edges of dough rounds, leaving center as firm as possible. Place a dough round flat on your palm. Use an ice cream scoop to scoop compacted filling in center. Using your free hand, pinch 1 inch or so of the edge of the round together between thumb and index finger. The dough between the pinch should fold together. Use middle finger to pinch another 1 inch or so section of the edge of the dough round. Pull index finger from where it is and pinch another section of dough to the clump of pinches you&#39;ve started in a finger-walking motion. Switch between middle and index finger of main hand as you \\walk\\ your fingers around the edge of the dough. The key is to pinch, not twist! Use thumb of other hand in a spatula motion to help corral filling within round. Keep as much of the rim of the dough round as clean as possible, as the more dry the dough is, the easier it will stick to itself when pinched. Perform 7 to 9 total pinches until there is a clump of pinches at the center/top of the now mostly formed dumpling. Bring all pinches together into one, central pinch, then flatten. Flip over so top of dumpling is smooth and base of dumpling is where the pinched folds are. Place dumpling in a cupcake wrapper. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Put wrapped dumplings into a steamer and cook until it looks flat in texture, not shiny, 10 to 13 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 71028,&quot;Red Wine Poached Pears with Vanilla Bean Custard 1 lemon 6 ripe Anjou pears 2 cups Beaujolais or other red wine 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 8 whole cloves 1 cinnamon stick Sweetened whipped cream and candied pecans, for serving, optional 1 cup whipping cream 1 cup whole milk 1/2 vanilla bean 5 large egg yolks 1/2 cup granulated sugar Instructions: For the pears: Remove a large strip of peel from the lemon and set aside. Squeeze the juice of the lemon into a medium bowl filled with water. Peel, halve and core the pears, adding the pears to the lemon water as you work (this will prevent them from browning). Combine the wine, sugar, vanilla, cloves, cinnamon stick and reserved lemon peel in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and stir until the sugar dissolves. Remove the pears from the lemon water and add to the wine mixture. Boil the pears until tender, 8 to 10 minutes on each side. Remove the pears from the poaching liquid to a wire rack to cool. If desired, continue to boil the poaching liquid until syrupy, about 10 minutes. For the vanilla bean custard sauce: Combine the cream and milk in a medium saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and add to the cream mixture along with the scraped bean. Place over medium heat until bubbles form around the edges, then remove from the heat and remove the vanilla bean. Whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl until combined. Gradually add a little of the hot cream mixture, whisking constantly until combined. Gradually add the remaining cream, whisking constantly. Return the mixture to the saucepan.

(Draining the onions prevents a runny gratin because the onions will continue to release more liquid in the oven.)<br> In the same Dutch oven, melt 3 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for one minute. Add the scalded milk and cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is very thick. Remove from the heat. Fold in the Gruyere and stir until completely melted. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add the onions to the cheese sauce and toss to thoroughly coat. Pour the onion mixture into the gratin dish.<br> Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and toss with the panko crumbs. Sprinkle over the top of the onions and bake until bubbly and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71032,&quot;Grilled Provoleta 1/2 pound provolone, in 1 whole round slice 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1 teaspoon red chili flakes Bread slices Chimichurri, recipe follows 4 cloves garlic 1 tablespoon aji molido (Argentine ground pepper), or ground sweet pepper 1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley leaves 1 teaspoon red chili flakes Pinch coarse sea salt 1/4 cup malt vinegar, or white vinegar 1 cup canola/olive oil blend Instructions: Heat grill to 400 degrees F.

Slice the cooked chicken into 1/4-inch pieces. Add the chicken and the vegetables to the pan and cook until heated through. Add the Peanut Sauce to the pan and toss well until the sauce is warmed through.<br> In a large bowl, combine the chicken and vegetable mixture with the Rosemary Quinoa and toss until combined. Serve, garnished with cilantro. Roast the red peppers until the skin is blackened and begins to peel. Remove the skin and then remove the seeds. Combine all ingredients in a food processor and blend until thoroughly mixed. Use a hand mixer, if needed, to blend sauce until smooth. In a large pot, bring water and sea salt to a rapid boil. Add quinoa to the pot and boil for 7 to 8 minutes. Quinoa is cooked when you can see small white dots in the middle of the grain. Drain the quinoa and place it in a bowl, resting it in an ice bath to cool for 2 to 3 minutes. Once the quinoa is cool, drain until all liquid is gone. Combine the quinoa and the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl. Serve at room temperature. Using a hand mixer, blend the first 8 ingredients in a large bowl.

Finely zest the lemons. Using a mortar and pestle, work the salt and lemon zest together. Add a few turns of black pepper and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Stir to blend. Rub the lemon salt mixture all over the pork. In a large saute pan heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil until hot but not smoking, add tenderloins to pan and sear on all sides, about 5 minutes total. (If you have a small pan, sear 1 tenderloin at a time.) Move pan with pork to the oven and cook until a meat thermometer reads 155 degrees F, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove pork from the pan and let rest on a cutting board for about 5 minutes. Slice the tenderloins against the grain on a diagonal bias, fan out on a plate, and serve with Honey Roasted Applesauce. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Peel the apples with a vegetable peeler, remove the core and cut into 1-inch chunks. Heat a medium saute pan on medium-high heat with the butter in it. When the butter begins to brown add the lemon juice and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the apples and salt. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes until the edges just begin to color. Add the honey and put in oven for about 15 to 20 minutes until the apples are soft and lightly caramelized. Mash with a fork for a chunky version, or put in food processor for a smoother sauce. Serve warm, room temperature or cold. Yield: 4 to 6 servings Cook&#39;s Notes: Most applesauce recipes call for cooking the apples on the stovetop from start to finish. I prefer to start them on the stovetop and then finish them in a hot oven. The oven heat concentrates their flavors by drying and caramelizing them slightly. Although I have suggested a couple of apple varieties, you can use what good cooking apples are available in your area. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 71038,&quot;Potato Gumbo 1/4 cup, plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 medium white onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 6 slices smoked bacon, cut into large dice 2 stalks celery, diced 1 bunch Swiss chard, coarsely chopped, leaves and stems separated 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and diced 1/4 cup flour 2 bay leaves 2 cups chicken stock 2 cups water Pinch cayenne 2 pounds white potatoes, peeled and quartered Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the potato gumbo: Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat.

Add the pumpkin and vanilla until fully incorporated, about another minute. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Gradually add the flour mixture until just incorporated, being careful not to over mix.<br> Divide cake batter evenly into the 3 pans (I weigh the batter out for the best results). Rap each pan gently on the counter before putting in the oven so that the batter is evenly distributed.<br> Bake the cakes for 20 to 23 minutes, moving the pans around halfway through cooking time, until they are set and a toothpick comes out clean from the centers. Allow the cakes to cool in pans for 30 minutes. Run a knife along the sides of the pan and remove cake from pans. To do this, place a lightly-floured free hand or cardboard cake round directly onto the top of the cake in order to support the layer; then gently flip the cake pan over with your hand or cake round still supporting it, while gently tapping with the other hand until the cake slips out. Cool the cakes completely on wire racks.<br> For the frosting: With a hand mixer set at medium speed, beat the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla until smooth. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 5 more minutes.<br> Assemble the cake: Place one cake layer on a cake plate or serving dish and spread with a layer of cream cheese frosting. Repeat with the second layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with a crumb coat, then repeat with a thicker layer.

Halve 4 tomatoes and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Place the tomatoes cut-side down on the baking sheet, tucking 1 thyme sprig under each. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and roast until the skins start to loosen, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven; set aside until cool enough to handle, then pinch off the skins and discard. Return the tomatoes to the oven and continue roasting until slightly dried, about 1 hour. Discard the thyme and set the tomatoes aside to cool. (Keep the oven on.) Puree the roasted tomatoes, olives, anchovy, garlic, capers, vinegar, 3 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons water in a food processor until smooth. Season with salt and set aside. (The tapenade can be made 1 day ahead; transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate.) Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Working in batches, add the prosciutto slices in a single layer and cook, turning once, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Cut the baguette in half crosswise, then split each half open to make 4 pieces. Place cut-side up on a baking sheet and bake until golden around the edges, about 5 minutes. Slice the remaining tomatoes. Spread the roasted tomato tapenade on the baguette. Arrange the mozzarella and sliced tomatoes on top.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, pecorino, parsley, garlic and some salt and pepper until it is all incorporated. Add the ground meats and breadcrumbs and, using your God-given hands, get after it and mix away. Do not overwork the meat or it will turn meatloaf-y. You want it loose and supple. Using your hands again, make 6 loose patties to match the size of your bread. Heat some oil in a large heavy-bottomed cast-iron pan (or use a griddle pan) over medium heat. In batches, fry the patties until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet. For the sandwich build: Toast the split buns under the broiler, about 3 minutes. Spoon 3 tablespoons of sauce on top of each patty and top with a few slices of mozzarella. Place the patties under the broiler until melted and golden, 3 to 5 minutes.

Scatter the butter and shortening over the top of the flour mixture and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the water a few tablespoons at a time and pulse until the dough just comes together. Remove the dough from the machine and lightly knead on a flat surface until it just comes together. Form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine peaches, sugars, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, peach eau de vie and cornstarch or tapioca in a large bowl and mix until well combined. Toss the blackberries with the cassis. Let sit for 10 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to spoon the berries into the peaches, and toss. Divide the dough in half and roll each half out on a lightly floured surface to 13 to 14- inch round. Transfer 1 of the rounds into the bottom of a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Spoon the fruit into the crust using a slotted spoon. Add some of the juices that have accumulated in the bowl. Scatter the butter over the top. Roll up remaining dough on rolling pin and unroll atop peach mixture. Trim edges of both crusts to 3/4-inch overhang. Fold edges over; press to seal. Crimp edges. Cut 6 slits in top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush top of the pie with the cream and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake on the bottom rack of the oven until the crust is golden and juices bubble thickly through slits, covering edges of crust with foil if browning too quickly, about 1 hour 20 to 30 minutes, until the bottom crust is brown and the juices bubbling. Cool pie 3 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71054,&quot;Pan Roasted Lobster with Cava Butter Sauce and Salsa Verde Rice 4 live lobsters (1 1/2 to 2 pounds each) Olive oil Salt and pepper 2 shallots, finely chopped 2 cups Cava (Spanish sparkling wine) 2 tablespoons Champagne vinegar 2 tablespoons heavy cream 3 sticks very cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon leaves 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 2 cups arborio rice 1 cup white wine 1 cup clam juice, shrimp stock or lobster stock 4 to 5 cups boiling water Salsa Verde, recipe follows 1 tablespoon chopped basil leaves 1 tablespoon chopped tarragon leaves 2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 tomatillos, papery skins removed, roughly chopped 4 cloves garlic 1/4 cup pure olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves 3 tablespoons chopped basil leaves 3 tablespoons chopped tarragon leaves Instructions: Lobster: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.

Cream together the butter, sugar, and lemon zest until smooth and creamy. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. Combine the milk, vanilla extract and lemon juice. Alternately combine the dry ingredients and the milk mixture with the butter mixture. Beat well until smooth. Add the eggs 1 at a time and mix well. Divide the batter between the 2 cake pans. Bake the cake for about 20 minutes until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool before unmolding. For the Lemon Curd: Whisk together the egg yolks and the sugar. Add the lemon juice. Place the mixture in a heavy bottomed sauce pot. Cook over medium low heat, stirring constantly until thickened. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the butter. Strain the curd. Stir in the lemon zest. Place the curd in a bowl and cover the surface of the curd with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until cold. For the Easy Buttercream Frosting: Combine powdered sugar with the other ingredients and beat until smooth. Assembly: Cut each cake in half, giving you 4 layers. Layer 1 cake piece with 1/3 of the lemon curd. Gently spread about 1/3 cup of the frosting over the curd. Repeat with 2 more layers of cake, curd and frosting. Place the forth cake piece on top and frost the sides and top with the remaining frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 71056,&quot;Blue Cheese and Chive Butter 2 sticks (1 cup) salted butter, softened 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives<br> 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> Pinch ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Put the softened butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Whip the butter until it&#39;s fluffy. Add the blue cheese, chopped chives, red pepper flakes and ground pepper. Mix until totally combined, scraping the sides as needed. Lay out a long piece of plastic wrap on top of a piece of aluminum foil and scoop the butter mixture in a long strip down the middle of it. Carefully pull one side of the plastic wrap and foil over the butter, squeezing it gently to form it into a log. Continue to roll the log of butter into a roll. When it&#39;s all rolled up, twist the ends (like a piece of candy) until they become very taut (this means the butter is pressing together inside the plastic and foil to form a cohesive roll). Place the roll of butter into the fridge so it will harden, at least 1 hour, or into the freezer if you need to speed along the process. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71057,&quot;Hawaiian Chicken Kebabs 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for brushing 3/4 cup ketchup 3 tablespoons soy sauce or teriyaki sauce 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 1/2 tablespoons honey 1 1/4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/4-inch pieces 1 8-ounce can water chestnuts, drained and rinsed (optional) 4 cups chopped pineapple (about 3/4 pineapple) 1 small red or orange bell pepper, cut into chunks Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 small Hawaiian sweet rolls Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

Add the millet and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir, cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook the millet until it&#39;s tender and all the water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and let sit, covered, for 15 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, and fluff the millet with a fork. Serve warm or at room temperature. (The millet can be made and refrigerated, covered, up to 2 days ahead. Microwave just enough to take the chill off, about 2 minutes, stirring about halfway through.) Cook the sausage: While the millet cooks, heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage, and cook, stirring frequently and breaking up into smaller, bite-size pieces, until the sausage is browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Make the yogurt-hummus sauce: Whisk together the yogurt, hummus, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon water, hot sauce and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Assemble the tomato-pepper salad: Stir together the tomatoes, peppers, parsley and a pinch of salt in another small bowl. Build the bowls: Divide the millet evenly among 4 bowls. Make neat piles and/or rows of the sausage, tomato-pepper salad, pickled beets, grape-leaf coins, cucumbers, sauce.

Cover with 1/2 to 1 inch of Pastry Cream, followed by a quarter each of the jam, fruit and whipped cream. Repeat the layering 3 more times or until you have used up all of the ingredients. Serve with a spoon to make sure everyone gets all of the layers. Enjoy! Put the heavy cream, 1/2 cup of the sugar and the vanilla bean seeds and pod in a saucepan and whisk to combine. Bring to a boil over low heat. While the cream is coming to a boil, combine the eggs and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in one bowl and the cornstarch and milk a second bowl. Beat both with a whisk to a homogeneous mixture -- no big lumps of egg white! When the cream comes to a boil, remove it from the heat and discard the vanilla pod. Whisk half of the cream into the egg-sugar mixture and then IMMEDIATELY whisk it back into the pan with the hot cream. (This is called tempering and will allow you to combine boiling cream and eggs without making scrambled eggs.) Return the pan to a medium heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch-milk mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. (It is necessary to bring this mixture to a boil to cook the starch; otherwise the pastry cream will feel starchy and gritty.) Cook until thickened to the consistency of vanilla pudding (YUM!). Transfer to a bowl and chill; this can be done really quickly over an ice bath. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71061,&quot;TV Dinner Cupcakes 1 Recipe Basic Vanilla Cupcakes, recipe follows Drumsticks, recipe follows Mashed Potatoes, recipe follows Peas and Carrots, recipe follows Disposable aluminum cupcake baking tray (available at grocery stores) 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 stick butter 1 cup sugar 3 eggs Bone template 1/2 cup white chocolate melting wafers 2 cups vanilla frosting 6 plain doughnut holes 1 cup cereal crumbs (recommended: Cornflakes) 3 yellow fruit chews (recommended: Laffy Taffy&#39;s, Starbursts) 1/2 cup vanilla frosting 1/4 cup caramel sauce 9 orange fruit chews (recommended: Tootsie Fruit Rolls, Starbursts) 6 tablespoons vanilla frosting Green food coloring 2 tablespoons hard green candies (recommended: M and M&#39;s, Runts) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda.<br> In another bowl, whisk together the vanilla extract, milk and vegetable oil.<br> Cream together the butter and sugar with a hand-held mixer in a large bowl.

Stir truffle oil into the mayonnaise. Plate the asparagus. Spoon mayonnaise to one side of asparagus. Bring about 6 quarts of water to a rapid boil in a covered pot large enough to hold the asparagus. Cut the bottom section- usually about 1 to 2 inches off the asparagus stalks with a sharp knife. Peel the asparagus by laying them flat, one at a time, on a cutting board. If the asparagus are thinner than 1/2-inch, use a vegetable peeler and peel the asparagus starting at the base of the tip and peeling them all the way down to the base, eliminating the fibrous peel and revealing the pale green flesh. If the asparagus are very thick or woody, use a paring knife and start peeling from the base. When ready to cook, toss the salt into the boiling water and carefully lower in the asparagus. Turn the heat to low and simmer the asparagus, uncovered, until the spears are easily penetrated with a knife, usually after about 5 minutes but from 1 minute for very thin asparagus to 12 minutes for the very thickest. If serving cold asparagus, plunge the hot cooked asparagus into ice water or rinse under cold water in a colander.

Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil (to facilitate cleanup) and butter an 8 by 8-inch baking dish (oven-proof glass or ceramic is ideal); set aside Peel the apples, cut them in half from stem to blossom end, and remove the core with a melon baller. Working with the apples cut side down, cut each half crosswise into very thin 1/16 inch thick slices, keep the slices in place to retain the form of the apple half. Working with one-half apple, at a time, press the apple in your hand and fan the slices, lay the slices in the pan. Continue fanning and arranging the apple halves until you&#39;ve covered the bottom of the pan. Fill gaps with apple slices. You are basically trying to get an even layer in the pan the arrangement isn&#39;t so important. Brush the layer generously with butter, sprinkle evenly with a thin layer of sugar, and toss on a few strands of orange zest. Continue making layers until you have used all the apples, at which point the ingredients may mound above the top of the pan. Double wrap the pan with plastic film, stretching the plastic around the pan, top and bottom, to make certain that it is well sealed. Prick the plastic on the top in 6 to 8 places with a knife and weight the top with it couple of ovenproof plates or bowls, taking care not to cover all of the air holes you&#39;ve created. Nesting two souffle dishes on top of the pan is a perfect arrangement. (it&#39;s OK that a portion of the surface won&#39;t be weighted.) Place the weighted pan on the lined jellyroll pan and bake for 10 hours. (Don&#39;t be concerned the oven temperature is so low there&#39;s no danger of the plastic wrap melting or burning.) Remove the apples from the oven to a cooling rack and, keeping the plastic wrap and weights in place, cool to room temperature. Chill the apples, still wrapped and weighted, for at least l0 hours before using them. when you are ready to use the apples, unmold or spoon them from the pan. The apples can be kept wrapped airtight in the refrigerator for about 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71084,&quot;Crab and Kale Dip 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 bunch lacinato kale, stemmed, leaves chopped (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 pound lump crabmeat, picked over for traces of shell and cartilage<br> 3/4 cup grated mild white Cheddar<br> 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan<br> 3/4 cup sour cream<br> 6 ounces cream cheese, softened<br> 1/2 cup egg-free mayonnaise, such as Vegenaise, or regular mayonnaise 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Pat the beef dry with a paper towel and season all sides with salt and pepper. Quickly sear the beef on 2 sides only until deep golden brown, about 4 minutes total; do not overcook. Transfer to a plate to cool. Add the mushrooms and cook until beginning to brown and release liquid, about 5 minutes. Add the shallots and continue cooking until mushroom mixture dries out, is golden brown and shallots are soft, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. Preheat to the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. On a work surface, roll 1 sheet of puff pastry to a 10 by 14-inch rectangle. Put teaspoon-sized mounds of mushroom mixture on the pastry, evenly spacing them in 4 rows of 3. Top the mushroom mound with a piece of beef, seared side up. With a sharp knife, cut the pastry into even squares around the meat and mushrooms. Working 1 at a time, pull 2 opposite sides of pastry up over each beef piece, then fold the ends over the top to make a packet. Invert and arrange the packets seam side down on the baking sheet and press them lightly to seal the pastry. Repeat with the remaining beef, mushrooms, and pastry.

Sift the flour, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a food processor. Add the pine nuts and butter and pulse until the texture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 10 to 15 seconds. With the motor running, add the egg yolks. If the dough is too dry to form a soft ball when pressed, add ice water 1 tablespoon at a time and pulse to mix. Do not over process; the dough should not be processed for more than 30 to 40 seconds after adding the liquids. Transfer the dough to a sheet of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Form the dough into a flat circle. Enclose tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. Press the chilled dough in a 10 to 11-inch fluted tart pan and use fingers to press it over the bottom and up the side of the pan. Roll over the edges. Use a fork to prick the shell all over. Cover and chill for 1 hour. Line the chilled dough with foil or parchment paper smoothed carefully into all of the corners. Line with dry beans, rice, or pie weights. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, just to set the crust. Remove from the oven and carefully lift the foil and weights. Return to the oven 8 to 10 minutes, until the edges barely begin to color.

Stir in butter evenly. Set aside for 5 minutes, then, using your fingertips, break the mixture into 1/4 to 1/2-inch crumbs. Set aside again while you prepare the filling. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set racks at middle level. Roll out bottom crust and arrange in 9-inch Pyrex plate. To make filling: Peel the peaches by cutting a cross in the blossom end of each and dropping them three at a time into a pan of boiling water. Remove after 20 or 30 seconds with a slotted spoon or skimmer and drop them into a bowl of ice water. If the peaches are ripe, the skin will slip off easily. If it does not, remove the skin with a sharp stainless steel paring knife. (If you peel it with a knife, include an extra peach for what you have peeled away.) Hold each peeled peach gently in your left hand over a mixing bowl (if you are left handed reverse.) With a stainless steel paring knife make a cut through to the pit, from stem to blossom end. Make another cut about 3/4-inch to the right of the first one along the outside of the peach. Angle the knife blade back so the cuts meet at the pit. Twist the knife blade upward slightly as a wedge of peach will fall into the bowl. Continue in the same manner around the peach, cutting it into 8 to 10 wedges. Discard the pit and repeat with remaining peaches. Add remaining ingredients, except the butter, to the peaches and stir gently with a rubber spatula to combine. Pour filling into the prepared pastry shell and smooth. Dot with the butter. Scatter the crumb topping evenly over the filling. Place pie on the bottom rack of the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Lower the temperature to 350 degrees and move pie to the middle rack. Bake another 30 minutes, or until the crust and crumble are a deep golden and the juices are just beginning to bubble up. Cool the pie on a rack and serve warm or room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71103,&quot;Roasted Sweet Corn Soup with Smoked Trout and Heirloom Tomatoes 1 large heirloom tomato, diced small 1/4 red onion, diced small 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, plus sprigs for garnish 10 ears fresh corn Salt and pepper to taste 1 white onion, roughly chopped 1/2 cup diced bacon (about 5 strips) 2 tablespoons ground cumin 2 1/2 quarts water 1 large chipotle cl 2 1/2 tablespoons lime juice 1 (4-ounce) fillet of smoked trout Instructions: Toss the heirloom tomatoes, red onion and cilantro in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside. Preheat a grill. Lightly coat the ears of corn with vegetable oil. Grill the corn, turning frequently until the majority of the kernels are brown. Remove the kernels from the cob, cutting close to the cob so as to remove as much of the starch in the cob as possible. In a large pot, saute the onion and bacon until the bacon is crisp. Add cumin and cook for another couple of minutes. Add the corn, water, and chipotle. Simmer for 1 hour. Using a hand blender, puree on high speed until smooth. Add lime juice and season with salt. Strain through a fine strainer. Divide soup into 4 bowls and spoon the heirloom salsa in the center. Break apart the filet of trout and place over the salsa.

Open the flesh like a book. With a sharp knife, carefully cut out the backbone, making sure to keep the fillets attached at the head and the tail. Season both sides of the trout with salt and pepper. Lightly dredge both sides of the trout with flour, shaking off any excess. Heat a large saute pan over high heat. When the pan is hot, add enough olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Heat the oil until it shimmers when swirled. Carefully add the trout, flesh-side down, starting at the tail and laying away from you towards the head. You may need to cook the trout in batches. Cook until golden brown on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove to a platter and keep warm. Once the trout is all cooked, return the pan to medium-high heat and remove all but 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter and cook just until it begins to brown and smell nutty, about 3 minutes. Add the capers, lemons, croutons, white wine, and lemon juice and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and remove from the heat. Stir in the parsley and pour over the trout. Heat a large saute pan over high heat. Add the olive oil and heat. When the oil is hot, add the bread cubes and cook, stirring, until toasted and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

In a mixing bowl, combine the wasabi, lemon juice, rice vinegar, Dijon mustard, yuzu kosho, and soy sauce, and whisk well. Slowly add the oils, whisking constantly to emulsify. Taste for seasoning, add salt, and set aside. Place tuna in a glass or stainless steel bowl. Add the shallots and chives, and toss gently to combine. Drizzle about half of the vinaigrette over the tuna, and mix well. Let the tartar sit for 2 minutes; taste for seasoning, and add more of the vinaigrette or salt, to taste. Leftover vinaigrette will keep, refrigerated, for 1 week. To serve: shape 1/6 of the tuna tartar into a disc and place it in the center of a serving plate. Arrange 3 dollops of seaweed salad around the disc and garnish with 3 potato slices. Top tuna with a small spoonful of caviar, if desired.

Place 1/4 cup oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, and saute until it is limp, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaf and a pinch of chili flakes. Reduce heat to low and cook 7 minutes longer. Add wine, and bring to a simmer. Add clams, cover pot, and cook till they start to open, about 10 minutes. As they open, use tongs to transfer them to a large bowl. When all clams are cooked and cooled, pluck out meat, and discard shells. Simmer liquid left in pot until it reduces to a thick, syrupy glaze, about 10 minutes. Add cream, and continue simmering until mixture is reduced by a quarter, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, and set aside. Take a pizza peel and dust the surface with flour. Form the dough into a 12-inch round. Working quickly, paint the entire surface of the pizza with one-quarter of the clam glaze. Scatter a dozen or so clams over the pizza and sprinkle with chili flakes. Drizzle with oil. Place peel into brick oven. Slide off the peel. Watch the pizza and continue to rotate it in the oven until all sides of the crust bubble up, allowing for some black bubbles, but not too many. (Approximately 2 minutes.) Take the pizza out of the oven and sprinkle with chili flakes and scatter with parsley. Repeat with the remaining dough balls and toppings. If using fresh yeast, mix 1 1/2 cups cold water and yeast together in an electric mixer until yeast is dissolved. If using dry active yeast, mix water and yeast and let sit until the yeast is foamy, about 5 minutes. Beat in flour and salt and mix with dough hook until the dough comes together to form a smooth, slightly elastic dough, 2 to 3 minutes. Do not knead. Place the dough into oil-coated bowl, cover loosely with plastic and store in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours and up to 3 days to proof. At Franny&#39;s we let it proof for 48 hours, at which point we feel the dough has the optimal texture and flavor. When you are ready to make the pizza, divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape into balls. Return the dough to the refrigerator to rest for 4 to 6 hours, or until needed, up to 12 hours. Remove the dough and let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before using (take the dough out of the fridge while you preheat the pizza stone). You can let it sit out longer as long as it doesn&#39;t get too soft and floppy, which will make it difficult to shape. Soft dough is also more likely to stick to the cookie sheet or pizza peel, making it harder to slide onto the stone. If the dough gets too soft, stick it back in the fridge for 10 minutes or so to give it a chance to firm up. Shape and top as directed for in the pizza recipe.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Chianti]&quot; 71113,&quot;Creamy Lobster Linguine 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 slices bacon, chopped<br> 3 shallots, minced<br> 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 2 cups tomato puree<br> 1/4 cup cream<br> 1 pound linguine<br> 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving<br> 1 cup baby arugula, roughly chopped<br> 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped<br> 1/4 cup fresh tarragon leaves, roughly chopped<br> 1 cup frozen peas, thawed<br> Two 1 1/2-pound lobsters, steamed, meat removed<br> Instructions: Heat a large straight-sided skillet over medium heat.

Brush two sheet pans with half the olive oil. Divide the naan between the sheet pans and brush the tops with the remaining olive oil. Toast in the oven until lightly brown and slightly crisp on the bottoms and around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. For the seafood sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, capers, parsley, salt, lemon zest and juice in a small bowl until smooth. Set aside. For the crispy calamari: Heat 1 inch oil in a large pot to 375 degrees F. Pat the calamari dry and set aside. Mix together the flour, seafood seasoning, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Add the eggs and milk to a second shallow dish and mix together. Add the panko to a third shallow dish. Begin breading by dredging a few pieces of calamari in the seasoned flour, then dipping them in the egg mixture and then covering them in the panko. Set aside on a plate and repeat with the remaining calamari. Fry the calamari in two batches, making sure to not overcrowd the pot, until golden and crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined sheet pan and immediately squeeze a little lemon juice over the top; sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining calamari. Spread the sauce evenly across the top of each piece of naan, using a spoon to spread it almost to the edges. Sprinkle the lettuce over the sauce, then add the tomatoes and cucumbers. Generously top with the golden fried calamari. Sprinkle with hot sauce if desired, along with a squeeze of lemon and parsley.

Swish around and drain water off. Spread couscous grain in a baking pan and leave them to swell for 10 minutes. Rub couscous between your wet hands to break up lumps. Let stand another 10 minutes. Combine the broth, water cinnamon stick, ginger and cumin in the bottom of a couscousiere. Secure the top of the couscousiere to the bottom with a dampened piece of cheesecloth, lightly dusted with flour and large enough to go around the rim of the top. When the liquid comes to a boil, slowly dribble 1/4 of the swollen couscous into steamer, forming them into a mound. Steam uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the remaining couscous. Steam over low heat, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove the top of the couscousiere (if the liquid in the bottom seems low, add some more water or broth) and dump the couscous into a large shallow pan and spread it out with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle 1/2 cup cold water and 1/2 teaspoon salt over the couscous. Break up lumps by lifting couscous and stirring the grains with a fork. Lightly oil your hands and rework grains, rubbing them through your fingertips, to keep them separate. Dry for 10 minutes. (Can do in advance up to this point and keep until the final steaming with a damp cloth over top). Return the dried couscous to the top of the couscousiere (resealing it with cheesecloth again) and dribble couscous in as before, in a soft mound. Steam uncovered for 20 minutes more.

Line 2 muffin tins with cupcake liners. Whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. In another bowl, whisk together the oil, vanilla, eggs and 1 cup water until well blended. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir until just incorporated. Divide the batter among the cupcake liners and bake until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the tins for 5 minutes, then remove and cool completely on a wire rack. For the frosting: Dissolve the coffee in 1 tablespoon hot water in a small bowl; set aside. Beat the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until creamy. Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until incorporated. Beat in the vanilla. Add 1/4 cup of the milk and beat to incorporate. Add more milk, a tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is a creamy piping consistency. Remove a rounded cup of the frosting and put it in a piping bag fitted with a plain 1/2-inch tip. Add the cocoa powder and dissolved coffee to the mixing bowl and beat until well mixed. Add a little more milk as necessary to return the frosting to a creamy texture. On a very large platter or a cutting board, arrange the cupcakes into the shape of a football. When you have a shape you like, spoon a very small amount of frosting onto the bottom of each cupcake and put them back onto the platter to help them stick to it slightly. Spoon the mocha frosting over the cupcakes, then use an offset spatula to smooth it over the top, allowing the frosting to cover the small gaps between the cupcakes. Use the white frosting to pipe the football&#39;s laces and the white markings on either end of the ball.

Mound the flour on a large cutting board and make a wide well in the middle. Add the eggs and olive oil and season with salt. Beat the eggs with a fork, then use the fork to break the wall of the well and incorporate the flour into the eggs. Gather the dough into a ball; don&#39;t worry if there are lumps. Knead the dough. Using the heels of your hands, push the dough away from you, then fold it back over itself and push again (put your whole body into it!). Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and supple, 10 to 15 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at least 1 hour at room temperature. Mix the filling. Mix the ricotta, taleggio, eggs, parmigiano and parsley in a bowl and season with salt. Transfer the filling to a large pastry bag and refrigerate. Roll out the dough. Cut the dough into four pieces. Flatten one piece slightly, then run it through the widest setting on a pasta roller twice, dusting with flour in between if it feels sticky. Fold the length of dough into thirds and run it through the roller two to three more times. Continue running the dough through the roller, reducing the width setting between each run, until you reach the second-to-last setting and the dough is about 1/16 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Layer half of the dough sheets between parchment paper, wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 1 month (you&#39;ll only need half of the dough for the ravioli recipe). Assemble the ravioli. Place the lengths of dough on a floured surface. Lightly brush the lower half of each strip (the part closest to you) with water. Snip the corner off the pastry bag; pipe 1-inch balls of filling, 2 inches apart, onto the lower half of each strip. Fold the dough over the filling to meet the bottom edge. Press around each ball of filling with your index fingers, making sure there are no air bubbles. Cut out the ravioli using a 2-to-3-inch round fluted cutter. Transfer to a baking sheet dusted with semolina. Make the sauce. Drizzle olive oil into a large deep pan. Add the pancetta and garlic and place over medium-high heat. When the garlic is light brown and fragrant, discard it. When the pancetta is crisp, add the mushrooms, season with salt and saute until the mushrooms are soft and wilted, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, season with salt and cook until the sauce is reduced by half. Add the butter and cook, shaking the pan, until the sauce thickens and looks velvety. Season with salt, if necessary. Cook the ravioli. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil; add the ravioli and cook 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer with a skimmer or slotted spoon to the pan with the sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, shaking the pan. Sprinkle in the cheese and swirl to combine.

Toast the cumin seeds, fennel seeds, black peppercorns, coriander seeds, cloves, white peppercorns, cinnamon sticks and star anise in a dry pan until fragrant, and then grind in a spice grinder. Put the mixture into a medium bowl, add the salt and sugar and mix well.<br> For the pork belly: Rub the pork belly thoroughly with the rub and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days. Wash the rub off the pork belly and cut each into 6 squares. Put the garlic, carrots, onions and celery in a large pan. Place the belly pieces on top of the vegetables and add the dark beer. Cover with hot water and add the black pepper, sage and bay leaves. Put the pan over high heat and bring it to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and simmer until the pork is super tender and easily breaks apart. Taste for salt and add some if needed before turning the heat off. Remove the pork from the liquid and cool enough to be able to peel the skin and fat off. Shred the meat while warm for easy shredding. Cool in the refrigerator to avoid the meat getting tough. For the BBQ sauce: Whisk together the ketchup, brown sugar, honey, molasses, Worcestershire, mustard, Sriracha, liquid smoke, sambal and coriander in a large saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook for 45 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.<br> To assemble the sloppy joes: Warm some of the pork belly meat with some of the BBQ sauce. Serve in hamburger buns. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 71137,&quot;Italian Meringue Buttercream 7 cups granulated sugar 4 cups water 8 1/4 cups egg whites 1 tablespoon salt 12 cups soft butter 1/16 cups vanilla extract Instructions: Dissolve sugar in water over medium heat, in a medium saucepan.

Salt and pepper 2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil 4 red bell peppers, cored, seeded and cut into fine julienne 2 onions, finely sliced (3 medium size) 2 pounds of egg plant, scrubbed clean 4 cloves garlic, finely sliced 28 ounces can plum tomatoes, drained and chopped (or 8 vine ripened tomatoes, peeled and seeded and chopped) 1 teaspoon dried thyme or sprigs of fresh thyme 2 medium zucchini (1 pound), scrubbed clean 2 medium yellow squash (1 pound), scrubbed clean Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To form a soupier poaching liquid, gently reheat ratatouille with fennel seeds, and tomato juice or fish stock. Bring mixture to a simmer and gently poach seafood until done. Adjust seasoning and add fresh parsley. Spoon into deep dishes and serve with warm crusty French bread with which to sop up the juices. Heat olive oil in a large heavy enamellined casserole. Add peppers and onions and saute for a minute to get them cooking. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer very gently until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Don&#39;t let olive oil get too hot or you will change the flavor. While these are cooking, cut eggplant into 3/4inch chunks. When peppers and onions are tender, add the garlic, eggplant, tomatoes and thyme and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. While this is cooking cut zucchini and yellow squash lengthwise into halves or quarters, depending on how thick they are. Remove seeds with a spoon, then cut into 3/4 inch lengths. After 30 minutes of stewing eggplant, add zucchini and squash to stew, cover and simmer, over very low heat until all the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes ( you can simmer for another 30 to 40 minutes for more meltingly tender vegetables). Strain the stew through a sieve and return juices back to casserole. Reduce the juices over medium heat until they begin to sizzle in the olive oil. Return this to the stew, season well to taste with salt and pepper. Divide ratatouille into two portions to proceed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 71140,&quot;Rise and Shine Eggs Benedict 8 slices pancetta, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons chopped garlic 1 leek, sliced into half moons 1 shallot, sliced Splash white wine 1 cup chicken stock 1/2 cup milk 1 cup mashed potatoes 2 tablespoons lemon juice Pinch cayenne 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped chives 4 eggs 1/4 cup vinegar 2 English muffins, cut in half and toasted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Arrange the pancetta in a single layer on a quarter sheet tray lined with parchment,. Lay another piece of parchment paper over the pancetta. Cook&#39;s Note: Put another quarter sheet tray on top of the parchment to fit snugly. This will prevent the pancetta from curling while baking. Put the pancetta in the oven and bake until rendered and crisp, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove the pancetta from the oven and set aside on a paper towel lined platter. Add the butter to a medium-sized saucepan over medium-high heat. Allow the butter to brown for 1 minute and then add garlic, leeks, and shallots. Cook the vegetables, stirring frequently until they develop a little color, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the white wine and scrape the fonds from the bottom of the pan. Stir in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Whisk in the milk, mashed potatoes, lemon juice, cayenne, salt, pepper and chives and stir. Keep warm. In a deep saute pan, add enough water to fill up to within 2 inches of the edge. Bring the water to a slow simmer (a slight bubble) and add the vinegar. Crack the eggs into the water and poach until the whites are firm and the yolks are still loose, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the water using a slotted spoon to a plate. To assemble: Put 2 muffin halves on each plate and put 2 slices of crisp pancetta on each half. Top each with a poached egg and pour enough gravy over the eggs to cover and form a pool on the plate.

Add the ramps to the boiling water and stir to submerge. Let cook until wilted and dark green, about 1 minute. Immediately transfer to the ice water with tongs and swirl around until completely cooled. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Roughly chop the ramps and transfer to a food processor (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Pulse the ramps until they are finely chopped, about 8 pulses. Add the butter, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon salt and the crushed red pepper flakes if using. Process, scraping down the sides halfway through, until the butter is dark green and everything is well combined, about 2 minutes.<br> There are several ways to store the ramp butter. You can transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 7 days. You can also transfer the butter to a piece of plastic wrap and roll it into a log, tying off the ends to fully enclose it.

Brush with some olive oil and sprinkle about 1 cup za&#39;atar across the dough to mostly cover with only small gaps of dough showing, brushing off any excess, and leaving 1/2-inch border of clean dough on the top and bottom edges. Fold the dough in half towards you, pinching together the naked edges to seal. Lightly go over the dough with the rolling pin to help the dough stick together. Repeat with the remaining puff pastry. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Beat the egg white with 1 tablespoon water. Brush some over the surface of the dough and sprinkle each with an additional 1/3 cup za&#39;atar. Using a pizza wheel or very sharp knife, slice each piece of dough crosswise into 12 strips. Gently twist each strip, then lay on the prepared baking sheet leaving at least 2 inches in between each, and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. (Save the remaining za&#39;atar for another use.) Bake the chilled straws, rotating and switching positions of the pans halfway through, until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.

Add half of the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles fine cornmeal. Add the remaining butter and continue pulsing until no pieces are larger than peas. Add 2 tablespoons of the ice water and pulse until combined. Add just enough of the remaining 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water, a little at a time, and pulse until the dough just comes together and holds its shape when squeezed. Turn the dough out onto a large sheet of plastic wrap, gather into a disc and wrap well. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to an 11-inch circle and fit it into a 9-inch pie plate. Crimp the edges and refrigerate the dough until chilled, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prick the bottom and sides of the crust several times with the tines of a fork. Fit a piece of aluminum foil over the crust and fill the foil with pie weights or dry beans. Bake until the edges of the crust are golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the foil and weights, return the crust to the oven and continue to bake until the bottom of the crust is lightly golden and no longer shiny, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Cool completely. For the filling: While the crust cools, use a fork to prick the yams all over. Place them on a rimmed baking sheet and roast with the oven still at 350 degrees F until very soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Peel and mash until very smooth; you should have about 2 cups. Transfer the mash to a medium bowl and add the cream, brown sugar, vanilla, allspice, ginger, salt and eggs. Whisk just until smooth. Gently tap the bottom of the bowl a few times to release any air bubbles. Pour the filling into the cooled crust and bake until the center of the pie is set and no longer shiny, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes; if the edges of the crust brown too quickly, cover them loosely with foil. Transfer the pie to a wire rack to cool. For the topping: Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat until melted. Stir in the brown sugar, vanilla and salt, stirring until the mixture starts to bubble. Stir in the pecans and cook until the nuts are toasted and have absorbed most of the buttery sugar mixture, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and gently stir in the coconut. Spoon over the pie and press gently to adhere to the filling. Let stand at least 20 minutes to cool. Serve the pie with whipped cream if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 71151,&quot;Big Cheese Squeeze 2 slices of bread, cut thin (as far as bread selection goes, all I&#39;ll say is the bigger the loaf the bigger the sandwich) 1 teaspoon (or more) smooth Dijon mustard 1 cup grated cheese semi-soft combo like smoked gouda and Gruyere or Fontina with a young Asiago. Good quality olive oil for spritzing Instructions: Find 2 heavy skillets that will nest together. Two (10-inch) cast iron skillets are ideal. Heat them over high heat. Meanwhile, spread mustard on one slice of bread. Distribute the cheese evenly over the mustard, season with fresh black pepper and top with second piece of bread. Spritz the bread surface that&#39;s staring up at you with olive oil using either a Misto or a pump sprayer. A light coat will do; don&#39;t soak. When the pans are hot enough to vigorously sizzle a drop of water, remove them from the heat and place the sandwich, top-side down, in the middle of one pan. (If your pans are a different size, this would be the smaller one.) Spritz the slice now facing you, as well as the bottom of the other skillet. Lay the skillet right on top of the sandwich. If the top pan isn&#39;t cast iron, weigh it down with a brick, can or something of similar heft. Wait patiently; crack a beer. When you hear the first bit of cheese run out and sizzle on the pan, it&#39;s done. This will take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully remove the top skillet (you may need to coax it off with a spatula, but I doubt it). Just look at it. It&#39;s perfect. Better than Mom&#39;s (no reason to tell her). Remove to a plate, count to 10 and slice it in half. Take a bite. Take another.
