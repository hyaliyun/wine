Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, its grapes were grown in St. Helena. The wine shows softly lush tannins and deep, complex flavors of red fruit, berry, licorice, cocoa and mineral that easily stand up to 100% new French oak. Don't open it until at least 2018, and it should develop for many years afterward.","designation":"Profile","title":"Merryvale 2009 Profile Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Incredibly dense and rich, this just rocks with luscious aromas and flavors of cherry pie, anise, mushroom and sandalwood.

Best after 2016.","designation":"Episode","title":"Terlato 2008 Episode Red (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Three Corner is a block in the estate vineyard that was planted in 1974. The 2010 is very rich and full bodied, dramatically so packed with cherries and pomegranates and savory spices and minerals. The power reflects the vineyard's site in a warmer part of the valley. But the wine never loses sight of elegance, and, like all Rochioli's vineyard-designated Pinot Noirs, it is in need of age. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2016, and the wine should develop for many years afterward.","designation":"Three Corner","title":"Rochioli 2010 Three Corner Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Rich, vital and dramatically layered, offering tiers of ripe cherry and blackberry flavors.

It should hit its stride in 8-10 years and go for well beyond that.","designation":"","title":"Lokoya 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)"},{"country":"US","description":"Bitter tannins lock this wine down in mouth-numbing astringency. Below the tannins is incredibly pure fruit, by way of blackberry and plum flavors.

This is nowhere near ready, so give it at least eight years in the cellar.","designation":"","title":"Lokoya 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is heavy on the wood, but it's so rich in fruit as well.

The acidity is straight as an arrow, giving the wine good lift.","designation":"","title":"Maison Jessiaume 2009  Chambertin"},{"country":"US","description":"This low production (365 cases) Pinot Noir is a selection from the winery's various vineyards. It's an enormous wine, intricately layered with blackberry, cherry, cola, mushroom, pine needle, bacon and toasty oak.

It's like a medieval tapestry, intricately woven and velvety, with interlocking flavors of berry, cherry, cola, mushroom, buttered toast and spice. As powerful as it is, it retains a subtlety that's captivating and elusive. Still, the acids and tannins are strong and unresolved. Cellar this for at least six years.","designation":"Gowan Creek Vineyard Estate Grown","title":"Goldeneye 2009 Gowan Creek Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"An elaborate wine it's broodingly closed and dry, yet it offers tantalizing glimpses of what it could become. As acidic and tannic as it is, it dazzles with complexity, showing notes of blackberries and cherries, then licorice and cola, then smoked meats, saut ed mushrooms and spices. A great success, it should begin to mellow by 2015.","designation":"Confluence Vineyard Estate Grown","title":"Goldeneye 2009 Confluence Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Made in the Lokoya style, which is darkly colored, full bodied, tannic and dense in mountain fruit.

The only difference between this Estate Monte Bello Cabernet and Ridge's Monte Bello Estate Cabernet ($150; note the difference in the placement of \\"estate\\") is that the winemaker selected lots from the vineyard that were considered more accessible, which in this case means more luscious.

This upscale Pinot Noir is drinkable now and should evolve over the next six years.","designation":"Durell Vineyard","title":"De Loach 2009 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"A major league Cabernet, capable of extended aging. Blended with a few drops of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it shows massive flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and sweetly smoked cedar wood. Just superb and delicious, but tannic and locked down in astringency. If you can keep your hands off it, cellar this beauty.

Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class.

The crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime, that accompanies the raspberry, cherry and persimmon fruit is bracing. Meanwhile, a mushroomy earthiness gives complex layers that don't stop.

Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, cr me de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins.
