nose, alongside slate, mint and sandalwood notes. those same red-cherry elements meet with cranberry on the palate, growing more complex as layers of graphite, bay leaf, pine needle and turned forest floor arise.","designation":"Coastview Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"wilting white flowers, tangerine and jasmine aromas are followed by light but sweet fruit flavors, with the sugar providing much of the appeal.","designation":"Special Harvest"},{"country":"it","description":"this opens with aromas suggesting toast, menthol, mature berry, coffee and a balsamic note. on the full-bodied palate, notes of white pepper, cinnamon and powdered sage accent dried black cherry while firm, close-grained tannins provide the framework.","designation":"Bricco Ambrogio"},{"country":"us","description":"the dried herb, currant and woodspice aromas provide intrigue. flavors offer a mouthful of fruit with balance, intensity and length that convinces.","designation":"House of Independent Producers Bacchus Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"though reserved on the nose at first, this bottling begins to show dense blueberry, coffee and soy with patience. there are boisterous flavors of squeezed elderberry and blackberry fruit once sipped, along with beef char, black coffee, dark chocolate and purple flowers on the finish. this still needs a little time to open, but shows lots of potential.","designation":"Club Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"light in color and silky in texture, this earthy wine offers overtones of cinnamon, dark cherry, raspberry and clove. well integrated in terms of oak and tannin, it's full-bodied enough to please those who like a bigger styled wine.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"not quite up there with the '05, but certainly better than the '04, this wine shows softly ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries and red currants, with complexities of mocha, vanilla, bacon, pepper and sandalwood. beautiful now and for the next 3‚Äì5 years.","designation":"Selleck Vineyard"},{"country":"pt","description":"producing wines at the western end of the douro vineyards since the 18th century, this family estate presents a young, vibrant tawny with this vintage. it has a fine mix of fresh and dried fruits along with wood flavors that come from the aging in old barrels. it is a dry tawny with some acidity at the end to give this rich wine a final lift.","designation":"Colheita Tawny"},{"country":"it","description":"funky, earthy aromas dissipate in the glass to reveal mature black plum, espresso and vanilla. the forward, warm palate offers ripe‚Äîalmost overripe‚Äîblack cherry, layered with fleshy raspberry, coffee, and bitter chocolate sensations. it closes on a sweet, almost sugary note.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"es","description":"briny apple and lime aromas set up a minerally, fresh, natural palate with stony lime, green apple and white-pineapple flavors. par for the brut nature course is a stony, chiseled finish that frames the wine's crisp, lean character.","designation":"Privat Brut Nature"},{"country":"fr","description":"always a dense, dark and concentrated selection, la forge is a wine that is immediately attractive but would be best after a few years of cellaring. notes of dark berry preserves, muddled boysenberry, raspberry sauce, cocoa, leather and truffle abound on the nose and palate. the mouthfeel is plush and creamy, with medium tannins and a texture like crushed velvet. the finish is long and spicy, offering notes of black pepper and charred oak spice.","designation":"La Forge"},{"country":"georgia","description":"aged in buried clay vessels in accordance with ancient georgian winemaking techniques, then transferred to new oak, there's a core of bright cherry fruit, coffee grinds and vanilla on the nose and palate of this unique saperavi. it's a good wine, but charred wood, jagged tannins and hints of barnyard tend to obscure all the lovely fruit.","designation":"Satrapezo"},{"country":"us","description":"smoky tar is met by dark brick color in this serious, robust and 100% varietal wine. jammy black cherry is complemented by chewy tannin. this is a steak wine in every way, rich and rewarding.","designation":"Fortitude"},{"country":"us","description":"cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc meet up with smaller amounts of syrah, zinfandel and petit verdot in this soft, silky blend. mild tannin and a robustness of ripe black currant and cedar are seasoned in a strong whiplash of eucalyptus, as the finish touches a theme of black tea.","designation":"Potelle Two"},{"country":"us","description":"the alcohol on this wine is 16.2%, so high that it makes the wine taste as sweet as port. there may even be residual sugar, giving it the taste of blackberry jam and chocolate.","designation":"Thurow Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"another solid showing from one of importer fran kysela's stable of rh√¥ne producers. this offering shows plenty of rustic leathery aromas, along with a blend of cherries and blackberries. not overripe or heavy; the fruit and tanned-hide notes come together in a velour-textured finish.","designation":"Domaine Grand Veneur"}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:S}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return
