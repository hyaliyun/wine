Distinctive for its rich acids as well as the deep core of blackberry and coffee flavors and firm tannins.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A full-bodied wine that packs plenty of chocolate, plum, coffee, black cherry, vanilla and spice flavors. The tannins are fairly smooth, while the finish is a tad short for a wine with this kind of stuffing. Still, quite nice for those who enjoy a rich, sweet Port style.","designation":"Blis #3 Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"A smooth, toasty, oaky style of Sauvignon Blanc. Quite viscous and almost chewy on the palate. The flavors run towards melon, fig, more toast, pear and apple flavors. Hints of butterscotch are at the end, finishing still bright and clean.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The winery seems to be picking earlier than most, so that the wine from this celebrated vineyard, in this wonderful vintage, is tough and tannic. You can taste the underlying cherry fruit, but it's hard. The gamble is on ageability. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, try after 2006.","designation":"Allen Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"What a nice Cab this is. Intense cherry and currant fruit, and wonderful balance. Tannins, acids and oak act in harmony, pulling it all together. Will probably age well.","designation":""},{"country":"ar","description":"This top-of-the-line Cabernet (there's also 16% Merlot) boasts an impressive texture that's remarkably smooth and supple.

Good price for the appellation and ageworthiness.","designation":"Chicken Ranch Reserve"},{"country":"ar","description":"This upper middle-class Trapiche brand seems to be here to stay, and the Malbec offers round, chunky aromas of sweet berries and vanilla, followed by a juicy palate loaded with plum and cherry. Some dark campfire notes to the finish let you know this is real wine.","designation":"Broquel"},{"country":"US","description":"You'll find an array of fruit flavors but the main one is sweet-sour lemondrop, sweetened with oak. The wine is soft in acids, with an oily, creamy texture and an oriental spice finish. It has class and elegance.","designation":"Bien Nacido Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"A full-bodied, rich Chard that combines ripe tropical fruit, sweet pear, green apple and spice flavors with winemaker interventions, including smoky oak and lees. The creamy texture and long finish are just great.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Give this wine a few minutes and it'll display a fine bouquet of black cherry, sweet almond paste and cedar. The palate veers a bit toward the lean, red-fruit spectrum of Brunello, but the more air and time it's given, the more open it becomes. Decant and drink slowly for best results.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"There will never be a lushly ripe Cab from this cool appellation, but no one has worked harder to craft interesting ones than Smith &amp; Hook.

The result is an earthy, tobacco-scented wine that still retains underpinnings of fresh blackberries. Finishes with elegant flourishes of smoke and vanilla.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"it","description":"Luce's second wine is violet in color, with profound cola and root beer aromas, lots of oak, and a rich personality.

Beyond the herbaceousness are some pure flavors of blackberries and cherries. Drink 2008 and beyond.","designation":"Block Collection, Vallerga Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a tannic, acidic puppydog of a wine. It's not showing its best now, coming off as rather tight and tense. The question is, will it age? The best evidence is a rich core of blackberry and cherry fruit that hits midpalate and really kicks in on the finish. Best after 2008.","designation":"Out-of-Sight Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"A big, exuberant wine, filled with power but a bit wanting in grace at this stage of its life.

Not for the cellar, but great now for your best foods.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Starts with a confusing nose of tobacco, smoked ham and overt leather and animal aromas; a staid, simple wine this is not. The palate, which has a feel that's thick and chewy, is bulked up with baked black fruits. The finish, meanwhile, is dark, with berry flavors and fading spice. The blend is Cabernet, Merlot and Sangiovese.","designation":"Guidalberto"},{"country":"US","description":"Oaky, with a meaty, leathery edge to the blackberry and cherry flavors, and very dry.

Long in the finish, this balanced wine should hold well for 10 years.","designation":"Perspective"},{"country":"it","description":"Probably not what you'd expect from this wine. It's a fair amount gamy, with caramel, warm earth and some bacon on the nose. There's sweet berry fruit and licorice notes, but also a dry, peppery, woody character. Shows a young, willing attitude, but it's not the best  Guado  of the past few vintages.","designation":"Guado al Tasso"},{"country":"es","description":"A modern, ripe, full-bodied Chardonnay that sports an aun personality and a bright gold luster. It's richly buttered, with lemon, pineapple, green apple and cinnamon flavors. Creamy on the finish yet it holds onto its minerality. An atypical Navarran white due to its richness.","designation":"Colecci n 125"},{"country":"it","description":"Very pretty on the nose, with warm plum, vanilla and mint aromas.

Hard to imagine a more versatile wine at the table, and an incredible value in something different for a change.","designation":"Ros  de Saign e"},{"country":"es","description":"One of the big differences between C ceres and its competitors is a reliance on French rather than American oak.

A fully mature Rioja that offers good value.","designation":"Gran Reserva"},{"country":"US","description":"Seems to possess that mountain character of a tightly wound wine, tannic and firm, with a rich and solid core of black cherry and currant fruit. Those tannins are pretty fierce now, but should develop nicely. Best after 2008.","designation":"Mountainside"},{"country":"it","description":"Fine-tuned aromas of mint, licorice, herbs and berries hit, while oak comes on with airing.

Complex yet smooth and sleek. Long, elegant finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"It took a while for this wine to open up, because it's closed and brooding at first. Opens with a cigarette ash aroma you sometimes find in terroir-driven wines. Tannic; airing reveals lush cherry and cassis flavors and a rich overlay of fine smoky oak. Seems a natural for the cellar, and could age to greatness by 2010.","designation":"Red Rose Hill"},{"country":"US","description":"A new wine from Robert Pepi, and an ambitious one.

Mostly Cabernet with a splash of Merlot.","designation":"Red Wine"},{"country":"US","description":"A bright, zippy style that still shows depth, with complex layers of black cherry, black currant, ginger, coffee, herb and cinnamon flavors.

Hold until 2005.","designation":"Collepiano"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows real finesse in the rich balance of fruit, oak, acidity and tannins, and while it's complex, it's also an easy drink.

Prominent grapefruit, grass, and fig elements recall a Bordeaux Blanc. A good one.

Better than many wines we sampled that were twice the price.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Scents of herb and saddle leather mix it up at the start; the wine hits the palate with a broad swath of chalky tannin.

More renditions like this will expand the grape's possibilites and make it more friends.","designation":""},{"country":"ar","description":"Deep berry fruit, sweet perfume and beyond average complexity. From an excellent vintage, it offers violets on the nose and a sweet, rich body. A no-brainer among under-$10 reds.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"Whether due to the wild ferment, this is one of the more singular-tasting Chards we sampled.

Smooth, harmonious, yummy. 1,000 cases produced.","designation":"Prelude Vineyards"},{"country":"ar","description":"Big and burly, but also stylish. The nose throws off roasted plum, rubber, road tar and tree bark. All together the bouquet stirs interest.

Still young, the tannins are edgy and the wine will definitely benefit from another year or two in the bottle.","designation":"Chaleur Estate"},{"country":"ar","description":"A single-vineyard wine from Tupungato, and barrel fermented as well as fully oaked throughout aging.

This is an elegant, harmonious Chardonnay, with white stone fruit at the core, and hazelnuts, vanilla and talc flavors that accent rather than overwhelm the fruit.

Hints of leaf and earth emerge with time, but this is  very young and compact. A serious wine that needs substantial decanting and/or cellar time.","designation":"Artist Series"},{"country":"US","description":"Another single-vineyard gem, solid, substantial and sophisticated, though still quite young and tight. Fruit flavors hint at raspberry and pomegranate, along with graphite and dry, lightly chalky tannins. The mix is roughly two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Cab Franc, 10% Merlot and a splash of Petit Verdot. The PV is a catalyst; it puts things in play and makes the wine jump.","designation":"Champoux Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"The unusual twist here is 19% Malbec, a grape rarely grown in Washington.

Good penetration and a nice balance that captures the flavors of oak without making the wine oaky.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The aromas recall fresh-turned soil, showing leaf, earth, manure and herb.

Young, complex and fascinating.","designation":"Cougar Hills"},{"country":"US","description":"The winery's premier wine showcases  Block One  Champoux vineyard fruit: about two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cab Franc and the rest Petit Verdot. A big, fleshy wine, it shows rich, plummy fruit and swirling streaks of licorice, mineral and preserves. Young and somewhat blocky, it's dominated by cassis and a broad swath of dusty tannin.
