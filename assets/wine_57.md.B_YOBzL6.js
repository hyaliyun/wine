But there's lots of blackberry and black currant richness, and the wine is totally dry, with full-bodied, thick tannins. Unusual for a Cabernet, but a nice, complicated red wine for drinking with grilled meats.","designation":"Preston Vineyard","title":"V.

Right now the tannins, dusty as they are, dominate, and the blackberry and cherry flavors are all jam. Should develop healthily for 6C8 years.","designation":"","title":"Riboli 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)"},{"country":"cl","description":"Thick, minty and extracted, with charcoal darkness. A forward wine that steps on the gas pedal with cola, black cherry and licorice flavors. More dark flavors and licorice notes settle on the finish, which has good feel but not much variety.

Long and lingering on the finish; a dessert wine sure to please those with a sweet tooth.","designation":"Ice Apple Wine","title":"Domaine Pinnacle NV Ice Apple Wine Apple (Canada)"},{"country":"US","description":"Though it lacks the broad, sweet fruit of the 2005 reserve, this is a fine reflection of the vintage. It's compact, tannic, and a bit unyielding, but structured with enough density to age for a few years.

There's a Zin-like briary, brambly feeling, and the blackberries have a strong herbal component, while the finish is awash in peppery spices. The tannins, too, are classic Dry Creek, furry and edgy.

It's fresh in acids and clearly has a pedigree of terroir, showing mineral-infused raspberries, cherries, rhubarbs, wild strawberries, and pomegranates, accented with rich, smoky oak.

Will hold for perhaps six years.","designation":"Hawk Hill Vineyard","title":"Williams Selyem 2007 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Ed Sbragia is making some of the most interesting single-vineyard Cabernets in California.

It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish.

The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa, herbs and sweetly smoked oak are beautiful and complex, yet the tannin-acid balance is near perfect.

Drink now-2025.","designation":"The Standish Single Vineyard","title":"Standish 2005 The Standish Single Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"The winery's philosophy is, if you're going to make a dessert wine, why not make it fabulously sweet instead of boringly off-dry? With 17.5% residual sugar, this indeed hits the limit of the sweetness scale. Yet it's superbly balanced with acidity, giving a refreshing balance to the intense apricot jam, lemon drop, candied ginger, pineapple crme br?le and vanilla custard flavors. A tremendous success for a California dessert wine.","designation":"Late Harvest","title":"Williams Selyem 2007 Late Harvest Muscat (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"it","description":"This beautiful expression of Nebbiolo from the La Serra cru represents the best of Barolo winemaking tradition.

Racy in acidity, silky in texture, yet powerful, it exudes the essence of Pinot Noir's greatness. Shows great fruity ripeness in the cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, licorice and bacon flavors, and also a wild, forest quality of grilled mushrooms, thyme and fennel. Absolutely dry, with a firm spine of tannins, the structure is near perfect. A divine expression of Hirsch, and a good candidate for six years in the cellar.","designation":"Hirsch Vineyard","title":"Williams Selyem 2007 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous.

Made from a vineyard on the true Sonoma Coast, in the remote Fort Ross area, it's fabulously rich in cherry, framboise and red currant flavors, with intriguing waves of anise, bacon and sweet, vanilla-scented smoky sandalwood.

Stunning now, and should hold for at least six years.","designation":"Precious Mountain Vineyard","title":"Williams Selyem 2007 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"A spectacular Pinot Noir, but a very young one, and extremely dry. It's a wine of great structure, with rich acids and tannins framing extraordinarily complex flavors of grilled cherries, strawberries and raspberries, with complicating notes of cola, pomegranates, orange zest, anise, dusty Asian spices and smoky sandalwood. A truly great Pinot Noir from a great vintage that needs time in the bottle to express itself.
