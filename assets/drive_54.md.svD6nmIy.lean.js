Drink this attractive wine from 2017.","designation":"Vertice Grande Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine defines luxurious texture, at once velvety, richly layered and bright. From one of the warmer sites in a cool climate zone, it complements its fruit concentration with deeper sarsaparilla, vanilla, tea and cardamom scents, the finish delightfully playful in orange peel accents.","designation":"UV Lucky Well Vineyard"},{"country":"de","description":"This late-release GG is a stunning showcase of how just a few years of bottle age impact a dry, richly concentrated Riesling. Yellow peach and grapefruit tones shine brightly still, but are glazed by layers of slick, penetrating minerals. While moderate in alcohol, it feels dense and creamy on the palate. The finish meanders almost endlessly, punctuated playfully by strikes of lemon-lime acidity. It's singing now, but should improve till at least 2020.","designation":"Wehlener Sonnenuhr Old Vines GG Erste Lage Dry"},{"country":"es","description":"For those who like an old-school, oxidized style of white Rioja (think L√≥pez de Heredia), Murrieta's Capellan√≠a is up your alley. The nose is almost like Sherry in its creamy, maderized state, while the palate is low in power, with coconut and lemon flavors. Finishes soft, with vanilla. A unique, identifiable white wine that's not for everyone. Drink now.","designation":"Capellan√≠a"},{"country":"us","description":"Though it was given twice as many new French oak barrels as the Estate bottling, this Vintage Select could be its twin. Solid and balanced, it mixes berry, herb and earth components, making for a well-structured, no-frills wine.","designation":"Vintage Select"},{"country":"it","description":"Oak, coconut, espresso and menthol aromas lift out of the glass. The taut somewhat lean palate shows raw sour cherry, tart cranberry, espresso and oak-driven spice but not much fruit richness. Tight raspy tannins dry out the finish. Let the tannins soften for a few years then drink to capture the remaining fruit.","designation":"Preve"},{"country":"us","description":"Tim Mondavi is back with this interesting Cabernet blend. It's very much in the modern Napa style, soft, rich and sophisticated, with cherry, red currant, Asian spice and new oak flavors. It's an elegant wine, but a fairly tannic one, with a dusty astringency that suggests mid-term aging. An auspicious, if expensive, new beginning.","designation":"Proprietary Red Wine"},{"country":"it","description":"The light cherry aromas and flavors with herb accents show a slight candied quality. Decent structure, but overall the wine is a bit narrow and closes with sharp, quite tart cherry fruit. It's youthful, for sure, and perhaps will even out with six to nine months in the bottle.","designation":"Aziano"},{"country":"us","description":"This is a little tight upon opening, showing just touches of flower, herb and earth.

The nose here is fresh and loaded with berry sweetness and accents of cinnamon and forest floor. The palate is round and chewy, with plum and berry flavors. It's richer than many so-called alta expresi√≥n wines, and the structure goes way beyond that of most under-$10 reds. With some airing and good food, it's a certain winner.","designation":"Crianza - Estate Bottled - Finca los Trenzones"},{"country":"cl","description":"Pear and apple aromas open this unoaked Chardonnay.

Drink over the next few years.","designation":"Black"},{"country":"at","description":"An overtone of leesy yeast quickly gives way to lemony freshness, rounded out by hints of yellow plum and peach. Citrus also continues to be the focus on the palate: fresh zest of ripe lemons and Meyer lemons just edged by peppery spice. This is taut and very linear, streamlined, concentrated and slender but still tightly wound. This will relax into more spice and fruit with a little while in bottle. Right now it is a zesty, evocative mouthful of promise.","designation":"Ried Sch√ºtt Smaragd"},{"country":"il","description":"A blend of 40% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot, 4% Cabernet Franc, and 3% each Mourv√®dre and Grenache, this wine is made from grapes that are dried for 50 days prior to fermentation.

Wild flower tones ride over underripe peach, with leesy undertones.","designation":"Unrestricted Barrel Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"Veteran winemaker Eric Laumann pushes the varietal envelope by blending Dornfelder, Tannat, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah in this wine.

Drink over the next 5‚Äì6 years.","designation":"Grand Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"The Frederick bottling is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 31% Merlot, with other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Chewy and tannic, it seems to have a green edge to its fruit and tannins. Nonetheless, there are plenty of flavors of berry, spice and black pepper, with highlights of coffee and cacao. This has lots to chew on, plus good length.","designation":"Frederick Estate Grown Red Wine"},{"country":"it","description":"This simple wine offers subdued charred earth and dark-skinned berry aromas. On the palate, an unusual medicinal note and green hint of sage accent the faint sour cherry fruit. The tannins are astringent yet fleeting.","designation":"Tomaiolo Riserva"},{"country":"us","description":"Kevin Riley packs eight varieties into this pink wine, but the major proportion of Syrah and Grenache lend it its deep hue and rose petal, red cherry and vanilla notes on the nose.

Flavors of blackberry jelly are lifted by lavender and anise spice.","designation":"Osso Balenda Vineyard"},{"country":"cl","description":"A bit green and ashy, with aromas of green bean, green tobacco and bell pepper. It's not over-the-top vegetal, but it does deal plenty of green bean and celery in addition to tangerine.

Ripe, round and bursting with flavor, this luscious wine is a paean to blackberry fruit. Veins of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate weave through the extended finish. Cellar this for another few years if you can keep your hands off it, but know that it is almost too good to wait for.","designation":"Luxuria"},{"country":"pt","description":"A powerhouse, but one that shows a certain degree of lushness to its robust blackberry and mint flavors.

Lovely now and over the next six years.","designation":"Ponzo"},{"country":"at","description":"Mandarin peel flirts with the aromatic zest of Seville orange. The concentration of flavor is immense and has the verve, drive and linearity of a jet-engine on on takeoff.
