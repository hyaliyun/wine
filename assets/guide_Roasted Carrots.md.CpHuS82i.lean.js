In a large, hot saute pan, saute the foie gras until golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Remove to a paper towel lined plate Place the gingerbread on a plate and top with the pears and foie gras. Sauce the plate with pinot noir jus and garnish the foie gras with the cacao nibs. Place all ingredients in a small pot and cover with a clean towel. Bring to a slow simmer. Cook until a knife will easily go into the pears. Remove pears form the heat and cool to room temperature in the liquid. Slice and fan the pears. Heat the pears in the poaching liquid before serving. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cut the onion, carrot and leek into medium dice. In a medium saucepot, add the garlic and sweat the vegetables in 2 ounces of the olive oil until translucent and soft. Add the half bottle of pinot noir and reduce by half. Add the veal and brown chicken stocks and bring to a simmer, skimming scum off the surface often. Heat a pan and add the remaining 2 ounces olive oil and the squab bones. When the bones start to color, place the pan in the oven and roast the bones until golden brown. Add the bones to the sauce and deglaze the pan with 2 tablespoons pinot noir and add the deglazed fond to the sauce. Reduce the sauce by half, strain and discard the bones and vegetables. Continue to reduce to desired consistency and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of wine. Season with salt and pepper and pass through chinois. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Meursault, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 4,&quot;Lemon-Scented Broccolini 1 1/2 pounds broccolini, washed, chopped 1 cup water 4 strips lemon peel Salt Instructions: Place broccolini in a large bowl. Add 1 cup water and tuck lemon peels in and around the broccolini. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 5 minutes. Remove from the microwave, drain and add a little salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 5,&quot;Chocolate Sea Salt Rugelach 2 1/2 cups (325 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup (226 grams) unsalted butter, cubed and cold 8 ounces (226 grams) cream cheese, straight from the fridge<br> 2 large egg yolks plus 1 large whole egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, optional<br> 1 1/2 cups (260 grams) chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (I prefer milk but any type will do!) Flaky salt, for sprinkling<br> Sprinkles, sanding sugar or turbinado sugar, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: Combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the cubed butter, distributing it all over the top of the dry ingredients, then dollop in the cream cheese (1-inch dollops should do it, but it doesn&#39;t need to be perfect). Turn the mixer on low speed and mix until the mixture is mostly mealy and there are still some larger clumps of butter and cream cheese intact. With the mixer still running, add the egg yolks, vanilla and almond extract, if using, then continue mixing until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half and shape into 2 discs. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, stirring constantly, or in a microwaveable bowl in 30-second increments, stirring after each. Set aside to cool briefly while you roll out the dough. Beat the remaining whole egg with a splash of water for an egg wash. Roll out a dough disc on a lightly floured surface, dusting with flour as needed to prevent it from sticking, until it is a wide rectangle, 18-by-9-inches. Use an offset spatula to spread half of the chocolate over the dough in a thin even layer, leaving a 1-inch border along the long edge that&#39;s farthest from you. (Try to work kind of quickly so the chocolate doesn&#39;t harden.) Brush the border with a thin layer of egg wash. Starting on the long end closest to you, roll the dough into a long, tight log, then place it seam-side down on a cutting board or baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and chocolate. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days (depending on fridge space, you might want to cut the log in half so you&#39;re dealing with four shorter logs instead of two really long ones; wrap in plastic if refrigerating for longer than 1 hour). Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Brush the logs with a thin layer of egg wash, then sprinkle with a few pinches of flaky salt and a ton of sprinkles or sanding sugar. Cut into 1 1/2-inch slices and transfer to the baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart. Bake until golden brown on top, about 24 minutes. (You might notice that the cookies seem to sweat and leak out some fat while in the oven; this is completely normal.) Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, or enjoy them warm! Fully cooled cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for several days. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 6,&quot;Tart of Spiced Fruit Pie dough 1/2 pound dried figs 1/4 pound raisins 1/2 pint red wine 1 pound cooking apples 1 pound pears 4 ounces caster sugar 1 tablespoon flaked almonds 1/2 teaspoon powdered cloves 1/2 teaspoon ground mace 1/2 teaspoon powdered cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Simmer figs and raisins in the wine for 30 minutes. Peel, core and slice the apples and pears. Add them, together with the sugar, almonds, and spices to the figs and raisins and simmer until the apples and pears are soft. Line a dish with pie dough. Fill with the fruit mixture and bake for 1/2 hour or until pastry is cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 7,&quot;Pithivier 1/2 recipe Almond Cream, recipe follows Puff pastry, store bought Egg wash: 2 large egg yolks 1 large egg 1/4 cup whole milk 1/4 cup light corn syrup 1 1/2 tablespoons water To make almond flour: 1 cup (125 grams) slivered almonds 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon room temperature unsalted butter 1 large egg Instructions: Prepare the almond cream, place it in a pastry bag with a large opening (no tip) and set aside. Prepare the pithivier: Cut the puff pastry dough in 1/2 and roll each 1/2 into an 8 1/2-inch circle. Each circle will be about 1/8-inch thick. Place 1 of the circles on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Pipe a 5-inch-diameter mound of almond cream in the center of the circle. The mound should be about 1-inch high. Prepare the egg wash: Whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small bowl until well combined. Lightly brush the remaining 1 1/2-inch rim of the pastry circle with the egg wash. Place the second circle of puff pastry over the first. Gently press against the sides of the almond cream mound to remove any trapped air. Seal the edges of the 2 layers by pressing the top edge into the bottom edge. This will keep the almond cream from running out as it bakes. Use a sharp knife to give the circle a fluted edge. It should look like a flower when finished. Use a sharp knife to pierce a 1/2-inch slit in the top layer at the center of the almond cream mound. This will allow steam to escape during baking. This dessert usually has a classic pattern scored into its top. If you would like to try it, use a sharp knife to score a curved line that begins at the top of the mound and ends at the bottom of the mound. Repeat this line every 1/2-inch around the circumference of the mound, but be careful not to cut through the top layer and into the almond cream. Let the pithivier rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour before baking. (At this point, you can wrap the pithivier well in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 2 weeks. Let it thaw in the refrigerator or in your backpack before baking.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the pithiviers until it begins to brown slightly, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze: Stir together the corn syrup and water. Remove the pithivier from the oven and brush it well with the corn syrup mixture. This adds sweetness, enhances the color, and gives it a crispy crust. Lower the oven 20 degrees and continue to bake until well risen and evenly browned, about another 15 minutes. The baked pithivier should be flaky and tender, and the almond cream center still moist. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. The pithivier is best when served while it is still slightly warm. Use a serrated knife to slice it. I can&#39;t tell you how long the baked Pithivier can be stored because I never have any leftovers! It is possible to buy almond flour (use 1 cup if you do) but it just as easy to make your own. Place the slivered almonds (no skin preferred) and granulated sugar into the food processor. Pulse until the almonds and sugar reach the consistency of flour. It is best to pulse because the heat of the blade will cause the release of the oil from the almonds. Mix in the flour. Mix in the butter. Add the egg and mix until the mixture becomes light and creamy. Do not overmix or the gluten in the flour will overdevelop and the almond cream will lose its delicate texture when baked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 8,&quot;Fire and Ice Peach and Jalapeno Soup Ice Bowls with Cotton Candy 3 cups peeled, pitted and diced peaches 1/2 cup peach schnapps 1 cup dry white wine 1 handful mint leaves 1 jalapeno, seeds removed depending on desired heat 3 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons heavy cream Crystalline sugar, for garnish, optional Cotton candy, for garnish (can be found in the candy aisle of most grocery stores) Instructions: Fill a shot glass ice tray with water and freeze overnight. Combine all the above ingredients in a blender and puree. Set in refrigerator for at least 1 hour to allow all the ingredients to meld. It also will help to keep your ice bowl from melting if your soup is extra chilled. On small plates add about 2 tablespoons of crystal sugar. Put the ice shot glasses on top of the sugar. Pour the soup into the shot glasses, garnish with cotton candy and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 9,&quot;Pan Roasted Okra with Onions and Five Spices &#39;Bhindi Sabzi&#39; 1 1/2 pounds okra 2 to 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon Fivespice Blend (see recipe below) 1 large onion (about 1/2 pound), peeled and sliced 1/3 cup water Lemon juice Coarse salt 3/4 teaspoon cumin seeds 3/4 teaspoon mustard seeds 3/4 teaspoon fennel seeds 3/4 teaspoon sesame seeds 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes Instructions: Wash okra and wipe dry. Trim and leave okra whole. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, heat the oil until hot. Add the spice blend and let it sizzle for 20 seconds or until the cumin turns a few shades darker. Add the okra and onions, toss and mix, and cook about 10 minutes or until vegetables are streaked brown. Add water and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook, covered, for about 10 minutes or until okra is soft. Uncover and continue cooking until the excess moisture evaporates and the vegetables look glazed. Sprinkle with lemon juice and salt and serve. Combine cumin, mustard, fennel and sesame seeds and red pepper flakes. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 10,&quot;Stuffed Tenderloin Head roast of tenderloin, approximately 1 to 1 1/2 pounds Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Olive oil 3 ounces blue cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Slice roast open lengthwise in middle to create a pocket, being careful to not slice all the way through. Salt and pepper the meat on all sides. Heat a grill pan over high heat and brush roast with olive oil. Sear the roast on all sides. Remove from the heat, tent with foil and allow to rest for 15 minutes. After the meat has rested, stuff pocket with the blue cheese. Tie the whole thing together with kitchen string. Return the tied meat to the grill pan, place into the oven and cook until it reaches an internal temperature of 125 degrees F, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, wrap in aluminum foil and allow to rest 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah]&quot; 11,&quot;Twice Baked New Potatoes 1 1/2 pounds small red potatoes (new potatoes) 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 cup shredded Monterey jack cheese 1/2 cup sour cream 3 ounces cream cheese 1/3 cup minced green onions 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 clove minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper 1 pound bacon, cooked and crumbled 1 cup crushed garlic flavored pretzels 1/2 stick butter, melted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pierce potatoes and rub skins with oil. Place in a shallow baking pan in a single layer. Bake uncovered for 50 minutes or until tender. Allow to cool. In a mixing bowl, combine Monterey jack, sour cream, cream cheese, onions, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper and mix well. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the pulp, leaving a thin shell. Add pulp to the cheese mixture and mash. Stir in half of the cooked, crumbled bacon. Stuff potato shells. In a separate bowl add the crushed pretzels, the remaining bacon, and the melted butter. Mix well. Top each potato with the pretzel topping. Place in a baking dish or on a cookie sheet and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until heated through. These can also be frozen and then baked at a later date. Be sure to thaw before baking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12,&quot;Ultimate Macaroni and Cheese 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 4 tablespoons minced onions 4 tablespoons sweet butter 4 tablespoons flour 10 ounces milk 3 ounces white wine 1/2 teaspoon Hungarian paprika 6 ounces sharp white cheddar 3 ounces gruyere cheese Fresh ground nutmeg, to taste Salt and fresh ground white pepper to taste 3/4 pound cooked macaroni Instructions: In a saucepan over low heat, add oil then the onions sweat until translucent.

Remove from the heat, stir in the paprika, cheese, season to taste with nutmeg, white pepper, and salt. Mix in your cooked macaroni and serve immediately. Note: If you like to turn this dish into a casserole, preheat the oven to 350 degrees, place the macaroni and cheese into a casserole dish, sprinkle 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese on top, then sprinkle 1 tablespoon dried bread crumbs on top of the cheese. Cook for approximately 4 minutes or until lightly brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 13,&quot;Vanilla Sugar Cookies 2 1/3 cups plus 2 tablespoons (11-ounces) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks; 6-ounces) unsalted butter 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4-ounces) granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Set aside. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture in 2 batches, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Beat until the dough just comes together, being careful not to over mix. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Place the ball of dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper and roll out to 1/4-inch thick. Keeping the dough in the parchment, transfer to a cookie sheet and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut out the cookies in the desired shapes and place on a half-sheet pan lined with parchment paper or an un-greased nonstick cookie sheet, at least 1-inch apart. Transfer to the freezer and chill for at least 15 minutes or until they are firm. Bake until the cookies are light golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Set a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a 3-count of olive oil and gently brown the meatballs. Meanwhile, with a mortar and pestle, grind the salt, black peppercorns and fennel seeds with some olive oil into a grainy paste. Rub the ribs and shoulder with the mixture. Remove the meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. In the same pot, brown the shoulder pieces and ribs, in batches. Alternately to save time, roast the ribs in a preheated 500 degree F oven for 10 to 15 minutes while you brown the shoulder pieces in the pot. Remove the shoulder pieces and ribs to the meatball plate and let rest. Add a little more olive oil to the pot and add the thyme, oregano, carrots, onion and celery. Stir it around and scrape up the bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Cook the vegetables until they are slightly softened and have some nice color. Add the wine, tomatoes and tomato paste and mix well, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom. Nestle the pork shoulder pieces back into the middle of the pot then arrange the ribs around the sauce. Finish by placing the meatballs in the gaps (some of the pieces will be sticking out from the sauce but that&#39;s perfectly fine as it will roast and caramelize). Use a spoon to baste everything well, cover, then put the pot into the oven and roast until the pork is tender and the meat is just falling off the rib bones, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. For the topping: Combine the chopped raisins, toasted pine nuts and parsley in a small bowl. Use a slotted spoon to remove the meatballs and ribs to a large platter. Remove the pork shoulder pieces from the pot and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing into bite-size pieces and adding them to the platter. Puree the sauce in a food processor then add it back to the pot and set over medium heat. Reduce the sauce until it is rich and thick, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. When the spaghetti is cooked, drain and add to a medium bowl. Spoon a little sauce over the spaghetti and the remaining sauce over the platter of meat. Garnish the meat platter with the raisin mixture and serve. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and parsley and cook until the vegetables are soft but not colored, about 10 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and let the mixture cool. Add the bread to a medium bowl and pour in the milk. Let the bread soak while the onions are cooling. Combine the meats in a large bowl. Add the egg and cheese and season generously with salt and pepper. Use your hands to squeeze the excess milk out of the bread and add it to the bowl along with the cooled onion mixture. Gently combine all the ingredients with your hands until just mixed together. Don&#39;t overwork the mixture or the meatballs will be tough. Divide the mixture into 8 equal pieces and shape them into 8 nice looking meatballs.

Sparingly brush the prepared seasoning oil on all sides of the hanger steak, skirt steak, short ribs, pork sausage and blood sausage. Place the meat on the grill at a diagonal angle, and sprinkle the tops of all cuts with sea salt. Turn the meats only diagonally when you see a deep grill mark and the meat is sizzling. Sprinkle the other side of the meat with sea salt and cook the meat until medium rare. For the sweetbreads, cut the lobe in the middle and leave it uncut on one side so it hinges. Coat it in the seasoning oil and sea salt and grill it first on the cut side. Then close it and grill both opposite sides until golden and crisp. Cut the tomato in half and make a cross with a sharp knife in the center of the pulp. Coat with the seasoning oil, and pour a small tablespoon of the oil in the center of the core.

Combine the egg yolks, lime juice, mustard, hot pepper sauce, fish sauce, and white pepper in a large bowl. Remove the oil and vegetables from the heat. Slowly pour into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Begin by pouring with small splashes, incorporating the oil completely before adding more. The heat of the oil will cook the yolks as you go, and you should end up with a hollandaise-like sauce when all the oil has been blended. Return the bowl to the heat for 30 seconds, whisking constantly to insure that the sauce is fully incorporated. Set the sauce down over a bowl of ice and whisk to cool quickly. Refrigerate the sauce, covered, until well chilled. Pick over crabmeat to remove any shell pieces. Add the herbs and gently toss, taking care not to break up the crab. Add two or three heaping tablespoons of the chilled sauce to the crab and gently combine. Add enough of the fresh breadcrumbs to bind the crab mixture. Check to see that the mixture is moist (the breadcrumbs will absorb moisture as the crab mixture sits) and add more sauce or breadcrumbs as needed and taste for seasoning. Spread Japanese breadcrumbs on a work surface and place ring mold on top. Pat the crab into the mold and top with more Japanese breadcrumbs. Tap down to secure crumbs. Remove crab cakes from the mold and set aside. Repeat until all crab is used. Heat some of the vegetable oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Sauteing in batches, brown the crab cakes on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Reserve on an ovenproof platter. Place platter in a pre-heated 350-degree oven until heated through, about 5 minutes, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 33,&quot;Lemon-Ginger Ice in Lemon Cups 8 medium to large lemons 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 cups water 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced Crushed ice 1 lemon, zest finely grated Fresh mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: To make the lemon cups: Trim a very thin slice off of the lemon bottoms so they&#39;ll sit sturdy when standing up. Cut off the top 1/3 of the lemon and reserve to cap the cups. Carefully hollow out each lemon with a teaspoon, turning and digging into the pith so the entire inside of the fruit comes out, take care to leave the lemon shell in tact. Chop and mash the lemon pulp and strain into a blender. (You should have about 1 cup of fresh lemon juice, reserve it for the filling.) Freeze the lemon cups in egg cartons, with their lids, at least 1 hour or up to overnight. The frozen shell will prevent the lemon ice from melting too quickly when you serve it. To make the ginger syrup: Combine the sugar, water, and ginger in a pot over medium heat. Gently simmer and stir for 2 minutes until the sugar is dissolved and the ginger fragrant ? do not allow the syrup to boil or get dark. Remove from heat, cover, and steep until cool. Fill a blender with crushed ice, pour in the reserved cup of fresh lemon juice, add the ginger syrup (remove the big pieces of ginger), and process until slushy. Add the lemon zest and blend again.

(I&#39;m a huge fan of paper plates in the kitchen.) Be sure to get the skins as flat and stretched as possible. Dry for 10 minutes. Crank your waffle iron to high. When the skins are dry, move carefully to the waffle iron; depending on your model you may only get a couple of pieces in at a time. Do not allow them to overlap. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, then use a spatula or kitchen tweezers to flip and rotate the skins about 45 degrees. Continue cooking until golden brown and crisp: about 5 minutes total. Remove to a rack and season with salt and pepper. Repeat until all the skins have been converted into meat crackers, stopping halfway through to carefully pour the rendered fat (schmaltz) into a heatproof bowl. DO NOT DISCARD AS THIS IS ESSENTIALLY GOLD. To make sandwiches, brush one side of a single piece of bread liberally with schmaltz.<br> Place the bread schmaltz-side down on the waffle iron. Spread with mayonnaise then top with a layer of the skin and season with the marjoram. Spread some mayonnaise on one side of a second slice of bread and close the sandwich, mayonnaise-side down. Brush the top with schmaltz and close the waffle iron lid. Weigh the top of the waffle iron down with a cast-iron skillet or a 28-ounce can of tomatoes. After 2 minutes check for doneness. When you peek under the bread corner it should be golden brown and everything should be crisp. EVERYTHING. Repeat the process with the remaining bread and ingredients.<br> Serve as is or cut into quarters. Serve with the soup or just binge right then and there with no apologies. If so, shower afterwards. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 76,&quot;Sweet Potato and Black Bean Burritos 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes Olive oil, for drizzling<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/2 Spanish onion, finely diced<br> 1 jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped<br> 1 tablespoon chili powder<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano<br> 2 cups packed fresh baby spinach<br> One 15-ounce can black beans, drained<br> One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes<br> 1 cup crumbled queso fresco<br> Juice of 1 lime Ten 10-inch whole-wheat tortillas<br> 1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped<br> Hot sauce, as desired<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Set aside. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a large saute pan and place over medium heat. Add the garlic and onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Then, add the jalapeno and stir to combine. Add the chili powder, tomato paste and oregano. Stir to combine and cook for an additional 2 minutes to release the flavors of the herbs. Then, add the spinach, beans and tomatoes. Fold gently to combine. Simmer until the spinach is wilted and the liquid has reduced by half, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the queso fresco, lime juice and sweet potatoes. Taste and season as needed. Distribute the mixture evenly among the tortillas. Roll the tortillas, garnish with the cilantro and hot sauce and serve immediately. For freezer meal prep, wrap tightly in plastic wrap or parchment paper and store in an airtight container or bag.

In a medium nonstick pot on the stove, combine sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt with 1/2 cup cold water. Mix until the ingredients dissolve. Add apples and stir. Bring to medium-high heat and, stirring frequently, cook until apples have softened, about 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and, stirring often, cook until thick and gooey, 1 to 2 additional minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool. This is your pie filling. Prepare a large baking sheet by lining it with foil and/or spraying it with nonstick spray. Set aside. Place egg roll wrappers flat on a dry surface. Set out a small dish of water. Dip your finger into the water, and run it along all of the wrapper edges. Repeat as needed while preparing your pockets, as it will help seal them. Starting 1/2 inch from the bottom, place about 1/3 cup pie filling along the bottom half of each wrapper, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the sides. Fold the top 1/2 of each wrapper over the filling, so that the top edge meets the bottom and the filling is encased with a border on 3 sides. Dab each border with water, and fold each inward about 1/4 inch to lightly seal. Press firmly along the borders with the prongs of a fork to seal completely. Carefully transfer to the baking sheet. Repeat this process with remaining wrappers and filling, leaving you with 6 pie-lets. Spray the top of each pocket with 3 sprays butter.

Spray an 8-inch square metal baking pan with nonstick spray and line with foil. Pulse the cookies in a food processor with the butter, sugar, and salt to make a fine crust. Evenly press the crust into the prepared pan taking care to cover the bottom completely. Bake until the crust sets, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl; heat at 75 percent power until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir, and continue to microwave until completely melted, up to 2 minutes more. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water, and stir occasionally until melted and smooth.) Blend the cream cheese, 2/3 cup of the sugar, and 1/2 cup of the sour cream together in the food processor until smooth. Scrape down the sides, as needed. Add the eggs and melted chocolate then pulse until just incorporated and smooth. Pour the filling evenly over the crust and bake until the filling puffs slightly around the edges and just set in the center, about 20 minutes. Mix the remaining cup of sour cream and 2/3 cup sugar with the creme de menthe and food coloring, if using. Carefully, spoon the mixture over the top of the chocolate and gently spread into an even layer. Bake until topping becomes glossy but is still a bit loose, about 15 minutes more. (The topping will set when cooled.) Cool on a rack. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.

In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the fennel, mustard, salt and black pepper. Add the chicken and massage the bag so the chicken is thoroughly coated in the spices. Add the buttermilk and onions, and massage the bag again to mix the ingredients. Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. For the breading: Set up a breading station by lining up 3 small baking dishes or pie plates. In one dish, add the flour. In the second, whisk the eggs with 3 tablespoons water. In the third, mix together the panko, fennel, paprika, salt and black pepper. A few pieces at a time, remove the chicken from the marinade and let the excess drip off before dredging in the flour. Shake off the excess flour and then dunk the chicken in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off. Finally, dredge in the panko mixture, making sure the chicken pieces are completely coated. Place the breaded chicken on a wire rack set over a baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes.

Add the onions and saute until translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and pine nuts and saute for 2 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly. Add the rice, salt, raisins, mint and juice of 1 lemon to the bowl with the onion mixture and mix well. Set aside. Bring a medium pot of water to a simmer. Remove the grape leaves from the jar and drop them in batches of 4 or 5 into the hot water. Quickly remove them from the water and spread flat on a towel-lined work surface. Cut the stem from each grape leaf, as needed. (NOTE: Fresh grape leaves also need to be blanched for 1/2 minute.) To assemble the dolmades, place 1 grape leaf on the work surface, dull side (or underside) of the leaf up. Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of rice filling near the stem end of the leaf. Fold the stem (bottom) end up over the filling, fold the sides toward the filling in the center, then roll up the leaf into a small cylindrical package, being careful not to fold too tightly, as the rice will expand during cooking. Place the dolmades in a large Dutch oven or wide saute pan, seam side down. Combine the remaining cup of olive oil and juice of 1 lemon, and pour over the dolmades. Cover with a heavy plate or baking dish and add water to cover to the level of the plate. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for 1 hour, or until rice is tender. Serve at room temperature, with Kicked Up Tzatziki as a dipping sauce. In a medium bowl combine all the ingredients and chill for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to marry. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container. Recipe from New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch.

Thoroughly butter a 12 1/4-by-11 2/3-inch honeycomb pull-apart dessert pan, making sure to cover all the detailed nooks and crannies. Lightly dust the pan with all-purpose flour (sifting the flour over the top of the pan works best; tap out excess).<br> Beat the butter, salt and 1 3/4 cups of the sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, scraping down the sides as needed, until well combined (the butter does not need to be fluffy), about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time until incorporated (the mixture will first appear loose and broken, but will eventually come together). Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and beat into the butter mixture; reserve the pod for another use.<br> Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the almond flour until combined. Add the all-purpose flour and beat on low until combined. Add the whiskey and beat on low until combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a rubber spatula. Tap the pan firmly on the counter a few times to force batter into the edges of the pan.<br> Bake the cake until golden brown, the edges begin to pull away from the pan and a toothpick inserted in the center and edges of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Invert the cake onto a serving plate; carefully remove the pan and very lightly brush away any excess flour from the top of the cake.<br> Meanwhile, use a vegetable peeler to peel wide strips from half of the orange (about 6 strips).<br> Boil the cardamom pods in 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat until most of the water has evaporated and the mixture is very fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 1 cup of the honey and the orange peels. Let sit for 5 minutes. Strain the mixture through a mesh sieve into a small glass measuring cup; discard the solids. The mixture should be very thin and slightly warm; gently re-heat if necessary. Slowly drizzle the mixture over the warm cake, allowing the cake to soak up the honey before adding more. Let the cake cool, about 1 hour.<br> Just before serving, heat the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with 1 tablespoon water in small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves, 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup honey until combined, then remove from the heat and drizzle over the top of cake, allowing the honey to slowly drip over the sides and into each honeycomb. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 103,&quot;Honey Glazed Fried Manchego Cheese 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 egg, lightly beaten 1 cup panko bread crumbs 1/2 pound Manchego cheese, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes Canola oil, for frying Honey, for drizzling Smoked paprika, for sprinkling Instructions: Place the flour, egg, and panko bread crumbs in 3 separate dishes. Dip the cheese cubes into each ingredient to coat, starting with the flour and ending with the panko. Preheat the canola oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F, (or in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F.) If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes. Add the breaded cheese to the hot oil, in batches, and deep fry until the cubes are crisp and golden. Remove the cheese from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined baking sheet to absorb the excess oil. Transfer the cheese to a serving platter, drizzle with the honey, and dust with the paprika. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Cava]&quot; 104,&quot;Orange-Honey Glazed Carrots 3 bunches carrots, peeled 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons honey Kosher salt 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger 1 teaspoon grated orange zest 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Cut the carrots diagonally in 1-inch-thick slices. You should have about 5 cups of carrots. Place 1/2 cup water, the butter, honey, 2 teaspoons of salt, and the ginger in a large saute pan and bring to a boil. Add the carrots, cover the pan, and simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to cook for about 20 minutes, or until all the water has evaporated. You may want to raise the heat for the last 5 minutes. Add the orange zest and orange juice to the pan, tossing with the carrots. Simmer uncovered for about 5 minutes, until the carrots are al dente (tender but still resistant when you bite) and the sauce glazes the carrots. Add the pepper and another teaspoon of salt, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 105,&quot;Cheater Churros 3 quarts vegetable oil 1 1/2 cups pancake mix<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg<br> 1/2 cup fat-free milk<br> 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> Chocolate Dipping Sauce, recipe follows 1/2 cup hot fudge sauce 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon chili powder<br> Pinch kosher salt Instructions: Put the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot fitted with a deep-frying thermometer. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F. Place a cooling rack over a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Fit a large piping bag with a small star tip. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the pancake mix, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. Pour in the milk and vanilla extract. Stir vigorously to form a thick dough. Transfer the dough to the prepared piping bag and squeeze to press the dough down towards the tip. Carefully squeeze about 3 inches of dough into the hot oil. Use a pair of kitchen shears to trim the end of the churro from the piping bag. Repeat this process to create 3 more churros. Fry the churros, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Lift the churros out of the hot oil and allow any excess oil to drip off. Place the churros onto the cooling rack and continue this process until all of the dough has been fried. Place the granulated sugar into a shallow bowl. Dredge the warm churros in the sugar until evenly coated on all sides. Serve with the Chocolate Dipping Sauce. Put the fudge, cream, cinnamon, chili powder and salt in a small saucepot. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes. The sauce will thicken as it cools. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 106,&quot;Raclette 1 large wedge raclette (about 1 pound) 1 dozen cooked small new potatoes, unpeeled Assorted pickled garnishes: cornichons, pickled onions, caper berries 1/2 pound sliced Black Forest ham Sliced ripe tomatoes Instructions: Have a knife ready and small plates to serve. Arrange potatoes, pickles, onions, caper berries, ham, and tomatoes on a serving platter. Place cheese on a clean stone or a heatproof board or tile as close to the fire as possible. As the top of the cheese melts, scrape off cheese onto potatoes and accompany with garnishes. It takes some time between servings for the cheese to continue to melt, so have some wine or kirsch handy to keep guests happy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 107,&quot;\\A Star is Born\\ Cupcakes Nonstick oil spray 1 cup roasted hazelnuts 4 tablespoons dark brown sugar 16 gingersnaps<br> 1 stick salted butter, at room temperature 4 tablespoons hazlenut liqueur, such as Frangelico 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick salted butter, at room temperature 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure caramel extract 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk 1/2 cup pre-cut caramel pieces<br> 1 cup dark brown sugar 1/4 cup evaporated milk<br> 1 stick salted butter 4 sticks salted butter, cold 1 teaspoon salt 5 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup caramel sauce, at room temperature 1/2 cup heavy cream 4 teaspoons vanilla bean paste Nonstick oil spray 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt .06-ounce container edible star glitter 1/4 cup turbinado sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 2 dozen mini-cupcake pans with paper cupcake liners and spray with oil spray. For the crust: In a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, add the hazelnuts, brown sugar and gingersnaps, and pulse until a medium-fine paste. Then, add the butter and liqueur, and pulse until it&#39;s a paste that sticks when pinched with your fingers. Place 1 tablespoon of the crust into the prepared pans. For the cupcakes: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside. In the bowl of an upright mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then beat in the extracts. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the buttermilk and beginning and ending with the flour mixture; beat until combined after each addition. Fold in the caramel pieces with a rubber spatula. Using a small ice cream scoop, scoop the batter into the prepared pans three-quarters of the way full. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 11 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the pans when cool to the touch. For the butterscotch glaze: In a saucepan over low heat, combine the brown sugar, evaporated milk and butter, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and allow to slightly cool (it will thicken as it cools). Reserve for assembly. For the frosting: In the bowl of an upright mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and salt together until lightened and fluffy. Reduce the speed to low and add the confectioners&#39; sugar. Mix until thoroughly combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the caramel sauce, heavy cream and vanilla bean paste. Beat on medium-high speed until light and airy and completely mixed, about 2 minutes). Place in a pastry bag fitted with a small star tip and leave at room temperature. For the stars: Lay out a large piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet on your work surface and spray with oil spray. In a medium saucepan, mix the granulated sugar, salt and 3/4 cup water; stir over low heat until the sugar dissolves to make a syrup. Increase the heat and bring the syrup to a boil. Lower the heat slightly and swirl the pan once or twice so the syrup colors evenly to a golden blonde. Remove from the heat and transfer to a flat work surface. Dip the tines of a fork into the golden blonde colored caramel and, in sweeping motions, make a star pattern on the parchment paper. Repeat until the desired amount of stars is achieved. Allow the caramel to harden, and then gently lift off the parchment paper and reserve for cupcake adornments. To assemble: Dip the tops of the cooled cupcakes in the room temperature butterscotch glaze. Pipe the caramel buttercream frosting in a 1-inch diameter rosette on top of the glazed cupcakes, and sprinkle with edible star glitter and turbinado sugar. Then finish by adorning with a radiating star topper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 108,&quot;Mango Sorbet with Grilled Fruit Fresh mango, pureed (2 3/4 cups) 1 1/2 cups hot water 1 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice Use fresh if available - Dried are also good Port Zest from 1 lemon 1 pineapple 1 cup orange juice 1/2 cup dark brown sugar 1 bunch bananas 1 cup orange juice 2 tablespoons lime juice 4 tablespoons molasses Pinch of salt Nectarines or peaches Salt, optional Olive oil Dark brown sugar Instructions: For the sorbet: Combine water, sugar and lemon juice in saucepan over low heat.

Once the peppers have cooled, scrape away and discard the charred skin, then remove the stems and seeds. Finely dice the flesh and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the milk and panko and set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey, onion, parsley, garlic, eggs, cumin, salt, black pepper, cayenne, panko-milk mixture and diced peppers. Mix all the ingredients together. Using your hands, shape the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs, about 3 ounces each. Evenly space the meatballs on a baking sheet and place into the oven. Bake until firm and browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Place the meatballs on a large platter, garnish with cilantro and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 124,&quot;Sesame-Crusted Tuna 1/4 cup sesame seeds 1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, optional salt and freshly ground black pepper salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing the fish 1 1/2 tablespoons butter 2 pounds tuna steaks, cut in 6 equal portions, approximately 1-inch thick fleur de sel Instructions: In a dry skillet on medium heat, toast the white sesame seeds until they are just beginning to turn light golden brown and fragrant. Remove from heat and spread seeds on a plate. Add the black sesame seeds to the plate if using, and stir seeds around with fingertips to combine.<br> Brush the tuna pieces on all sides with olive oil. Season on all sides with salt and pepper, and dip tuna pieces in the seeds, pressing to coat on all sides. Set aside on a wax foil lined cookie sheet.<br> When ready to cook, heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil on medium high in the skillet. When oil is hot, add the butter, when the butter foams, add the fish to the skillet. Let cook without moving the fish for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, until the sesame crust begins to crisp and brown. When the crust is golden brown, turn the fish and cook until the other side is golden brown and crisp, about another 2 minutes, adding additional butter if needed to keep the fish from sticking and speed up the browning. Once the second side is browned, turn the fish pieces on edge with tongs, to brown the remaining sides.<br> Remove from heat and set aside. Fish will be medium rare at this point. If you prefer fish more well done, place the ban with the fish in a 375 degree F oven for another 3 to 5 minutes.<br> To serve, slice each portion in half and place on the pasta bed with the edges overlapping. Sprinkle with finishing salt, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 125,&quot;Hand Cut Fries with Celery Salt Celery salt, for sprinkling Vegetable oil 4 large russet potatoes, scrubbed, peel-on Instructions: Fill a 6-quart heavy pot or Dutch oven two-thirds of the way full with oil.

Season the cavities and the outside of each pheasant liberally with salt and pepper. Divide the chopped onion and carrot equally among the cavities of the pheasants. Squeeze the juice from both halves of the orange and set aside. Cut 1 of the squeezed halves into 3 pieces, and tuck inside of the cavities along with the veggies. Insert 1sprig of thyme into the cavity of each pheasant. Arrange the pheasants in a large roasting pan, breast sides up. Lay 2 strips of bacon over the top of each pheasant, cutting the bacon into pieces if necessary to cover as much of the pheasant as possible. Roast for 15 minutes, then remove the bacon strips and continue roasting for approximately 30 to 40 minutes, or until the juices run clear. (It is important to not overcook the pheasants, as they are very lean birds.) Remove the pheasants from the oven and transfer to a serving platter, loosely tented, while you make the sauce. Using a spoon, carefully remove as much extra fat from the pan as possible. Place the roasting pan over high heat and, when hot, deglaze with the reserved orange juice and Madeira, using a wooden spoon to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. When the orange juice and Madeira have reduced by half, add the chicken stock and continue to cook until sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 3 to 4 minutes. Swirl in the butter and remove from the heat. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Remove the back bone from each pheasant, then cut along the breast bone to divide the birds into two halves. Serve 1/2 pheasant per person, napped with some of the sauce and with some of the Wild Mushroom Bread Pudding. Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over high heat. Add the onions and cook until golden brown and tender, 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Essence, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 3/4 teaspoon of the pepper, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are tender and have given off their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add the beer and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan and until the mixture is almost dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, cream, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of Essence, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, and whisk well to combine. Add the mushroom mixture and cheeses and stir well. Add the bread cubes and let sit until the bread has absorbed the liquid, 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with the butter. Add the bread crumbs, shaking to cover the bottom evenly. Pour the bread pudding mixture into the prepared pan and cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour and uncover. Continue baking until risen and firm in the center, and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool slightly before serving.

Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar for about 2 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in the egg white, scraping the sides of the bowl as you go. Add the vanilla and beat on medium-high speed for about 1 minute. In a separate medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix the flour mixture and the milk into the egg mixture in three parts?flour-milk-flour, taking care to scrape down the sides as you go, and incorporating each addition well. Mix until smooth. Divide the batter evenly between the muffin cups using an ice-cream scoop--the batter should come about three-quarters of the way up the sides. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 16 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pans on a wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes. Then remove from the pan to the rack to cool completely. For the filling and decoration: Use a cupcake corer to hollow out the center of the cupcakes, saving the tops; then fill with a couple tablespoons of candy goo. Slice the top off of the plug you removed from the cupcake and place back in the hole to seal in the filling. Use a couple of drops of red food coloring and the smallest amount of yellow and black to color your frosting. Frost the tops of cupcakes with a thin layer of buttercream. Place the remaining buttercream into a pastry bag fitting with a medium round tip. Pipe squiggles around the top of the cupcakes, creating two hemispheres of the brain. Thin the red piping gel with a teaspoon of water and use a spoon to drizzle over top of the brain to get into crevices. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine all the ingredients. Whip the mixture on low speed for a while. When the sugar is incorporated, turn the mixer speed up and whip until the buttercream is smooth and looks right to you. If it&#39;s too cold, persuade it with a blowtorch if you have one. If it&#39;s too wet, add a bit more powdered sugar. If it&#39;s too stiff, add a bit more butter. Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl once or twice to make sure everything is combined. Use immediately, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for 24 hours or in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Rewhip cold buttercream before using it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 148,&quot;Big Chocolate Birthday Cake 4 sticks butter, plus more for greasing 8 heaping tablespoons cocoa, plus more for dusting 4 cups all-purpose flour 4 cups sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 cups boiling water 1 cup buttermilk 2 teaspoons baking soda 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 4 whole eggs, beaten 3 cups heavy cream 24 ounces semisweet chocolate, broken into pieces 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cook until the veggies begin to blacken, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and garlic, then stir gently for an additional 30 seconds. Add the chicken stock and wine, stirring to release all the flavors from the bottom of the skillet. Allow to cook for a couple minutes, then reduce the heat slightly. Add the cream, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce, then continue to cook until the sauce has started to thicken. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. Add the steak and shrimp back to the skillet along with any juices left on the plate, then stir. Add the fettuccine and toss to combine. Garnish the skillet with the scallions and parsley, then serve and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 168,&quot;Holyfield&#39;s New South Grill Cat Fish 1 (2 1/2 to 3 1/2 pounds) fresh whole catfish Salt and pepper 2 pounds rice flour 1 pound all-purpose flour 1/2 pound cornstarch 4 tablespoons five-spice powder 2 teaspoons garlic powder Salt and pepper, to taste 2 1/2 cups soy sauce 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon minced ginger 1 tablespoon cl-garlic sauce 1/3 cup lime juice 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce 2 teaspoon honey 1 teaspoon ground cl 3/4 cup pickled ginger juice or seasoned rice vinegar 1 medium carrot, peeled 1 medium beet, peeled 2 tablespoons sesame oil 1 large red tomato 1/4 cup scallions, finely sliced 1 tablespoon pickled ginger 1 tablespoon toasted white and black sesame seeds Instructions: Clean and wash the catfish, rinsing thoroughly. Using a sharp knife, partially fillet both sides of the catfish as follows: cut straight into the fillet until the bone stops the knife, then turn the knife in and cut along the bone for about 2 inches, leaving a loose flap of fillet. Make as many of these incisions as it takes to cover both sides of the fish. Season fish and set aside. Combine dredging flour ingredients on a large plate and mix thoroughly. Set aside. Combine sauce ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk together to blend. Set aside. Using a turning slicer, cut the carrot and beet into long strands. Rinse out the beet. Strain and add to carrot and drizzle with sesame oil. Peel, seed and cut tomatoes into large dice and set aside. Set fryer to 350 degrees. Dredge catfish in the flour. Shake off excess flour. Place catfish in a fryer basket, folding in the tail so that it curls away from the fish. Cook for about 12 minutes. To check doneness, lift one of the flaps cut in the fillet. If it comes clean off the bone, the fish is cooked. Allow fish to rest for a couple of minutes and transfer to a platter. Using a knife, cut through each flap and dislodge each from the carcass -- thereby finishing the filleting process. Ladle sauce over the entire fish. Sprinkle diced tomatoes and scallions. Put a dollop of pickled ginger on the nose and garnish with beet and carrot noodles as well as toasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 169,&quot;Chicken Kiev with Bacon and Asparagus 8 strips bacon 12 asparagus tips (top 2 inches only) 4 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts, tendons removed 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 eggs, beaten 2 cups bread crumbs (coarse if possible) 5 tablespoons butter Salt and pepper Instructions: In a frying pan, cook bacon until almost crispy. Steam asparagus tips for 3 minutes. Using a mallet, or other blunt instrument (the kind you keep beside your bed to ward off mad burglars), flatten chicken breasts by placing them, 1 at a time, between 2 sheets of wax paper or plastic wrap, and pound to 1/4-inch thickness. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In 3 separate bowls place: flour, eggs, beaten and bread crumbs. Line the 3 bowls in a row. Complete the following procedure for each portion: Take 1 flattened chicken breast, season with salt and pepper. Lay 2 strips of bacon side by side, on the top side of the chicken breast. Place 3 asparagus tips crosswise at 1 end and top with 1 tablespoon butter. Starting at the end with the asparagus, roll up chicken like a carpet around the bacon, butter and asparagus, and tuck in the loose ends underneath. Dip rolled chicken in the flour, then the egg, and then the bread crumbs, covering thoroughly at each step. Place in a shallow pan with the seam on the bottom. Place 1/4 tablespoon butter on top of each piece of chicken. Bake for approximately 20 minutes, or until cooked throughout. Towards the end, baste with pan drippings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 170,&quot;Apple-Almond-Coconut Quick Bread with Lemon Glaze 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) melted unsalted butter or vegetable oil, plus more melted butter for brushing the pan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook?s Note) 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 cup shredded sweetened coconut 3/4 cup chopped toasted almonds 1/2 cup plain yogurt or sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest, optional 1 cup shredded apples, excess moisture squeezed out 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon milk 1 teaspoon lemon zest plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cut the white pith off the back with a very sharp knife. Cut into julienne, and blanch three times in boiling water. Drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside. Squeeze the juice of those 2 oranges and reserve. Peel and cut the remaining 2 oranges into sections, draining their juice into the other juice, and set the sections aside. You now have one dish of blanched julienned orange zest, about 1 cup/250 ml orange juice, and a dish of orange sections. Prepare the duck breasts: Score the fat side of the breasts with a knife. Set them fat-side down in a pan over low heat and render the fat, about 10 minutes. Remove the duck and pour off the fat. Increase the heat in the pan and put the breasts back in skin-side down. Saute until done to your liking, or about 7 minutes on the fat side, then another 3 on the other. Remove to a carving board to rest, covering to keep warm. Make the sauce: Put the sugar and 1 tablespoon water in a saucepan, bring to a boil and cook until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the vinegar and orange juice. Reduce slightly.

(Or prepare a grill for high heat.) Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the tomatoes, onions, jalapeno and garlic on the parchment. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes, then remove the onions and garlic and set aside; peel the garlic. Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast the jalapeno and tomatoes until charred and soft, about 15 minutes more. (Or, if making on the grill, place the vegetables on a perforated pan or aluminum foil on the hot grill. Cook, covered and turning when necessary, until all the vegetables are evenly charred and soft. The tomatoes and jalapeno will take longer than the garlic and onions, so remove everything as it finishes cooking.) Transfer all the vegetables to a blender and add the cilantro, chipotles with adobo sauce and salt. Blend on medium speed until a uniform puree has formed. With the motor running, slowly add the oil until emulsified and completely incorporated. If the consistency of the salsa is too thick, add some water 1 tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency is achieved. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more chipotle if desired. Let cool before using, or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until needed. The salsa will keep for up to 1 week. For the skirt steak: Season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Toss with some of the roasted tomato salsa and marinate, refrigerated, for at least 1 1/2 hours and up to overnight. Reserve the remaining salsa for serving. For the grilled romaine: To clean the romaine, place the halves in a large bowl (or several bowls) filled with cold water. Swoosh the lettuce gently in the water and let it sit for 10 minutes--the dirt and grime will settle to the bottom of the bowl. Gently lift the lettuce out of the water and rinse the bowl. Repeat the cleaning process until the water remains clean after you&#39;ve swished the leaves around in it. Gently pat the lettuce dry around and between the leaves to remove as much moisture as possible. Rinse and dry the bowl, and place the lettuce back in it. Season the lettuce with the olive oil and some salt and pepper, and gently toss to combine. Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade and let any excess marinade drip off. Grill 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium rare. Let rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Place the romaine halves on the grill cut-side down and grill until well marked, about 2 minutes. Rotate the romaine 45 degrees and grill until well marked again, 2 minutes more. (If doing this on a grill pan, you may need to work in batches.) Transfer the romaine halves to a cutting board and chop them into 2-inch pieces. Place the romaine in a large bowl and toss with the lemon juice. Slice the steaks thin and serve with the reserved roasted tomato salsa and grilled romaine. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 179,&quot;Corned Beef with Cabbage and Beets 3-4 pound piece corned beef 2 bay leaves 1 tablespoon caraway seeds 5 black peppercorns 3 parsnips, peeled and cut into 3 \\ pieces 5 carrots, peeled and cut into 3\\ pieces 3 turnips, peeled and quartered 2 onions quartered 4 potatoes, peeled and quartered 1/2 head cabbage, cut into wedges 4 beets, boiled until tender, peeled and sliced Instructions: In large heavy pot, combine corned beef, bay leaves, caraway seeds and peppercorns.

Instructions: Start by making the roux. In a heavy bottomed pan, preferably a cast-iron skillet, melt the bacon fat and stir in the flour. It&#39;s important to keep stirring this until it turns a deep dark brown. Usually about 30 minutes. Also remember once it is brown to remove it from the burner and it will continue to cook as the pan is still really hot. For the gumbo: Melt the butter in a large pot. Add the celery, onions and green and red bell peppers. Let simmer for 5 minutes. Cut the hot links in 1/4-inch half-moons and add to the pot. Add the water, clam base, chili powder, thyme, oregano, garlic, paprika, cayenne, chicken base, hot sauce and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and turn down to a simmer. Let simmer for 30 minutes. Take 1 cup of the liquid and stir it into the still hot roux; it will expand to double the size. Add this to the gumbo and stir it in well bring it back to a boil. Once it has thickened, turn off the heat and stir in the okra and gumbo file. (At this point you have a nice base that you can add your choice of proteins to, anything from crawfish, shrimp, crab, chicken or a combination.)

It has a refreshing, slightly sour taste since it contains oxalic acid. Sorrel is related to rhubarb (which also contains oxalic acid), and can be used as a vegetable (salads, purees) or as an herb (soups and sauces). It is available throughout the summer. Granite is coarse, crystalline ice, made without egg whites or milk products. It is made without an ice cream maker. Since granite has a low sugar content, compared to ice cream, it freezes quickly. History of ice cream: Before the freezer, Italians used to send runners to the mountains to get snow. They would flavor the snow with honey or fruit to make iced desserts. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]</p><p>&quot; 187,&quot;Veggie Top Pesto 1/4 cup chopped walnuts 1 clove garlic<br> 1 cup carrot fronds<br> 1/2 cup beet greens<br> 1/2 cup celery leaves<br> 1/3 cup grated Parmesan<br> 2/3 cup olive oil<br> 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: In a food processor, combine the nuts and garlic and pulse until coarsely chopped.

Add a generous pinch of salt and cook for 15 minutes, or until tender. Potatoes cook quickly. Test often for tenderness and don&#39;t overcook them. Alternatively, cook the potatoes in a pressure cooker for 5 minutes, releasing the pressure immediately to prevent overcooking. Drain the potatoes and arrange them in a 6- by 9- by 2-inch casserole dish. In a large skillet, add a little oil to coat the pan. Combine the beef and onion and cook together over medium heat until the beef is browned and the onion softened, about 10 minutes. Drain excess fat. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan and whisk in the flour to make a roux. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and the flour turns light brown in color. Gradually whisk in the milk and continue to stir while cooking over medium heat. When the mixture thickens, season with salt and pepper, then stir in the cheese and browned beef and onions. Pour the ground beef mixture over the potatoes and bake the casserole for 20 minutes, until heated through and bubbling. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top of the casserole and bake until the crumbs are toasted, about 5 minutes longer. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 194,&quot;Glazed Salmon Miso Soup Rice Bowl 3 tablespoons soy sauce 2 teaspoons brown sugar 1 teaspoon lemon juice 8 ounces skin-on salmon fillet (preferably wild-caught) 3 coins ginger, smashed 2 scallions, green tops thinly sliced and white bottoms halved 1/3 cup yellow miso 8 shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps sliced 2 heads baby bok choy, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 4 cups cooked rice, hot 6 sheets roasted seaweed snack, cut into thin strips with shears Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish Sambal or other hot chili sauce, for serving, optional Instructions: Preheat a broiler with a rack set 4 inches from the heating element.

Pat the chicken breasts dry with a paper towel. Coat a medium saute pan with olive oil, and place over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, sprinkle the skin of the chicken generously with salt, and then place skin-side down into the pan. Cook until the skin is golden and crispy, 4 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle the opposite side of the breast with salt, and then flip the chicken and continue cooking until cooked through, another 5 to 6 minutes. If the pan starts to smoke, lower the heat. Transfer the breast to a sheet pan, tent loosely with foil and place in the oven until the sauce is finished and you are ready to plate. Remove the excess oil from the pan before returning over medium-high heat. Add the clementine juice, clementine supremes and vinegar, scraping up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan. Stir in the thyme and chiles and let the liquid reduce by half before pouring in the chicken stock and a pinch salt. Continue cooking until the stock has reduced. Taste the sauce, making sure it&#39;s delicious, and then remove the thyme stalk and season with more salt, if needed. The sauce should be thickened and a little chunky. Lay the Yukon Gold and Cauliflower puree on the bottom of the plate, and then slice the chicken breast and fan the slices on top. Spoon some of the sauce on and around the chicken, and garnish with the supreme clementines. Halve the potatoes, and then cut each half into 6 to 8 pieces. Place the potatoes in a pot large enough to hold the cauliflower as well, and then cover the potatoes by 2 inches of water. Sprinkle generously with salt (it should taste like the ocean) and bring to a boil. After the water has been boiling about 10 minutes, add the cauliflower and cook until the vegetables are fork-tender. Bring the cream to a scald in a small saucepan. Meanwhile, pass the potatoes and cauliflower through a food mill into a large bowl. Add about half of the hot cream and 1/2 of the butter, and stir with purpose until thoroughly combined. Repeat this process with the remaining cream and butter until incorporated. Taste for seasoning (you will probably have to add salt), and serve warm.

Cover with paper towels and a tea kettle that is full and heavy. Let stand for about 1 hour until moisture is released. This first step is very important to remove any bitterness. Batter the eggplant by dipping first in beaten eggs, then in bread crumbs seasoned with salt, pepper, oregano, parsley, and garlic powder. (If you need to use store bought seasoned bread crumbs omit salt and pepper.) In a deep sided fry pan heat the olive oil to 350 degrees F. Add a little butter (for flavor) and fry the eggplant in batches until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and set aside. Make the vinaigrette of red wine vinegar, olive oil, chopped peppadews, sugar, oregano and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Chop the mint and Italian parsley. Spoon 2 tablespoons vinaigrette in the bottom of a large bowl. Layer eggplant slices with the chopped mint, parsley, and the vinaigrette. Top with more of the vinaigrette and marinate, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. (Cook&#39;s note: you can also add to the layers more minced garlic and shredded Parmesan.) Boil the lasagna noodles with a little oil, so that they do not stick, and some salt, to impart some flavor. In a beautiful serving dish layer the marinated eggplant, the noodles, then sprinkle with some fresh mozzarella, then the basil and finally drizzle with the vinaigrette. Repeat until all the layers are formed, making sure that the noodle is not the last layer. Garnish with cherry tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve at room temperature for the best summer lasagna.

Place the almonds and pecans on a baking sheet; toast on the upper oven rack until lightly browned and fragrant, about 8 minutes. Let cool, then pulse in a food processor with 1/4 cup granulated sugar until finely ground. (Don&#39;t overprocess or the mixture will turn into a paste.) Turn off the oven. Whisk the flour, cinnamon, cardamom and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside. Using a mixer, beat the butter and the remaining 11/4 cups granulated sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla extract, egg yolks, and the lemon and orange zest; add the ground nuts. Add the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated (do not overmix). Divide the dough into 2 pieces; place 1 piece between 2 lightly floured sheets of parchment paper and roll into a 14-inch square, about 1/4-inch thick. Repeat with the other piece of dough. Refrigerate both rectangles, covered with the parchment sheets, until firm, at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350. Cut the dough into hearts with a 21/4- to 21/2-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter. Using a smaller heart-shaped cutter (about 11/2 inches), cut out the centers from half of the cookies (you can reroll the centers and scraps). Place the cookies, about 1 inch apart, on baking sheets and bake 2 sheets at a time until the edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through. Cool on wire racks. Sift confectioners&#39; sugar over the cookies.

Place tamarind fruit in a small saucepan with enough water to cover by an inch. Cook over medium low heat, covered, until soft, about 30 minutes. Drain, reserving the cooking water. Mash and then push through a strainer, discarding the seeds and strings. Reserve the pulp, which should measure about 1/2 cup, and add to that 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking liquid. (Or, if using tamarind paste, combine pulp and water in a small saucepan, bring to the simmer, and push through a sieve to remove seeds. Reserve resultant puree, which should measure about 1 cup.) In a small dry skillet, toast sesame and cumin seeds over medium low heat until fragrant and lightly colored, about 2 minutes. Place in small bowl and add celery seeds, cracked black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir to combine and set aside. Drop shallots and garlic through top of blender with the motor running. Add spice and whirl to pulverize slightly. Add tamarind, honey, Worcestershire, and oil and blend thoroughly. Rub marinade evenly on turkey leg and let marinate in refrigerator 3 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove turkey leg from refrigerator and season evenly on all side with salt. Place on rack set inside roasting pan. Pour 1/4-inch of water into the bottom of roasting pan. Cover roasting pan with foil and roast for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to cook 2050 minutes, until fork inserted in meat slips out easily or instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part of joint measures 165 degrees F. Remove leg from oven, let cool and shred meat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 241,&quot;Fried Calamari with Spicy Anchovy Mayonnaise 1 egg, at room temperature* 4 to 5 anchovy fillets 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley leaves 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 3/4 cup light olive oil or vegetable oil 1 pound fresh, clean calamari 4 cups light olive oil or vegetable oil 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup graham cracker crumbs 1 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: In a food processor, combine the egg, anchovies, lemon juice, parsley, and cayenne. Blend until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the oil to make a mayonnaise. Transfer the sauce to a bowl and refrigerate, covered tightly, for up to 2 days, until ready to serve. Cut the calamari into 1/4-inch rings. If the tentacles are large, halve or quarter them lengthwise. Refrigerate until ready to use. Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed, straight-sided 3-quart saucepan, about 8 inches in diameter. To prevent the oil from bubbling over when frying the calamari, the pan should be no more than 1/3 full. Heat the oil to 360 degrees F on a deep fat thermometer. (to check the temperature without a thermometer , drop a small piece of bread the size of a crouton into the oil. It should float to the surface immediately and brown lightly in about 45 seconds.) Combine the flour and graham cracker crumbs in a bowl. Divide the calamari into 2 or 3 batches for easier frying. Toss each batch in the flour mixture to coat evenly. Shake the calamari in a mesh strainer to shed excess coating. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, gently lower each batch of calamari into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. The cooked calamari can be kept warm in a low oven while you continue. Check your oil temperature (360 degrees F) and repeat with the remaining calamari. Serve hot with the chilled anchovy mayonnaise. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 242,&quot;Pork Loin with Ketchup and Onion Marmalade 1 (2 1/2 to 3-pound) pork loin Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon garlic powder 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 1 large red onion, sliced 1/4 cup ketchup Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. For the pork: Rinse pork loin to remove residue and pat dry with paper towels. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Heat grapeseed oil over medium-high heat in an oven safe pan, preferably with a lid. Sear pork loin on all sides, leaving each side undisturbed for the first few minutes before turning, to allow the seasonings to integrate into the surface of the meat. Cover the pan and transfer to the oven. Roast, covered, until fork tender, about 1 1/2 hours, or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove cover and increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F for about 10 minutes to allow outside of roast to brown. Remove from oven and allow to rest and carryover cook to 170 degrees F. Slice. For the marmalade: While the pork is in the oven, make the marmalade. Heat grapeseed oil over medium heat in a small skillet. Add onion and reduce heat to low. Allow to slowly caramelize, about 30 to 40 minutes. Stir in ketchup and salt and pepper, to taste, and allow to cook for another 10 minutes to reduce and thicken. Add additional oil before serving if the marmalade looks too pasty.

Add the shortening and work it into the flour. Add the milk, extract, eggs and cinnamon oil in a separate bowl. Mix well. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and work with your hands until combined. The dough will be sticky to the touch. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Dust your hands with flour and roll a 5-inch rope-like log out of the dough. Make the dough log into a knot. Place the dough knot onto a cookie sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Bake until firm to the touch, about 6 minutes. For the glaze: Combine the powdered sugar and milk and use to glaze the lemon knots. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 251,&quot;Whole-Wheat Cinnamon-Raisin Bread 2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 2 cups whole-wheat flour 1/4 cup nonfat dry milk 1 large egg 2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for brushing 3 tablespoons honey 2 teaspoons salt 1 1/2 teaspoons instant dry yeast Nonstick cooking spray 2/3 cup raisins 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar Instructions: Make the dough. Measure out 1 1/4 cups very warm water and check the temperature; it should be 120 degrees F to 130 degrees F. Combine both flours, the dry milk, egg, canola oil, honey, salt, yeast and warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix 3 minutes on the lowest setting, then increase to the next highest setting and mix 5 more minutes. The dough should be soft and sticky. Let it rise. Transfer the dough to a large bowl coated with cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the dough has nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Soak the raisins. Dry raisins will rob moisture from the bread, so soak them first in boiling water until plump, about 30 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Fold the dough. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Picture it as a loose square. Lift up one side of the dough and fold about one-third of it across; press down on the dough with spread fingers to remove any air bubbles. Repeat with the remaining 3 sides of the dough. Add the filling. Mist two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray. Divide the dough in half; roll out each half into an 8-inch square. Brush each square with canola oil, then sprinkle with the cinnamon (it&#39;s high in antioxidants!), brown sugar and raisins. Form the loaves. Roll up each square of dough into a tight cylinder; place seam-side down in the prepared pans. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the dough fills the pans and springs back when touched, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Bake the bread. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush the loaves with canola oil and bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the pans and transfer to a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 252,&quot;Cherry Pecan Spread on Corn Muffins 1 (6.5-ounce) package cornbread and muffin mix (recommended: Betty Crocker) 1 egg 1/3 cup milk 2 tablespoons butter, melted 1/2 cup frozen whole corn kernels, thawed 1 (8-ounce) container strawberry cream cheese (recommended: Philadelphia) 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese 1/4 cup chopped dried cherries 1/4 cup chopped pecans, toasted 2 teaspoons lemon zest Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

With a sharp knife, score each chestnut 1/4-inch deep all around. Arrange them in one layer in a baking pan and roast for 20 minutes, or until shells have just opened. Peel off both layers of skin with a knife while the nuts are still hot. In a large saucepan of boiling, salted water, cook the Brussels sprouts for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and refresh with cold water. Then thinly slice the cooled Brussels sprouts. In a large skillet set over moderately high heat, melt the butter, add the shallots and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add the chestnuts, Brussels sprouts, herbs, and salt and pepper, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes, or until heated through. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 254,&quot;Mike Mills&#39; Beef Ribs Four 2 1/4- to 2 1/2-pound racks center cut beef ribs Magic Dust dry rub, recipe follows Apple City Barbecue Sauce, recipe follows 4 cups apple juice in a spray bottle 1/2 cup paprika 1/4 cup kosher salt, finely ground 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup powdered mustard 1/4 cup chili powder 1/4 cup ground cumin 2 tablespoons ground black pepper 1/4 cup granulated garlic 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper 1 cup ketchup 2/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar 1/2 cup apple juice or cider 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 1/4 cup soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 1/3 cup bacon bits, ground in a spice grinder 1/3 cup peeled and grated apple 1/3 cup grated onion 2 teaspoons grated green bell pepper Instructions: Prepping the meat: There is a skin-like membrane on the back of the ribs. The easiest way to remove it is to start in the middle of the rack and work a table knife or a screwdriver underneath the skin, going all the way across and teasing it up. Slide your forefinger in there and bring your thumb across, holding the rib down and pulling the membrane straight up. It&#39;ll peel from the middle. Once you start cooking the ribs, you can&#39;t leave the pit or grill unattended for any more than about 20 minutes. You&#39;ll need to continually check that the temperature remains between 250 and 275 degrees F at all times in the grill. If it gets too hot, shut the top and bottom drafts to smother the fire. If some of the coals appear to be glowing red, that will cause a hot spot. Don&#39;t cook the ribs directly over the hot spot, move them to a different, cooler, part of the grill. If the temperature dips too low, move the ribs to a hot spot for a while and add some hot coals. Sprinkle ribs liberally with Magic Dust, coating both sides. Put them in a shallow pan or on a cookie sheet and cover them with clear plastic wrap or a lid. Refrigerate them until you&#39;re ready to use them. I recommend letting them marinate for at least 1 hour. At the restaurant we dust the ribs up to a day in advance. Place ribs on grill and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. About 10 minutes before you remove the ribs from the grill, mop them with sauce. When you take them off the grill, mop again with sauce and sprinkle some more Magic Dust on them. Serve immediately. Serves 4 very hungry people or you can cut the rack in half to serve 6 to 8 people who have a regular appetite. Mix all ingredients and store in a tightly covered container. You&#39;ll want to keep some in a shaker next to the smoker, grill, or stove. Keeps indefinitely but won&#39;t last long. Combine the ketchup, rice vinegar, apple juice or cider, cider vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic powder, white pepper, cayenne, and bacon bits in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the apple, onion, and bell pepper. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, 10 to 15 minutes or until it thickens slightly. Stir it often. Allow to cool, then pour into sterilized glass bottles. A clean glass jar that used to contain mayonnaise or juice works real well. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 255,&quot;Eggberts Sunriser 2 to 3 cups canola oil, for frying 6 cups frozen hash browns<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 18 to 20 frozen mini potato wedges<br> 4 tablespoons butter<br> 2 cups diced ham<br> 1 jalapeno, seeded and diced, optional 1 medium onion, diced<br> 1 green bell pepper, diced<br> 1 red bell pepper, diced<br> 2 cups grated sharp Cheddar 8 eggs<br> Store-bought salsa, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Pour 3 tablespoons of the oil in a skillet and heat to medium. Add the hash browns and leave them undisturbed for a few minutes. Make sure the skillet&#39;s not too hot. Ideally you&#39;ll turn them only once and then cook them on the other side--you want them crispy and golden. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.<br> In another skillet, add about an inch of oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F. Fry the potato wedges until golden brown and crisp. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. (You can also bake these in the oven if you prefer.) Drain the hash browns and potato wedges on a paper towel and keep warm. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet until melted. Throw in the ham, jalapenos if using, onions and bell peppers and toss them around for several seconds. Turn off the heat and set the pan aside. In 8 individual skillets (or 1 very large one) layer: the hash browns, the veggie/ ham mixture and then the grated cheese. Bake for a minute or 2, until the cheese is melted. Remove from the oven with an oven mitt, as the skillets will be hot. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a nonstick skillet and fry the first 4 eggs, then remove and set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and fry the remaining 4 eggs. Place the potato wedges over the top of the melted cheese, then top with 1 egg per skillet.

For the bottom layer: In a large pan on medium-high heat, add the oil, sausage and chorizo. Using a wooden spatula or, even better, a wired and wavy potato masher, break up the chorizo and sausage until they are homogenous and resemble ground beef in its tiniest form. Once broken down, continue to cook until the sausage is cooked through and orange fat is rendered from the chorizo, 10 to 12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon to drain off excess fat, transfer the mixture to an 8-by-8-inch casserole dish. For the middle layer: In the same pan with the remaining fat from the meat, quickly add and saute the onions and peppers with a pinch of salt and pepper until tender and the moisture from being frozen is cooked out, 5 to 8 minutes. As before, use a slotted spoon to transfer the pepper/onion mixture to the casserole dish, draining off excess fat, and evenly spread this mixture over the top of the meat layer. Next, evenly layer the mozzarella cheese over the vegetables. Then use the American cheese slices to create another layer, pressing down once done to make everything level and compact. For the top layer: In a large bowl, add the hash browns, butter, steak rub and remaining fat from the pan. Season generously with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Sprinkle this layer on top of the cheese and gently press down, but not too tight so steam can escape. Bake, uncovered, until the top is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Leave the chicken at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts of cold water to a boil over medium-high heat in a 7-quart Dutch oven. Add 2 tablespoons salt, the ginger and whole scallion. Slowly lower the chicken into the boiling water with the breast side up. Bring the water back up to a gentle boil. Carefully lift the chicken out using the handles of 2 wooden spoons or 2 pairs of chopsticks positioned under the wings; be careful not to tear the skin (do not use tongs as they can easily tear the skin). Lift the chicken just high enough and tilt it so all the water drains from the cavity into the pot; this allows cold water in the cavity to drain and ensures even cooking. Lower the chicken back into the water. Bring the water back to a gentle simmer and reduce the heat to low. Cook, covered, until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced between the leg and thigh, 33 to 35 minutes. Right before the chicken is done, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Transfer the chicken to ice water breast-side down; reserve the liquid the chicken poached in. Let the chicken cool for about 10 minutes, flipping it once after about 5 minutes. (The ice bath prevents the chicken from overcooking, but also helps to firm the meat and tighten the skin.)\\u202f Remove the chicken, letting the excess water drain off.<br> Whisk together 2 cups of the reserved poaching liquid, the wine, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until the sugar dissolves. Set aside to cool to room temperature.<br> Carve the chicken with a meat cleaver or chef&#39;s knife: Start by detaching both leg quarters (leg and thigh together) from the body. Chop the leg quarters through the bone into roughly 3/4-inch pieces. Cut off the wings and drumettes. Split the wing flat lengthwise to expose the meat. Cut the breast bone down the center to separate the two breast halves. Cut each half through the bone into 3/4-inch pieces. Lay the chicken pieces in a 2-quart casserole dish in a single layer.<br> Sprinkle the goji berries if using around the chicken. Pour the wine mixture over the chicken making sure it\\u2019s submerged; add a little more poaching liquid if it\\u2019s not.

Shape the beef into 4 patties, each about 5-inches in diameter. Sprinkle the outside of the patties generously with salt and pepper and set aside. Lay the bacon in a large nonstick skillet and cook over medium heat, until brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Pour off and reserve all but about 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings and increase the heat to medium-high. Add the burgers to the skillet, and cook until well browned on the outside and medium-rare on the inside, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer the cooked burgers to a rimmed baking sheet and top each with a slice of cheese. Brush the insides of the buns with the melted butter and put on a second baking sheet buttered side-up. Bake until the cheese melts, about 3 minutes and the buns are lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, wipe out the skillet. Heat 1 tablespoon of the reserved bacon drippings over medium-high heat. Break the eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Put a burger patty on each of the bottom buns and top each with 2 slices of bacon and a fried egg. Spread the top bun with some of the spicy ketchup and put on top of the burger. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 291,&quot;Portuguese-Style Pan-Fried Hake 2 medium ripe tomatoes (12 ounces) 3 tablespoons olive oil, preferably Portuguese 2 bay leaves 3 whole allspice berries, cracked and finely chopped 3 or 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 medium green bell pepper (about 6 ounces), thinly sliced 1 medium onion (about 6 ounces), thinly sliced 1/4 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup small black Portuguese or nicoise olives, pitted and rinsed Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup olive oil, preferably Portuguese 1 1/2 to 2-pounds hake fillets, trimmed, deboned and skinned; cut into 4 (6 to 8-ounce) portions Kosher or sea salt freshly ground black pepper 2 cups cornmeal Instructions: Fill the saucepan halfway with water and bring it to boil over high heat. Score an x at the base of each tomato with a small paring knife. Lower the tomatoes into the boiling water until the skin splits, about 30 seconds. Plunge them into ice water after blanching to stop the cooking. Peel skins from the tomatoes, and cut them in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds, cut the tomatoes into a 1/3-inch slivers (julienne) and set them aside. There will be about 1 1/2 cups. You should start the sauce about 15 minutes before you want to serve the fish, so start heating up the larger skillet (for the fish) on a medium heat at the same time you begin the sauce. Place the smaller skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil (3 tablespoons) and the bay leaves. Cook the bay leaves until they are lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the allspice and garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Add the bell pepper and onion and saute, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are golden, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, white wine and olives. Simmer until the sauce is fragrant and has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat. Just before you add the tomatoes to the sauce, add the olive oil (1/4 cup) to the preheated large skillet. Quickly season all the fillets with salt and pepper on both sides. Spread the cornmeal into a shallow bowl and dredge the fish portions in the cornmeal, 1 at a time, pressing to make the cornmeal adhere and then gently shaking off the excess. Work quickly and put each fillet into hot oil as you prepare them. As soon as the cornmeal appears to darken, turn the heat down a bit. The key is to have them cooking evenly so that when you turn the fillet, it should be a perfect golden brown. It will take about 3 to 4 minutes per side. The thicker the fish, the slower you should cook it. Turn the fillets, and cook for another 3 or 4 minutes until crisp and golden brown. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the fish to individual plates or to a platter. Divide the sauce by draping a small amount of the chunky sauce over the fish and spooning the remaining sauce around it. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Barolo, Chianti, Pinot Noir]&quot; 292,&quot;Phyllo Onion and Dill Purses 1 package phyllo dough 2 large onions, sliced, 1 1/2 cups 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 tablespoon ground toasted coriander seed 1/4 cup freshly chopped dill Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large saute pan heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions to the pan, season with salt and pepper and saute gently over medium heat until the onions have caramelized to a rich golden brown, about 20 minutes. At the end of the cooking time add the fresh dill and pour the onions out onto a cookie sheet and allow to cool completely before proceeding on to the purses. On a clean and dry workspace lay out 1 sheet of phyllo and brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of phyllo on top of the first, brush with oil and repeat two more times. Using a pastry wheel, cut off the corners of the dough to achieve a sort of rounded shape. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of the onion mixture into the center of the dough. Gather up the edge of the dough, pull towards the center to from the folds of the purse, and pinch the dough to seal the purse closed. Brush the outside of the purse with olive oil and repeat this purse making until the onions are all used. Place the finished purses on a cookie sheet and bake for 20 minutes until crisp and brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 293,&quot;Carved Baked Ham 1 (10-pound) bone-in shank-half ham (not pre-cooked) 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 3 tablespoons honey 3 tablespoons brown sugar Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Season the ribs with salt and pepper. Dust with the flour. Heat the oil in a large braising pan or ovenproof casserole over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until most of the fat is rendered, then remove and set aside. Add as many ribs as can fit in a single layer to the pan. You will need to cook them in batches. Sear the ribs on both sides until well browned, then remove from the pan and set aside. Repeat with the remaining ribs. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan. Lower the heat to medium, add the carrots and onions, season with salt and pepper, and saute until the vegetables begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and tomato and paste and cook for 4 more minutes, scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the red wine and brandy and reduce by 1/2, about 6 minutes. Return the ribs and bacon to the pot. Add the remaining ingredients except the apricots and parsley and bring to a boil. The liquid should come 1/3 of the way up the ribs, if it does not, add some water. As soon as the liquid comes to a boil, turn off the heat an cover the ribs tightly with foil, pressing the foil down into the pan, then place a lid on the pan. Braise the ribs in the oven for 2 hours, turning them every 30 minutes so they cook evenly. Add water as necessary to keep the braising juice 1/3 of the way up the ribs. After 2 hours, add the apricots and cook for an additional 30 minutes. The meat should be almost falling off the bones (if it is not, keep cooking until it does). Transfer the short ribs to a large platter. Spoon the vegetables, olives, and apricots over them. Keep warm. Strain the braising juices into a clear glass container and siphon or skim off the fat. The braising juices may already be the consistency of a sauce. If not, return them to the pan and boil for a few minutes to thicken. If you prefer an absolutely smooth sauce, strain out any remaining pieces of vegetable. Taste, season with salt and pepper, and add the parsley. Pour the sauce over the ribs and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 297,&quot;Grilled Chicken with Spinach and Pine Nut Pesto 2 boneless chicken breasts 2 cups lightly packed baby spinach leaves (about 2 ounces) 1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 to 2 teaspoons grated lemon peel 1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Heat a grill pan on medium high heat.

Sprinkle with peppercorns, thyme, parsley, the small onion, and celery leaves. Pour in the stock. Add 1 cup heavy cream and milk. Cover pan with aluminum foil and place pan in a 350 degree F oven for 15 minutes or until the fish is barely heated through, turning opaque. Remove from oven. Let cool. Flake the fish into big pieces, making sure there are no bones or whole peppercorns lurking in crevices. Blanch 6 (1 pound) culls in boiling salted water for 5 to 6 minutes. Refresh in cold water to stop cooking. Take meat from the shells leaving big chunks. In a 3-quart stainless saucepan, place 4 of the lobster bodies over medium heat with 2 tablespoons butter. Saute until barely colored, then add 2 cups heavy cream and simmer slowly until reduced by 1/3. Use any of the smoked haddock scraps, bones, etc., when reducing the cream. This will give additional flavor to the soup. The lobster cream should have a lobster-smoked haddock flavor. Add the stock cream from poaching the smoked haddock. Strain, you should have approximately 3 to 3 1/2 cups soup base. To finish soup, saute 1 medium size onion in 4 tablespoons of butter. Add 4 red bliss potatoes cut into chunks leaving skins on. Pour over the soup base and simmer until the potatoes are \\just done, not overcooked and mushy. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. In saute pan over medium heat, saute lobster meat, in big chunks in 2 to 3 tablespoons of butter. Add to the soup with the finnan haddie, taste for any additional salt and pepper. Adjust the amount of liquid by adding milk or cream. Bring just to a boil, heating the fish and lobster through. Ladle into hot soup bowls. Place a little slice of whole butter to melt on top and plenty of finely chopped parsley for garnish. Serve with toasted and buttered split Vermont common Crackers.

Ribs: Preheat gas grill on low for 1/2 hour. If using charcoal, let the coals burn to embers, also about 1/2 hour after lighting. Cut the rib racks in half horizontally along the bone. Season the ribs with a 1/2 of the spice rub mix. In a large roasting pan, add chicken stock, beer, and the bay leaves. Lower the ribs into the liquid. Bring up to a simmer and poach the ribs for 15 minutes. Take the ribs out of the liquid and season them with the other 1/2 of the spice rub on both sides. While re-spicing the ribs, bring the liquid up to a boil over low heat to reduce. Take the ribs outside to the grill. The coals should be at the ember stage. Gas grills stay on low. Place ribs on the grill and cover to smoke for 2 hours. While ribs are cooking, the sauce can be finished. Add the olive oil to a large, preheated saute pan. Add the poblanos and onions, and saute for 5 or 6 minutes, until caramelized. Add the garlic, carrots, and jalapenos and saute another 3 minutes. Add the Roma tomatoes and let it simmer 20 minutes. Add the molasses, honey, and chipotle with adobo sauce. Add the orange, then salt and pepper. When the initial braising liquid has reduced by half, add this to the sauce mixture.

Put the dough onto the oiled baking sheet and stretch and pat evenly into the pan, making sure that it reaches the edges. Use your fingertips to make dimples all over the dough. Brush with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt. Arrange the tomato slices on the pizza in a single layer, making sure that each bite will have a piece of tomato. Sprinkle the tomatoes lightly with salt. Place the baking sheet with the dough directly on top of the preheated baking sheet in the oven (this helps with a crispy crust). Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheets and sprinkle the Parmesan over the dough. Continue to bake until the dough is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.<br> For the Caesar salad: Meanwhile, whisk together the honey, anchovies, garlic, lemon zest and juice and egg yolk in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil, then season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.<br> Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a large platter or cutting board. Toss the romaine with the dressing. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Top the pizza with the salad. Use a vegetable peeler to shave ribbons of Parmesan over the salad. Drizzle with olive oil, cut into pieces and serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 381,&quot;Melting Snowman Cake 5 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 1 cup vegetable oil 5 cups granulated sugar 12 large eggs 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 2 teaspoons mint extract 2 tablespoons red liquid food color Flour-based baking spray, for the pans 2 to 2 1/2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 4 cups powdered sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/3 cup half-and-half 1 square orange-flavored fruit chew 5 mini semisweet chocolate chips 1 semisweet chocolate chip 1 pretzel stick 2 chocolate sprinkles 1 red licorice lace 12 ounces white candy melting wafers 1 mini (fun-size) peanut-caramel-nougat candy bar 1 round vanilla wafer cookie 4 ounces dark chocolate Instructions: For the cakes: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter, oil, granulated sugar and eggs together until well combined. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture alternately with the milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture. Add the vanilla extract and mix briefly to combine. Line a cupcake pan with 7 paper liners. Fill the cupcake liners 2/3 full with batter. Remove 2 2/3 cups batter from the bowl and place it in a separate bowl. Stir in the mint extract and red food color. Spray a 4-cup bundt pan and a 10-cup bundt pan with flour-based baking spray. Alternate layers of vanilla batter and mint (red) batter in each bundt pan until the pans are about 3/4 full. Use a butter knife to gently swirl the two batter colors together. Bake the cupcakes for 15 to 20 minutes, the 4-cup bundt for 30 to 35 minutes and the 10-cup bundt for 50 minutes to 1 hour or until a toothpick tester comes out clean. When the cakes are done, turn them out onto wire racks to cool completely. When the cupcakes are cool, crumble them into a large bowl and add 2 ounces of cream cheese. Mix together using a rubber spatula or knead together with your hands. Squeeze a small handful of the mixture in your hand. It should hold together. If it doesn&#39;t and the mixture is crumbly, knead in the remaining 1/2 ounce cream cheese. Form three roughly ball-shaped pieces from the mixture that are small, medium and large as the segments of a snowman. Flatten the bottom of the largest ball so that it appears to pool and slump to one side. Add the medium ball on top and flatten slightly. Add the smallest ball on top and dowel the three pieces together with a toothpick. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 to 20 minutes. For the glaze and decors: Combine the powdered sugar and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in the half-and-half a little at a time until a thick white glaze forms. Place the largest bundt cake on a cake stand or serving platter with a lip. Cover the top of the bundt cake with half of the glaze. Top the glazed bunt cake with the second smaller bundt cake. Top the second cake with the remaining glaze. You may not have to use the entire batch of glaze. Cut a small piece away from the orange fruit chew using a knife and mold it into a triangular carrot shape. Break away the point of a toothpick and insert the non-pointed end into the flat side of the carrot shape. Have this ready on hand along with the chocolate chips, pretzel stick, chocolate sprinkles and licorice lace. Melt the white candy melting wafers in the microwave at 100 percent power at 30-second intervals until the candy can be stirred smooth and is pourable. Place the chilled modeled snowman shape on the center of the top bundt cake. Spoon the white melted candy onto the snowman shape and allow the excess to run down the sides of the cakes. Quickly add two mini chocolate chips (flat side out) for the snowman&#39;s eyes. Add the two chocolate sprinkles just over the eyes for eyebrows. Press the nose into the face just under the eyes and add the larger chocolate chip (flat side out) for an o-shaped mouth. Break the pretzel stick in half and add to each side of the body, with one arm sticking upright and the other onto the lower part of the body as if it has melted off. Add the three remaining mini chocolate chips for buttons down the front of the snowman body. Add a licorice lace scarf around the neck. Cut the fun-size candy bar in half and have ready on hand with the vanilla cookie. Heat the dark chocolate in the microwave at 100 percent power at 30-second intervals until melted and smooth. Dip the cut end of a candy bar half into the chocolate and press it on the center of the cookie, creating a hat shape. Refrigerate until set, about 5 minutes. Dip the entire cookie hat in the chocolate and remove with a fork. Place it on parchment paper and refrigerate until set, about 5 minutes. Dab a small amount of melted chocolate onto the bottom flat part of the cookie hat and hold to the snowman&#39;s head until set, about 2 minutes. Display as an edible centerpiece at your next holiday gathering. Cut the cake into slices to serve, revealing the red peppermint swirled interior. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 382,&quot;Homemade Pita Chips 3 pitas, cut into 8 wedges 4 tablespoons olive oil 1 clove garlic, smashed Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat heat oven to 375 degrees F.

Using wet hands, roll little balls of sausage meat about the size of large marbles and set aside. Heat a large frying pan and add a good splash of olive oil. Gently fry the sausage balls until golden brown all over, then add the pancetta and continue cooking for a couple of minutes, until it&#39;s golden. While this is cooking, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the linguine, and cook according to the packet instructions. In a large bowl, whip up the egg yolks, cream, half the Parmesan, the lemon zest and parsley. When the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water, and immediately toss it quickly with the egg mixture back in the pasta pan. Add the hot sausage meatballs and toss everything together. The egg will cook delicately from the heat of the linguine, just enough for it to thicken and not scramble. The sauce should be smooth and silky. If the pasta becomes a little claggy, add a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water to loosen it slightly. Sprinkle over the rest of the Parmesan, season, if necessary, with the salt and pepper, and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Eat immediately! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 384,&quot;Baked Orange Chicken and Brown Rice 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 cup brown basmati rice Zest and juice of 2 navel oranges Kosher salt Four 6-ounce boneless, skinless chicken thighs Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Spray both large and small cake pans with nonstick cooking spray, coat with flour, and knock out the excess. For the cake: Combine the cake mix with the pumpkin puree, oil and eggs. Using a hand mixer, beat on medium until well incorporated, about 3 minutes. Using an ice cream scoop, fill 6 of the the mini pumpkin pans 2/3 of the way to the top. Fill the unused cups with water so the pan doesn&#39;t burn. Pour the remaining batter into the large pan, 2/3 of the way up the sides. Bake the small pans until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes. Continue to bake the large cake until browned and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean as well, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and, once cool enough to handle, invert onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Slice the tops off of each cake so that it is flat. Spread about 1/4 cup of the frosting on the cut side of the large cake. Place the other cake half on top of the icing to form a large pumpkin. The icing will act as glue and hold the 2 halves together. Repeat the process with the smaller cakes using 1 tablespoon of frosting per cake set. For the fondant: In a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat together the confectioners&#39; sugar and pumpkin puree. Slowly add water by the tablespoonful until a very thick but pourable consistency is reached. Color the fondant orange with a few drops each of red and yellow food coloring. Put the icing in a resealable zip top bag. Place the cakes on a wire cooling rack fitted in a sheet pan. Snip the corner the zip top bag and start to squeeze fondant over top of cakes, allowing to drip down the sides. Let the fondant dry before inserting the stems. For the stems: Wrap the cork with the green raffia. Insert a toothpick half way into the cork. Insert into the top of the large pumpkin. Cut the soldering wire into 6 (6-inch) pieces and fold each piece into thirds to form one thick piece about 2 inches long. Wrap with raffia and insert into the top of each small pumpkin cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 401,&quot;Crispy Oven Fries with Feta-Red Pepper Dip 3 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more to taste 2 pounds russet potatoes, cut into wedges<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> One 8-ounce jar roasted red bell peppers (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 ounces feta, coarsely chopped<br> 3/4 cup toasted walnuts or almonds<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> 2 teaspoons lemon juice<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 1 clove garlic<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the fries: Dissolve the salt in a large bowl of cold water and add 1 cup of ice cubes.

If you wish to test the oil, add a 1-inch cube of bread to hot oil. If it turns deep golden brown in color in a count of 40, the oil is ready. While the oil is heating make the batter. In a wide mixing bowl combine 2 cups of the pancake mix, 1 1/4 cups water and about 6 teaspoons hot sauce. (Use a regular teaspoon you would stir coffee with ? that&#39;s what I did. I don&#39;t, technically, have a set of actual measuring spoons.) Place the remaining plain 1/2 cup pancake mix in another wide mixing bowl. Arrange the batter and the bowl of plain pancake mix near the cook top and the heating oil. Line a plate with a few sheets of paper towels and keep within reach. Once the oil is heated and ready, toss the chicken pieces in 2 teaspoons of hot sauce then toss in the plain pancake mix, coat evenly and shake off excess. The plain dry pancake mix will help the batter stick to the chicken pieces. Add some of chicken to the batter, you are going to want to work in 3 to 4 batches coating and frying. Using a fork, toss the bites in the batter. Remove the first batch from the batter, shaking off the excess batter as you carefully add them to the hot oil. Fry for 2 minutes on the first side, or until the first side is a deep golden brown, flip and continue to fry for another 2 minutes or until deep golden brown all over. Remove from the oil and drain on the paper towel lined plate, season with salt. Repeat until all the popcorn chicken bites are fried. Serve immediately with refrigerated, good quality creamy blue cheese prepared dressing with chopped scallions and black pepper stirred into it for dipping.

Turn onto a lightly floured board and knead briefly; dough should be soft and pliable but not too sticky. Rest, covered, while you make the filling and the sauce. Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix until thoroughly combined. To check for seasoning, fry a bit in some hot oil until just cooked through. Adjust the seasoning as necessary. For the sauce: Combine all but the last 2 ingredients in a bowl for dipping. Sprinkle the basil and habanero over the top. To Assemble and Cook: Flour your work surface lightly and roll the dough, or pieces of it, about 1/8-inch thick (too thin and the dough will tear as you fill the dumplings). Cut out circles with a 3-inch round cutter. Cover the dough with a side towel or piece of plastic wrap as you work. Have a small bowl of water next to you. Place a scant tablespoon of filling in the middle of a dough circle, and press it so that it spreads slightly toward the side edges of the dough. Using your fingertip or a small pastry brush, wet the edge of the dough. Fold the dough up around the filling so that the filling sits on the work surface-that&#39;s the bottom of your dumpling-and the seam is between your fingers. Pleat the dough that is facing you, about 6 times, pressing it against the back to seal-only the front of the dumpling should be pleated. The corners of the dumpling should curl slightly away from you, toward the unpleated side. Heat a skillet, just large enough to accommodate the number of dumplings you want to cook over high heat. Add a thin coating of oil, heat, then add the dumplings in concentric circles. They should be touching. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes (reduce the heat if they are browning too quickly). Add enough water to come about 1/4 of the way up the sides of the dumplings-it will spatter. Cover the skillet, adjust the heat so that the water is simmering, and cook for about 7 minutes. Uncover the skillet and, if there is water left, let it cook off. Check the dumpling bottoms-if they need to brown a bit more, let them, adding a bit more oil if necessary. Serve the dumplings immediately, drizzled with some dipping sauce and garnished with cilantro and lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 411,&quot;Cream of Celery Soup 6 slices bacon, quartered 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 cups chopped celery hearts 3 cups chopped peeled celery root 1 shallot, chopped 2 teaspoons fresh thyme 1/2 teaspoon celery seeds Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3/4 cup half-and-half 2 cups fresh parsley 2 tablespoons fresh tarragon 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice Instructions: Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Pour 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings into a large pot over medium heat; add the butter. When the butter is melted, add the celery, celery root and shallot.

Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add as many of the chicken thighs, skin side down, as will fit without touching. Cook until the skin is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Flip the chicken pieces and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 5 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and spoon off all but about 2 tablespoons of the fat, leaving all the lovely brown bits behind. Return the pan to low heat, stir in the garlic and thyme and cook until the garlic starts to turn golden, about 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the sherry, increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil. Let it boil a minute or 2, then return the chicken to the pan skin side up. Reduce the heat to low, pour in the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan tightly and cook 20 minutes. Flip the chicken pieces (or rotate them top to bottom if using a smaller pan) and cook until the chicken is very tender, about 20 minutes. Serve hot. Note: If you like a mix of white and dark meat, substitute a 4-pound chicken cut into 10 pieces. Let the thighs, drumsticks, and wings cook in the sauce for 15 minutes before adding the browned breast pieces. If you&#39;d like to use all white meat, cut the breasts in half crosswise, brown them as described above, but let the sauce cook down 10 to 15 minutes before adding the chicken breasts. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 450,&quot;Lobster Club with Saffron Mayonnaise, Crispy Serrano Ham and Watercress on Chipotle Brioche 1 envelope active dry yeast 2 tablespoons sugar 1 1/4 cups warm whole milk 8 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 large eggs 7 large egg yolks 1/4 cup chipotle in adobo puree 3 sticks room unsalted butter, cut into pieces and slightly softened, plus more to rub on top of the loaves 1/4 cup pure olive oil 8 slices thinly sliced Serrano ham 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1 large pinch saffron 1 tablespoon honey 1 cup prepared mayonnaise 2 cloves garlic, mashed to a paste 1/2 cup finely diced celery 1/4 cup finely diced red onion Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds fresh lobster meat, chopped 2 green onions, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon Watercress Bread Unsalted butter Chipotle Brioche, recipe above Instructions: For the chipotle brioche: Combine the yeast, sugar and milk in a small bowl and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour and salt. Mixing on low speed, add the yeast mixture and mix until combine. Mix together the eggs, egg yolks, chipotle puree in a bowl and slowly add the mixture to the flour while continuing to mix on low speed. Mix in the butter, piece by piece until combined and continue mixing until the dough is silky and springy, about 10 minutes. Remove the dough to a lightly floured surface and lightly knead for 30 seconds. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. Lightly punch down, cover and allow to rise for 30 minutes longer. Butter a 12 by 4-inch or 5 by 4-inch loaf pan.

Put the tomatoes, onion and lemon on a baking sheet. Brush with 1 tablespoon of oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Lightly oil the grill grates. Arrange the tomatoes and onion on the grill. Put the lemon halves cut-sides down on the grill. Cook until charred in spots, rotating the tomatoes and onion slices as needed to ensure even cooking, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the grilled vegetables and lemon to the same baking sheet that they were on before. Allow to cool 5 minutes. Leave the grill on high heat. Combine the tomatoes and onions in a blender along with the juice of half of the grilled lemon, Worcestershire sauce, honey, horseradish, hot sauce and 1 tablespoon oil. Blend until smooth; the sauce should be the texture of tomato puree. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Pour into a small serving bowl and reserve. Toss the shrimp with the remaining tablespoon oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Grill until lightly charred in spots on both sides and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes total. Transfer the shrimp to a large platter and serve with the reserved grilled tomato cocktail sauce. Cut the remaining grilled lemon into wedges and serve on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 453,&quot;Mussels 2 pounds mussels, scrubbed and debearded 4 cloves garlic, smashed and roughly chopped 1 Roma tomato, roughly chopped 1/2 small onion, chopped 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro leaves 1-ounce white wine 2 tablespoons butter Freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: Place mussels on a large piece of tin foil. Sprinkle garlic, tomato, onions, cilantro. Add a dash of wine, butter and some pepper. Wrap up the edges to keep in the juices and place on the grill. Cook until mussels open. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 454,&quot;Chickpea and Leek Soup 12 ounces (340 grams) chickpeas, soaked overnight, refrigerated 1 medium potato, peeled 5 to 6 medium leeks, finely sliced 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 cloves garlic, finely sliced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pints (850 milliliters) chicken or vegetable stock 2 handfuls Parmesan, grated Extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Rinse the soaked chickpeas, cover with water, and cook with the potato until tender. Remove the outer skin of the leeks, slice lengthways from the root up, wash carefully and slice finely. Warm a thick-bottomed pan, and add the tablespoon of oil and the knob of butter. Add the leeks and garlic to the pan, and sweat gently with a good pinch of salt until tender and sweet. Add the drained chickpeas and potato and cook for 1 minute. Add about 2/3 of the stock and simmer for 15 minutes. Puree half of the soup in a food processor, and leave the other half chunky. This gives a lovely smooth comforting feel but also keeps a bit of texture. Now, add enough of the remaining stock to achieve the consistency you like. Check for seasoning, and add Parmesan, to taste, to round off the flavors. This is classy enough for a starter, but I like it best for lunch in a big bowl with a good drizzle of my best peppery extra-virgin olive oil, a grinding of black pepper and an extra sprinkling of Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</li></ol><p>&quot; 455,&quot;Berry Scones with Orange Honey Butter 1 quart heavy cream Zest of 1 orange 1/2 cup honey Pinch salt 2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar, plus more for sprinkling scones 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 stick cold unsalted butter, cubed 1 1/2 cups fresh mixed berries (e.g. blueberries, raspberries, blackberries), washed and dried 3/4 cup buttermilk, (leftover from orange butter), plus more to brush scones Instructions: You can do this the old fashioned way and add ingredients to a mason jar, cover with the lid and shake vigorously for 10 minutes, or you can use the food processor. In a food processor bowl add all the ingredients and turn on high. The liquid will slosh, whip and then separate after about 4 minutes. When the mixture separates, (these are the butter solids and buttermilk), stop processing and strain out the buttermilk - there will be just under a cup. Reserve the buttermilk to make the scones. Strain out the butter and squeeze dry. Work the butter a couple of times to bring it together to form a nice ball. Refrigerate butter until ready to use. For the scones: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a food processor bowl add flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add cold butter cubes and pulse until you have the texture of coarse bread crumbs. Transfer to a large mixing bowl, then add 3/4 cup of buttermilk and stir to combine. As it comes together add berries and fold dough to incorporate berries but not break them up too much. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto a parchment lined sheet pan. Using a pastry brush, paint the tops of each scone lightly with buttermilk and sprinkle with sugar. Bake until golden brown, and nice and puffy, about 17 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm with the Orange Honey Butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 456,&quot;Crab Cake Mac N Cheese Salt 1 pound cavatappi or elbow pasta with lines on conchiglie (small fat tube/shell shaped pasta with lines) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 6 tablespoons butter 3 ribs celery with leafy tops, finely chopped 1 medium onion, finely chopped 1/2 small red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped 3 to 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 bay leaf About 2 tablespoons freshly chopped thyme leaves, several sprigs About 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest Freshly ground black pepper 3/4 pound fresh lump crabmeat, picked for shells and flaked 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 1/2 cups milk Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/3 pound, about 1 rounded cup grated sharp white Cheddar 1/3 pound, about 1 rounded cup shredded Gruyere or Swiss cheese 3 tablespoons hot sauce (recommended: Frank&#39;s Red Hot) 1 cup panko bread crumbs A generous handful flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, a couple of handfuls Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium heat, then salt the water. Add the pasta and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, (it will be undercooked). Cool, drain well and add it to a large bowl. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, and 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium to medium-high heat. Add the celery, onion, red pepper, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, lemon zest, salt and pepper, to taste. Cook to tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the crabmeat to the vegetables and season liberally with seafood seasoning. Stir to combine, then remove from heat. In a medium sauce pot, over low heat, melt 3 tablespoons butter and whisk in the flour. Cook for 1 minute, then whisk in the milk and bring to a bubble. Season the sauce with salt, pepper and nutmeg, to taste, and cook for a few minutes, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon. Add the mustard and the cheese and stir in a figure 8 motion. Add the vegetables and crab, sauce to the bowl with the pasta and transfer the mixture to individual baking crocks or a large casserole dish. This can be made ahead to this point and refrigerated. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To complete the dish, melt a couple of tablespoons butter in a small skillet, over low heat and add 3 tablespoons hot sauce. Warm through, then add the panko crumbs and toss to evenly coat the crumbs in sauce mixture. Cool the crumbs, then toss in the parsley and 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano -Reggiano cheese. Top the mac n cheese with the spicy crumb mixture. Arrange individual crocks on a baking sheet or put the casserole on baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake until brown and heated through, about 10 minutes. If cooking from cold, the mac n cheese will take 40 to 45 minutes, but add the crumbs the last 10 minutes of baking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 457,&quot;Grilled Buffalo Chicken Cobb Salad 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pound chicken cutlets Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into pieces (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/2 cup hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s RedHot (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup buttermilk 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 head iceberg lettuce, cored and chopped into bite-sized pieces 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved 1 cup blue cheese crumbles 4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled 2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced into thin rounds 2 center celery stalks and leaves, sliced thin on a bias 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped 1 avocado, chopped 1 cup corn chips, such as Fritos Instructions: For the chicken: Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.

Cut in the shortening and 1/4 cup butter pats until pea-size bits remain. Add the milk and gently stir until combined. The dough will be wet. Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface and gently pat into a 9-inch round that is 1-inch thick. Cut the dough into 2-inch rounds using a cookie cutter. Transfer the rounds to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet that has been lightly coated with cooking spray. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Remove the towel and cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Cook&#39;s Note: The longer the biscuits stay in the freezer, the lighter and fluffier they become. You can make ahead and just bake off a few as you need them. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the heavy cream and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the tops with the melted butter.

For the meatballs: Place the tofu in a piece of cheesecloth or a kitchen towel and wring dry, squeezing to remove as much water as possible. (This also breaks up the tofu into small crumbles.) Crush any remaining large pieces of tofu by rubbing them between your fingers. It should all be finely crumbled and there should not be any big chunks left.<br> Combine the crumbled tofu, beef, pork, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, scallion and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until the ingredients are well incorporated and the mixture comes together.<br> Scoop the meat mixture into 18 to 20 meatballs (about 1 1/2 tablespoons each; see Cook&#39;s Note), placing them on a large baking sheet or plate. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten into a 1/2-inch-thick patty, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.<br> Add the flour to a large rimmed plate and whisk the eggs in a medium bowl. Heat a large nonstick skillet with 3 tablespoons of the oil over medium-low heat.<br> Dredge each patty in the flour, coating well on all sides. Smooth out any rough, uneven edges and shape the patty neatly. Working with one at a time, shake off excess flour, then dip and roll the patty around in the egg, making sure to coat thoroughly with no flour peeping through. (All the patties can be dredged and sitting in flour, but be sure to dip the patties in the egg one at a time.) Gently place the egg-coated patty in the heated skillet -- most of the egg will drip off to the bottom, creating a desirable \\u201cskirt\\u201d that will be served on top. (Do not move the patties around as the top needs to be clean and free of brown bits.)

Partially freeze the meat and fatback to facilitate grinding, about 1 hour. While your meat is freezing, toast the fennel seeds, anise seeds, and peppercorns in a dry pan on the stovetop until fragrant, and grind them in a spice grinder. Mix the ground fennel seeds, anise seeds and peppercorns with the sage, thyme, salt, paprika, cayenne, garlic and citrus zests in a large bowl. When the meat and fatback are almost frozen, remove them from the freezer, and mix them with the other ingredients. Grind everything together through a medium-size die. Add a couple ice cubes at the end of the grinding to push out the last bit of meat in your grinder. Mix the meat vigorously in a stand mixer for a few minutes until the whole batch is very sticky. Pump the mixture into the sausage casings, and twist to create links of your preferred size (8 inches is ideal). &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 469,&quot;Spicy Coconut Curried Lobster on a bed of Jasmine Rice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 Scotch bonnet peppers, minced 1 red pepper, julienned 1 red onion, sliced thinly lengthwise 1 teaspoon curry paste 2 cups fish stock 2 cans coconut milk 3 lobsters, boiled, meat removed and chopped 1/4 cup milk 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 can pineapple chunks, juice drained 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons sugar 4 scallions, chopped 1 cup cilantro leaves, chopped, plus extra for garnish 1 cup flaked coconut, toasted Jasmine Rice, recipe follows Water 2 cups jasmine rice 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon sugar Toasted coconut, to taste Instructions: In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.

Homemade pastry is short and so will be quite crumbly. Don&#39;t be alarmed by this, you can patch it together in the pan. Take a small ball of the pastry (the size of a nickel) and use it to gently ease the dough down into the pan. Press the handle of a wooden spoon against the pastry all round the edges to coax it into the fluted grooves. Trim off the excess around the top and run a thin knife around between the pastry and the edge of the pan to loosen. Put in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes, or until firm.<br> Remove the tart from the refrigerator. Take a piece of parchment paper slightly larger than the pan and scrunch it up, then unscrunch it and line the pan with it. Fill it with pie weights or dried beans and \\blind bake\\ in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry feels sandy to the touch. Remove the paper and bake for an additional 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.<br> For the filling, put the cream in a bowl and whip until beginning to thicken, then fold it into the cream cheese and mix with the honey and Marsala, if using. Put the filling in the tart case, then arrange the figs on top and scatter over the nuts and mint. Serve with a sweet wine such as Asti.<br> Figs and mint are delicious, so sprinkling some torn mint leaves over the tart works really well.

Add the onion, the garlic, the ginger root and the jalapeno. Saute for 2 minutes, stirring. Add the split peas, the coriander, the cumin, the celery seed, the cinnamon and the clove. Mix well. Add the chicken stock, stir again, and bring to a boil. Turn heat down to low and simmer slowly, partially covered, for about one hour, or until split peas are just soft. You may need to add more chicken stock if peas become too thick and dry. While soup is cooking, prepare the relish: Toss all six ingredients together in a bowl. Season to taste. With a wooden spoon, crush a few of the soft peas in the soup against the side of the pot. Stir well. If the soup is too thick, add a little chicken stock. Season to taste. Ladle the hot soup into four wide soup bowls. Mix in most of the tomato relish, saving about 1/4 cup. Place three shrimp in the center of each bowl. Divide the remaining tomato relish among the four bowls, placing it in the center of the shrimp. Top that with a few fresh cilantro leaves.

Add the butter and olive oil to the pot. Once the butter has melted completely, add the onions, thyme, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and several grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until the onions start to sizzle and the mixture is thoroughly combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 4 minutes. After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete (this should take about 2 minutes). Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid, then stir in the balsamic vinegar. At this point, the onions should be tender and blonde in color.<br> Set the pot back to high saute and cook, stirring frequently and scraping any brown bits from the bottom and sides of the pot, until almost all the liquid has evaporated and the onions are a deep golden brown and saucy, about 30 minutes. Be sure to stir the onions frequently and watch them closely; you want to scrape the brown bits from the pot before they turn too dark and burn.

Coat a wide, deep pan with the olive oil and put over medium-high heat. Add the pureed veggies and season with salt; cook until all the liquid has evaporated and the veggies begin to stick to the pan-you want to brown the crap out of these guys until crud starts to form on the bottom of the pan. Stir occasionally to scrape up the browned bits, then let the crud form again. Be patient here and don&#39;t rush it: This is where the big flavor develops; it will take up to 30 minutes. When the lovely brown crud has formed and been scraped down a couple of times, stir in the tomato paste. Let it start to brown a little, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes. There&#39;s not much liquid at this point to keep things from burning, so move fast: Add the wine, stir to combine and scrape up any remaining browned bits. Cook until about half of the wine has evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. (This is where another round of big flavor is formed, so take your time.) Add enough water to cover the meat by about 1/2 inch. Stir to combine well, then add the bay leaves and thyme bundle. Taste, season with salt and taste again; it&#39;s by no means done, but it should taste good. Bring the sauce to a boil (BTB) and reduce to a simmer (RTS). Continue cooking for 3 hours, tasting, seasoning and adding more water as needed. Discard the bay leaves and thyme. Meanwhile, make the pickled onions: Combine the vinegar, 1/2 cup cold water, the sugar, 1 tablespoon salt and the hot sauce in a bowl. Add the sliced onion and let sit, at least 1 hour. Drain. Assemble the nachos: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread a layer of tortilla chips on an ovenproof platter. Top with a layer of the ragu and cover with the parmigiano and fontina cheeses. Bake until the cheeses melt, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the chopped chipotle, adobo sauce and mascarpone in a bowl. Sprinkle the arugula over the nachos and finish with dollops of the chipotle mascarpone and the pickled onions. A gooey cheesy treat.

Now pour the liaison (egg mixture) into the milk pot, stirring constantly. You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook. The idea is to avoid making scrambled eggs! Continue cooking on medium heat until the mixture begins to thicken so it will coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In a large skillet, saute the apples and bananas in the butter and add cinnamon and lime juice and stir to coat. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and allow to cook until apples are tender and caramel colored, about 20 to 25 minutes and let cool. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F For the crumb topping, using a wooden spoon, mix oatmeal, flour, sugar and butter until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Combine the now cooled apples with the cream, pour into the pie shell and top with oatmeal mixture. Bake until crust is completely baked and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Heat maple syrup as an accompaniment, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 491,&quot;Zucchini with Parmesan 8 medium zucchini Good olive oil 2 large yellow onions cut in half and sliced 1/2 inch thick Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Remove the ends of the zucchini and, if they are large, cut in half lengthwise. Slice the zucchini diagonally in 1/2-inch slices. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large (12-inch) saute pan and add the onions. Cook for 10 minutes on medium-low heat, until they start to brown. Add half the zucchini, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to the pan and cook, tossing occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, until just cooked through. Sprinkle with Parmesan and cook for 30 seconds more. Remove to a serving platter and repeat with the rest of the zucchini. Serve immediately. Note: If you cook too much zucchini in one pan, you end up steaming rather than sauteing it. I prefer to cook it in 2 batches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 492,&quot;Shepherds Pie with Scallion-Cheese Crust 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 pound minced British lamb 1 pound minced beef 2 medium onions, peeled and chopped 3 carrots, peeled and chopped very small 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms 1 level tablespoon tomato puree 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 level tablespoon all-purpose flour 1 cup red wine 1 1/2 cups fresh beef stock Salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes 2 tablespoons butter Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup scallions, cleaned and chopped 1 cup mature Cheddar, coarsely grated Instructions: Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven or deep saute pan. Brown the lamb and beef. Remove the meat from the pan with a slotted spoon. Add the onions to the pan and saute until the onions are tinged brown at the edges - about 5 minutes. Add the chopped carrots and cook for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, tomato puree, thyme, parsley and cinnamon. Stir and saute for 2 minutes. Next, stir in the flour, which will soak up the juice, then stir in the wine and the beef stock. Taste and add salt and pepper, as needed. Return the meat to the pan and bring to a boil. Cover, turn down the heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes until the lamb is fully cooked. Peel the potatoes, cut them into large even-sized pieces and place into a pot of cold, salted water. Bring the water to a boil and cook potatoes until they are tender, about 10 minutes. (Potatoes are done when a knife can easily go through.) When the potatoes are done, drain off the water, return them to the saucepan, cover with a clean tea cloth to absorb the steam and leave them for about 5 minutes. Next, add the butter and mash them to a puree. Season with salt and pepper. When the meat is ready, spoon it into a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and level it out with the back of the spoon. After that, spread the mashed potato evenly all over. Sprinkle the scallions on top of the potato, scatter the cheese over the scallions and bake the pie until the top is crusty and golden, about 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 493,&quot;Broccoli Soup 1 tablespoon butter 6 garlic cloves, sliced 4 shallots, sliced 1 leek, white part only, sliced 1 sprig thyme 1 small onion, sliced 2 heads broccoli, stems sliced, and green tips reserved for puree 8 cups chicken stock 1 bay leaf Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a medium-size saucepan, over medium heat, add the garlic, shallots, leeks, onion and thyme.

Add to beef and cucumbers and toss to coat. Arrange romaine leaves on a serving platter and spoon beef salad on top. Sprinkle green onions over the salad and serve room temperature or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 495,&quot;Polish Pierogies 1 pint sour cream 5 cups flour 2 tablespoons melted butter 2 whole eggs 1 egg yolk 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons olive oil 1/2 pound ground beef Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 pound soft farmers cheese 2 tablespoons minced shallots 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1/2 cup green onions, chopped 1 whole egg 4 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves 1/2 cup sour cream Instructions: For the dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the sour cream, flour, butter, 2 whole eggs, egg yolk, 2 teaspoons salt and olive oil. Knead the mixture into a soft dough. Divide the dough in half and cover for 10 minutes. On a floured surface, roll each half of the dough into a thin circle, 1/4-inch thick. Cut the dough using a 3-inch circle cutter. For the filling: Season the beef with salt and pepper. In a saute pan, render the ground beef for 3 minutes. Remove from the pan and drain on a paper-lined plate. In a mixing bowl, combine the cheese, ground beef, shallots, garlic, green onion and egg. Mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of each circle of dough and fold over. Press and seal into half-moon shapes. Use a little water to seal the pierogi&#39;s. In a pot of boiling, salted water, cook the pierogi for 8 minutes, or until they float. Remove from the water and drain. In a saute pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Sear the pierogi for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown. Remove from the pan. The pierogi will need to be sauteed in batches. Arrange the pierogi&#39;s on a platter. Garnish with parsley and serve with sour cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 496,&quot;Crispy Fish with Semolina Polenta, Broccolini and a Cilantro-Citrus Salad Semolina Polenta: 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup chicken broth 1/3 cup semolina flour<br> 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Broccolini: 24 pieces broccolini (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> Cilantro-Citrus Salad: 1 cup mandarin orange segments plus 2 tablespoons juice 1/2 cup lemon juice<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano<br> 1 cup grapeseed oil<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 12 thin slices red onion 1 bunch cilantro, leaves picked<br> Crispy Fish: Canola or vegetable oil, for frying 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups rice flour<br> 2 cups semolina flour<br> 1 quart whole milk<br> 12 large eggs<br> Six 8-ounce flounder filets Instructions: For the semolina polenta: Combine the heavy cream and chicken broth in a small pot and bring to a boil. Slowly whisk in the semolina, bring the polenta back up to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium. Simmer the polenta, stirring regularly, until thickened, about 20 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. For the broccolini: Bring 1 gallon water and 2 tablespoons salt to a rolling boil in a large pot. Set up an ice bath for shocking the broccolini after blanching. Blanch the broccolini in batches until crisp-tender, 45 to 60 seconds, and then immediately transfer to the ice bath. Remove the broccolini from the ice bath and dry with a towel. Heat a saute pan over high heat, add the grapeseed oil and saute the broccolini until lightly charred, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and then squeeze the lemon juice over the top. For the cilantro-citrus salad: Add the orange juice, lemon juice, basil and oregano to a blender. Start blending and slowly add the grapeseed and olive oils until emulsified. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Combine the orange segments, red onion and cilantro in a bowl. Add one quarter of the salad dressing and toss to coat. Reserve the remaining salad dressing. For the crispy fish: Fill a deep fryer with canola oil and heat to 350 degrees F.

Remove the foil and turn the ribs bone-side up. Preheat the broiler to high. Brush the bone side of the ribs with half of the remaining sauce, and broil until lightly charred in spots, about 5 minutes. Turn the ribs over, brush with the remaining sauce and broil again until charred stops on top, another 5 minutes. Cut the racks in half and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 498,&quot;Cauliflower-Stuffed Meatball Ragout in Spicy Tomato Sauce (Tunisian Mubattan Bruklu) 6 cups olive oil or vegetable oil, for frying 1 medium-sized head cauliflower (about 1 pound) 1 1/2 pounds ground beef, lamb, or veal 1 small onion, finely chopped 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 1/2 teaspoons tabil (a Tunisian spice blend of coriander seed, caraway seed, garlic powder, cayenne pepper) 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 large eggs beaten All-purpose unbleached flour, as needed, for dredging Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 cup water 1 1/2 teaspoons harisa (Tunisian hot chili paste of guajillo chili peppers, garlic, oil, caraway, and coriander) 1/2 teaspoon ground red chili Instructions: Preheat frying oil in a deep-fryer or 8-inch deep saucepan to 375 degrees F. Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil and cook the whole cauliflower until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well and break into small florets. Place the meat, onion, cinnamon, parsley, tabil, salt, and pepper in a food processor, in batches if necessary, and process until well blended. Remove to a bowl. Have a bowl of water handy to keep your hands wet while making meatballs. Meatballs are formed by flattening a lemon-sized portion of meat into a thin patty and wrapping the patty around a cauliflower floret to completely enclose. Form into an oval shape, then dip into the eggs and dredge in flour, tapping off any excess flour. Cook the meatballs in oil until golden, about 4 minutes, without crowding the fryer. Remove with a slotted spoon to paper toweling to drain. Heat the extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. Dissolve the tomato paste in the water, and add to the pan along with harisa and ground red chili. Add the meatballs and cook covered until most of the liquid evaporates, about 25 minutes.

Put your eggs in cold water in a medium saucepan, place on the stove, and bring to a boil. Turn the stove off, cover the saucepan with a lid, and after 15 minutes run them under cold water. Peel the shells from the eggs (reserve 2 whole eggs for Round 2 Recipe Nicoise Salad with Lemon Garlic Vinaigrette) and chop. In another bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, paprika, dill, and salt and pepper. Add the chopped eggs and gently toss.<br> For the ham salad: In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, pickle relish, onion, salt, pepper, and parsley. Add the celery and half the ham (reserve remaining half for Online Round 2 Recipe Ham and Cheese Breakfast Burrito) and toss to coat. Set aside. For the sandwiches: Cut off the crusts from the wheat and white bread. On a clean surface, place 1 slice white bread down and top with half the egg salad.

Repeat, alternating the white and wheat bread as the beginning slice, until you have made 4 sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 520,&quot;Miso Noodles with Seared Ahi Tuna 1/2 cup white miso paste 3 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons mirin 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar 1 teaspoon sesame oil Kosher salt 10 ounces sugar snap peas, julienned into matchsticks 12 ounces buckwheat soba noodles 2 medium organic carrots, peeled and julienned into matchsticks 2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for brushing 1 tablespoon sweet soy sauce 2 teaspoons yuzu 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 3 pounds good-quality ahi (or yellowfin) tuna, sushi-grade if possible 1/4 cup black sesame seeds 1/4 cup white sesame seeds 4 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias, for garnish Special equipment: 8 bamboo skewers soaked in water for 10 to 15 minutes Instructions: For the noodles and dressing: Begin by making the dressing. In a large bowl, combine the miso, soy sauce, 1/4 cup hot water, mirin, canola oil, rice vinegar and sesame oil. Whisk together well and set aside. In a large pot of salted boiling water, blanch the sugar snap peas until bright green and just tender, 10 to 15 seconds. Set aside. Add the soba noodles to the hot water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Then strain and rinse under cold running water (this will stop the cooking process and gives the soba noodles their distinctive springy texture). Toss the noodles in the dressing and fold in the sugar snap peas and julienned carrot. Set aside until ready to serve. For the seared ahi tuna: In a large mixing bowl, make a quick marinade of the canola oil, sweet soy sauce, yuzu, sesame oil and ginger. Whisk together to combine. Carefully cut the tuna into 1 1/2-inch cubes and place in the marinade and toss to coat well (it will be a very light coating/marinade as the tuna shouldn&#39;t be too wet when searing). Thread 4 pieces of tuna per bamboo skewer (4 cubes per skewer, 8 skewers total). Mix the sesame seeds together and spread out on a flat platter. Take each skewer and press the tuna into the sesame seed mixture so it is well coated on all 4 sides. Heat a flat grill plate to high heat. Brush lightly with some oil to clean the grates and create a nonstick surface. Grill the tuna skewers just a few seconds on each of the 4 sides so the sesame seeds are toasted and crunchy and the tuna is rare in the middle, 30 to 35 seconds. Serve the tuna skewers on a bed of the dressed soba noodles and garnish with some sliced scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 521,&quot;Wild Mushroom and Fonduta Ravioli with Asparagus, Butter and Parmigiano 1 pound Fresh Pasta Dough 1 recipe Mushroom Filling 1/2 cup Fonduta 1 egg yolk Semolina flour to dust 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 cup fresh asparagus (green and white), blanched, cooled and cut into 1-inch pieces 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 3 1/2 cups flour (all-purpose or \\0-0) 4 eggs 1 teaspoon olive oil 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 1 pound assorted wild mushrooms, cleaned and chopped (save stems and peelings) 1 teaspoon garlic, finely chopped 1/4 cup white wine 1/2 teaspoon fresh parsley, chopped 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh sage Salt and pepper to taste 1 cup Porcini Mushroom Stock or vegetable stock White truffle oil (optional) 2 ounces dried porcini pieces 5 cups cold water 1 pound Italian Fontina cheese 1 1/2 cups milk 6 egg yolks 1 teaspoon flour Instructions: For the Fresh Pasta Dough: Place the flour on a work surface. Make a well in the center and add the eggs, olive oil and salt. Begin mixing the eggs with a fork, being careful to stay in the center. Add flour from the sides of the well little by little. When it becomes too stiff to mix with a fork, continue, incorporating flour by gently kneading the dough. When the dough has absorbed about as much flour as it&#39;s going to, move it to another area of the counter, scrape up the remaining flour and pass it through a sifter to remove any dried bits (you don&#39;t want these in your dough.) Then start kneading, keeping the table lightly dusted with flour. When it no longer sticks to the table, you&#39;re about finished. In the end, you want a smooth, firm but resilient, homogenous ball of dough, neither too dry nor too soft. Poke the dough and it should spring right back, press your fingers into the middle of the ball and it should feel just a bit tacky. If it is very sticky, you&#39;ll need to add more flour. Wrap the dough loosely in plastic and let it rest for at least 1 hour. This will make it easier to roll out. For the Mushroom Filling: Heat the oil in a frying pan add the mushrooms and saute. Add the garlic and deglaze with the white wine. When the wine has cooked away, add the mushroom stock and simmer until almost all the liquid has evaporated. Let the mushrooms cool then pulse in a food processor until coarsely chopped. In a mixing bowl, fold in the herbs and season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also stir in a drop of truffle oil if desired. For the Porcini Mushroom Stock: Place porcini in a saucepot and cover with water. Bring to a boil then lower heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the mushroom steep for 30 to 40 minutes. Pass the stock through a strainer lined with a cheesecloth or a dampened paper towel to remove the mushrooms and any bits of sand. You should have 4 cups of flavorful, not overly concentrated, stock. For the Fonduta: Trim the red rind off the cheese and chop in a food processor. Put the cheese in a stainless steel mixing bowl, pour the milk over the cheese, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate over night. Fill a saucepan halfway with water and bring to boil. Place the mixing bowl over the pot to create a double boiler and allow the cheese to dissolve slowly into the milk, whisking occasionally. When the milk and cheese are completely amalgamated, stir in the flour. Whisk in the egg yolks one at a time. When all the eggs have been incorporated continue whisking over the heat until the mixture is thick and creamy and warm to the touch. Be careful not to let the fonduta get to hot or it will curdle. For the Ravioli: Using a pasta rolling machine or rolling pin, roll pasta out into a very thin sheet 6 to 8 inches wide. Spoon the mushroom filling on to half of the sheet in 2 rows of even rounds. Make a small indentation in the center of each mound and, with a pastry bag or small spoon, place a little of the fonduta into the center of each mound. Brush a little of the egg yolk around the mushroom filling then carefully lay the other half of the pasta sheet over the top. Gently press around the filling. Using a scalloped pastry wheel, cut the pasta in between the mounds to form individual ravioli. Keep the ravioli on a board or pan sprinkled with flour until ready to cook. (May be made and kept in refrigerator up to a day in advance). Bring a pot of salted water to a boil add the ravioli and cook 3 to 5 minutes; when the pasta rises to the surface they are done. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the asparagus, a pinch of salt. Add the ravioli, toss with the Parmigiano cheese and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 522,&quot;Marinated Grilled Steak 1 1/2 pound flank steak 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped Ground black pepper 1 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: Trim steak of excess fat.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make small slits all over the prime rib and fill each slit with a slice of the garlic. Season liberally with the salt and coarse pepper, place on a rack set inside a roasting pan and roast for about 2 hours until medium-rare, or until a thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 135 degrees F. Remove the meat to a platter, and tent with foil to keep warm. Place the roasting pan on top of the stove over 2 burners set on high heat. Add the wine to the pan drippings in the pan and cook over high heat until reduced, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the stock and cook until reduced by half.

Attach a candy thermometer to the pot (if you have one) and place over medium heat. Bring to a gentle boil.<br> Continue to cook the sugar mixture (it should bubble adamantly), stirring occasionally, and checking the temperature, either with the candy thermometer or with a regular digital thermometer. Be extremely careful; bubbling sugar will burn you like nobody&#39;s business.<br> When the sugar mixture reaches 230 degrees F, turn the heat off. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, pull the chilled bowl of water out of the freezer and, using a spoon, drop a tiny dollop of the sugar mixture into the cold water. It should form long strings. This is called \\one-string consistency\\ and it means that your sugar is at exactly the right temperature.<br> Stir in the cardamom and red food coloring if you&#39;re using it. Now, add the coconut and the cashew powder if using. Stir carefully until the whole mixture is an even pink hue. Quickly, pour into the prepared pan, smooth out so it&#39;s an even thickness and allow to cool for about an hour.<br> When hardened, pull out of the pan, and cut into either bite-size squares or diamonds.

Add the flour mixture and water, alternating in 3 additions. Mix until the ingredients are combined.<br> Mound the dough onto a clean workspace and press into two discs. Wrap each disc in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the dough to hydrate and the butter to firm up.<br> Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll it to 1/4-inch thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut the dough into shapes and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze the cookie cut-outs for 15 minutes so they will retain their shape when baked.<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place two racks in the upper and lower third of the oven.<br> Bake, switching the baking sheets halfway through, until the cookies have dried out and are baked through, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before decorating. Continue until all of the cookie dough has been used.<br> After cooling completely, decorate the cookies using royal icing or glaze.<br> To decorate with royal icing: Transfer 1/2 cup of royal icing to a piping bag with a #2 metal piping tip (small round tip). Pipe as desired--the royal icing will need about 1 hour to dry, or overnight if you plan to pack them for shipping. Add additional royal icing to the piping bag as needed.<br> To decorate with glaze: Dip the top half of the cookie into the glaze. Sprinkle the cookies with colored sugar as desired. Decorate with various candies if using.<br> Sift the powdered sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the egg whites and mix on low until combined, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and mix until smooth, about 5 minutes. With the mixer running, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time, if needed, to desired thickness. Use immediately, as the royal icing will dry out. Or, store in a closed container in the refrigerator until ready to use (you may need to whisk in a little water again for it to be the desired thickness). Makes about 3 cups icing. Add the ingredients to a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Spoon about 1 teaspoon on each cookie and use a small offset spatula or butter knife to spread the glaze on in an even layer. Sprinkle with colored sugar on top, if desired.

Put the masa harina in a large bowl, pour in the water and get in there with your hands, kneading until you have a uniform dough. It should take only a minute or two. You want a nice, moist dough, so work in a little more warm water if it&#39;s dry. If it&#39;s sticky, work in a little more masa harina. Break the dough into four equal pieces and roll each one into a ball. Put the balls on a plate or cutting board and cover them with plastic wrap to keep the dough from drying out. One at a time, roll them out with a rolling pin or clean wine bottle until they&#39;re a thin circle about 1/4-inch thick. Brush a little of the vegetable oil on a skillet or comal and heat it over medium-high heat until it&#39;s good and hot. Carefully add the first sope and cook it until little brown blisters appear on the bottom, about 45 seconds. Flip it over with a spatula and cook for another 30 to 45 seconds. Flip it over again, count to 10 and transfer to the towel-lined baking sheet. Keep it warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining 3 sopes (adding a little more oil if you need to), and keep them in the oven until you&#39;re ready to serve them. Pour a couple of tablespoons of the oil into a skillet and add the cl, garlic and onions. Set the skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the huitlacoche (or mushrooms) along with a good pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the huitlacoche is heated through, about 5 minutes (or until the mushrooms are a little browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes). Take the mixture off the heat and stir in the cilantro. Arrange your sopes on a platter. Cover with a thin layer of Roasted Tomato-cl de Arbol Salsa, the huitlacoche or mushrooms, a drizzle of the crema fresca and a sprinkle of queso fresco. Serve the remaining salsa on the side. Preheat the boiler. Put the tomatoes on a baking sheet and broil until the tomatoes are nice and charred, 10 to 12 minutes. Take the tomatoes out, let them cool just until you can handle them, slip off the skins and cut out the tough cores. Transfer the tomatoes to a big bowl (don&#39;t you dare forget the tomato juice that has leaked out and reduced to awesomeness on the baking sheet), and then roughly chop them. While the tomatoes are broiling, heat a dry skillet over medium heat and toast the chiles (in batches, if necessary), flipping them over occasionally, until they just begin to smoke, about 5 minutes. Set them aside in a bowl. Put the olive oil, garlic and onions in a saucepan, set it over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, about 7 minutes. Add the toasted chiles, tomatoes and 2 cups water, bring to a simmer and cook for another 12 minutes, so the flavors come together. Let it cool a bit. Carefully transfer the mixture to a blender. Add the cilantro, salt and pepper and puree until the mixture is very smooth. Pour the mixture through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. Serve at room temperature or slightly chilled. Store the salsa in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to a week, or in the freezer for a month. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 555,&quot;Balinese Vegetable Curry with Fried Rice: Nasi Goreng 12 shallots, chopped 2 tablespoons chopped garlic 2 tablespoons chopped ginger 1 tablespoon turmeric powder or 2-inches fresh turmeric root, peeled 1/2 cup macadamia nuts 1 teaspoon shrimp paste (optional) 1/2 cup chopped lemongrass 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground Thai Bird cl 1 tablespoon tomato paste 2 tablespoons tamarind pulp, soaked in 1-cup warm water, strained, pulp discarded 3 kaffir lime leaves, stemmed and cut 1/16-inch ribbon 1 cup vegetable stock 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup cauliflower florets, blanched in salted water and cooled in an ice bath 1 cup mixed yellow and green patty pan squash, halved, blanched in salted water and cooled in an ice bath 2 cups mixed yellow and green squash, cut into 2-inch chunks and blanched in salted water and cooled in an ice bath 1 cup haricot verts, snipped and blanched in salted water and cooled in an ice bath 2 chayotes, cut into 2 inch chunks and blanched in salted water and cooled in an ice bath Grapeseed oil, to cook Salt and pepper Nasi Goreng, recipe follows Fried Shallots, recipe follows Peanut oil, for cooking 8 shallots, halved and sliced 4 cloves garlic, sliced 1 tablespoon minced ginger, 1 tablespoon minced lemongrass, white part only 1/4 cup sambal oelek 2 tablespoons naturally brewed soy sauce 4 eggs, beaten 2 cups cooked jasmine or other long grain rice, cold 2 cups cooked Balinese red rice, cold (can substitute jasmine or other long grain rice) 2 Thai bird chiles, minced 1/4 cup chopped cilantro Peanut oil, for frying 1 cup sliced shallots 1/2 cup rice flour Salt Preheat a fryer or deep pot of oil to 350 degrees F.

Line an 8 by 8-inch baking pan with foil so it hangs over the edges by about 1-inch. Spray with cooking spray. Cheesecake topping: In a medium bowl and using an electric mixer at medium speed, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Beat in the sugar and the vanilla until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in the egg until well blended. Set aside. Brownie layer: Put the chocolate, butter, and oil in a small microwave-safe bowl and heat at 75 percent power for 30 seconds. Stir and microwave again until melted and smooth, about 30 seconds longer. (Alternatively, put the chocolate, butter, and oil in a small heatproof bowl. Bring a small saucepan filled with 1 inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, not touching, the water, and stir occasionally, until melted and smooth.) Combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt, and cayenne in a medium bowl. Combine the brown sugar and granulated sugar in a large bowl. Whisk in the buttermilk, egg whites, and vanilla. Add the chocolate mixture and whisk vigorously until fully incorporated and the batter is thick and glossy. Gradually add the flour mixture and stir just until it disappears.

Stir in the yeast and 3 tablespoons sugar; let stand until foamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast mixture, eggs and vanilla to the flour. Mix on medium speed until the dough comes together, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in the butter 1 piece at a time. Continue mixing, scraping the bowl occasionally with a rubber spatula, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes (it will be a little sticky). Lightly coat a large bowl with cooking spray. Scrape the dough into the bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; dust with flour. Turn out the dough onto a well-floured surface and gently pat until 1/2 inch thick. Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut out 12 to 14 rounds as close together as possible. Place the rounds 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared pans. Lightly coat the tops of the rounds with cooking spray. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until puffy, 30 to 45 minutes. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a heavy pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Cut the parchment paper around each dough round so they can be picked up separately. Working in batches of 3 or 4, use the parchment to carefully slide the dough rounds into the hot oil. Fry the doughnuts, flipping occasionally, until golden brown, 2 1/2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the doughnuts to a paper towel?lined baking sheet to drain. Return the oil temperature to 350 degrees F between batches. Put the remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a medium bowl. While the doughnuts are still warm, toss them in the sugar to coat, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Using a chopstick or skewer, poke a hole in the side of each doughnut, wiggling the stick around to form a pocket. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip with the jelly and squeeze about 2 tablespoons into each doughnut. Blueberry-Lemon Poppy Seed Skip the sugar coating in Step 5. Fill the doughnuts with blueberry jam. Top with lemon glaze (whisk 1 cup confectioners? sugar with the zest of 1 lemon, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and a pinch of salt). Sprinkle with poppy seeds. Apple-Cinnamon In Step 5, coat the doughnuts with cinnamon sugar (whisk 3/4 cup sugar with 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon). Fill the doughnuts with apple butter. Learn how to make a Hanukkah favorite: jelly doughnuts! Lemon-Raspberry In Step 5, coat the doughnuts with raspberry sugar (pulse 1/2 cup freeze-dried raspberries in a food processor or spice grinder until powdery; mix with 1/3 cup sugar). Fill the doughnuts with lemon cream (whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream to stiff peaks, then fold in 1 cup lemon curd). Strawberry-Chocolate Skip the sugar coating in Step 5. Fill the doughnuts with strawberry jam. Top with chocolate glaze (melt 6 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate with 1/3 cup heavy cream and a pinch of salt in the microwave, then stir until smooth). &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 588,&quot;Cardamom-Coffee Custard 2 cups whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 2 tablespoons dark-roast coffee beans, crushed with a heavy skillet 4 green cardamom pods, crushed 6 egg yolks 2/3 cups sugar 1 pinch salt 1/4 cup cornstarch 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 4 whole coffee beans, for garnish Instructions: In a nonreactive saucepan, bring the milk, vanilla bean, crushed coffee beans and cardamom to a simmer over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg yolks, sugar and salt until pale yellow and fluffy. With the mixer running at low speed, mix in the cornstarch, then very gradually pour in the hot milk mixture, mixing it in as you go. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve back into the saucepan, to smooth it and to remove the spices. Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Cook just until no starchy taste or feeling remains. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter until melted. Pour into 4 custard cups, ramekins, or mugs and chill, uncovered, at least 2 hours or overnight. Serve chilled, placing a whole coffee bean in the center of each serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 589,&quot;Grilled Pickles with Dill Mustard Dipping Sauce 1 quart half-sour pickles 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1/4 cup sour cream 1/3 cup mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon finely minced fresh dill 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder<br> 1 clove garlic, finely minced<br> Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium-high heat.

Mix the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a shallow bowl or plate. Roll the dough into 1 1/2-inch balls (each ball should be a heaping tablespoon; you should have about 18 balls), then roll in the spiced sugar mixture. Divide the dough balls between 2 baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Use the handle of a wooden spoon to indent the centers of each dough ball, pinching together any large cracks that form (a few small cracks are fine). Refrigerate until firm, 20 to 30 minutes.<br> Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.<br> Bake until the cookies just begin to warm through, about 6 minutes. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and use the handle of a wooden spoon to indent the centers just a little more. Return them to the oven, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom and front to back, and bake until the cookies are set and slightly browned on the bottom, an additional 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.<br> For the pecan crumble: Meanwhile, microwave the butter in a small microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 1 minute.

Add the lemon juice, olive oil, a big pinch of salt and some black pepper and toss to combine. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator while you make the feta. For the feta, prepare a dredging station. In a rimmed dish, add the flour. In a separate rimmed dish, whisk the egg with a splash of water. In a third separate dish, whisk together the breadcrumbs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few turns of black pepper. Coat each chunk of feta in the flour and tap off the excess. Dunk in the beaten egg and then coat in the breadcrumbs, tapping off the excess. Heat a 1/4-inch layer of olive oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. (Test to see if it is hot enough by sprinkling a bit of breadcrumb in the oil. If it sizzles right away, it\\u2019s ready.) Carefully place the breaded feta cubes in the oil and fry in batches for 90 seconds to 2 minutes on the first side, undisturbed. Flip and fry on the other side for another minute or so, or until golden brown. Remove to a cooling rack set over a baking sheet and allow excess oil to drain. Repeat until all pieces are fried. To serve, slice open each pita and create a pocket. Schmear a big plop of hummus inside each one, followed by some arugula. Top with a pile of the Greek salad, a few chunks of the warm, fried feta, a dollop of yogurt and a few pieces of mint. Serve with lemon wedges and hot sauce, if desired. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix together the water, sugar and yeast just to dissolve. Add the oil and salt and then gradually add the flour. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix for 7 to 10 minutes, adding just enough additional flour so that the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Do not add too much flour. The dough should be smooth and slightly sticky. Lightly coat a clean large bowl with oil or cooking spray, then place the dough in the bowl and turn it once or twice to coat it in oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. Turn the dough onto a clean work surface and divide it into 8 equal pieces. Mold each piece into a ball by stretching the top and tucking the edges under. Place the balls 1 inch apart on a piece of parchment paper, cover them with plastic wrap and let them rise for 30 minutes. Set an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. With a rolling pin, roll out the balls of dough into 6-inch circles.

Heat a heavy-based frying pan over medium-high heat and cook the steaks for about 3 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the steak and how you like it done. If you prefer to use boneless lamb sirloin or noisettes, I&#39;d advise 2 per person, and less time for their cooking. Wrap the steaks in aluminum foil to rest on a warm plate or in a warm place, while you make the sauce. With the pan still on the heat, but turned down low, add the butter and let it melt, then finely chop the needles from the rosemary sprig and add them to the pan. Peel and crush or mince the garlic clove and add it to the pan, then pour in the port, letting it sizzle and reduce slightly. Unwrap the steaks and add any juices from the foil parcel to the sauce.

Let marinate overnight, in the refrigerator, for best results.<br> Open the pork by the belly, but do not cut or poke holes into the upper or side skin. Place the grease tray inside the Caja China. Tie the pig in between the grids, on its back, and place in the grease tray. Close the Caja China with the ash pan and charcoal grid. Allow 4 inches of separation between the roast and the ash pan. We recommend the pork be at room temperature at the time of roasting.<br> Prepare the charcoal: we recommend Kingsford Charcoal because it lights faster, burns evenly, and lasts longer. Never use instant charcoal. Start with 14 pounds of charcoal for Caja China Model #1 and 16 pounds for Model #2. Place the charcoal into 2 piles of equal size, on each end of the charcoal tray. Never place charcoal on center of tray. Add lighter fluid and light.<br> When the charcoal is lit for 15 minutes, distribute it evenly throughout the tray. Once this process is completed, roast pork for 3 hours, without opening the Caja China. Add more charcoal after 1 hour and distribute evenly throughout the tray. After 3 hours, wearing heavy-duty silicone mitts, remove the charcoal tray, ash pan, and dump the ashes. Then turn the pork over and cut into the skin, every 4 to 6 inches. Place the ash pan and charcoal tray, filled with new charcoal, back into position and continue the roasting process. Check the skin after 20 minutes, slightly opening the box by 1 of the corners. You can continue this process until the skin&#39;s crispness is to your liking. For a pig this large, it will probably require a full hour on its second side.<br> Remove the pork from the Caja China. Deposit the contents of the grease tray into a container, let cool, and discard with trash.

Cream the butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add the granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl between additions. Beat in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, lime zest and salt in a medium bowl. Add one-third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture; beat in half the milk. Repeat additions, ending with the flour. Beat until combined, taking care not to overmix. Divide the batter between the prepared muffin tins, filling the cups two-thirds full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cupcakes comes out clean and the tops spring back when pressed gently, 18 to 22 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the tins on a rack for 10 minutes, and then remove from the tins and cool completely. To assemble: Pour the Key Lime Curd into a squeeze bottle with 1/4-inch opening. Fill the cupcakes with curd by inserting the tip into the top of each cupcake and squeezing a couple tablespoons of filling into each cupcake; the cupcake will feel heavier and curd may be visible as it comes up to the top of the cupcake. Stir the Key Lime Frosting and dip the top of each cupcake into the frosting, allowing any excess to drip off. Roll the edge of each cupcake in the graham cracker crumbs and place on a serving platter. Garnish with a slice of Key lime if desired. Whisk together the yolks, granulated sugar, lime juice and salt in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, about 6 minutes, or until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine sieve into a medium bowl. Stir in the butter, one piece at a time, stirring until combined before adding the next piece. Stir in the lime zest and cover with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface of the curd. Chill completely, about 1 hour. 3 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature<br> Beat the cream cheese and butter in a bowl with electric mixer at medium speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the sweetened condensed milk, scraping down the sides of the bowl to combine well. Beat in the lime juice and vanilla. On low speed, gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until well combined. Chill 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 603,&quot;Baileys Spiced Coffee 1.5 oz. Baileys Coffee Irish Cream 1 oz.

Puff Pastry Sheets (2 sheets) 1/2 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese Instructions: Thaw the pastry sheets at room temperature for 40 minutes or until they&#39;re easy to handle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Season the beef with the black pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook for 10 minutes, turning the beef over once during cooking. Remove the beef to a plate. Cover the plate and refrigerate for 1 hour or until the beef is cold. Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, shallots and garlic. Season with the black pepper. Cook until the mushrooms are tender, stirring often. Remove the mushroom mixture from the skillet and let cool. Unfold the pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry sheets into 2 (14-inch) squares. Trim the edges to form 2 (13-inch) squares. Cut each square into 4 squares, making 8 squares in all. Place 1 tablespoon Gorgonzola in the center of each pastry square. Divide the mushroom mixture among the pastry squares. Top each with 1 filet mignon. Fold 2 opposite pastry corners over the beef, overlapping slightly, and press to seal. Brush with the egg. Repeat with the remaining pastry corners. Place the Wellingtons seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate the Wellingtons and the remaining egg for 1 hour or overnight.

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Add the shallot, a small pinch of salt and a splash of water and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool slightly. Pour the buttermilk over the stale bread in a large bowl and let sit at room temperature until the bread soaks up most of the buttermilk, about 5 minutes. Lightly squeeze the excess buttermilk from the bread; discard the buttermilk but keep the bread in the bowl. Add the egg, parmesan, parsley, cooled cooked shallots and 1 teaspoon salt to the bowl with the bread. Use your hands to stir the bread mixture together until it is well combined with no large pieces of bread. Add the ground beef and sausage and gently mix all the ingredients with your hands until just combined. (Do not overwork the mixture or the meatballs will be tough.) Using a 1-ounce ice cream scoop or 2 leveled tablespoons as a measurement, scoop and form 24 meatballs and transfer to a baking sheet. Broil the meatballs until they are browned all over, 4 to 8 minutes, depending on your broiler. Lower the heat of the oven to 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, pour the tomato sauce into a medium saucepan and bring to a low simmer over medium heat. Gently nestle the browned meatballs in the sauce, cover and cook until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat but keep the meatballs covered to stay warm while you make the crostini. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet. Lightly brush the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil on both sides of the bread slices. Bake until light golden brown around the edges and crispy throughout, 12 to 15 minutes, turning the bread slices halfway through the baking time. To serve, smear each crostini with a bit of the warm tomato sauce, then top with a meatball and basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 606,&quot;Basic Stuffing 1 stick unsalted butter, plus more for pan and topping 2 cups diced onions 2 cups diced celery 2 apples, cored and chopped 1 tablespoon minced fresh sage 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 cups chicken broth 2 eggs 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 16 cups cubed stale country white bread Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375?

Instructions: In a large saucepan, heat 3 cups of chicken stock. Coarsely puree the Roasted Winter Vegetables and the chicken stock in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade (or use a handheld blender). Pour the soup back into the pot and season, to taste. Thin with more chicken stock and reheat. The soup should be thick but not like a vegetable puree, so add more chicken stock and/or water until it&#39;s the consistency you like. Serve with Brioche Croutons and a drizzle of good olive oil. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the carrots, parsnips, sweet potato, and butternut squash in 1 to 1 1/4-inch cubes. All the vegetables will shrink while baking, so don&#39;t cut them too small. Place all the cut vegetables in a single layer on 2 sheet pans. Drizzle them with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Toss well. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender, turning once with a metal spatula. Sprinkle with parsley, season to taste, and serve hot. Slice the bread about 3/4-inch thick. Cut off the crusts and then cut the slices in 3/4-inch dice. You should have 3 to 4 cups of croutons. Place the croutons on a sheet pan and toss them with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, tossing once, until they&#39;re nicely browned on all sides.

In a small saucepan, heat milk, and whisk in flour and cook for 30 seconds. Pour this into soup after beans are tender, and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until soup is slightly thickened. To serve: garnish with sour cream and parsley. TIP: NO MORE GRAY BEANS To ensure a bright green bean color in your favorite recipe, try blanching the beans in briskly boiling water to which 1 generous teaspoon of salt has been added. Cook the beans in this water for 2030 seconds, until the color changes to bright green, and immediately plunge the beans in ice water to stop the cooking, and set the color. You can use the beans for crudite, or continue to cook them with a quick saute. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 614,&quot;Chocolate Taffy 2 cups sugar 2/3 cup Dutch process cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup light corn syrup 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water 1 teaspoon white vinegar 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, plus additional for greasing pan and hands Instructions:</p>",118)]))}const g=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
