It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package. The flavors of earthy, roasted fruits are a touch salty, and the finish tastes briney and baked, with notes of coffee and toast. A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"An awkward wine, with some delicious blackberry and cherry flavors, but also some green ones that give an asparagus, minty note.

Dry mineral notes and crisp acidity balance out those ripe fruit flavors.","designation":"Sanct Valentin"},{"country":"us","description":"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering.","designation":"Old Vine"},{"country":"fr","description":"Medium sweet in style, this is as much about ripe tropical and pineapple fruits as about spice and richness.

Pomegranate and cranberry give it a high-toned minerality around integrated oak and tannin.","designation":"Private Reserve"},{"country":"at","description":"A wine that is on the cusp of adding an extra element of complexity.

Screwcap.","designation":"Gaisberg Riesling"},{"country":"us","description":"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented).

The finish is sturdy and lengthy, and overall it delivers a round feel and good expression.","designation":"Librato"},{"country":"us","description":"A very tight, tart and tannic Pinot Noir, almost impossible to open up despite hours of breathing. Acidic and unyielding, the rating is a compromise between what it is currently showing and what it hints at if you probe deeply enough.","designation":"Cuv√©e Romy"},{"country":"us","description":"What a fine, beautiful wine this is. Shows every graceful aspect of a modern Napa Cab, from the perfectly ripened fruit to the unbelievably fine tannins and application of oak.

Best now, even without decanting, and through 2014.","designation":"Vintner Select Cuv√©e"},{"country":"ar","description":"Hard, charred oak and cedar are the lead aromas on this woody Malbec, which also shows lemon peel and blackberry on the nose.

Good balance between ripe strawberry fruits and the crisp acidity make it both fruity and warm. Drink now.","designation":"Vale da Poupa"},{"country":"cl","description":"Alert but a bit yeasty on the nose, with notes of citrus, tropical fruits and green herbs filling things out, this is weighty and mature, with acidity to spare but also some creaminess to the palate. Briny, salty flavors of orange, tangerine and lime finish long and reflective of the Pacific Ocean, which isn't far from the vineyard that yielded this new-to-the-market SB.","designation":"Kuda"},{"country":"us","description":"Density is a hallmark of all the Silverback reds, and this is the biggest of them all. It's packed tight and almost impenetrable until it's had several hours of breathing time. A mouthful of black fruits is set amidst a sea of darker flavors: tar, smoke, charcoal, graphite, cacao, licorice and espresso grounds.

A zing of citrus finishes this attractive wine in style.","designation":"Vielles Vignes"},{"country":"us","description":"Dark, black and leathery, this wine has an Old-World spirit and rusticity, a dearth of fruit under smooth, thick and dense tannins as well as oak.","designation":"Betsy's Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"This wine is lean, with a severe character that gives tightness to the fruit. It's very mineral in character, full of acidity and just hinting at spice. Drink this nervy wine from 2016.","designation":"Les Pierrottes"},{"country":"us","description":"While a bit restrained in style, this dry easy-going Riesling offers delicate shades of tangerine and yellow-apple flavor augmented by zesty lime and lemon acidity.

Soft and spicy scents are laced with a mix of rock and vanilla. This nicely structured yet approachable wine might be mistaken for a Washington take on Priorat. The underlying minerality gives the light, plummy fruit a solid footing, and extends the length considerably.","designation":"Southern Blend Red"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is big Fleurie, dominated by floral aromas and dry tannins at this stage, and therefore likely to develop for a year or two. The fruits are dark plum, full in the mouth. The acidity offers freshness but also adds to the weight of the texture.","designation":"Ch√¢teau des Moriers"},{"country":"it","description":"This opens with a plush, dark appearance and generous aromas of ripe fruit, tobacco, hazelnut and bitter chocolate.

The fruit flavors are in the plum class, and there seems to be a poached-fruit element there as well. The finish feels hefty and disparate; it has no real direction.

Best from 2020 through 2030.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"us","description":"This Reserve requires the faith of a true believer in its future. It's awkward now, a tannic, very new-oaky wine with jammy black currant flavors, and seems all over the place. We know from long experience that CDV Cabs age terrifically, and this one might.

Try holding it until 2015.","designation":"Alexis"},{"country":"fr","description":"One of a pair of wines from Palayson blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. This, with its 80% Syrah and 20% Cabernet, is perfumed and spicy. With great violet aromas and firm spice and tannin, it does show power and alcohol.

The acidity is just about perfect.","designation":"Olivet Lane Vineyard"},{"country":"pt","description":"The wine comes from Symington vineyards in the Douro Superior, recognized as a top Douro region for red wines.

Drink from 2018.","designation":"Altano Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"This blend is near-equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon along with a healthy dollop of Petit Verdot (18%). It shows a mix of fruit and savory elements, with notes of potting soil, green coffee bean, mocha, fresh herbs, licorice, generous barrel spices and red and black fruit‚Äîshowing more with each swirl.

It's atypical for the variety, but delicious. Drink now, not too cold.","designation":"Riverbench Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"Since the Baumards began bottling all their wines with screw caps, it is noticeable how much more slowly they age.

An easy-drinking wine to pair with mild white fish, like tilapia.","designation":"Barrel Fermented"},{"country":"es","description":"This highly concentrated, black-as-night RDD is inky, volatile and cheesy smelling, but also loaded with massive black-fruit scents. Saturated to the max, this is tannic as nails. Huge blackberry, chocolate and fig flavors end with prodding, rock-hard tannins and flavors of blackened toast, chocolate and cassis extract.

A succulent mix of apple and pear, a touch of pineapple, and a generous swath of butter, caramel and toasted nuts all comes together in a sure palate-pleaser. It spent 13 months in 40% new French oak, and fires on all cylinders, with perfect balance and compelling aromatics.","designation":"Domaine Danielle Laurent"},{"country":"cl","description":"Mild, controlled aromas of peach, apple and woodspice set up a cutting palate with noticeable minerality.

A touch of Gewurztraminer lifts it into floral and lychee territory.","designation":"Riva Ranch"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine skirts the limits of low alcohol, given added weight and body through 75% whole-cluster fermentation and time in 25% new French oak.

New oak adds even richer nuances of smoky caramel and vanilla to this compelling wine.","designation":"Savoy Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"The blue bottle with the banana-colored cork is almost iconic in Oregon. The wine, as always, is far less flashy but perfectly serviceable. It gives fair flavor for your 10 bucks, keeping it simple, sweet and slightly tropical. Don't look for complexity, but if you want a decent, tasting room Riesling, this does the job nicely.","designation":"Blue Moon"},{"country":"us","description":"Too sweet.

Drink from late 2017.","designation":"R√©serve Sauvignon-S√©millon"},{"country":"us","description":"Pierre L√©on is a selection of different clones from the winery estate.

The flavors of tart wild berry, earth and herb have a thin, edgy character; and the tannins seem greener than what would be optimal.","designation":"Pierre L√©on"},{"country":"fr","description":"Honeyed, ripe pear meets far earthier notes of cep mushrooms on the nose. The palate majors on bright, softly sweet pear notes but ends in a harmonious, citrus-fresh dryness. A balanced wine of great subtlety with an absolutely clean-cut finish.","designation":"Bruderthal Grand Cru"},{"country":"us","description":"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is too ripe and obvious for its own good. It's very good, offering a vast wealth of pie filling blackberries, cherries, cassis, licorice and chocolate flavors, but you find yourself wishing that, at this price, it had greater structure and was a little more aloof and tantalizing.","designation":"Blend 25"},{"country":"it","description":"Here's a simple and fruity Nero d'Avola that offers fleeting blackberry and tart red-cherry flavors alongside fresh acidity. Pair this with pizza or with other everyday, informal meals.","designation":"L'Asispadi"},{"country":"pt","description":"This blend of the two classic grapes of Vinho Verde, Loureiro and Alvarinho, is packed with fruit.

The mouthfeel is rich, persistent and soft.","designation":"Coniale"},{"country":"us","description":"Mazzocco's style has settled into high alcohol, in this case 15.8%, sweet, jammy pie-filling fruit flavors, and soft tannins. If this is the kind of Zin you enjoy, it's for you.","designation":"Maple"},{"country":"us","description":"Vibrant acidity envelops lively yet dark, brooding baked plum and cherry notes in this smoothly made, velvety-textured wine from estate vineyards. It excites as much on the palate as on the nose, transitioning smoothly into the medium-length finish.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"fr","description":"There is a distinct tannic edge to this 100% Pinot Noir Champagne.

It's surprisingly heavy for such a low-alcohol (12.7%) wine.","designation":"Memsie Sauvignon Blanc Semillon Roussanne Chardonnay"},{"country":"ar","description":"Soupy, saucy aromas are akin to tomato sauce. This is wide, chunky and struggling for textural balance. Stalky roasted plum flavors finish herbal, spicy and flabby in feel.","designation":"Vi√±a Amalia Reserva Single Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Although this wine earns its reserve designation with extra concentration, it comes at the cost of complexity. The tart rhubarb and cranberry flavors are tight and the mouthfeel blocky; the wine seems to hit a wall and stop at the stiff tannins.","designation":"Nicholas Estate Reserve"},{"country":"pt","description":"This is a big ripe wine full of juicy sweet plum flavors and dark dense tannins. It is still young with a bitter edge from the toasty wood aging. The wine, with its structure and firm texture, will need more time so drink from 2017.","designation":"Quinto Elemento Reserva"},{"country":"cl","description":"Dry, rubbery aromas are low on fruit.

Aggressive menthol and sappy green-barrel aromas and flavors dominate this wine. There's good weight and texture, just not much in the way of vinous flavor.","designation":"Prima Reserva"},{"country":"cl","description":"Not unlike this producer's 1999 Chardonnay Selection, this Gran Reserva's delivery is all at the beginning. Apple and toasted oak start things off and are followed by crisp acidity and a smooth mouthfeel, However, the finish is short and the oak somewhat overbearing.","designation":"Gran Reserva"},{"country":"de","description":"Plump and powerful yellow plum and cherry flavors seem peppered by spice and tea leaves in this lithe but penetrating wine.

It shows restraint but doesn't come together.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"pt","description":"This was a great vintage Port year, and this white Port, which was bottled in 2015, has hints of the firm tannins and structure that marked out the year. It also has preserved an amazing amount of freshness still suggesting orange marmalade flavors. These are backed up by the fine, concentrated old wood tastes. The wine is, of course, ready to drink.","designation":"Colheita White"},{"country":"us","description":"Given the vineyard sources (Kiona, Ciel du Cheval) and the AVA (Red Mountain), this pure Cabernet Sauvignon may come into its own with a bit more bottle age. Tasted prior to release, it's in a bit of a dumb phase, the fruit essentially in hiding. A hint of raspberry is there, cloaked in leafy notes, with a slightly chalky finish.","designation":"The Rookie"},{"country":"us","description":"The wines from this remote ranch off of Jalama Road combine mossy forest-floor touches with dark hearty aromas, in this case showing pine, rust, juniper, thyme and purple fruit on the nose. The texture is grippy, and there is cranberry fruit in the background, but the palate's attention turns mostly to eucalyptus, dark spice and even tobacco toward the finish.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"it","description":"This wine, which takes the family name of Franz Haas's wife, is an extraordinary blend of 50% Riesling, 20% Chardonnay, 20% Traminer and 10% Sauvignon Blanc. And yet these disparate elements come together into a harmonious, ripe wine, with just a hint of toast from the barrel-fermented Chardonnay. It is powerful, rich and complex.","designation":"Manna Bianco di Mitterberg"},{"country":"cl","description":"Minerally and neutral on the nose, this tastes fresh and crisp like a green apple, with dry flavors of white fruit and bitter almond. It retains that almond character on the finish, which turns even drier and more bitter.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"es","description":"Baked black-fruit aromas feature a ton of oak and related char and spice. In the mouth, this is pulling, blocky, tannic and wiry. A mixed bag of oak, spice, clove and blackberry flavors finishes like a campfire, with choppy, hard tannins that make for a rock-hard closing mouthfeel.","designation":"Capr icho"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine is marked by exceptionally ripe, forward flavors of blackberry jam and black currants, with a sweet coating of smoky oak. In fact, flavor is what drives this wine, although it also shows fine, complex Diamond Mountain tannins that give it a dramatic structure. Seems best now and for the next three years.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"es","description":"Classic Rioja aromas of berry fruits, spice, tobacco and vanilla lead to a grabby palate that's slightly bumpy in feel.

The palate offers yellow peach, green apple and a mineral note alongside vibrant acidity and small, persistent bubbles.","designation":"Brut"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine is youthfully pugnacious, gamy and nutty with sharp acidity that has yet to come into its own.

The two combine for an inviting nose of fresh wild strawberry jam amidst a smooth, silky texture and creamy mousse. The acidity is sharp and generous.","designation":"Brut Reserve Pinot Noir Ros√©"},{"country":"es","description":"Jumpy foxy berry aromas get this Garnacha going. Raw hard tannins smack down with ferocity, while this tastes of candied plum, salt, chocolate and something oddly artificial. Dry scratchy tannins make for a rough finish.","designation":"Selecci√≥n Especial"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a rich smooth wine, full of delicious citrus and apple-fruit flavors.

Very fine in the mouth, clearly a wine with pedigree, but it needs time.
