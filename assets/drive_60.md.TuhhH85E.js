The score indicates its current drinkability, but that could heighten over the next 6C8 years. Shows a very firm tannic structure, with luscious black currant flavors that grow richer as the wine warms up in the glass.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"The relatively unknown Pezerolles Vineyard is at the far northern end of Pommard, touching Beaune above Les Epenots. It produces wine that seems softer than many Pommards, with rich fruit, the tannins firm but definitely playing second fiddle. It is the smoky plum fruit with just a dash of acidity that makes this immensely pleasing.","designation":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"This is always a topflight bottling, and winemaker Ron Bunnell gets the same rows and uses the same barrel regimen and winemaking methods. So what is different? Vintage variation. In 2006 the wines are tighter and slower to open, perhaps longer lived, and show less of the immediately seductive fruit flavors of 2005.

Drink now through 2012.","designation":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"Tasted in May, this Grenache-based Rh?ne blend was still overwhelmingly vibrant and fresh in grapey, primary fruit raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors. It's appealing, but really needs some time to settle down and mellow, so the fruit and oak can mesh together. By the summer of 2009, it should be a wonderful wine, retaining its balanced lushness through at least 2012.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Notable for sheer deliciousness, the way you can't stop at one sip but want more. Soft and gentle, with just a touch of crispness and oak tannins, this Pinot's flavors star. Raspberries, cherries, cocoa, red licorice, cola, vanilla all mingle into some fabulously sweet confection that manages to finish thoroughly dry.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine was sent to me with little information about the owners, and their Web Site doesn't reveal much. The paperwork says it's from Knights Valley, although the label reads Sonoma County. It's a dry, fairly tannic wine, quite ripe in currants and dark chocolate, with an herbal edge and a firm structure. Aged in 100% new French oak, it impresses for its richness and depth, and could develop over the next 6C8 years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier, this softly rich wine has fine, ripe fruit, flavors of cinnamon and almonds, as well as the structured edge of apple skins and lime. It's still young, needing time for the structure to soften, but already impressively complex.","designation":"Champagne"},{"country":"fr","description":"A ripe, soft wine that still does manage to preserve the Ayala lightness of touch. The fruit is green apple and pink grapefruit, with great freshness. The structure, though, is open and hints of yeast show through the fruit. The aftertaste is deliciously fresh.","designation":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"Firmly tannic and dry, this Cabernet, which was blended with a little Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, is one for the cellar. The tannins are tough and astringent, but when they melt away over the next decade or so, they'll leave behind sweet currants, cedar and violets.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Cab Franc is often chewy, tannic, herbal, but rarely luscious, as it is here. The addition of 12% Merlot softens up the middle, but the Franc is the show, with a dazzling display of blueberry, boysenberry, raspberry, coffee, tobacco leaf, lead pencil and more.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"It's pure Cabernet Sauvignon, dense, dark and what might be called brooding.

Drink after 2013.","designation":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"This vineyard-designated Sauv Blanc is half fermented in stainless steel, 40% in concrete eggs and the rest in French oak. It is completely different from the winery's Columbia Valley bottling, with much riper and rounder fruit flavors showing off stone fruits, such as peaches and apricots, along with tropical hints of papaya. There's plenty of stuffing and spice, and a perfect mix of the grape's innate herbaceous and grassy qualities, ramped up with riper, sweeter fruit.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"The Claret is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes filling in the other half, and is quite firm, sappy and muscular. It is tightly structured with cassis, black cherry and plenty of dark, tarry undertones.

It's a very polished and appealing balance of forward, approachable fruit married to more elegant, ageworthy tannins and acids.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Not showing well now due to hard tannins and extreme dryness. There's a core of blackberry fruit but it's buried beneath astringency.

Finishes clean and zesty, but loses a few points because of a rough edge to the mouthfeel.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A solid ros, with berry aromas and a touch of leather on the nose.

Some bitterness in the finish (perhaps attributable to that same SO2) is the only off note.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"Light and taut, this blend from Nuits-St.-Georges, Volnay and Pernand-Vergelesses offers an odd combination of elements. There are bright cherry-kirsch aromas, cherry and earth flavors and a nice mouthfeel sporting a chalky note. But theres also an odd, candied edge to the fruit and a touch of greenness.

Tasty and satisfying, if a bit one-dimensional.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"Lime, fig and taffy flavors mark this successful light white.

A cinnamon nuance provides an exotic edge to the otherwise straightforward, somewhat tart cherry palate. Buttery oak and more tangy cherries dominate the finish.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"Not from old vines, but cloned from them in the pursuit of complexity. This is a very young, backward Zin, dominated by dusty, earthy notes, like a whiff of south-facing barnboard under a hot summer sun.

Floral and fruity in yuzu, it presents itself in a big style, but ultimately finishes with balance.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"From a site planted by Steve MacRostie in 1998, this white sings in complexity and tension, providing tart jolts of lemon verbena, ginger and nutmeg. Complex and elegant, especially in its floral perfume, it drinks voluptuously, full of come-hither ripeness.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Very strong, ripe and extracted. The word massive comes to mind. So packed with blackberry and blueberry preserves, it's almost a food group in itself. Then there are the tannins, huge and soft, giving the wine dramatic refinement. Defines the modern style, and shows that Alexander Valley doesn't have to take second place to Napa Valley when it comes to Cabernet Sauvignon.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The winery actually released this wine after the 2007, no doubt to give it the extra bottle age needed. Nonetheless, it's still quite tannic, bringing to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet. It's refreshing to have an ageable alternative to the soft, sweet modern style. Rich in mountain blackberries and sweet currants, this wine should develop over the next decade.","designation":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Exemplary Gran Reserva Rioja blending modernity with the best traditions of this famed region. Perfumed, lush and complex to start, then vibrant in the mouth, with excellent integration of flavors, acidity and tannins. Tastes of fine tobacco, mulled blackberry, chocolate and dry spices. Proper as the textbook calls for but individual as well. Best from 2014C2018.","designation":"Northern es"},{"country":"it","description":"Volpaia is the proud author of one of Chianti Classico's most enjoyable dessert wines. This luscious Vin Santo (a blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia aged in small barrels called caratelli) is velvety soft and decadent with lingering tones of orange zest, resin, dried ginger, candied fruit and a tiny hint of musk.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"at","description":"Blaufr?nkisch dominates this blend with Merlot and Zweigelt.

Berries and citrus, juicy and tart, cling to the palate and pull through to a lingering finish. Pure and deep all the way through.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"A similar blend to the Ovide; this is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah.

A light lavender note adds interest.","designation":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's one for the cellar, no doubt about it. Shows classic, old-fashioned Howell tannins, the kind that grip early and lock the palate down throughout. But you can't help but be struck by the immensity of fruit.

The wine is quite light in body and color, but the flavors really penetrate and sink in deep. They range from red cherries and cola to red licorice, bacon and spices, with a deft touch of oak. Dry and crisp in acidity, it should provide fascinating drinking over the next seven years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"One of the best Cabernet-Syrah blends out there. The Cabernet dominates, with firm tannins and blackberry and currant flavors, but Syrah brings a meatiness, like teriaki beef. Terrifically interesting, this wine should develop over the next four years.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A Burgundian take on Viognier, barrel fermented in 30% new French oak, put through M-L, and aged 18 months in barrel.

Grill up your best steak and enjoy.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A lovely Pinot Noir, delicious and sweet in fruit.
