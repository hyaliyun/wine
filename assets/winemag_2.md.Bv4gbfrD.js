The wine contains a substantial dollop of Petit Verdot, adding a silky note of violets and textural elegance, in counterpoint to the lead-in-the-pencil firmness offered by the inclusion of the virile Tannat. Tannat, the grape implicated in the French paradox (and the vinifera variety with resveratrol levels that are off the charts), is principally grown in Gascony (land of Les Trois Mousquetaires), though it was historically grown as well in Bordeaux as late as the 19th century.Comparing this wine with the 2012 APC, the inaugural vintage, the '13 version is a bit plusher and posher, with softer tannins, not unreminiscent of the overstuffed chair at one's Club. There is still a lovely minty, cedary aspect to this wine, reflective of its perfect balance, with nary a prunish note to be found."},{"name":"Bonny Doon A Proper Claret 2015","region":"California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Blend: 40% Merlot, 24% Petit Verdot, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc, 4% Malbec"},{"name":"Bonny Doon Bien Nacido X-Block Syrah 2009","region":"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"An exceptionally cool and elegant vintage, this bottling shows off the typical smoked meat/bacon fat character that typifies Bien Nacido. In recent vintages, Bonny Doon has been including a more substantial percentage of whole cluster fruit in this wine, and the stem inclusion does add rather nicely to the structure of the wine and perhaps an enhanced degree of herbal spiciness.

We therefore typically render Big House White with a more grassy, savory character to distinguish it from other members of our white wine fold. There is certainly a strong mineral, almost salty quality here compliments of the chenin blanc, yet this is certainly the fruitiest, most floral Big House White to date. The viognier is quite pronounced and its contribution of honeysuckle and nectarine tones is not merely an exotic foil to the normally dominant, no funny business, sauvignon blanc, but indeed the prevailing component. We are fortunate the razor sharp sauvignon is in there however, to keep at bay the blousiness to which viognier is prone.

I had written that it was our desire to enable this wine to gradually become more piscatorial, i.e. fish-friendly and that had led to a very gradual weaning from a querco-dependency, that is to say, incrementally less new oak. We've used more sauvignon blanc [including some from the very special Rutherford bench, the dusty soil of which is alleged to impart a very particular top-note to sauvignon] in this cuve, which adds a wonderful grapefruit/gooseberry/cassis-like component as well as a substantial dollop of viognier for fragrance and finesse; the wine is crisp, light and lively on the palate.

We have taken to heart some of the lessons learned from fooling around with syrah in southern fr. Very long cuvaisons with whole clusters, a sort of macration carbonique manque, if you will, then micro-bubbleage to a fare-thee-well seems to be a great format for the retention of spice and fragrance in syrah from, shall we say, thermically overachieving climats. The other great lesson is that one can blend various syrahs from different terroirs and climats in much the same way that one blends different cpages to attain complexity and balance. The grapes from the way cool Bien Nacido Vineyard seemed to enhance the mentholated quality that we adore to death. Syrah from the very shy-yielding Chequera vineyard in Paso provided an extremely powerful backbone upon which we were able to overlay and layer in the fine lapidary bits. This is a very potent syrah that still possesses a remarkably fine perfume.

Bud break for Chardonnay began to creep out in the warmest hillsides in February following an exceptionally mild winter. We had rain and cold in April, warm May days, showers in June and thunderstorms in July. Go figure. While we worried about rain during harvest, we found instead a beautiful Indian Summer that let grapes hang and develop full flavors, with higher acids that lead to this vintage having a bright, crisp showing that should be very pleasing. Flavors were even more concentrated as most vineyards found yields for Chardonnay 20-30% below average, allowing vines to concentrate energy in the fruit.

The '13 Fulldraw will stand up to any GSM on the market, period. Notes of fresh blackberries and blueberries are backed with subtle hints of properly proportioned vanillin French oak.

Formerly known as Thira as well as Kallisti (The Fairest'), Santorini is a volcanic island with porous terrain and unique appearance that were created by a series of volcanic eruptions many hundreds of thousands of years ago.

The island is all that remains of a massive volcanic eruption 3,600 years ago that destroyed civilizations hundreds of miles away.  The extremely hot, dry and windy growing conditions make it impossible to grow grapes in standard rows.  Instead the vines are trained into basket shapes and the grapes are grown in the protective center of the basket.  Some vines are over 200 years old and form giant baskets.  The wines of Santorini are made from the Assyrtiko (a-SEER-tee-ko) grape, which has the unique ability to maintain its fresh, citrusy flavors despite the extreme conditions that would make other grapes overripe.  The result is a completely unique dichotomy of flavors that combine grapefruit and red apples with notes of wet chalk.

But for the last three vintages, Lyra has become almost overwhelmingly beautiful. It isnt just fruit any more, and what began as a rapture has changed to a kind of apotheosis of fruit toward a gleaming and complicated divinity. The wine remains ecstatic, but these things are never earned easily. 13 is graceful and massive, dense and weightless, a whirligig of complexity in which a hundred elements glide in an esoteric dance, moving quickly, stepping lightly; it has the focus and the beatific glow of Alzinger (and his wines!), somehow both serene and hyperactively intricate.

For aging the wine, we selected the French oak barrels from five coopers because we like the layered flavors that result from their different styles of cooperage.  We aged the wines for 20 months before  assembling the final blend, which also included a small amount of firm, extracted Merlot from Carneros for additional complexity.  The wine's color is a dense, saturated dark ruby color.  The dominant aromas are of ripe black currants, black cherries and sweet berries, with subtler suggestions of brown spices, bittersweet cocoa and earth.  In the mouth, there are bursting flavors of berry fruits/plums at their lush, high-summer ripeness, toasted spice and chocolate.

This vintage saw quite cool overall weather patterns for our region, and many vintners addressed that challenge by thinning their crops during the summer to give the grapes left on the vines their best chance to reach maturity. Our own crop reduction measures started at fruit set and continued through the season. As a result, while our yields were low even by our standards, we were very pleased with the quality of the fruit and especially its maturity level.   For even more selectivity, we picked our Cabernet in several passes through the vineyards. For example, we harvested Cabernet from one of our small estate blocks on October 1, 3, 13, 14 and 23. We were rewarded with the dark color and deep, lush flavors that we always seek in our wine. Following fermentation, we aged the lots separately, selecting primarily new French oak barrels, for 24 months before blending. I'm very proud of this bottling, truly the result of pro-active farming throughout a season of difficult weather conditions.  Tasting notes  Color: Deep black-purple. Nose: Spicy, layered aromas mingling black currants (cassis) with rich blackberry liqueur-the classic identifiers of deeply ripe Cabernet. These fruit aromas mesh seamlessly with notes of roasted espresso beans as well as vanillin from the toasted oak. Mouth: The wine continues to evoke the ripe Cabernet flavors promised in the aroma, adding abundant, multi-dimensional flavors of blackberries and black licorice. The texture is dense, thick and mouth-coating, the tannins firm but sweet. Restrained notes of smoky oak enhance the flavor and texture without dominating. This is a generous wine with an exceptionally long finish. It should drink well for several decades."},{"name":"Caymus Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon 1999","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Opaque, dark black-cherry color.

Veeder, Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"If Cabernet is THE grape of the Napa Valley, Mount Veeder is definitely THE place to grow this king of the grapes. The elevation, slopes, poor soils, natural drainage, dry farming, stressed vines, small berries and low yield all unite to produce a wine of intense character in both fruitiness and spiciness. It is a wine rich in personality with concentration and depth.  These grapes come from our 26 year old vines on our Mount Veeder Estate. They are hand picked. The extremely low yield, 2 tons per acre, is due to the structure of the different soils the Cabernet grows on ranging from volcanic, rocky soils to deep loamy and clay. These soils force the vines to work harder creating a wine of intense character both in fruitiness and deeper spice flavors.  Natural fermentation brings the true flavors from the soils and the grape. The wine was aged 20 months in French oak barrels. To ensure the lowest manipulation possible, all rackings are made by gravity barrel to barrel. Unfiltered, the wine keeps in the bottle all the elements it developed in the barrels.  Chateau Potelle Cabernet Sauvignon VGS is aged 16 months in the bottle before release. This extra time allows for the tannins to melt and integrate and contribute to make a wine well rounded and ample at release."},{"name":"Ch. Potelle Mt.

We have matched our diverse terrain, soils and mesoclimates to specific Bordeaux varieties, clones and rootstocks. The Estate Red combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Carmenre.  Grown on rocky hillsides with sunny aspects, our red vineyards are thinned to low yields and canopies are diligently maintained to ensure the clusters reach optimum maturity. We are dedicated to managing tannins in the vineyard and patiently wait for flavor development as single vineyard blocks are micro-managed and frequently divided into multiple harvests to achieve desired ripeness.  Winemaking practices are geared toward extracting the softest tannins from the skins and promoting fruit expression, with a combination of tank and barrel fermentations. Aged in French oak barrels for 20 months, this wine is a compilation of 42 small lots, each treated individually until the initial blending at 10 months barrel age. Aromas are varied and complex, featuring warm black raspberries, crme de cassis, violets, roasted herbs, and pipe tobacco. The palate delivers concentrated red fruits, dried cranberries and black plum leading to a more savory element of sage and black pepper. Textured yet silky, the wine finishes long and is enjoyable upon release, but will also age beautifully for the next 15+ years."},{"name":"Chalk Hill Estate Sauvignon Blanc 2016","region":"Chalk Hill, Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The 2016 Sauvignon Blanc captures the exotic, vibrant and complex fruit character of our estate-grown grapes.

In the vineyards we carefully manage the vine canopy to expose the fruit to filtered sunlight. This is achieved by careful hand leaf removal in the fruit zone combined with cluster thinning. The result is both fully and evenly ripened grapes. This wine is a blend of nine different clones of Sauvignon blanc and two clones of Sauvignon gris grown on the Estate. Sauvignon gris' ripe stone fruit flavors plus its weight and texture provide a pleasing counterpoint to the more bright tropical and citrus aspects of the other Sauvignon blanc clones. f Throughout harvest and vinification exposure to air is minimized. One third of the lots are given skin contact before pressing. This increases the concentration of the aromatic compounds associated with the intense aromas of passion fruit and grapefruit. The wine is entirely barrel fermented in a combination of small French oak and stainless steel barrels. Although primarily fermented with native yeast, the skin-contact lots were inoculated with strains of yeast which assist in the release of the ripe aromatic compounds of this variety. f Batonnage, or lees stirring, continues regularly during and after fermentation to add a soft creamy element to the texture of the wine. After nine months in the barrel various lots were blended and then bottled without filtration. f This wine has an abundance of tropical and citrus elements on the nose and palate.

There is little morning or afternoon sun, and moisture burns off slowly late in the season. After the grapes are fully ripe, light rainfall encourages botrytis development.

We bottled the wine without fining or filtration, leaving the richness & intensity of the wine to speak for itself.

The color is similar to the 2013 with its vibrant pink, salmon and fuchsia edges. More than ever, the wild red fruit of strawberry, raspberry and Bing cherry are interwoven with Herbs de Provence and grass, a touch of citrus and an even greater presence of minerality. It was generally a lower acid year, but you wouldn't know that from the natural acid in the wine and bright finish. To promote vibrant aromas, we used a few new experimental yeasts, which we liked a lot and, as ever, maintained lees contact to build up body until we blended for bottling.

There were very few bottles of red: my maternal grandfather, who died in 1949, could never explain to him why, because they never knew each other. But it is quite obvious that there has always been a strong white tradition at Saint Cosme. The wines, all of which were pre-1949, were extraordinary according to what my father told me. When he replanted the Le Poste vineyard in 1964, he kept the same proportion of Clairette and Grenache, to perpetuate its history. Our Clairette plantings at Hominis Fides and Le Claux will soon start bearing and write a new chapter in the story of Saint Cosme that we will be able to read together. The application to produce white Gigondas, which we have been supporting for almost 10 years at INAO, is in its final phase. We should reach a successful conclusion in around two years time and will finally be able to call Le Poste, along with the other whites produced in Gigondas, Gigondas.

Our Deux Albion vineyards have been vinified exactly the same way as the Gigondas wines. The cooking book says: crush and blend the grapes, leave the fermentation begin naturally, keep going adding cold grapes consistently. Then you'll control your temperature fermentation without working too much. If you are lazy, be clever. Leave the indigenous yeasts get exited by mixing them up. As you want to keep the delicate aromas, don't leave the yeasts become too hysterical by cooling down all the stuff. Don't burn your aromas. Don't ferment too hot. When you get to the end of the cooking, don't stop it, leave it keep going gently as long as possible. Take your time. It has to be slow. Then gently rack the wine and softly press the grapes. Taste very often. Taste several times per day. Taste again. Look for your own pleasure, then you'll get more chances to give pleasure. Serve at 16C with a nice smile.
