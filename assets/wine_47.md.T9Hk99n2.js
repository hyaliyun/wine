The blackberry, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors have all kind of overtones, ranging from licorice and vanilla to gingerbread and candied violets.

Small amounts of Syrah, Malbec and Cabernet seem to have pumped up the color and the tannins, without adding much in the way of fruit. Right now it's quite tight, and long airing does not improve it.

This quaffable Sardinian wine, deeply redolent of dried sage, oregano, natural rubber and those funny cigarettes people smoked in the 1960s, speaks loads about the arid, brush-covered island it comes from. Those herbal notes set this wine up for a pairing with smoked salmon or swordfish.","designation":"Silenzi","title":"Pala 2006 Silenzi White (Isola dei Nuraghi)"},{"country":"US","description":"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola.

There may not be another wine in the galaxy with more eco-friendly credentials (salmon safe, Tilth-certified, organic, etc.) but more importantly, it simply tastes good.

These wines are somewhat similar in style to the Syrahs from the Okanagan valley of Canada, and they offer an earthy mix of flavor that puts the fruit under earth, soy, coffee and smoke.

The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus C not generally a character found in Champoux fruit.

It shows the elegant polish of the '97 Royal Cuv e, but is superior even to it in richness.

But that merely ensures ageability. It's beautiful the way the acid-tannin structure plays against the cherry, cassis and olive fruit, creating an architectural tension.

So powerful is the wine in itself that it easily shoulders the 100% new French oak, which pushes the richness into a smoky, ne plus ultra territory.

It was very hot, the earliest harvest ever, and it was difficult for vintners to achieve total balance.

This is a Syrah that's hard and astringent, almost aggressive. But then the core of blackberries and cherries kicks in, turning spicy and licorice-like on the finish.

One to watch, if the winemaker can manage those bigtime tannins.","designation":"","title":"River Star 2004 Syrah (Paso Robles)"},{"country":"US","description":"I like this Merlot for its plush fruit and soft balance.

I like the complexity, the way the primary fruits mix in unusual notes of pineapple along with the black cherry. It's resonant and tangy, with good, long flavors and lots of new oak.

Doesn't that sound good?","designation":"Special Select Late Harvest","title":"Arrowood 2005 Special Select Late Harvest White Riesling (Alexander Valley)"},{"country":"it","description":"There's a particular elegance here that is impossible to beat: The wine is spectacular overall, but never too ornate, and earns high praise for its purity. Aromas of resin, tar, apple and almond are distinct and vibrant and the wine delivers firm, dusty tannins and excellent length.","designation":"","title":"Bertani 1998  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico"},{"country":"fr","description":"This blanc de blancs certainly shows its dryness, but with the wonderful maturity that it is just beginning to develop, it also has plenty of richness. Almonds are emerging to balance the white, almost tropical, fruits, calming the extreme crispness of the acidity. A great wine, which should develop beautifully over the next 10C15 years.","designation":"Avize Grand Cru Extra Brut","title":"Jacquesson et Fils 1997 Avize Grand Cru Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a small production barrel selection from the estate vineyard in Green Valley. It's very rich and quite young, too primary and tannic to drink now, but extraordinarily rich in the cherries, blackberries, blueberries and Asian spices that characterize the estate. Best 2008C2012.","designation":"Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard","title":"Marimar Estate 2004 Cristina Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"it","description":"This is one of those  wow  wines you encounter on fortunate but rare occasions that radically changes the way you think about a relatively unknown, workhorse grape like Montepulciano d'Abbruzzo. Gianni Masciarelli is a solid and passionate winemaker who has expertly extracted both elegance and complexity: Black cherry, espresso, chocolate and licorice are reinforced by impenetrable concentration, raw intensity, solid tannins and extreme persistency on the finish.","designation":"Villa Gemma","title":"Masciarelli 2001 Villa Gemma  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)"},{"country":"US","description":"A very fine Chard, complex and layered, and quite dry. Acidity makes the tangerine, kumquat, ripe yellow pear, roasted pineapple and oaky, cr me br?l e flavors really come alive. After you swallow, the wine leaves behind a delicious impression.","designation":"Dutton Ranch Rued Vineyard","title":"Dutton-Goldfield 2005 Dutton Ranch Rued Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"it","description":"There's something magical about this wine: the purity, the elegance, the harmony, the immediate rush of intensity. This is one of it's iconic wines thanks to the profound purity it delivers with notes of chocolate, leather, cherry, apple, cola and spice. It imparts loads of succulent flavor and is simply beautiful.","designation":"","title":"Quintarelli 1998  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico"},{"country":"US","description":"This is ageable and enormously complex, and should do very interesting things over the next six years. Right now it is tight and fresh in primary fruits and acidity. It's an enormously rich wine, vast in black cherries, pomegranates, cola, red plums, balsam and saut ed mushroom flavors, with a gamy, forest-floor earthiness. Time in the bottle can only improve it through 2011.","designation":"Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard","title":"Dutton-Goldfield 2005 Dutton Ranch Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"nz","description":"From the makers of Pegasus Bay, this is a dark, plummy Pinot Noir that's plump and easygoing in the mouth. Hints of leather, chocolate and wintergreen spice it up a little, adding a mouthwatering freshness to the finish. Imported by Meadowbank Estates.","designation":"","title":"Main Divide 2005 Pinot Noir (Waipara Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This lively, 100% Sauvignon Blanc sports fresh flavors of grapefruit, lemon meringue and quinine much like a cool-climate Viognier. Racy and fresh, it was mostly stainless-steel fermented, and is young enough to capture a bit of spritz in the mouthfeel.","designation":"","title":"Woodinville Wine Cellars 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"The cool 2005 growing season benefited this wine. It's dry and balanced and quite elegant, with delicious flavors of peaches, buttered popcorn and caramel.","designation":"Estate","title":"Grgich Hills 2005 Estate Chardonnay (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Basso makes good wines year in and year out. This Malbec is saturated and potent. It needs time to air out or it could be intimidating. Once open, look for cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a dessert-worthy finish. Tastes a touch hot despite only 13.5% posted alcohol.","designation":"","title":"Carlos Basso 2006 Malbec (San Carlos)"},{"country":"US","description":"Scents of beeswax and lemon tea open into a pretty, lemon-drop flavor set. Winemaker Steve Lessard has softened the sometimes bitter phenolics of the grape, so the fruit flavors, though not quite tropical, are ripe and smooth as they open up. Hints of pineapple, lemon and grapefruit mingle to create a user-friendly, approachable wine.","designation":"","title":"Whitman Cellars 2006 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Pretty tannic at this point, which makes for a fairly astringent palate experience despite loads of ripe cherries, blackberries and currants. On the other hand, that grittiness will pair well with steak. Nice now but doesn't have the stuffing for ageability.","designation":"Reserve","title":"Kunde 2003 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)"},{"country":"it","description":"This wine offers a nice mix of typical Sauvignon aromas such as fresh fruit, sage and tomato leaf, and also appears less sharp than other versions of the grape with low-key acidity that is never pointed or thorny.","designation":"Indra","title":"Girlan 2006 Indra Sauvignon (Alto Adige)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a waxy, rather soft rendition of Sauvignon Blanc, and the pretty fruit flavors mix grapefruit, citrus and pineapple. There is very little suggestion of Sauvignon Blanc's herbal or grassy side; the grapes seem to have been ripened past that point, though not all the way to California-style, tropical fruit flavors. All in all this is a well-crafted, smooth and flavorful wine, with a portion barrel-aged for extra complexity.","designation":"Grand Estates","title":"Columbia Crest 2006 Grand Estates Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"With 10% Petite Sirah, which seems to give it a tannic essence of dark fruit intensity, this Zin is enormous in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with cola and caramel notes. It's full-bodied and dry and, once again, those tannins are center-stage.","designation":"Sonoma County Ranches","title":"Phipps 2005 Sonoma County Ranches Zinfandel (Sonoma County)"},{"country":"nz","description":"A good warning against holding Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc too long. This wine is already losing some fruit, showing a touch of asparagus or green bean. It's still impressively complex and weighty, with a rich, slightly oily mouthfeel, but deserved to be tasted earlier in its life.","designation":"Clifford Bay Reserve","title":"Villa Maria 2005 Clifford Bay Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Dynamic aromas of honeysuckle and mint gumdrop precede intense honey, orange, tangerine and marmalade flavors. This is a thicker, more oily style of Torrontes than the commonly seen watery ones, and it makes a statement via its viscosity and power.","designation":"Cuma Organic","title":"Michel Torino 2007 Cuma Organic Torront s (Cafayate)"},{"country":"US","description":"This winery seems to be trying to find an identity. The Cabs are vintage-driven, and do better in cool years, which 2004 wasn't. This wine is a little soft and direct, but delicious enough, with ripe, pastry-filling blackberry, cherry, boysenberry and chocolate flavors. You can taste high-char oak on the finish.","designation":"Th r se Vineyards Estate","title":"Martin Ranch 2004 Th r se Vineyards Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)"},{"country":"ar","description":"A draft of menthol and aromas of chocolate and mossy fruit work pretty nicely on the nose, while the palate is superripe, a bit candied and accented by spice and coffee. This is a strong starter, though it falls off a little on the finish.","designation":"IQUE","title":"Enrique Foster 2006 IQUE Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Staunch cherry and grape aromas are indicative of what the wine will give. The palate pushes ahead with plum and cherry flavors, but the fruit isn't overly developed and the mouthfeel is more tight and sheer than cushioned and rich. Zesty and firm on the finish, which is par for this course.","designation":"","title":"Felipe Rutini 2005 Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"au","description":"A good wine at a good price, the 2006 Jim-Jim Shiraz offers bouncy raspberry fruit, hints of cracked pepper and vanilla and a medium-bodied, reasonably lush mouthfeel. Multiple U.S. importers.","designation":"Jim Jim","title":"Hugh Hamilton 2005 Jim Jim Shiraz (McLaren Vale)"},{"country":"it","description":"This is a crisp wine with pretty brilliance and aromatic floral notes, peach, white mineral and a very enticing hint of crushed basil leaf.

There's nice heft to its texture that helps drive a chewy, spicy finish.","designation":"","title":"Ronco delle Betulle 2005 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)"},{"country":"ar","description":"The only thing holding this value-priced Cab back is that it seems slightly overripe, which results in a bouquet that's mildly cooked and grainy and a palate that's rooty and sweet. But if you like softer tannins and flavors of root beer, chocolate and spice, this has plenty of that.","designation":"","title":"Septima 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)"},{"country":"it","description":"Poolside lunches, seafood salads and quick finger foods call out for a simple, un-oaked Chardonnay and this crisp white from northern it fits the bill perfectly. The wine is light as a feather with cool crispness on the close that reinforces distinct citrus flavors.","designation":"","title":"Santa Margherita 2006 Chardonnay (Trentino)"},{"country":"US","description":"From the former Ashley's Vineyard, one of the best-known in the AVA, comes this very ripe, extracted Pinot Noir. Tastes like it had a long hangtime, getting ripe to the point of baked pie-filling cherries and pur ed, smoky, almost raisined blackberries. The tradeoff for all this richness is softness and a resulting one-dimensionality.","designation":"Cuv e Sandra","title":"Demetria 2005 Cuv e Sandra Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)"},{"country":"US","description":"Big and bold, a Chard that shows off its terroir in the crisp, citrusy acidity and clean purity of fruit. The flavors veer toward pineapples and green tropical fruits. Oak plays a very prominent role, perhaps a little too much so, in this dry wine.","designation":"La Reina Vineyard","title":"Figge 2005 La Reina Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.","designation":"Oak Cask","title":"Trapiche 2005 Oak Cask Syrah (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"A southern Rh?ne blend of Syrah, Mourv dre and Grenache, this wine is stylish and elegant, with a smooth, silky texture. But it's just a little too sugary sweet to earn a higher score, with the blackberry and cherry fruit having a jellied, candied edge.","designation":"Z Three Red Wine","title":"Zaca Mesa 2004 Z Three Red Wine Red (Santa Ynez Valley)"},{"country":"it","description":"This is a simple, friendly wine with a pretty dusty, mineral quality that frames fresher aromas of pear, peach and golden apple. It's a bit toned down in terms of flavors intensity but does end on a playful spicy note.","designation":"Vigneto ai Palazzi","title":"Masottina 2005 Vigneto ai Palazzi Chardonnay (Piave)"},{"country":"US","description":"I went back and forth on this wine, hating it, then liking it. It's too soft, but dry. It's candied, but the cherry-berry flavors have a nice edge of spicy cola. The more I sipped it, the better it got. The alcohol is a modest 14.1%.","designation":"MdR Vineyard","title":"Sensorium 2005 MdR Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles)"},{"country":"US","description":"Big, bold, and buttery, with plenty of oaky micro-popcorn flavors. Don't look for subtlety, but you get plenty of flavor.","designation":"Grand Estates","title":"Columbia Crest 2005 Grand Estates Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Too sweet and simple, this wine has sugary flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam.","designation":"Ancient Vines","title":"Cline 2006 Ancient Vines Zinfandel (Contra Costa County)"},{"country":"US","description":"Brief aging in oak and sur lies aging has given this a much needed creamy richness. Without that, it would be just a crisply acidic, fresh wine, with citrus, apple, peach and honeysuckle flavors. With it, it's elevated. Excessively sweet on the finish.","designation":"","title":"La Crema 2006 Pinot Gris (Carneros)"},{"country":"US","description":"Price rise. With broad flavors of berry and chocolate, this is pleasant and undistinguished. This does not have the weight or varietal presence of the winery's Merlot.","designation":"Four Corners","title":"Sagelands 2004 Four Corners Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"ar","description":"Peppery red fruit and a strong whiff of a wet dog make this a leap of faith. The palate holds that peppery element while also showing raspberry and cassis notes. Vanilla and wood spice are front and center on the finish, and while it gets better with time, it never quite reaches fifth gear.","designation":"Clos des Andes","title":"H l ne Garcin 2005 Clos des Andes Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"fr","description":"A lively Champagne, initially all froth and fizz. But get through that and there is a pleasant, slightly sweet wine  perhaps more full-bodied than some. The primary red-fruit flavors have been lessened by some bottle age, leaving a wine which has a hint of maturity.","designation":"Ros  Top","title":"Heidsieck &amp; Co Monopole NV Ros  Top  (Champagne)"},{"country":"US","description":"A little weedy, despite lots of flashy oak. The pineapples and peaches have notes of dried dill and thyme, and the finish is dry and crisp. Nice with broiled halibut in a thyme-butter sauce.","designation":"","title":"Domaine Chandon 2005 Chardonnay (Carneros)"},{"country":"ar","description":"A little bit of leather and smoke meat give the blackberry bouquet something different, while the palate is round, forward and shows good plum and berry flavors. Some heat and spice on the finish do not detract from the overall package, which makes the grade if it doesn't blow you away.","designation":"Los Cardos","title":"Do?a Paula 2006 Los Cardos Cabernet Sauvignon (Luj n de Cuyo)"},{"country":"US","description":"Simple, easy and balanced, this crowd-pleasing Cab will satisfy for its wealth of ripe fruit and oak flavors. Floods the mouth with cassis, licorice and melted milk chocolate, wrapped in smooth, gentle tannins.","designation":"","title":"Burgess 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"nz","description":"A lightweight, delicate Pinot Noir, with a light ruby hue and pretty cherry and herb flavors framed by oaky notes of brown sugar and vanilla. Good value.  Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.","designation":"","title":"Brancott 2006 Pinot Noir (South Island)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Pineapple and apple aromas are fairly attractive and fresh, as is the light, wet and zippy palate, which shows mostly citrus and apple flavors. The finish is mild and clean, and overall the wine delivers clarity and a dominant citrus profile.","designation":"Cruz Alta Reserve","title":"Bodegas Escorihuela 2006 Cruz Alta Reserve Chardonnay (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"Mer Soleil Chards seem to get bigger, riper and oakier every year. Of course, this is the winery's style, and when it works, the results can be fabulously rich, but this caramelized wine seems a little top-heavy.","designation":"","title":"Mer Soleil 2005 Chardonnay (Central Coast)"},{"country":"nz","description":"Like most unoaked Chardonnays, this is a bit simply fruity, but it's also clean and fresh. Apple, melon and citrus flavors are easily carried by its medium body and mouthwatering finish.","designation":"Unoaked","title":"The Crossings 2006 Unoaked Chardonnay (Marlborough)"},{"country":"US","description":"Simple and likeable in fruity extract, this young Pinot has a silky texture and dry, spicy flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, leather, tobacco and oak.

It doesn't have huge flavor intensity but just enough to keep your attention.","designation":"","title":"Mario Schiopetto 2004 Tocai Friulano (Collio)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Sweet aromas that verge on syrupy set up a sweet and easy palate of black cherry and cassis. This has a nice texture as it shows good body, feel and fruit quality. Maipe means  lord of the winds  in a native language, and while this Malbec won't transport you anywhere, it's good for the price.","designation":"","title":"Maipe 2006 Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"it","description":"If any one single estate turned America on to Pinot Grigio, Santa Margherita did.

In this cool vintage, the wine shows zesty flavors of gooseberries, spiced melons and limes, with a touch of feline essence.","designation":"","title":"Greenwood Ridge 2006 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the most successful of La Crema's three $34 regional Pinots, because it's the fruitiest, most balanced and most satisfying. It shows expressive cherry, pomegranate, cola and spice flavors, but it's a little soft and one-dimensional.","designation":"","title":"La Crema 2005 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Value-level Chardonnay has never really been ar's strong suit, but this fuller-bodied version is pretty good. It starts with citrus, orange peel and some dusty scents, which are backed by melon, apple and citrus flavors. It finishes with some pithy bitterness but overall it's nice for Mendoza Chardonnay.","designation":"","title":"Septima 2006 Chardonnay (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a new winery for me. It was started by a veteran of the wine industry on the business side. Not clear exactly where the grapes come from along the sprawling Central Coast, but they're quite ripe in blackberry jam and licorice flavors, although there's a bite of acidity and tannins for balance. Appeals for its directness. Drink now.","designation":"The Puzzle","title":"Ovene 2004 The Puzzle Syrah (Central Coast)"},{"country":"it","description":"There are only a few pockets of vineyard land in it with the correct levels of fog or moisture for noble rot (botrytis) and the Marche is one of them. But 2003 was a sweltering hot year and as a result this Sauvignon-based dessert wine lacks its characteristic intensity. You do get apricot, peach and honey over the wine's lean consistency and there's a slightly sour taste on the finish.","designation":"Maximo Botrytis Cinerea","title":"Umani Ronchi 2003 Maximo Botrytis Cinerea Sauvignon Blanc (Marche)"},{"country":"US","description":"Lots to like in this four-year-old Merlot. It's fully dry and not too fruity, with rich blackberry, sage, anise and oak flavors that are complex and long.

It's a style that is popular and valid, but not to my personal taste. The wine is open and shows plenty of ripe fruit, the tannins are managed well, and the acids provide some much-needed support. This wine is designed for drink-now enjoyment.","designation":"","title":"Whitman Cellars 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"There is just 9% Cabernet in the blend. Smooth and light, with lean flavors showing herb and bark. The tannins have a green edge to them, and perhaps as a result, the vanilla flavors  seem to stick out rather awkwardly.","designation":"","title":"Kestrel 2004 Merlot (Yakima Valley)"},{"country":"ar","description":"A little big and heavy, but that's the style that Kaiken has pushed since arriving on the market a few years ago. This version has baked-fruit aromas backed by lemon peel and espresso, while the palate is rich, dark and syrupy, but also oaky and tannic. Seems to want to offer more than it can deliver. The 14.5% alcohol level tells you that it's a big boy.","designation":"","title":"Kaiken 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"Not particularly Riesling-like, but it's very dry, nice and crisp in punchy acids, and superclean, with spicy citrus and flower flavors.

Best now and for a couple of years.","designation":"","title":"Wild Oak by St. Francis 2004 Syrah (Sonoma County)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is just a little too soft, sweet and ripe, although it retains the classic structure and elegance you demand from the venerable name Eisele.

The vineyard is where Russian River Valley meets Dry Creek Valley, and the wine is bone dry and astringent.

This reflects the tight, somewhat herbal aspect of the vintage, and is still showing a bit of a raw edge to the tannins. But the fruit is sweet and ripe, and the balance impeccable. The flavors mix fresh herb (basil, oregano) and tangy fruit (berry, cherry) with pleasing flashes of leaf and bark.

Absolutely gorgeous Pinot Noir.","designation":"The Noble One","title":"Harmonique 2004 The Noble One Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Fabulous Pinot, about as good as Carneros gets. Sourced from this famous vineyard, it's silky and complex in cherries, sassafras, cola, black raspberry tea, vanilla and cinnamon spices that change and intensify as they roll across the palate.

The tightly packed fruit has it all, from red, blue and black berries on to cherry and cassis. The mid-palate, though quite full, is fleshy and tight.

This wine is, in a word, fabulous. It's enormously attractive in well-oaked cassis, plum, leather, cocoa and white pepper aromas and flavors, but that only begins to describe the complexity. The 4% Viognier seems responsible for the bright intrusion of citrusy acidity. As powerful as it is, the wine never loses sight of balance and elegance.","designation":"Estate","title":"Signorello 2005 Estate Syrah (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":" The Beautiful' lives up to its name and reputation. The aromas shoot from the glass; young, herbal and strikingly peppery. This shows a complexity that is rare outside of fr. The flavors run through the entire length of the palate, a fascinating mix of herb, leaf, earth, and tightly wound berry fruit. It's young and crunchy, thought not fleshy, a wine that is a unique combination of masculine and feminine qualities. It should age well for at least a decade.","designation":"The Beautiful","title":"K Vintners 2005 The Beautiful Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))"},{"country":"au","description":"Unlike most of the Torbreck wines, this is single-vineyard Shiraz, cofermented with a small proportion of Viognier, then aged in barrels previously used for RunRig. Hints of apricot and bacon fat impart beautiful nuance to the blackberry fruit.

Cool-climate notes of cracked pepper elegantly frame waves of blackberry fruit that are fresh and zingy, not cooked or confected.

The parts haven't come together yet, but each is great. Smoky new oak dominates, closely followed by enormously ripe crushed cherry, blackberry, pomegranate, cola and mocha flavors. There's a rich tannin-acid structure, and the sweet, spicy oak reprises on the finish. This big, masculine wine needs time to come together.

The layered mid-palate mixes grape, berry, cherry and plum, sweet and dense. The oak is applied moderately, not dominating as in past Leonetti reserves. It's a profound wine with a gorgeous, entrancing structure that is barely beginning its evolution. Flavors emerge in surprising succession, like spring wildflowers that pop up overnight. A remarkable achievement, and quite possibly the best wine ever made by Leonetti.","designation":"Reserve","title":"Leonetti Cellar 2004 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))"},{"country":"au","description":"This is incredibly dark, concentrated stuff from what may be the oldest (planted in 1886) continuously producing Cabernet vineyard in the world.

One look at the glass shows you why: it's as black as the night sky, with only the rim showing purple/garnet.

This is a serious multigrape wine from the outskirts of RDD that needs a few years in the cellar and then a decanting. With that TLC you will get saucy berry flavors, aggressive spice and tannins, and a dynamic, multifaceted finish.

The alcohol is just over 14%; the wine is ripe, full, with a mix of citrus and green apple flavors, fresh, crisp and penetrating. It could age for another 5C6 years, as per a good village Burgundy.","designation":"","title":"Forgeron 2005 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"With some Carneros fruit blended in, this Sonoma Coast Pinot is a very nice example of cool-climate Sonoma County Pinot Noir.

Finishes long and totally dry.","designation":"Reserve","title":"Ironstone 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Calaveras County)"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows the tangy minerality this cool appellation is known for. The pear, green apple, lime and kiwi fruit has a cold metal, almost chalky edge that lends this wine a Chablisian complexity.
