The 2005 is typically rich and dense, with saturated berry aromas and a strong but balanced oak element.

An affordable shining star for a rising region.","designation":"Altos de Luz n","title":"Bodegas Luz n 2004 Altos de Luz n Red (Jumilla)"},{"country":"US","description":"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine.

The blend is 77% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot.

It's certainly not an ager, so drink up.","designation":"Lust","title":"Michael David 2004 Lust Zinfandel (Lodi)"},{"country":"US","description":"Big, juicy Pinot, dry and fruity, with layers of flavor that change with every sip.

As winemaker Charles Whish says,  It doesn't have to be huge and rich and jammy it needs to have finesse and length.

Maybe it's the acidity that makes the framboise and cherry flavors come alive. Deeper notes of Portobello mushrooms and balsamic suggest moderate aging possibilities. Drink now through 2009.","designation":"","title":"Williams Selyem 2005 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"The wine, from a warm vintage, bursts with fruity charm, but this is a mountain Cab, and while acids are low, you'll find strong tannins.

Finishes with a bit of high-alcohol sweetness.","designation":"","title":"Cuvaison 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)"},{"country":"es","description":"A barrel buster, with huge barrique qualities including char, chocolate and vanilla along with ripe black-fruit aromas.

Hold a couple of years to let it settle, then enjoy.","designation":"Amadis","title":"Rotllan Torra 2003 Amadis Red (Priorat)"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows a beautiful balance of all its parts. The fruit is forwardly ripe, showing cherries, blackberries and rich dark chocolate. But the tannins are firm and supportive, and there's gorgeous acidity that makes the tastebuds sing.

The tannins are substantial but not intrusive; they carry a sensation of rock and graphite.

An exceptional effort.","designation":"","title":":Nota Bene 2004 Syrah (Washington)"},{"country":"US","description":"Soft aromas with a mix of plum, berry, melon and smooth mocha. The scents envelop you and the flavors follow, good, still tight, still firm, still showing a little bit of green tea in the tannins. It's structured well, with a forward, lush, roundness from the Merlot, backed with more assertive tannins and some moist earth flavors from the Cab Franc. Just a hint of coffee comes through at the end.","designation":"Camille","title":"Nicholas Cole Cellars 2004 Camille Red (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry Creek Valley has a natural affinity for Marsanne, and particularly in this balanced vintage. The grapes got ripe in lemon chiffon, peach and honeysuckle flavors, while a clean crispness and minerality add length and palate interest.

This Marsanne explores the outer reaches of the variety's possibilities in California.","designation":"Preston Vineyard","title":"JC Cellars 2005 Preston Vineyard Marsanne (Dry Creek Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is easily the best Bordeaux red wine Ironstone has ever produced, and it's a welcome addition to their portfolio.

Penetrating and complex, its aromas border on the exotic, and there is so much going in the nose that you almost forget to taste it! It captures the unique, lifted, citrus and spice flavors of great Washington Syrah, adding in tangy cinnamon and spiced plum through a long, silky finish.","designation":"","title":"Seven Hills 2004 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))"},{"country":"ar","description":"Frenchman Bernard Magrez is building a global brand via high-quality, smartly named wines such as this (La Bienvenida means The Welcoming in Spanish). But the cuteness ends there; this is serious Malbec with maple, leather and coffee aromas in addition to rich berry scents. The palate is integrated and deep, with lively acidity and tannins but enough cuddly fruit to ensure balance. An excellent Argentinean debut for Monsieur Magrez. Imported by Bernard Magrez USA.","designation":"La Bienvenida","title":"Bernard Magrez 2003 La Bienvenida Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"The final blend was done right before bottling, and this young wine is still knitting itself together.

A floral quality emerges as the wine breathes.","designation":"","title":"Buty 2005 Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Impressive by any standards, this Cab is doubly so for having such great balance from a hot-hot vintage. The acids and tannins are firm, but best of all are the flavors, rich in ripe blackberry, cassis, spicy plum pudding and sweet new oak.

It's delicious and silky, pure varietal, blended from a mix of top vineyards. The wine is a portrait of grace and power, folding its berry and cassis fruit into layers of smoke, toast, ash and char. A suggestion of cigar runs through the finish, and this is a wine that is sure to reward   further cellaring.","designation":"","title":"Abeja 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"es","description":"Powerful is almost an understatement in describing this big boy. The nose starts out fiery and rough before settling to intense. It's all guns blazing on the palate, where tight, racy raspberry fruit holds court. With intense oak and a molten core generating 15.5% alcohol you may want to tread carefully. The ride is not for the weak. Garnacha with Carignan, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon.","designation":"Melis","title":"Cellers Melis 2004 Melis Red (Priorat)"},{"country":"US","description":"Tasted right after bottling, this new release from the high-profile Ste. Michelle/Antinori Red Mountain project may be the finest Col Solare to date. The blend is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, and a splash each of Cabernet Franc and Petite Verdot. Half is Horse Heaven Hills fruit, one quarter Cold Creek and one quarter Wahluke Slope. This is a chewy, muscular wine, dense with plummy fruit, and layered with flavors of earth, soy and black tea. There is a hint of baked, pruney flavor that is restrained enough to add interest rather than detract.","designation":"Red Table Wine","title":"Col Solare 2004 Red Table Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Nice and dry, with smoky oak framing tropical fruit and peach flavors, finishing with Asian spices.

Some may find it lean in fruit, which emphasizes the acidity, but it's a connoisseur's Pinot Noir that gets better as it breathes.

The 2004 is on the right track: the nose is almost impenetrable as it oozes blackberry, tar and fine leather. Meanwhile, the palate is like warm berry compote followed by espresso and dark chocolate. Very rich although not overly complex. Best now with steak or cheese, or hold until 2008.","designation":"Embruix","title":"Vall Llach 2004 Embruix Red (Priorat)"},{"country":"US","description":"From the translucent, see-through ruby color to the intricate cola, cherry and toasted coconut flavors, this delicately powerful in a Burgundian way.

Best now and for a couple of years.","designation":"Manzana Vineyard","title":"Dutton Estate 2005 Manzana Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"I love this Pinot for its dry silkiness, fruit, and the way it's so complex and ever-changing in the glass. Cherries, raspberries, cola, plum skin, mocha and dusty Asian spice are the elementary flavors, amplified by rich oak, but it's not a fruit bomb. It's elegant and complex, exemplifying cool-climate California in a great vintage.","designation":"Grand Detour","title":"Landmark 2005 Grand Detour Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"US","description":"Showing the depth and nuance that mark great Chardonnay, this benefitted from its chilly location in the Petaluma Gap in this hot vintage. The coolness allowed the grapes to achieve maximally ripe tropical fruit, nectarine and peach flavors, while preserving vital acidity.

It all adds up to a totally delicious wine that's ready to drink now.","designation":"Ballard Canyon Reserve","title":"Rusack 2004 Ballard Canyon Reserve Syrah (Santa Barbara County)"},{"country":"es","description":"Deep and dark, this is an excellent kitchen-sink blend (it includes Carignan, Merlot, Cabernet, Garnacha and Syrah).

Outwardly impressive in a modern style.","designation":"Idus","title":"Vall Llach 2004 Idus Red (Priorat)"},{"country":"US","description":"I love the delicate complexity of this Pinot, which is a blend of five vineyards along this famous wine trail. If you want to understand RRV Pinot, and particularly from the stretch they call the Middle Reach, study this wine.

Winemaker Jorge Riccitelli has artfully crafted a bruising but lovable modern Bordeaux blend that hits every note on the head.

For a stud of a wine, it has nuance and character meaning it's not just a fat fruitball. At 70% Malbec with Merlot and Cabernet, this is the ideal wine for a great steak. Just 250 cases produced.","designation":"Perdriel Single Vineyard","title":"Bodega Norton 2003 Perdriel Single Vineyard Red (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is what people who pay a hundred bucks for a Napa Cab expect. Soft, ripe and enormously attractive, it seduces the palate with gooey red and black currant, cherry, blueberry, melted Swiss chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that just pile up and up and go on and on.

Gorgeous now, and should improve for six years before slowly bowing out.","designation":"Silver Pines Vineyard","title":"Tandem 2005 Silver Pines Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain)"},{"country":"US","description":"With this wine Iron Horse takes a giant step toward great Chablis. By that I mean the intense dryness and zesty acidity, and the tangy grip of iron and wet stone that undergirds the Meyer lemon, pineapple zest, honeysuckle, apricot, cinnamon spice and new oak flavors.

Drink now.","designation":"Barossa Wines Unoaked","title":"Grant Burge 2006 Barossa Wines Unoaked Chardonnay (Barossa)"},{"country":"US","description":"A controversial wine. On the plus side are dryness and silky elegance, courtesy of finely ground tannins and crisp acidity, while the cherry and earthy tobacco and truffle flavors are restrained and complex. But then there's the price, which seems excessive. You decide.","designation":"Poggio Alla Pietra Brunello di Sonoma","title":"Petroni 2002 Poggio Alla Pietra Brunello di Sonoma Sangiovese (Sonoma Valley)"},{"country":"it","description":"Here's a wine that faithfully reflects the personality of its origin: Prune, black fruit, plump cherry, leather, coffee, Mediterranean herb  and exotic spice are all components of an intense and intriguing nose.

What's missing here is that defining structure; they've slipped this one into the soft, smooth, generic red category. Sweet fruit, some smoke and a bit more stiffness to the tannins still make this wine a relative standout, but it's lost its edge.","designation":"Proprietor's Reserve","title":"Maryhill 2004 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"fr","description":"Attractive, ripe and full-bodied, this is touched with spice, vanilla and fresh pear flavors.

Don't drink it too cold.","designation":"Reserve","title":"ZD 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Maryhill, frustrating as many of their wines may be, does well by their Cabernets. This is not in the same class as the exceptional 2003, but offers ripe red fruits highlighted with smooth tannins and traces of black tea wrapped around black cherry and blackberry fruit. Ultimately, it falls into the same soft sweet red category as the winery's other wines, but with a bit more definition, snap and style.","designation":"Proprietor's Reserve","title":"Maryhill 2004 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"au","description":"Smells ripe, with scents of honey, baked apples and spice, but also a refreshing lime zest top note.

Definitely a drink-now Chardonnay.","designation":"","title":"Dusted Valley 2005 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"Chardonnay is the sweet spot in the white wine lineup (along with Riesling, of course). Big, bright and buttery, with plenty of legit oak highlights none of this fake vanilla or microwave popcorn excess. Bacon fat, smoke and toast match the big, round, rich fruit.","designation":"Grand Estates","title":"Columbia Crest 2004 Grand Estates Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"ar","description":"Quite earthy and ripe, as tree bark, leather and prune make up the bouquet.

Not overly complex but very good and straightforward.","designation":"","title":"Aleph 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Here's a nice wine that pushes the right buttons while not raising any red flags. Raspberry and vanilla flavors are solid and pleasing, while the medium-weight palate features depth and balance. This is not the richest, most overpowering Malbec you'll find, but it comes from 75-year-old vines and its virtues far outdistance its faults.","designation":"Reserve Organic","title":"Caligiore 2005 Reserve Organic Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Overt oak is the first thing you encounter on the nose, but underneath the heavy wood covering is a polished and sincere wine. The mouth is lively and juicy, with commendable plum and raspberry flavors. And while the finish is sort of basic in its vanilla and chocolate character, it has a nice feel to it. A wine with virtues but maybe a touch too much new oak.","designation":"Q","title":"Zuccardi 2004 Q Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"at","description":"Classic Riesling, all fresh currants and stone fruits with a touch of spice, finishing full and rich.

Snappy and crisply defined, this sharp-edged wine opens with tight berry flavors, some chalky acids, and grainy, stony tannins. It shows less flesh than the other reds, more acid, and a stiffness to the tannins. After extensive airing the vanilla flavors come out, along with an interesting spice. The fruit is clean and ripe, and the balance, except possibly for the chalky acids, is right on.","designation":"Abbinare","title":":Nota Bene 2004 Abbinare Red (Washington)"},{"country":"at","description":"Loess soil, fine silt derived from glacial deposits, is the core characteristic of the Wagram vineyards. With Riesling's ability to take its varietal flavor from the soil, this wine shows richness and opulence, while still keeping close to fresh apples and spice flavors. It's young, but already drinkable.","designation":"Vom Gelben L?ss","title":"Josef Ehmoser 2006 Vom Gelben L?ss Riesling (Donauland)"},{"country":"au","description":"This full-bodied wine could use a touch more lushness in the midpalate to help carry its assertive flavors of blackberries and chocolate. Mouthwatering fruit on the finish is backed by firm tannins, suggesting at least a few years of cellaring potential. Would go nicely with grilled steak. Multiple U.S. Importers.","designation":"The Rascal","title":"Hugh Hamilton 2005 The Rascal Shiraz (McLaren Vale)"},{"country":"US","description":"For the first time this popular blend contains no Yakima Valley fruit. The savvy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah works like a charm. Outside of the Ste.

It's elegant, somewhat European in style, with light, polished fruit flavors of plum, berry and cherry.","designation":"CMS","title":"Hedges 2005 CMS Red (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"ar","description":"Starts out sort of soft and shy, with modest red-fruit aromas. In the mouth, raspberry and cherry flavors get a quick lift from grabby, firm tannins. And by the time this baby hits its groove you're onto a finish defined by a starchy feel and long-lasting Cabernet essence. Airing is this wine's best friend; decant or drink over time.","designation":"Luigi Bosca Reserva","title":"Luigi Bosca 2004 Luigi Bosca Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"This soft, ripe wine erupts with blackberry, raspberry, cherry jam and milk chocolate flavors.
