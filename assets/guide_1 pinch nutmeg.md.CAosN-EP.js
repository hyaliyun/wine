For the seasoning: Combine the garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, salt and cayenne. For the surf and turf: Rub 1 tablespoon of the butter over the tenderloin then sprinkle lightly with the Cajun seasoning. Place in the oven for approximately 25 to 30 minutes. After about 25 minutes check the tenderloin; you want a temperature of 120 to 125 degrees F on a meat thermometer for medium rare to rare. Remove the tenderloin from the oven and rest it for 10 to 15 minutes. In another skillet, add 3 tablespoons of the butter and heat to melt. Throw in the onions, green peppers and red peppers, then cook until golden brown and colored, but still somewhat crisp, a couple of minutes. Add the garlic and cook around for 30 to 45 seconds. Remove the veggies to a plate. Heat the same skillet over high heat, and then pour in the wine and chicken broth. Cook on high for 3 to 5 minutes, scraping the bottom of the skillet to deglaze. Reduce the heat to medium-low heat and pour in the cream, stirring or whisking constantly. Cook the sauce until the cream starts to thicken the mixture, a few minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Add the cooked vegetables to the sauce, making sure to include all the juices that have drained onto the plate. Stir and cook until the mixture is bubbly and hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Next add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to a skillet and melt the butter over high heat. Throw the shrimp into the skillet and sprinkle them lightly with some of the remaining Cajun seasoning. Cook the shrimp until opaque and deep golden brown with some dark brown parts. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Serve the veggies and shrimp in their skillets and the tenderloin on a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 74302,&quot;Storm&#39;s Cordon Bleu Burger Butter 4 (2 1/2 ounces) lean, pure-beef hamburger patties 2 large hamburger buns Mayonnaise 4 tomato slices Sliced lettuce 4 (1-ounce) slices smoked ham 2 (1-ounce) slices mild cheddar cheese Instructions: You&#39;ll need a sharp knife, a sturdy metal burger turner and 2 large, heavy skillets (well-seasoned cast iron works very well; Teflon will not work.) Preheat the first skillet over medium-high heat. The second skillet should be preheated to be slightly less hot. Smear the inside of the second skillet with a thin coat of butter. When the first skillet is hot enough to instantly sizzle a small test piece of burger, place the 4 patties inside. Set the buns, crust side up, in the second skillet. Wait 30 seconds or so, then turn the patties and press them down so they spread a bit and stick to the skillet surface. Wait 2 minutes, then remove the lower halves of the buns and coat the toasted surface with mayonnaise. Add 2 slices of tomato and then cover tomato with sliced lettuce. Set aside. When the patties are almost done to your taste, turn them a second time, let them cook a few more seconds until you think they&#39;re just right, then remove from the pan. You&#39;re through cooking. Next step is to assemble the whole thing. Place 1 beef patty on top the dressed lower half of the hamburger bun. Then stack in this order: 1 slice of ham, 1 slice of cheese, a second slice of ham, a second beef patty, and finally the top half of the hamburger bun. In a few seconds, the heat from the hamburger patties should melt the cheese and weld the entire assembly into 1/2 pound of heaven on a bun.

Butter and flour the bundt pan. Sift the flour, cocoa, and salt into a medium bowl. Whisk the eggs, yolks, vanilla, and espresso powder together in a bowl and set aside. In a heavy-duty mixer, beat the butter with the paddle attachment, on medium speed for 1 minute, or until smooth. Gradually pour in the sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, until the butter begins to lighten, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and beat, on medium-high, until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes more. Adjust the mixer&#39;s speed to its lowest setting. Add 1/2 of the flour mixture and mix until completely absorbed before adding the rest. Scrape down the sides of the mixer then beat on medium-high for 30 seconds more. Adjust again to low speed and add half the egg mixture, mix until blended and smooth. Add the remaining egg mixture and beat until almost blended. Remove the bowl from the mixer, and fold in the chocolate by hand. Take care not to over mix the batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan, on a rack for 10 minutes. Turn the cake out of the pan, and cool right side up on a rack. If not serving the same day, wrap in plastic wrap and store at room temperature. Glaze just before serving. Cake can be frozen for 1 month. For the glaze: Put all the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue heat until completely melted, about 1 minute more. Remove from the microwave and whisk until fully combined, smooth and glossy. While warm, pour glaze over cooled cake and do not spread.

In a large bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Add the cubed brioche, truffle peelings, and chopped thyme to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.<br> In a skillet over medium-high heat, saute the morels, button, and oyster mushrooms with the shallots for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add 1/2 the Gruyere cheese to the brioche mixture, then add the mushroom- shallot mixture to brioche and cheese mixture.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the bread pudding mixture in an oven-proof baking dish. Add the remaining cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Bake for 45 minutes or until puffed and golden brown.<br> For the poached eggs: Fill a saucepan with 3-inches cold water, add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil.<br> As the water reaches the boiling point, reduce the heat and allow the water to simmer.<br> Add 1 tablespoon vinegar to the water. Swirl the water around.<br> Break the eggs into a small plate or bowl and gently slide it into the water with care, holding the plate as near to the water as possible before allowing the egg to slowly slip into the water.<br> Once the eggs are in the water, you can help shape it using a spoon or spatula. Let the eggs cook for 3 to 3 1/2 minutes, allowing for the size of the egg and the preferred doneness of the egg yolks.<br> Remove each egg with a slotted spoon and drain for a few seconds on kitchen paper. Trim any stringy or dangling bits with a knife or scissors, if you wish.<br> Serve the poached egg on top of the truffle bread and garnish with a little bit of the microgreens dressed with olive oil and salt and pepper.<br> For your first attempt at preparing poached eggs, you may want to carefully break each egg onto a small cup, ramekin, plate or bowl before adding it to the water.<br> A perfectly poached egg has a lovely rounded shape, a soft yet firm white and a deliciously runny yolk. Time is of the essence when it comes to poaching eggs.<br> Problems will most definitely arise if the eggs are cooked at a temperature that is too high, if the eggs are not very fresh or if there is not enough water in the saucepan.<br> Use a saucepan or a deep frying pan, which allows you to fill it with about 3-inches of water. The eggs should be covered with water during cooking and the 3-inch depth of water ensures that the eggs will not stick to the pan.<br> Poached eggs must be cooked in water that is very gently bubbling or simmering. The water is first brought to the boil and then by turning the heat down on the cooker, is allowed to gently simmer. The eggs are carefully added to the pan at this point. If the water is boiling too fiercely, the eggs will be forced to move around too much, causing them to break up and lose their shape. A gentle simmer allows the egg to sit in one place throughout cooking and cook nicely.<br> By using the freshest eggs possible, eggs that are less than 4 days old, you are more likely to achieve a perfectly poached egg that keeps its shape. With a fresh egg, the white will stay close to the yolk and should not spread out thinly.<br> Vinegar should be added to the water as it begins to boil, as this will help the egg white to coagulate more quickly and form a neat and compact shape. Without the vinegar, disaster may occur. Use about 1 tablespoon vinegar for each pint of water. Bear in mind that the vinegar may slightly flavor the eggs, so do not use too much or a vinegar that is too strong, if you are not so keen on a vinegary tasting eggs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 74311,&quot;Classic Cranberry Sauce 1 pound cranberries, thawed if frozen 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 wide strips lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2 wide strips orange zest, plus 2 tablespoons orange juice Instructions: Combine the cranberries, sugar, 1 1/2 cups water and the lemon and orange zest and juice in a medium saucepan.

Cool completely. Syrup should be thick but still liquid when cooled. Put a cooling rack onto a parchment lined sheet pan to catch any drips. Using a small clean paint brush, paint a swirl line on half each meringue. Arrange them on cooling rack and let them dry overnight. Carefully pile the meringues into a large wide lipped vase or centerpiece of your choice. Syrup will still be sticky on meringues so be careful not to touch it or over handle the meringues. &quot;,&quot;[Port wine, Moscato, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 74325,&quot;Pear Tart 2 cups flour Pinch salt 1/3 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed 11 tablespoons cold butter (do not use margarine) 2 egg yolks, lightly beaten with a fork 10 to 12 seckle pears or 6-7 bosc pears, peeled, cut in quarters and then into 2 or 3 lengthwise slices 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/2 cup currants 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/3 to 1/2 cup white sugar, depending on the sweetness of the pears 2 tablespoons butter 4 tablespoons sugar Instructions: Place the currants in a small saucepan.

Put the pieces skin-side up on a wire-racked roasting pan and thoroughly rub the kosher salt under and over the skin. Leave lightly covered in the fridge for 2 days, but as all dry-brining methods go, uncover for the last 6 to 8 hours to \\dry out\\ the skin. When ready to roast, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Put the turkey pieces skin-side up in the roasting pan (no rack), then arrange the celery, onions, herbs and garlic in between the pieces. Season with freshly cracked pepper and dot everything, especially the turkey skin, with tablespoon-size pats of butter. Roast the turkey for 30 minutes, then lower the temperature to 325 degrees F and continue to cook until the breast registers 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, another 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let rest, uncovered, for at least 20 minutes before serving.

Cut into rectangles, about 1 1/2 by 3 inches each, or cut into other shapes. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate chips in a double boiler or in the microwave until smooth. Set a rack on a sheet of parchment paper or on a baking sheet. Using two forks, dip each piece of marzipan in the chocolate to cover completely. Transfer to the rack and decorate with pistachios and dried rose petals. Allow to set until firm, about 30 minutes. In a food processor, blend the nuts until they\\u2019re finely ground and just starting to clump together (but don\\u2019t over-blend them or you\\u2019ll end up with nut butter). Add the confectioners\\u2019 sugar, extract, rosewater (if using) and salt; pulse to combine. With the motor running, drizzle in the corn syrup and blend to form a dough. It may still look crumbly in the food processor, but if you squeeze it in your hand, it should stick together. (You may find that you don\\u2019t need all of the corn syrup.)

Whisk to combine. In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, oil and eggs. Beat to mix and pour into the dry ingredients. Stir to form a dough. Knead either in the stand mixer or by hand on a floured surface, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking, until smooth and just slightly sticky, 7 to 10 minutes. Grease the inside of a large clean bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover with a towel and let the dough rise until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. For the baking soda bath: While the dough is rising, bake the baking soda. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Spread the baking soda out on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 1 hour. Let it cool and set it aside (even though the baked baking soda isn&#39;t as strong as lye, it could potentially irritate your skin, so avoid touching it once it&#39;s out of the oven). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Split the dough into 8 equal portions and keep it covered when you&#39;re not working with it. Working with one piece of dough at a time, stretch it into a ball by tucking the top surface under and pinching to seal, then place it on a baking sheet. Continue with the remaining dough pieces, placing them 1 1/2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Cover and let rise for 20 more minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Place the baked baking soda in a large bowl or casserole dish and add 2 cups (472 grams) of water. Stir it to dissolve the baking soda. (I&#39;ve never been able to get all of it to dissolve, so a few baking soda chunks are totally ok as long as they don&#39;t stick to the dough.) For the topping: Using gloved hands or tongs and working in batches, immerse the rolls in the baking soda bath for about 2 minutes on both sides. Pat them dry with a paper towel and place them back on the baking sheet. Brush with the egg wash and sprinkle with coarse pretzel salt. Cut 2 shallow slits in an X shape on top and bake until golden brown; begin checking for doneness at 16 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 74339,&quot;Blended Cherry Mojitos 1 pound bag frozen pitted cherries 2 cups crushed ice, plus extra to serve 1/2 cup packed fresh mint leaves 1/3 cup fresh lime juice (about 3 limes) 1 cup citrus flavored rum 1 2/3 cups Lime Simple Syrup, recipe follows Lime wedges and fresh cherries, for garnish 2 cups sugar 1 cup water 3 limes, zested Instructions: Place the frozen cherries, crushed ice, mint leaves, lime juice, rum, and simple syrup in a blender.

Tear the bread into small pieces and scatter in the dish. In a large measuring cup or small bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar until light. Add the milk and vanilla and whisk well. Pour over the bread evenly. Tamp down the bread with a spoon or spatula to submerge each piece in egg mixture. Cover with foil, gently pressing down so the foil is right on the surface of the mixture. Refrigerate overnight. The next morning, remove the dish and slide it into a cold oven with the foil on. Turn oven on to 350 degrees F. After 25 minutes, gently pull off and discard the foil. Continue to bake until pudding is puffed and golden brown, about 20 more minutes. In the meantime, prepare the spiced pears: melt butter in a wide frying pan (preferably nonstick) over medium-high heat then add the pears. Stir until pears are coated well with butter, then sprinkle sugar, cinnamon, and a good pinch of fresh nutmeg; continue to cook about 3 minutes until pears begin to soften.

Stir to blend until it forms a paste. Place the prime rib in the roasting pan (fitted with a rack) you intend to cook it in. Place the roast, fat side up, and spread the peppercorn paste over the whole top. If marinating, refrigerate overnight. For the Yorkshire pudding: In a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt. Stir to blend. Whisk in the eggs, one by one, and then the water. Refrigerate. For the prime rib: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the prime rib from the refrigerator about a half hour before cooking. This will allow the meat to come closer to room temperature and help the meat cook more evenly. Season the roast with salt. When the oven is hot, place the meat in the center of the oven. Allow it to cook 12 to 15 minutes per pound (2 1/2 to 3 hours). Cook until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 135 degrees F. When the roast is close to finished, remove the Yorkshire pudding mixture from the refrigerator to allow it to come close to room temperature. Then, remove the pan from the oven and allow the meat to rest at least 20 minutes before slicing. To finish the Yorkshire pudding: Raise the temperature of the oven to 400 degrees F and place the baking dish for the Yorkshire pudding inside. Whisk all of the warm milk and some of the melted butter into the batter. When the baking dish is hot, carefully remove it from the oven and quickly add the remaining melted butter to the dish. Pour the batter over the butter and place the dish in the center of the oven. Bake in the oven until golden brown and puffy, 30 minutes.

If you are using larger potatoes, cut them into quarters, then cut those half-moons in half--the aim is to end up with uniform sized potato pieces that are one-half to no more than 3/4 of an inch on any side. Place the potato pieces into the bowl with the shallots.</li><li>Pour the balsamic vinegar and the olive oil over the potatoes and shallots.

I like my potatoes pretty dark, so that the balsamic vinegar gets really crunchy on the outsides of the potatoes -if you don?t want them quite so dark, either take them out earlier at the 30 minute mark, or set the oven to 375 degrees F and roast for the full time. Serve hot or at room temperature. The potatoes can be reheated in the oven (400 degrees F for 10 minutes) or in a wrapping of heavy duty aluminum foil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 74352,&quot;Grilled Strawberries Ala Mode Easy \\Mock\\ Vanilla Ice Cream, recipe follows 8 large strawberries, whole 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon sugar substitute (recommended: Splenda) 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup sugar substitute (recommended: Splenda) 1 1/2 teaspoons no sugar added vanilla extract 2 tablespoons whole milk ricotta cheese Instructions: Preheat grill to high. Prepare mock ice cream as directed. In a bowl, coat strawberries with the balsamic vinegar and sugar substitute. Place strawberries on the hot grill to mark, only about 1 or 2 minutes. Remove from heat and serve a couple grilled berries in the Champagne glass with the \\mock\\ vanilla ice cream. Cook&#39;s Note: Garnish with low carb whipped cream, toasted almonds, a strawberry fan, and a sprig of fresh mint, if desired. With an electric mixer on high, whip the heavy cream in a bowl just until frothy. Add in the sugar substitute, vanilla, and ricotta cheese, and continue to whip on high until peaks form. Be careful not to over-whip, or cream will break. Using a 3-ounce ice cream scoop, place one scoop in each Champagne glass.

Instructions: For the calzone dough: In a small bowl, combine the yeast and sugar and whisk together with the warm water. Let sit for 15 minutes; when the water looks frothy and smells very yeasty, it&#39;s ready. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the flours and salt. Pour in the yeast-water mixture and the olive oil. Mix to combine on medium speed. When a dough ball has formed, continue to knead until the dough is tight and not at all sticky, 5 to 6 minutes. Lightly oil a mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl and cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm place to let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down and let it rise again for 30 to 40 minutes. During the last rise, make the filling. For the broccoli rabe and sausage filling: Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil and prepare a well-salted ice bath. Toss the broccoli rabe in the boiling water, swish around and then remove to the ice bath. Let cool and then coarsely chop. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring to a medium heat. Add in the sausage and chop it up with the edge of large kitchen spoon. Cook until the sausage is brown and crumbled. Stir in the broccoli rabe and remove from the heat. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and stir in the ricotta and Parmesan. Taste to make sure it is delicious and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To assemble: Once the dough is rested, divide the dough into nine 2-inch balls. (Save 3 of the balls for another purpose.) On a lightly floured work surface, roll the 6 dough balls into 8-inch circles that are about 1/4-inch thick. Place about 3/4 cup of the filling on the bottom half of a dough circle. Brush the bottom half edge of the circle with the egg wash. Fold the top half of the circle over to ALMOST meet the bottom edge of the dough. Fold the bottom edge of the dough over the top edge and crimp it shut. Brush the top of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat this process with rest of the dough and filling. Place the filled calzones on sheet trays and bake for 30 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature with tomato sauce if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 74354,&quot;Sauteed Tenderloin Steaks with Wine Sauce Two 1 1/4-inch thick (8 ounces weight) tenderloin steaks, top loin center cut 1 tablespoon olive oil Tablespoon or so finely sliced scallion<br> 1/2 cup good red wine 1 tablespoon butter Minced parsley or chopped chives Salt and pepper Instructions: Trim steaks of excess fat and pat dry with towels; brush them lightly with some olive oil and lightly oil a nonstick pan.

Spread the walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer and bake until lightly toasted, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, matcha and salt in a bowl. Beat the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla and egg yolk. Add the flour mixture in 3 batches, beating after each until just incorporated. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and make sure the dough is evenly mixed. Roll the dough into about thirty-two 1-inch balls, making them as smooth and even as you can, and place on the prepared baking sheet. Use the back of a round teaspoon measuring spoon to flatten the cookies and make an indentation in the center of each ball (rearrange the cookies as necessary so that they fit; they don&#39;t spread out too much, so about 1/2 inch of space between them is sufficient). If making the indentation causes a large crack, repair the crack with your fingers or re-roll the cookie and try again. Refrigerate the cookies until firm, about 15 minutes. Bake the cookies until the undersides are light golden brown and the tops puffed and set, about 11 minutes. Remove the cookies and use the teaspoon measuring spoon to re-make the indentations that have puffed up during baking. Bake the cookies for 1 minute more, then cool on the baking sheet. For the chocolate filling: Put the chocolate chips in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Put the cream, butter and corn syrup in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until steaming hot. Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate chips and let stand 5 minutes, then stir the mixture with a rubber spatula until smooth. If the chocolate chips do not completely melt, microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until melted and smooth. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of chocolate into the well of each cookie, then lightly press a toasted walnut half into each. Let stand until the chocolate sets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 74356,&quot;Zucchini Gratin with Pistachio Pesto 4 zucchini, tops trimmed, sliced lengthwise 1/4-inch thick 1 Vidalia onion, sliced into thin rings 1/2 cup Pistachio Pesto, recipe follows 2 to 3 ripe tomatoes, thinly sliced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs 1/2 cup unsalted pistachios, crushed in a mortar and pestle, for garnish 1/2 cup goat cheese 8 cups fresh basil leaves, washed and dried 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil 3/4 cup unsalted pistachios, toasted and crushed in a mortar and pestle 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 2 cloves garlic Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Place the one-third of the zucchini slices inside a baking dish.

Put the white chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave at 50 percent power for 30 second intervals, stirring after each, until it is completely smooth. Melt the semisweet chocolate in a small bowl in the microwave at 50 percent power in 15 second intervals, stirring after each until it is completely smooth. Transfer to a piping bag with a small plain tip (#2 or #3). (Alternatively, transfer to a resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner.) Spoon 12 ovals of white chocolate onto the parchment for the melted snowman bodies, leaving several tablespoons of white chocolate behind in the bowl. Top each oval with a truffle for a head. (If the truffle has a flatter side, attach it facing up for the hat decoration option, so the hat will adhere. If you are making the earmuff option, place the more rounded side up.) For the hat decoration: Cut each licorice gumdrop in half crosswise. Lay the flat disc-shaped piece on a flat surface and use the heel of your hand to flatten it into a larger disc shape. Attach the other half of the licorice back onto each using the sticky sides to adhere to each other. Dip the bottom of the licorice candies in the reserved white chocolate and attach to the tops of the truffles for hats. For the earmuff decoration: Spread white chocolate on the rope licorice and attach to the truffles for earmuff headbands. Dot white chocolate onto the mini candy-coated chocolates and attach to the sides of the truffles to make the earmuffs. For the body and face decoration: Stick the pretzel pieces into the white chocolate for arms and arrange some of the mini candy-coated chocolates down the center for buttons. With scissors, cut the gummy belts in half lengthwise, trim the ends to make scarves and set aside. Spread a little white chocolate on the orange candies and attach for noses, holding in place until the chocolate hardens. Pipe the semisweet chocolate on for the eyes and mouth.

Stir in the Berbere Spice Blend and 1/2 teaspoon salt. The sauce will be a little runny but will thicken as it sits. (This makes more awaze than you\\u2019ll need for the recipe, but it keeps for at least a week in the fridge and is wonderful on roasted meats or vegetables or stirred into cooked grains. If it is too thick once refrigerated, stir in a few teaspoons of hot water.) For the avocado toast with soft-boiled eggs: Put the eggs in a small saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a simmer and reduce the heat to the lowest setting. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes (6 will produce set whites with a runny yolk, at 7 minutes the yolk will be almost set but still a bit jammy in the center), then transfer to an ice bath to cool. Peel and halve the eggs. Toast the rye bread and brush one side with ghee or butter. Put an avocado half on each slice of toast. Mash coarsely with a fork and season with salt.

Line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper. Set aside. Unfold or unroll one sheet of the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Gently roll with a rolling pin until each side is increased by about 1/2-inch. Place the pastry on the prepared baking sheet and brush the pastry from edge to edge with prepared egg wash. Combine the mustard, apricot jam and a generous amount of black pepper in a small bowl, and spread over the egg wash, leaving about an inch border between the mustard and the edge of pastry. Place the ham evenly over the mustard and then evenly spread the cheese over the ham. Roll out the second piece of puff pastry as the first, increasing the size by about 1/2-inch on each side. Gently place it on top of the ham and cheese and press the edges together with your fingers. Gently fold about 1/2-inch of the edges over, creating a thick crust. Press the edges with the tines of a fork. Dip the fork in flour if it sticks to the puff pastry during pressing. Lightly brush a layer of egg wash over the top and edges of the pie. Cut a few small slits into the top of the pie and bake until cooked through and golden brown, 30 minutes. For the greens: Whisk together the vinegar and jam in a small bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified. Put the greens in large bowl, toss with the vinaigrette, divide among the plates and top with the almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 74366,&quot;Baked Swordfish with Tapenade and Orange 4 (6-ounce) swordfish steaks (about 3/4-inch thick) (or another firm fleshed fish such as: pacific halibut or mackerel) Salt and pepper 1/2 cup green tapenade (available at specialty food stores) 1 orange, juiced 1/4 cup dry white wine 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter For garnish: orange slices and minced parsley Accompaniment, if desired: Tomatoes Provencale, recipe follows 4 to 6 firm, ripe plum tomatoes Salt 1 clove garlic, minced 2 tablespoons minced shallots 3 tablespoons minced fresh basil 1 tablespoon fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1 tablespoon oregano 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup olive oil 1/2 cup dry white bread crumbs Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place swordfish steaks in large shallow baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Spread tapenade on top of steaks. Pour orange juice and wine over and around the fish and cover with foil. Bake until fish is just cooked through, and still opaque, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the baking pan from oven and transfer fish to platter. Pour remaining liquid into a small saucepan and reduce slightly. Whisk in butter and spoon sauce over fish. Garnish with orange slices and minced parsley. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut the tomatoes in half, crosswise. With your index finger poke out the seeds from the cavities. Sprinkle the halves lightly with salt and put the tomato upside down on a rack to drain for 20 minutes or more. Blend all of the remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl. Correct the seasoning. Sprinkle the insides of each tomato half with black pepper, then fill with 1 or 2 spoonfuls of the stuffing. Sprinkle with a few drops of olive oil. Arrange the tomatoes in the oiled baking dish. They can be prepared up to this point several hours ahead. Place the baking dish in the upper third of the preheated oven and bake the tomatoes until tender but still holding their shape, 10 to 15 minutes. The bread crumb filling should be lightly browned. 4 servings<br> Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 15 minutes Inactive prep time: 20 minutes &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 74367,&quot;Papaya and Raisin Bread 1/2 cup raisins 1/2 cup dark rum 3/4 cup sugar 1/3 cup vegetable oil 2 large eggs 2/3 cup milk 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 3/4 cups flour 3/4 cup coarsely chopped ripe papaya Butter, for preparing pan Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the raisins with the rum and leave to macerate for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350/. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, oil, and eggs. Beat together until blended. Whisk in the milk, then add the baking soda, salt, and flour and blend thoroughly.

Juice the oranges into the container. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the container, then add the pod. Stir in the wine, vodka and sugar. You can use the wine for poaching the shrimp right away or, ideally, cover with the lid and set aside in a cool, dark place, stirring once a week, for 2 to 4 weeks. (The wine will keep for up to 2 months.) Prepare the shrimp: Combine 1 1/2 cups orange wine with the olive oil, thyme, red pepper flakes, a generous pinch of salt and 1/2 cup water in a large skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, then add the shrimp, cover and poach 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the shrimp, cover and cook until pink, 2 to 3 more minutes. Transfer the shrimp to a serving dish. Boil the poaching liquid for 10 minutes, drizzle some over the shrimp and serve the rest on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 74369,&quot;Tuile Cookie Ice Cream Cones 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup powdered sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 3 large egg whites, lightly whisked 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and set aside. In a bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Whisk in the egg whites, butter, and vanilla until well combined. Let the batter sit at room temperature for 45 minutes. If using later, cover the surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Drop rounded tablespoons of the batter about 6 inches apart onto the baking sheet. Spread the batter with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon into 5 or 6-inch rounds. Bake in the middle of the oven until golden and lightly brown around the edges, about 6 to 8 minutes. To shape, gently loosen a cookie from the baking sheet with an offset spatula, then turn it over so the smooth side is facing up. Roll the cookie into a cone and hold the bottom of the cone together for several seconds until cookie holds its shape. Carefully slip the cone into a Champagne flute and let it cool completely. Shape the remaining cookies. If the cookies become too brittle to roll, return the baking sheet to the oven for a few seconds to soften. Make and shape more cookies with the remaining batter. Chef&#39;s Note: If the bottoms of the cones do not close tightly, fill them with peanut butter, chopped candy, or melted chocolate that has been cooled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74370,&quot;Lemon Brown Sugar Bread Pudding 1 loaf Challah bread, cut into 2-inch dice 6 eggs, beaten 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup light brown sugar, loosely packed 2 lemons, zested 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Whipped cream, for garnish 1/2 cup blueberries, for garnish Powdered sugar, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the potato slices, artichokes, olives, rosemary, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Spread the mixture evenly on a parchment-lined baking sheet; bake until the vegetables are tender and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Brush the fish with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and set the fish on top of the vegetables. Return to the oven and continue baking until the fish is opaque and the vegetables are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Drizzle the fish with the lemon juice and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 74372,&quot;Olive Oil Braised Potatoes 2 medium Idaho potatoes, washed, skin on, cut into 1/2-inch slices Gray salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 6 sprigs fresh thyme 4 garlic cloves Instructions: Preheat the grill. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Put the potato slices on the hot grill and cook for about 2 minutes on each side to mark them. Remove from the grill and place them in a single layer in a baking pan. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Add enough olive oil to reach 1/3 up the sides of the potatoes. Turn the potatoes over to coat with the oil. Scatter the thyme and garlic cloves over the potatoes, sprinkle with a little more salt, if desired, and place in the oven. After about 15 to 20 minutes, the potatoes will be tender. Remove from the oven and let them cool in the oil. Serve at room temperature. Chef&#39;s notes: Using a high quality olive oil will impart its flavor to the potato. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 74373,&quot;Squashed Cherry Tomato and Smashed Olive Bruscetta 2 handfuls cherry tomatoes 1 handful black olives 4 to 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon dried oregano A drizzle herb vinegar 1 dried cl A handful fresh basil Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 ciabatta or other rustic bread, cut into thick slices 1/2 clove garlic 4 boccacini Parmesan, for shaving Instructions: This is probably the quickest salad or bruschetta I make, but no less tasty for that. Very few ingredients, simple flavors, complete sense. Try to make use of the wider range of cherry tomatoes available now: yellow, tige, and plum cherry tomatoes for instance. And, as I always say, it&#39;s much better, taste-wise, to buy olives with their stones still in than without. Trust me. Simply squash your tomatoes into a bowl. I always have to put one hand over the tomatoes as I do this as juice and pips go everywhere (generally on me). You can be as rough with the tomatoes as you like, as the salad looks much better rough and rustic than perfect and pretty. Then, gently smash the olives on a board with a hard object, like a cup or a rolling-pin. Remove the stones, throw the olives in with the tomatoes, and toss together. Add a few glugs of oil, the oregano, a drizzle of vinegar, crumbled cl, and rip in the basil. Season, to taste, and that&#39;s your salad. Griddle or toast the slices of bread and rub with the garlic clove, pile on the tomatoes, and rip the mozzarella and lay over the top drizzle with a little bit more oil and finish with shaves of Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 74374,&quot;Sciue Sciue Titina&#39;s Move It!

Add 2 to 3 tablespoons salt and the spaghetti and cook until it still offers considerable resistance to the tooth, about three quarters of the cooking time. While the pasta is cooking, saute the garlic cloves and hot pepper in the oil over moderate heat in a large nonstick skillet. When the garlic barely begins to color add the cherry tomatoes and season lightly with the sea salt. Cook over high heat until the tomatoes lose their shape. Drain the spaghetti and add it to the skillet along with 1 cup of pasta cooking water. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, to amalgamate the tomatoes and pasta and to complete cooking. Add more pasta water if the sauce gets too dry.

F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the water, peanut butter, molasses and canola oil in the bowl of a stand mixer. Slowly add the flour and mix on low speed until all the ingredients are combined and a dough forms. Turn out the dough onto a clean surface and roll out to a 3/8-inch thickness. Cut out shapes with a squirrel cookie cutter; use a toothpick to make the eyes and a knife to score the arms and legs. Place the cutouts scored-side down on the baking sheet. Place a second baking sheet on top to prevent air bubbles from forming. Bake 15 minutes, then remove the top baking sheet, flip the cutouts and continue baking, uncovered, until just golden and slightly firm, 5 to 10 more minutes. Turn off the oven but keep the treats in the oven to dry, 2 hours (this will allow all the moisture to evaporate completely).

In a medium bowl, add the scallions, chives, olive oil, basil, parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, lime zest, lime juice, mustard, red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Stir to combine and set aside. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil onto one side of the steak and use a silicone brush to spread it all over the steak. Sprinkle with a nice pinch of kosher salt and pepper. Transfer the meat to the grill pan, seasoning side down. Drizzle the other side of the steak with a small amount of olive oil and once again brush it to cover and sprinkle with salt and pepper. For medium-rare, cook the steak until the internal temperature is 135 degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove the steak to a plate and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

Coat two 8-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper rounds. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a medium bowl and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the hot coffee and semisweet chocolate. Allow the coffee to melt the chocolate, then cool the mixture to warm, not hot. Stir to blend the chocolate into the coffee. Add the buttermilk and vanilla and stir again. Set aside. Whisk together the oil, eggs and egg yolk in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium high, about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low and add the coffee mixture. Gradually add the flour mixture and mix on low until well blended, about 1 minute. Give the batter a 20-second burst on medium-high speed. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans and bake on the center rack until a toothpick inserted into the centers of the cakes comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool for about 30 minutes in the pans, then remove from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack. Carefully double-wrap the cooled cakes in plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours or until you are ready to decorate. For the buttercream: Place the malted milk balls in a resealable bag and seal. Break the candies into small chunks with the back of a spoon and set aside. Beat the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium speed until nice and smooth, about 1 minute. On low speed, gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar until fully incorporated. Add the malted milk powder, vanilla and salt. Beat on medium speed until well combined, 2 minutes. (For a firmer buttercream, add a little more confectioners&#39; sugar. For a softer buttercream, add a little water a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.) In a small bowl, mix a quarter of the buttercream with the crushed malted milk balls. Store in airtight containers until ready to use. To assemble the cake: Remove the plastic wrap from the cakes. Using a long serrated knife, carefully cut off the domed sections of each layer of cake. (Discard the scraps or give to eager family and friends.) Place one layer of the cake on a plate or disposable cardboard cake circle. Using a medium-size offset spatula, spread about a 1/2-inch layer of the buttercream with candy pieces onto the top of the cake layer, leaving about half an inch of space between the buttercream and the edge of the cake. Carefully place the other layer on top of the one with the candy buttercream. Using the plain buttercream (without candy pieces), spread a thin layer of buttercream all the way around the entire cake. Chill the cake for about 30 minutes. This will act as a crumb coat and lock in all of the loose crumbs before adding the final layer of icing. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and, using your spatula, spread another layer of buttercream on the sides and top of the cake. Crush additional malted milk candies and sprinkle on top of the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 74381,&quot;Garlic-Stuffed Roast Beef for Po&#39;boys 16 ounces peeled California garlic 5 pounds choice rump roast<br> 2 tablespoons salt<br> 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 quart water<br> Serving suggestion: Leidenheimer French Bread (or any French bread), cut into 6-inch or 10-inch rolls, split and toasted; mayonnaise, lettuce, dill pickle and tomato slices for dressing the sandwiches<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Set roast fat-side up on top of garlic and add water to the bottom of the pan. Bake, uncovered, until the roast reaches an internal temperature of 155 degrees F. Refrigerate the roast and liquid overnight. The next day, skim off any fat from the top of the liquid. Heat the liquid on the stove until it reaches the desired consistency for a gravy. Thinly slice the roast and add to the gravy. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. If you like, serve the beef in French bread with mayonnaise, lettuce, dill pickle slices and tomato slices. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 74382,&quot;Autumn Harvest Burger with Caramelized Onion and Apple 2 tablespoons butter 2 Vidalia onions, sliced 2 Granny Smith apples, diced 2 pounds 80 percent lean ground beef 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1 egg 1 cup seasoned bread crumbs 4 large crusty rolls, split 4 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 cup blue cheese Instructions: Melt butter in skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions to hot pan and begin caramelizing, stirring occasionally. After 4 minutes or so, add apples to the onions and continue to cook until onions are golden brown, about 6 more minutes. Remove from heat when done. While onions and apples are cooking, blend together in a large bowl the ground beef, salt, pepper, thyme, Dijon, egg, and bread crumbs. Be sure ingredients are well incorporated, but don&#39;t over work. Form mixture into 4 good-sized patties. (hint: If you create a concave burger, with the center thinner than the edges, when it cooks the burger won&#39;t swell up to look like a meatball, but will remain flat and patty-like) Heat grill to medium-high heat. Place burgers on grill and cook about 10 minutes per side, or until cooked through. As burgers are finishing (after the first flip), spread mayonnaise on both cut sides of each split roll. Place rolls on grill, mayonnaise side down, to toast for about 1 minute, or until golden. Place each burger on the bottom half of a toasted roll. Top with about 1/4 cup of blue cheese, then with a generous scoop of the caramelized onion and apple mixture. Cover with the roll and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 74383,&quot;Red Cabbage Slaw 1 small head red cabbage, tough bottom ribs removed, shredded (about 6 cups) 2 bulbs fennel, cored and julienned 3 carrots, grated 2 Granny Smith apples, julienned 1 red onion, very thinly sliced 1 cup apple cider vinegar Kosher salt 1 1/2 to 2 cups mayonnaise 2 to 3 tablespoons horseradish Instructions: Combine the cabbage, fennel, carrots, apples and onion in a large bowl. Douse with the vinegar, season with salt and let sit at least 1 hour. This will soften the cabbage and make it seem almost cooked, but it will still have a great texture. Drain the cabbage of excess liquid but still keep it fairly juicy. Stir in the mayonnaise and horseradish. Taste for seasoning and add salt. The result should be a creamy and tart slaw. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74384,&quot;Barbecue St. Louis Pork Ribs 2 teaspoons paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 3 slabs St. Louis style ribs, 2 to 3 pounds each 4 tablespoons kosher salt 1/3 cup spicy brown mustard Special equipment: Smoker and 4 ounces hickory or oak wood chunks or chips Instructions: Set a smoker to 225 degrees F. Combine the paprika, black peppercorns, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, garlic powder, onion powder, nutmeg and cayenne in a spice grinder. Process until a fine powder is formed, approximately 30 seconds. Pat the ribs dry and turn bone-side up. Trim excess fat and, if one end of the ribs is especially narrow, trim meat and bone to ensure even cooking. Remove the membrane on the underside of the ribs by inserting a rounded utensil, an upside-down spoon works well, between the membrane and the meat at one end of the slab. Carefully work the spoon under the membrane to loosen but not tear. Once enough has been loosened, use a paper towel to hold onto the membrane as you slowly pull it down the slab to remove. Sprinkle the ribs on both sides with the salt and brush both sides with the mustard. Sprinkle two-thirds of the spice mixture on the meat side of the ribs and the remaining third on the bone side. Once the smoker has reached 225 degrees F, add the wood chips or chunks and the ribs to the smoker. Smoke for 4 to 5 hours then test for doneness. There are four criteria that should be met in order for ribs to be done. First, the internal temperature of the meat should be 185 to 190 degrees F. Second, pick up each slab from the center with tongs and it should droop into a u-shape and crack slightly. Third, while holding with the tongs, and bouncing gently, the surface of the ribs should crack slightly. Lastly, the meat should pull easily off the bone but not fall off. If ribs pass all tests, remove them from the smoker and wrap in heavy-duty foil and rest for 15 minutes. If not, continue smoking for 45 minutes to 1 hour and test again until done. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 74385,&quot;Sweet Saffron Yogurt: Shrikand 1 3/4 pints (28 ounces) whole milk yogurt or 1 pint (17 1/2 ounces) Greek-style yogurt* (See Cook&#39;s Note) Milk, for infusing 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads 6 to 8 tablespoons icing sugar (confectioners&#39;) 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground green cardamom seeds 2 tablespoon chopped unsalted pistachios 2 tablespoon flaked or sliced almonds Edible silver leaf* Pomegranate seeds Instructions: Line a large sieve with a double layer of paper towels.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer until the mixture is pale yellow and will hold a ribbon. Drizzle the melted butter around the edges of the bowl and fold the mixture together gently but thoroughly. Set aside. Sift the flour, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together and set aside. In another, larger mixing bowl, beat the egg whites to the soft peak stage. Fold half of the egg yolk mixture into the beaten egg whites. Fold in the dry ingredients and stir in the dates, pecans, and raisins. Fold in the remaining yolk mixture. Pour the batter into the pan and shake it a little to find its level. Bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a rack and then run a sharp knife around the edge to loosen the cake and turn it out onto a platter. Sprinkle confectioners sugar over the top and serve cut into wedges, accompanied by coconut ice cream, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 74393,&quot;Orange-Grapefruit Marmalade with Ginger 5 oranges 1 grapefruit 3 cups sugar 2 ounces crystallized ginger, cut in strips 1 box Fruit Pectin Powder, (1-ounce) Instructions: Cut fruit in half, squeeze out juice and pulp, discard seeds. The volume of this should be approximately 4 cups. Remove zest, this should yield approximately 1/2 cup. Transfer juice, pulp and zest to a large glass bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. This helps the peel to soften. After soaking, put the citrus in a large stockpot. Add 6 cups of water, simmer for 1 1/2 hours. A sample of the peel should feel quite tender if rubbed between fingers. Add sugar and ginger. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Boil hard for 20 minutes until sugar is dissolved and mixture is thickened. If the mixture foams up, add a pat of butter and the froth will subside. Test for jell-point: drop a small amount of hot marmalade on a chilled plate. Return to the freezer for 1 minute. If surface forms a skin, it has reached jelling point, if still syrupy, continue cooking and test again in 5 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in pectin. Cool for 15 minutes, spoon into half-pint sterilized jars leaving 1/4-inch headspace and seal. ** Recipe Note: Traditionally the citrus seeds and pith are enclosed in a nylon bag and boiled along with the juice/pulp. This releases the natural pectin that is stored in that part of the orange. For time and ease, we eliminated that step and used store-bought fruit pectin. It worked very well. ***To sterilize the canning jars, wash the containers in hot, soapy water and rinse. Boil them in a large pot for 10 minutes. Keep the jars in hot water until ready to use to prevent the jars from cracking. Dry with paper towels before filling with marmalade. Once filled, put on lids and collar. Boil again for 10 minutes to seal the jars. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 74394,&quot;Valerie&#39;s Go-To Gravy 3 cups turkey stock 2 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Freshly squeezed lemon juice, as needed<br> Instructions: Add the turkey stock and thyme to a saucepan over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer. Add the butter to a straight-sided saute pan and let melt. Add the flour and cook over medium-high to high heat, whisking frequently, until the mixture is light brown in color, 5 to 10 minutes (for a dark gravy, cook the flour to a deeper brown color). Add 2 cups of the warm stock, whisking constantly, and cook until the gravy thickens and bubbles. Add more warm stock if a thinner consistency is desired. Reduce the heat to low and add salt and pepper to taste (this will depend on how salty the stock is). Add a squeeze of lemon juice and taste again for seasoning. Keep warm until ready to serve, adding more warm stock as needed.

Put the butter, sugar, salt and 1 1/2 cups water in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring to melt the butter. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour with a wooden spoon to make a paste. Return to the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste is shiny and pulls away from the pan, 6 to 7 minutes. Cool slightly. Transfer the paste to a stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed to cool, 1 minute. Beat in the eggs 1 at a time. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Transfer the dough to a large pastry bag with a 1/2-inch tip. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, dabbing a bit of dough under the corners to keep the paper in place. Pipe 1 1/2-inch balls of dough onto the paper. Smooth the dough peaks with a wet finger. Bake until puffed, 15 to 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Turn off the oven; keep the puffs inside 10 minutes to dry out. Pierce each puff with a dry piping tip; transfer to a rack to cool. For the white chocolate: While the puffs are baking and cooling, bring a small saucepan of water to a simmer. Combine the white chocolate with the heavy cream in a small metal bowl and set it on top of the saucepan without touching the water. Heat, stirring, until the white chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Set aside to cool. For the whipped cream filling: Using a stand mixer or hand mixer and a whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream with the confectioners&#39; sugar until soft peaks form. Whisk in the cooled white chocolate mixture. To assemble: Add the whipped cream filling to a pastry bag fitted with a medium tip. Fill each puff with a few tablespoons of the mixture through the hole already punched into it. Set aside. For the caramel: Mix the granulated sugar, corn syrup and 1 cup water in a saucepan, cover and bring to a boil over high heat; don&#39;t stir. Uncover and boil, swirling the pan, until the syrup turns deep amber, about 20 minutes. Immediately dip the bottom of the saucepan in a large bowl of ice water for a few seconds to stop the cooking. Transfer the caramel to a liquid measuring cup and cool slightly (it should still be liquid). Be careful--the caramel will still be hot! Draw a 7-inch circle on parchment paper. Partially dip each filled puff into the caramel and let the excess drip off (if the caramel hardens, microwave until soft, 45 seconds). Arrange the puffs around the circle on the parchment. Fill the base circle with more puffs for stability, then continue building a conical tower of smaller circles. Top the tower with a single puff. Line your work surface with parchment paper--the next step can be messy. Dip the tip of a fork into the caramel and quickly wave it in circles around the tower to create a web of caramel strands. Repeat. Let set, then slide 2 spatulas under the paper and transfer the croquembouche to a platter. Tear off the excess paper around the base. To serve, crack the caramel web with the back of a knife, then dismantle the tower and transfer the cream puffs to plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74398,&quot;Whole Roasted Salmon 5 to 6 pounds whole salmon, scaled, gutted and washed 6 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 3 bunches fresh tarragon 2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced thin 8 large shallots, peeled and sliced 2 pound leeks, well washed and cut into 1-inch pieces 1/2 cup white wine Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Rub the salmon on all sides with 4 tablespoons of the oil and season inside and out with salt and pepper. Place the tarragon bunch inside the cavity of the fish. Put the vegetables in a large roasting pan coat with the remainder of the oil, season with salt and pepper and mix to combine. Place the salmon on the bed of vegetables. Sprinkle fish and vegetables with white wine. Place the roasting pan in the oven and cook for 45 minutes or until the fish is thoroughly cooked. About 15 minutes for every inch of fish. Carefully lift the fish out of the pan and place on a platter along with the roasted vegetables. Serve by portioning out the fish using two large spoons: filleting as you go first the top fillet, discard the center bone and then serve the bottom fillet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74399,&quot;Corn Dog Cupcakes 6 hot dogs 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup coarse yellow cornmeal 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 large eggs 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1/4 cup honey 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 tablespoons yellow mustard Instructions: To assemble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line one 12-cup standard muffin tin with paper cupcake liners. Cut 1 1/2 inches from both ends of the hot dogs and reserve. Finely chop the remaining middle pieces and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, 1 teaspoon dry mustard, salt and cayenne. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, oil and honey until smooth. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry, and then stir in the chopped hot dogs. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about three-quarters of the way full. Skewer the reserved hot dog tips and place in the center of the cupcakes, leaning slightly askew. Bake until the tops of the cupcakes are golden brown and spring back lightly when touched, about 20 minutes. Cool in the tin 10 minutes, and then transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely. In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, yellow mustard and remaining 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard.

Thoroughly squeeze any excess water from the thawed spinach, removing as much liquid as possible. Coarsely chop. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant and golden brown. Add the spinach and nutmeg, sauteing for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and mix in the feta, lemon juice, cracked black pepper and egg to thoroughly combine. Allow the filling to cool. Melt the remaining butter over medium heat in a small saucepan. Cool slightly. Cover the stack of phyllo sheets with a clean damp kitchen towel. Working with the long side of the phyllo sheet nearest you, take 1 sheet from the stack and brush the entire surface with butter. Top with another phyllo sheet, brushing with more butter. Cut crosswise into five 2 1/2 to 3-inch strips. Place 2 teaspoons filling in the corner of each strip. Just like you would fold a flag, fold the corner of phyllo over to enclose the filling, forming a triangle, and continue folding the entire strip. Ending with the seam-side down, place the triangles on a large baking sheet and brush the tops with butter. Follow the same steps with the remaining ingredients. Space evenly on a sheet tray and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.

Sprinkle the yeast on top and let stand 10 minutes, or until foamy. Add the olive oil and salt, then use the dough hook to mix in the flour until the dough starts to come together. Allow the machine to knead the dough until smooth. (If you don&#39;t have a stand mixer, you can pulse the dough in a food processor until it is smooth and elastic. Or combine by hand in a large bowl.) Turn out the dough onto a floured board and knead 2 to 3 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat the surface. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide it in half for 2 large pizzas, or into 4 pieces for small individual pizzas. Form into smooth, tight balls, cover loosely with plastic wrap or a well-floured kitchen towel and set in a warm place to rise again, 30 to 45 minutes. (If you&#39;re not using the dough right away, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze up to 1 month.) Set a pizza stone in the oven and sprinkle a pizza peel lightly with flour. (If you don&#39;t have a stone, you can bake your pizza on a pizza pan or baking sheet sprinkled with flour.) Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Press the dough with your fingers until it&#39;s as flat as possible, then drape it over both of your fists and gently pull the edges outward while rotating the crust. When the circle has reached the desired size and thickness, place it on the pizza peel (or on the prepared pan). Top the pizza as desired and slide it from the peel onto the hot stone (or transfer the pan to the oven). Bake 8 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness, or until the crust is crisp and golden.

Run the mixture through a meat grinder fitted with the die with the largest holes. Repeat so that all the meat goes through the grinder twice. Add the water and Parmesan and mix together. Attach the sausage-stuffing attachment to the meat grinder, keeping the grinder blade and die in place. Place a generous amount of the sausage mixture into the grinder pan. Give the casings a slight bit of resistance by holding onto the sausage stuffer with three fingers and letting the casing slip through your thumb and forefinger. Turn the machine on and fill the casings, being careful to avoid any air bubbles. Twist the casings to create evenly-sized 4-inch sausages. Tie the sausages with butcher&#39;s twine to keep them nicely sealed, then prick all over with a pin or skewer to allow steam to escape while cooking (you don&#39;t want to have a blow-out!). Place the sausage links into boiling water and parboil for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the water, reserving the sausage water for sp?tzle, and transfer sausages to a preheated saute pan slicked with oil. Saute until browned, about 6 minutes. For the spaetzle: Bring the sausage water back to a boil over medium heat. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until homogeneous. Add the flour to a large bowl and make a well in the flour. Add a pinch of salt and then, with a fork, gradually combine the milk-egg mixture with the flour. Mix until just combined. Stir in half of the dill, marjoram, oregano and parsley (1/4 cup total). Place the batter in a colander set over the boiling sausage water. Using a rubber spatula or a spaetzle maker, push the batter through the colander and into the water. Boil the spaetzle until firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and add to a preheated saute pan slicked with oil. Add the savoy cabbage, white wine and mustard and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Finish with the butter.

Then drain them and keep them warm while you cook the eggs. In a saucepan, bring some water to the boil into which you have dropped a matchstick; according to my Aunt Frieda this stops the white from billowing out into the pan should the egg crack while cooking. Am I going to promise this works? Well, all families have their folklore. Lower the eggs into the water and cook them at a steady boil for about 4 minutes. Take them out of the water and immediately slice the top of each one; the yolk should still be runny enough to dip the asparagus spears in. Make sure that there&#39;s salt on the table for sprinkling into the almost aggressive blandness of the egg and spear, as you eat, with the warm asparagus. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74430,&quot;Buttermilk Panna Cotta 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped<br> 1 tablespoon honey powder (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 1/2 teaspoons powdered gelatin<br> 2 cups whole milk buttermilk<br> 4 tablespoons buckwheat honey, plus more for drizzling<br> 1/4 cup salted roasted pistachios, chopped<br> Instructions: Combine the cream, sugar, scraped vanilla beans, vanilla pod and honey powder in a saucepan over medium heat.

Scrape down the sides of the bowl from time to time so the butter and sugar are fully integrated and somewhat \\fluffy.\\ In another bowl, combine and mix the flour, almonds, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li><li>Because this dough has a good amount of butter, it needs no \\resting\\ time and needs to be rolled fairly quickly. Lay 3 large pieces of wax paper in a single layer on a flat surface. Sprinkle each one with a light coating of flour. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, blend the flour mixture in with the butter. When the ingredients are fully integrated, place ⅓ of the batter on each of the pieces of wax paper. Coat dough with a light layer of flour, and top with another piece of wax paper of the same length. Use your hands or a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a disk to make 3 dough \\sandwiches.\\ Place two of them in the refrigerator and work with remaining disk of dough.</li><li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Roll the first batch into as neat a shape as possible while keeping the waxed paper in place. Avoid creasing or cracking the dough as you roll it to about a ½-inch in thickness. When the first batch is rolled, refrigerate it and repeat the same process for the other two.</li><li>Remove the first rolled sheet from the refrigerator. Place it on a flat surface and remove the top layer of waxed paper. Spread a small amount of flour onto your work surface and invert the dough onto it. Carefully remove the second sheet of waxed paper. Cut as many 1½-inch hearts (or rounds) as possible. Reserve the scraps in the refrigerator. Arrange the cut cookies neatly in a single layer on a greased baking sheet. Repeat with the other two sheets, reserving any scraps.</li><li>Cut a heart, with the smaller cutter, out of the center of half of all the cookies to create a heart outline. Roll the scraps in between two of the pieces of wax paper using the method indicated above and cut additional hearts, if desired. Waste dough? No such thing. Simply reroll all the scraps and refrigerate for a few minutes before cutting into additional cookies.</li><li>Bake the cookies until they are lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the trays from the oven and allow them to cool slightly for a few minutes before gently transferring them to a cooling rack. Put the raspberry jam in a bowl and whisk to remove large lumps.</li><li>Spoon about ½ teaspoon raspberry jam on each bottom and place a \\top\\ heart on each. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired. Note: Dough can be rolled without waxed paper if allowed to chill in the refrigerator for one hour prior to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 74432,&quot;Goat Cheese Cheesecake 2 cups gingersnap crumbs 6 tablespoons melted butter, plus extra butter for pan 1/4 cup sugar Pinch salt 2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature 1 (12-ounce) log goat cheese 12 ounces creme fraiche or sour cream 4 eggs 1 cup sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Vanilla Pineapple Compote, recipe follows Special equipment: 9-inch springform pan 1 cup brown sugar 1 1/2 cups water 1 cup rum 2 vanilla beans, split, seeds scraped and reserved 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 ripe pineapple, top, skin and core removed, cut into bite-size wedges Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the crust: Stir all of the ingredients together in a large bowl. Butter a 9-inch springform pan. Press the crumb mixture onto the bottom and about halfway up the sides of the pan.

Set aside until they are 60 degrees, or slightly below room temperature. Pour flour, 1/2 cup granulated sugar and salt into a triple sifter or sieve. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper; set aside. Adjust rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 325 degrees. Set nearby a dry, ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Such a pan allows the batter to cling to the sides and rise to its full height. Place a long-necked bottle or large metal funnel nearby for inverting the baked cake. Whip egg whites, preferably with a whisk attachment until frothy. Add cream of tartar and whip on medium speed until soft peaks form. Continue whipping and gradually add the 1 cup granulated sugar until whites have thickened and form soft droopy white peaks. Add the vanilla and lemon zest in the final moments of whipping. Sprinkle one-quarter of the flour mixture over the whites, and with a rubber spatula, fold into the whites. Repeat this process with the remaining flour mixture, folding in only one-quarter of the flour mixture at a time. Gently pour the batter into an ungreased tube pan. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the top is light golden, the cake feels spongy and springs back when touched, and a wooden toothpick inserted in the middle comes out free of cake. Invert cake onto the neck of a bottle or funnel. Cool completely before removing from pan. To remove cake from the pan, slip just the tip of a small metal spatula between the cake and pan. Slowly trace the perimeter to release any cake sticking to the pan. Tilt the cake pan on its side, and gently tap the bottom against the counter to loosen the cake. Rotate the cake pan, tapping as you turn it a few more times, until it appears free. Cover the cake with a rack or cardboard round, and at the same time that you invert the cake onto the work surface, tap it firmly onto the surface. Lift the pan from the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74444,&quot;Allspice Gravy Giblets from turkey (not including the liver) 2 pints water 1 tablespoon allspice berries 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns 3 fresh bay leaves 1 (1/2-inch) cinnamon stick 1 stick celery, halved 2 carrots, peeled and halved 1 onion, halved, but not peeled 3 teaspoons salt 1 clementine, zested and juiced 1 cooked Spiced and Super-Juicy Roast Turkey, in roasting pan, recipe follows 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons clear honey For the turkey: 10 pints 11 fluid ounces (6 liters) water 4 1/4-ounces (125 grams) table salt 3 tablespoons black peppercorns 1 cinnamon stick 1 tablespoon caraway seeds 4 cloves 2 tablespoons allspice berries 4 star anise 2 tablespoons white mustard seeds 7 ounces (200 grams) caster sugar 2 onions, quartered 1 (3-inch) piece ginger, cut into 6 slices 4 tablespoons maple syrup 4 tablespoons clear honey Handful fresh parsley leaves, optional (only if you&#39;ve got some parsley hanging around) 1 orange, quartered 1 (9 to 11 1/4-pound) (4 to 5-kg) turkey 2 3/4 ounces (75 grams) butter 3 tablespoons maple syrup Instructions: Place the turkey giblets, water, allspice berries, black peppercorns, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, celery, carrots, onion, salt and clementine zest and juice into a large saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil. Cover the saucepan with a lid and reduce the heat so that the mixture simmers gently. Cook for 2 hours.<br> Remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the gravy stock through a sieve into a clean large measuring jug. This should give you about 1 liter of stock.<br> When you are ready to make the gravy, remove the cooked turkey from the roasting pan and let it rest on a clean carving board. Pour the turkey juices from the roasting tin into a clean saucepan. Place the flour into a small bowl. Add a few tablespoons of the gravy stock and mix well with a handheld whisk. Add the flour and stock mixture to the saucepan and mix well over medium heat until the ingredients have combined.<br> Gradually add the stock and honey to the saucepan and mix well. Let the gravy bubble away until it thickens and the floury taste disappears. Pour into a jug or sauceboat and serve with cooked Nigella&#39;s Spiced and Super-Juicy Roast Turkey. For the turkey: Place the water into your largest cooking pot or bucket/plastic bin and add all the turkey ingredients, stirring to dissolve the salt, sugar, syrup and honey. (Squeeze the juice of the orange quarters into the brine before you chuck in the pieces.)<br> Untie and remove any string or trussing attached to the turkey, shake it free and add it to the liquid. Add more water if the turkey is not completely submerged. Keep the mixture in a cold place, even outside overnight or for up 1 or 2 days before you cook it, remembering to take it out of its liquid (and wiping it dry with kitchen-towel) a good 40 or 50 minutes before it has to go into the oven. Turkeys - indeed this is the case for all meat - should be at room temperature before being put in the preheated oven. If you&#39;re at all concerned - the cold water in the brine will really chill this bird - then just cook the turkey for longer than its actual weight requires. For the basting glaze: Place the butter and syrup into a saucepan and cook over a low heat, while stirring, until the ingredients have melted and combined.<br> Brush the turkey with the glaze before roasting, and baste periodically throughout the roasting time.<br> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Cook the turkey for 30 minutes at this relatively high temperature, then turn the oven down to 350 degrees F and continue cooking, turning the oven back up to 425 degrees F for the final15 minutes or so if you want to give a browning boost to the skin. For a 9 to 11-pound turkey, allow 2 1/2 to 3-hours in total. But remember that ovens vary enormously, so just check by piercing the flesh between leg and body with a small sharp knife: when the juices run clear, the turkey is cooked.<br> Just as it&#39;s crucial to let the turkey come to room temperature before it goes in to the oven, so it&#39;s important to let it stand out of the oven for a good 20 minutes before you actually carve it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 74445,&quot;Mango Flan on Chocolate 3 cups sugar 1/2 cup water 4 cups whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 7 eggs 2 egg yolks 1/2 cup fresh mango puree (1 small mango, peeled, pitted, and pureed in a food processor) Chocolate brownie base, recipe follows 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 cup sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Pour 2 cups sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the sugar, trying not to splash any sugar onto the sides of the pan. Do not stir; gently draw your finger through the center of the sugar twice, making a cross, to moisten it. Over medium-high heat, bring to a boil without stirring. Reduce the heat to a fast simmer and cook without stirring until amber-caramel in color, 10 to 20 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat. Meanwhile, set 6 (1-cup ramekins or shallow coffee cups nearby. When the caramel is cooked, quickly pour about 1/4 cup caramel into each ramekin and swirl to coat the sides. Set aside to cool. In a saucepan, bring the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, additional egg yolks and the remaining 1 cup sugar. Whisk about 1/2 cup of the hot milk into the egg mixture. Whisk the remaining hot milk into the egg mixture. Whisk in the mango puree until smooth. Strain the mixture into a pitcher to smooth it and to remove the vanilla bean and mango fibers. Pour the mixture into the caramel-lined ramekins and arrange in a hot water bath. Bake in the center of the oven until dry and set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the water bath and let cool. Tightly cover each ramekin with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 2 hours, or refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 24 hours. To serve, place a brownie circle on each serving plate. Turn a flan out on top of the cake (you may need to dip the bottom of each ramekin in hot water to loosen the caramel, and/or run a knife around the edge of the ramekin). The caramel will pour out and serve as the sauce, and will also soak into the brownie. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9 by 13-inch baking pan and line it with parchment or waxed paper, pressing into the corners. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the butter until fluffy. Mix in the sugar. Mix in the eggs and vanilla and mix until light and fluffy. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Add to the butter mixture and mix just until combined. Mix in the chocolate chips. Pour into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and bake until the cake is firm in the center and the surface is dry and shiny, 15 minutes. Let cool in the pan. Run a knife around the edges of the pan and turn out the whole cake onto a work surface. Peel off the waxed paper.

Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottom of each with parchment. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the egg white, milk and vanilla together in another medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high until light and fluffy. Add about a third of the flour mixture and beat on medium-low until incorporated. Now add a third of the egg-milk mixture and continue to beat on medium-low until incorporated, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Repeat with the remaining flour and egg-milk mixtures, finishing with the flour. Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake until the cake bounces back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool completely in the cake pans on a rack. Make the buttercream: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a heatproof stand mixer&#39;s bowl above the water. Add the 3/4 cup sugar, cream of tartar, salt and egg whites, to the mixing bowl and whisk together by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar completely dissolves. Transfer to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until cool and the whites hold stiff peaks, 10 to 15 minutes. Toss in a couple of chunks of butter at a time, making sure the pieces are incorporated before adding more. After all the butter is added, continue whisking on medium-high speed. The mixture will deflate and appear curdled. Continue whisking until the buttercream comes back together to form a smooth and spreadable consistency. Beat in 1 teaspoon cinnamon and vanilla. Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl. To assemble: Slice each cake in half horizontally for a total of 4 cake rounds (set aside one of the bottom pieces for the top layer). Put 1 round on a cake stand or serving platter, and spread about 1 cup of the buttercream on top, all the way to the edge. Sprinkle with some of the cinnamon-sugar. Repeat with 2 more layers of cake, buttercream and cinnamon-sugar. Place the reserved cake round on top (browned-side up). Frost with the remaining buttercream and sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon-sugar. Let sit for at least 1 hour before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 74450,&quot;Ganache 3 tablespoons corn syrup 6 ounces heavy cream 12 ounces dark chocolate, chopped into small pieces 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: In a small saucepan combine the corn syrup and heavy cream.

Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Combine 1 cup of the flour, 1 1/2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar and the salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal with some large lumps. Add the egg yolks and pulse until blended. Place the dough in the springform pan, and press it evenly against the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides. Toss 2 1/2 cups of the berries, the lemon zest, juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, remaining 1 tablespoon flour and remaining 1/3 cup granulated sugar in a medium bowl. Pour the berry mixture into the shell and bake until vigorously bubbling, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and immediately top with the remaining 1 1/2 cups blueberries. Just before serving, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar by tapping it through a fine-mesh sieve. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 74452,&quot;Berry Sauce 3 cups mixed raspberries and blueberries 2 to 3 tablespoons sugar<br> Zest of 1/2 lemon and juice of 1 lemon<br> Instructions: Combine the berries, sugar, lemon zest and juice in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook until the berries burst and the liquid starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, forcing the berries through by pushing and scraping with a rubber spatula. The more you force through, the thicker the sauce will be (the pulp closest to the seeds contains the most pectin, which is a natural thickener). Let cool completely and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 74453,&quot;Ultimate Mac and Cheese 1 package (16 ounces) elbow macaroni 6 tablespoons butter 6 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons McCormick?

Sprinkle 2 tablespoons salt in the water, cover the bowl, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. When you soak the chicken overnight in salt brine, the salt infuses into the meat and makes it so tasty! Pour oil into an electric frying pan or deep, heavy skillet to a 1-inch depth and heat the oil to 375 degrees F. Check the temperature by sprinkling flour over the oil. If the flour sizzles, the oil is hot enough. Drain the water from the chicken, sprinkle each piece with some salt and pepper, and coat the pieces with flour, shaking off any excess. Carefully place the chicken in the hot oil. Place the cover on the pan, leaving a small opening for steam to escape. Cook for 15 minutes. Remove the cover and, using tongs, turn each piece of chicken. Replace the cover and cook for 15 minutes more, or until done. Use a sharp, thin-bladed knife to check for doneness by slicing a drumstick to the bone. Neither the meat nor the juices should be pink. Drain the chicken on paper towels and keep warm. For the gravy: Spoon about 4 tablespoons of oil that the chicken was fried in plus the brown bits into a medium skillet. Over medium heat, sprinkle in the flour and cook while whisking, until the flour is browned, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in the milk and cook until the gravy thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve with the chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 74456,&quot;Beets with Orange Vinaigrette 3 (15-ounce) cans baby beets, drained 2 tablespoons raspberry vinegar 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice 3 tablespoons good olive oil 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup small-diced red onion (1 small onion) 2 large seedless oranges, zested Segments 2 large seedless oranges Instructions: Drain the beets and dice into 1/2-inch cubes.

When the wood is down to the smoky embers, transfer it to the smoker or a roasting pan that you don&#39;t mind scorching. Place the roasting pan containing the burning wood in the oven along with the fish and allow it to smoke for about 5 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to oversmoke and thus overpower the albacore flavor. (Chef&#39;s Note: The amount of time the fish should be smoked will vary depending on the size of your oven. Mitchell recommends experimenting to your taste.)<br> Mix the herbes de Provence and coarse salt together. Coat the exterior of the albacore with the mixture. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sear the fish on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes total, keeping the center rare.<br> To serve, place a mound of white bean puree just off-center on each plate. Cut the albacore into slices and fan out around the white bean puree. Add the roasted tomatoes and drizzle pesto all around the plate. Serve with sauteed greens, asparagus, or haricots verts, if desired.
