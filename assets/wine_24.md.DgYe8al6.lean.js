Now 50 years old, this smooth, mellifluous wine is opulent and delicious. It has the true aged tawny, old gold character, with dried fruits that have sublimated into a wine that is almost dry. It is an astonishing wine that is ready to drink now.","designation":"Colheita"},{"country":"US","description":"This vintage of X is finished with a blend of still Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, skipping the added sugar that would have come with a traditional dosage. It is thus steely and sublime, clean, crisp and linear in dry flavors of red apple, cherry and creamy, nutty complexity. The acidity is well-toned and lingering on the finish.","designation":"Brut X"},{"country":"fr","description":"Tight with acidity and minerality, this is a precocious Champagne from a great vintage. Citrus and crisp apple flavors are allied to a strongly zesty character that brings out the chalk terroir of the C?te des Blancs in Champagne. Certainly the wine will age, so keep and drink from 2016.","designation":"Blanc de Blancs Brut"},{"country":"fr","description":"Situated at the entrance to a break in the hillside of the C?te d'Or, allowing cool air to come in from the west, Lavaux Saint-Jacques produces severely structured wines that need aging.

This wine has black fruits, dark tannins, a light perfumed character and considerable potential. Powered by its structure and acidity it is developing slowly and surely. Drink from 2017.","designation":""},{"country":"pt","description":"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, both originally from the D?o region, this sophisticated, rich wine is firmly structured.
