glass.","designation":"Estate Grown"},{"country":"us","description":"with a handsome percentage of whole-cluster fermentation in the mix, this wine shows a funky undercurrent of marshmallow and

drink it now.","designation":"Sophia's Hillside Cuv√©e"},{"country":"at","description":"slightly grassy in character, this wine shows green pepper and tight tannins as well as black berry fruits. to

alongside bright acidity and compact tannins.","designation":"Tufobl√π"},{"country":"us","description":"very black and dense, a super-young wine that shows pedigree and promise for development.

at least.","designation":"Las Madres Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"this ros√© has aromas of toast and walnut. it's bitter and dry, and lacks the fruit richness to balance its lean and astringent sensations.","designation":"Ros√©"},{"country":"us","description":"a voluptuous wine packed with almonds, a handful of herbs and citrus aromas and flavors, this big-boned, dry, barrel-fermented roussanne finishes with a swirl of lemon. available in 2013.","designation":"Monarch Mine Vineyard"},{"country":"ar","description":"this round, sticky blend smells burnt and like underbrush, and is very woody, with milk chocolate and plastic aromas. thick and sticky on the palate, with lactic oak, sweet spice, carob and berry flavors, this is dominated by creamy oak and

the danube in ro is very concentrated, with heady flavors of honey, caramel and apricot and a nutty overall character. the finish is crisp and there's some acidity to keep the wine light on the
