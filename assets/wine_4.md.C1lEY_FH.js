It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices.

Great concentration and depth, but drinking it now is robbing the cradle.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is great Zinfandel. The vineyard was planted in 1915 and probably contains other varieties than Zinfandel. Yields are extraordinarily low, as they are in these coastal ancient vineyards. The wine's concentration is impressive, spanning ripe, crushed raspberries through cherry pie filling to black currants, with all sorts of earthy, minerally, balsam and cedar complexities, not to mention the masses of spice.

As usual, the wine is massively constructed and extraordinarily rich and deep in flavor, offering waves of grilled blackberries and cherries, red currants, licorice, bacon, cola, black pepper and other spices.

Mainly Syrah, with 16% Petite Sirah, this wine will age, but it's really best now with hearty foods, like short ribs or lamb.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A beautiful massive, mouthfilling Zinfandel.

The fruit shows cherry and cassis, and the alcohol (listed at 14.9%) is mostly contained. But it's a hard wine, and does not seem to have the complex aromatics that promise more detail with age.

Superbly enjoyable, but as a brand new wine, its future is only a guess.

The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them.

Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6C8 years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a devastatingly good Bordeaux blend from Howell Mountain. Based on Cabernet, it has all the flavor you could ask for in blackberries, cherries, cassis, chocolate, herbs, spices and sweetly smoked oak. But the structure is awesome.

Tremendous now, and should age for years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a big Pinot Noir, dark and full bodied and juicy in pomegranates, cherries, red plums and sauted wild mushrooms, and the interplay of oak with fruit even yields richer notes of milk chocolate.

But from there it goes nowhere; the palate is watery and tart, with sour strawberry and raspberry flavors. Tangy and underdeveloped, it comes across as quick-picked Rioja ros.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"Flowery and sweet, with apricot, buttercup and banana flavors in a soft texture.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Simple, with blackberry, cherry, carob and herb flavors wrapped into a jagged texture.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"A tart, foxy style of Rioja with sharp-edged aromas. The palate is crisp as ice chips, with lean, leafy flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Tight on the finish, with a lasting scratch of peppercorn and acidity.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"Unbalanced, with citrus fruit flavors that taste distinctly sugary mixed with sharp, green mintiness.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is quite sharp and tannic; there are somewhat pickled spice flavors, clove and other suggestions of barrel aging, but where's the fruit?","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Tough in the mouth, with green, minty tannins framing jellied flavors of blackberries and cherries. Okay for fast foods and such.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Sweaty and thin, this wine has little character or appeal. Soupy, vegetal and tannic.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"A thin, characterless red wine, this has a little spicy clove but nothing else that stands out. Dull, thin, ordinary.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"Harsh and burnt-smelling, with beet-like flavors and too much body weight. One could argue that it gets better as it airs out, but nobody should have to wrestle with a ros just to get something likable from it. Past its prime with nowhere to go.","province":"Catalonia"},{"country":"au","description":"De Bortoli produces a wide range range of wines, but this is not one of the company's best efforts, even considering the price. The aromas are confected, and the flavors bear a resemblance to cherry pie filling with a rubbery edge.","province":"au Other"},{"country":"US","description":"Sugary sweet and soft, with candied flavors of cherries and berries.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Sweet, soft and simple, with medicinal flavors of cherries and oak.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Aromas of cabbage, tomato leaf and green berry fruits tell you all you need to know. The wine is green but thick, with an unctuous meeting of sweet and underripe flavors as well as a gooey mouthfeel. Just one of a million weak wines from the high plains of es.","province":"Central es"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows sugary flavors of apricots, grilled pineapples and vanilla that have a troubling vegetal edge.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"An aggressive wine with very little charm or character to back up its edgy verve. The nose is skunky while the palate tastes of pickled red cabbage and sharp berry flavors. A weak product reflective of a cool, nongiving vintage.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"Dull and vegetal. Tastes like canned asparagus juice, with a squeeze of citrus.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Eggy, sulfuric and gritty on the nose, with acrid, burnt-field aromas. The palate runs toward grapefruit and bland citrus, and the finish is dull. Barely an acceptable effort given the norm these days.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"es","description":"Murky and dusty, with additional nutty, dirty aromas. Not much to say here; the wine is heavy and battles you all the way. The fruit is muddled and tart, and overall the wine is devoid of character.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"es","description":"A gaseous, barnyardy wine from several vintages ago. It's tart and scratchy, with thin herbal flavors of red fruit and tomato. Doesn't seem worth much these days.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"cl","description":"Dark and smoky, like hickory burning alongside blackberry, spice and turned earth. The palate has jammy black plum and blackberry flavors mixed with herbs, while good acidity gives it length. Finishes long, spicy and herbal, with enough freshness to make it food friendly.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"au","description":"Lean in build, this is a lovely Riesling for drinking over the near term. It already displays some slightly developed notes of honey and toast alongside lime and crushed stone.","province":"Western au"},{"country":"US","description":"Roessler produces lots of single-vineyard wines, but this has not been one of their best ones. It's a good wine, not without interest, with plenty of compact cherry, raspberry and sandalwood flavors. But it's very acidic. Decant it for hours.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Appeals for its dryness, crispness and overall balance. Really elegant, with low alcohol and tantalizing citrus, gooseberry, pepper and vanilla flavors. The price makes it a good value.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"While this may already be in its latter stages of freshness, it's still offering nice lemon and minerality on the nose. It's more flat and melony in the mouth, with apple flavors running the show. Fleshy on the finish, but tasting quite nice.","province":"Galicia"},{"country":"it","description":"A hearty blend of Carignano, Syrah and Grenache, this interesting Sicilian red offers aromas of smoked meat and spice backed by a rich texture and a fresh acidic close. The wine takes a modern approach with grapes that are rarely used in Sicily.","province":"Sicily & Sardinia"},{"country":"US","description":"A consumer favorite, this cherry-flavored ros is 100% Sangiovese, ripe and round. Finished dry, it has so much fruit that there is an impression of sweetness. Forward and appealing.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"A step forward in this vintage, with a pretty nose offering blackberry and truffle notes. Flavors are a mix of fruit and herb, dried leaf, tea and cherry tobacco. It grabs your attention, then thins out a bit too quickly in the finish. But lots of potential, and probably a good chance to improve over the next couple of years.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"This oak-aged Viognier from Sicily still needs time to integrate and soften. Toasty oaky notes are evident, but the wine already boasts the background pulp and richness to pair with lobster or crab cakes.
