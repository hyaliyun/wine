Place the wings in a large bowl and sprinkle with the garlic salt, pepper, cayenne, and oregano. Season just 1 side of the wings for mild, or for hotter wings, turn the wings to coat the other side with seasonings and then cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Preheat a grill to medium-high. Grill chicken wings, turning once, until the juices run clear when pierced with a fork. Serve immediately with a side of Blue Cheese Dressing. Blend all ingredients together in a food processor. Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 20640,&quot;Prosciutto, Rosemary and Pepper Bread 1 package (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast 1/4 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 3/4 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper 3 1/2 cups bread or unbleached all-purpose flour, approximately 4 ounces (1/4-inch thick) sliced prosciutto, chopped into 1/4-inch dice 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary or 2 teaspoons dried rosemary Instructions: In a large bowl or in the bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir. Let stand until the yeast softens, about 10 minutes. Stir to dissolve the yeast. Using a wooden spoon or the paddle blade of the mixer, stir in the oil, salt and pepper. Gradually beat in enough flour to make a shaggy dough that clears the sides of the bowl. If kneading by hand, turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. If kneading by machine, change to the dough hook and knead on medium-low speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. If desired, knead on the work surface to check the consistency. Shape the dough into a ball. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled large bowl. Turn to coat the dough with oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch down the dough and shape into a ball. Return the dough to the bowl, turn to coat with oil, cover and let rise until doubled again, about 45 minutes. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a large baking sheet. Turn out the dough onto the work surface. Knead, gradually working in the prosciutto and rosemary. Flatten the dough into a 12-inch disk. Starting at a long end, roll up jelly-roll style. Pinch the seams shut. Place on a baking sheet, seam side down. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Using a very sharp knife, cut 3 shallow diagonal slashes in the top of the bread. Bake until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack. If desired, wrap in aluminum foil and store at room temperature up to 8 hours before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 20641,&quot;Seven Layer Cookies 4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 pound (two 8-ounce cans) almond paste 8 large eggs 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour Red and green gel food coloring 1/3 cup raspberry jam 1/3 cup apricot jam 1 cup chocolate chips 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 tablespoon canola oil or shortening Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line three 13-by-9-inch baking pans with either parchment paper or greased aluminum foil. In a food processor, pulse together the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and almond paste until pale yellow and fluffy. Continue to pulse while adding the eggs one at a time, then the vanilla extract. Add the flour and process until a smooth dough forms, stopping occasionally to scrape the sides and corners of the bowl. Remove the dough and divide into 3 even pieces. Place one piece back into the processor with a dab of red gel food coloring, and pulse until combined. Repeat with another piece and a dab of green food coloring.<br> Spread the red, green and plain doughs in the prepared baking pans, and bake until light and springy to the touch, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool completely in their pans, about 1 hour. Remove the cookie layers from their pans, reserving 1 pan to use as a mold. Place the apricot and raspberry jams in separate bowls or mugs and microwave until loose, about 1 minute. In another bowl, toss the chocolate chips with the corn syrup and oil and microwave in 30-second spurts, stirring with a fork in between, until a shiny glaze is formed. Place the green layer in the pan, then spread a thin layer of raspberry jam over it. Next, add the white layer, then repeat the process with the apricot jam. Top with the red layer, then spread the chocolate glaze across the top. Place in the refrigerator until the chocolate hardens, then wrap in plastic and allow to set for another hour, refrigerated. Place a cutting board on top of the pan, invert it, and unmold the cookies. Using a sharp knife, cut the cookies lengthwise into 4 long pieces, then cut across in 1/2-inch intervals. These keep, well-wrapped at room temperature, 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 20642,&quot;Stuffed Branzino with Walnuts and Pomegranate Nonstick cooking spray 2 cleaned, gutted whole branzino (1 to 1 1/2 pounds each) 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 lemon, juiced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 6 cloves garlic, minced 1 red bell pepper, finely diced 1 yellow bell pepper, finely diced 3/4 cup walnuts, chopped 1/2 cup barberries 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon sumac 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 3 scallions, finely chopped Kosher salt 1/4 cup pomegranate molasses 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds 1/2 cup parsley leaves, chopped 1 lemon, sliced Instructions: For the fish: Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with nonstick spray.

In a medium roasting pan or wide diameter pan, combine the beer, olives, garlic, rosemary and onion wedges. Season with salt and freshly cracked pepper and bring to a simmer. Add the sausages; the liquid should come about halfway up the sides of the sausages. If not, add more beer or water until it does. Braise the sausages until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes.<br> For the ribs: Sprinkle the ribs liberally with salt and freshly cracked pepper. Grill over high heat, turning frequently, until cooked through and caramelized on the outside, 15 to 20 minutes total. This is not a low and slow method of cooking ribs; it&#39;s the opposite, high and fast. Remove the sausages from the braising liquid and grill until there are grill marks on each side, about 5 minutes.<br> Transfer the ribs and sausages to a large platter.

Add 3 tablespoons hot tap water, cover and cook in a microwave oven on high power for 7 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Remove and discard any stems from the mushrooms and thinly slice the caps. Remove the tough, small strip on the sides of the scallops. If necessary, cut the scallops to make them as close to uniform in size as possible. Raise the heat under the skillet to high and add the scallops. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes, turning once halfway through. Add the mushrooms and cook for 2 minutes. Add the herbes de Provence, vermouth and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 3 minutes while you coarsely chop the chives. The mushrooms will be just wilted and the scallops lightly browned. Put the cooked peas and their liquid in a food processor with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter and salt and pepper to taste, and puree. To serve, ring a serving platter with the puree and put the scallops and mushrooms in the middle.

While the Dulce De Leche Caramel is boiling, lay out the bacon on a half sheet pan and bake for approximately 15 minutes. While the bacon is cooking, on another half sheet pan, bake the peanuts for 15 minutes. Allow the bacon to cool and chop into small pieces and set aside. Allow the peanuts to cool and then roughly chop them. Mix the dulce de leche caramel, bacon, peanuts and salt together in a bowl. Using a small melon scooper, scoop balls of the caramel mixture and place on a sheet of wax paper or parchment paper. Roll out a 1/8-inch-thick sheet of fondant and cover the caramel balls with the fondant. On a sheet pan lined with wax paper, spread a thin amount of melted chocolate in a circle just large enough to place the caramel balls on. Place the fondant covered caramel balls on the melted chocolate and place in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator. Then dip the fondant covered caramels in the melted chocolate. Return them to the refrigerator to cool. Serve. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Remove the label from the can of sweetened condensed milk. Place the can in a pot of boiling water and boil for 2 hours. Let the can cool completely before handling.

Paint each one lightly with beaten egg. Place 1 tablespoon filling in the center of each ravioli. Seal by placing 8 additional wonton wrappers on top to cover each square. Pick up each ravioli and press well all around edges to seal. For a good seal, make sure no filling is stuck in the edges. Square ravioli can be left as is or cut into festive shapes (stars, hearts etc.) with a medium cookie cutter. Place the ravioli upside down on a cookie sheet lined with parchment. Lay out 8 more wrappers and repeat the process until either wrappers or filling is gone. Lay additional parchment or plastic wrap between layers of ravioli as needed as you lay them on the cookie sheet. The entire cookie sheet can be wrapped well and refrigerated for 1 to 2 days. When ready to cook ravioli, bring large pot of salted water to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer, give the water a good stir to form a whirlpool effect and quickly drop in 12 to 15 raviolis one by one, stirring gently to separate them as they hit the water. Poach gently 2 to 3 minutes, or until ravioli puff up, float to the surface and are opaque in the center (in the case of raw poultry or fish fillings) Remove ravioli from pot with a slotted spoon and reserve.

Place over medium heat and be sure to clean the sides of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in water, to avoid causing sugar crystals, which will affect the final caramel. Heat up the cream either in a small saucepan or in the microwave in a microwave-safe container. Once the caramel turns a light amber color, slowly pour in the hot cream. Add the butter and salt, and stir until the butter melts. Once everything is incorporated, cook until a candy thermometer reads 120 degrees F. Pour the caramel over the white chocolate. The heat of the caramel will melt the chocolate. Pipe the caramel when it&#39;s hot into silicon molds. Then refrigerate and freeze before you place these on the Hazelnut Chocolate Ganache. Pop the frozen caramel right on top of the Hazelnut Chocolate Ganache coins while they&#39;re still warm. Sprinkle with the crisp pearls. You are now ready to dip into chocolate. To finish the bon bons, melt and temper the chocolate. Dip the caramels in the chocolate and let sit until chocolate sets. In a small 1-quart saucepan, bring the cream to a boil. Meanwhile partially melt the chocolate and when the cream comes to a boil, pour this over the chocolate. Before you start to mix, add the praline and the corn syrup. Gently mix until the mixture is homogenous. Let mixture cool until it thickens; it will be easy to pipe out of a disposable pastry bag.

To do it yourself, place the ribs meat-side up on a cutting board. There is a line of fat at the base of the ribs; cut along it to remove the cartilaginous rib tips. Turn the meat over, rib-side up. Cut off the flap of meat on the inside of the ribs. (The reason to remove these pieces is that they will burn, well before the ribs are done. You can season them and grill them over direct heat for about 15 minutes, turning once. They are delicious.) With the rib-side up, finesse a sharp knife under the tough membrane that covers the bones. Working from one rib to the next, pull the membrane off the rib. (For a better grip, grab the membrane with a paper towel.) The membrane may tear and you may have to start over, but be patient - removing the membrane allows the spices and smoke to penetrate the ribs, and makes the ribs much more attractive and easy to eat. In a shallow, non-reactive pan large enough to hold the ribs, mix together 1 cup cider vinegar, 1 cup cider, garlic, bay leaves, 2 tablespoons hot sauce and the salt. Put the ribs in this marinade, turn to coat, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 16 hours, turning once during this time. Remove the ribs from the pan 2 hours before you are going to grill and pat dry. Discard the marinade. Sprinkle the ribs all over with 1/2 cup of the rub, patting it on with your fingers. Cover and refrigerate for about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 1/2 hour before grilling. Mix the remaining 3/4 cup cider vinegar, 3/4 cup cider, and 1 tablespoon hot sauce. You will apply this mixture to the ribs once every hour or so with a spray bottle, a barbecue mop, a pastry brush or a long-handled spoon. Soak about 3 cups of wood chips (hickory, oak or apple) for at least 1/2 hour in cold water. Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill for indirect grilling over low heat. Drain and add 1 cup of the wood chips. Grill the ribs, covered, until they are crispy, and the meat has pulled back from the bone, 3 to 4 hours, depending on the heat of your grill. Spray or baste the ribs with the vinegar-cider mixture every hour, and turn them once during grilling. Don&#39;t forget to add more wood chips--and, if using charcoal, more coals--as needed (check every hour or so). You should have enough soaked wood chips for about 3 hours of cooking time; if your ribs take longer, you will need to soak more chips. If the ribs are done before you are ready to eat, wrap them in heavy-duty aluminum foil and leave them over very low, indirect heat for up to 1 hour. Remove the ribs from the grill, spray or baste with any remaining basting liquid, and sprinkle with the remaining the 1/4 cup of rub. Serve as is, or with Vinegar Sauce. Mix together all of the ingredients in an airtight container and store at room temperature. The rub will keep for several months. Yield: about 1 cup, enough for 8 pounds of Memphis-Style Ribs. In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients. Use immediately, or cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

To make the pesto: Place all the ingredients in a food processor and process until mixture turns into a smooth paste. Set aside. To make the filling: In a saute pan over medium heat, add oil and then the sausage. Saute the sausage, breaking it up with a spoon, until it cooks through and it turns golden brown. Cool slightly and drain the fat. Set sausage aside in a bowl. Keep mozzarella and Asiago cheese on standby. To make the topping: Heat a large saute pan with oil, add the peppers, onion, granulated garlic and Italian seasoning. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and mushrooms and cook another 5 minutes. Don&#39;t overcook the tomatoes. They should retain their shape. Set aside. To make the biscuit dough: In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the butter and with your fingertips or with a pastry blender blend together until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in milk, using a fork, until the dough comes together. Sprinkle flour on a clean work surface, remove the dough from the bowl and knead several times on the floured surface. Add small amounts of flour, as needed, so that dough will be easy to roll out. Roll the dough out to roughly 15-inches in diameter and generously brush the top with the softened butter. To assemble: Spread a layer of pesto on top of the softened butter. Sprinkle the top of the dough evenly with the sausage and top with the mozzarella and Asiago. Roll the dough into a log. Cut the ends off to create even edges then cut the log into 7 or 8 pieces, depending on the length of the roll. Place slices on a baking sheet and press the tops down. Put the ends on the baking sheet and press those tops down. Bake 20 to 30 minutes until biscuits turn golden. Transfer the rolls to a serving platter. Serve topped with the sauteed vegetables and sprinkled with remaining cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 20656,&quot;All Apple Salad with Florida Dressing 6 apples of different varieties, cored and diced 1 (4-ounce) container of strawberry yogurt Juice from 4 different Florida citruses (e.g.: 1 each Valencia, navel, tangerine, tangelo) Instructions: Place apples in a large bowl.

Place it in a large deep non-metal dish. Heat a cast-iron skillet or a griddle over medium heat. Tear the chiles into flat pieces and toast them a few at a time, pressing them against the hot metal surface with a spatula until they crackle and blister. Turn to the other side and toast again. Transfer the chiles to a bowl, cover with hot water, and soak for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, toast the unpeeled garlic on the griddle until blackened outside and soft inside. Peel, discard the skins and transfer the softened cloves to a blender. Drain the soaking chiles, reserving the soaking liquid, and add them to the blender along with the vinegar. Add the cumin, black pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 3/4 cup of the cl-soaking water. Blend until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. Push the paste through a medium strainer. Remove 1/2 cup of the paste, stir the sugar in, and set it aside for the final glazing. Spread the remaining cl paste over the goat, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Set a roasting rack inside a large Dutch oven or heavy casserole. The rack should rise 1-inch above the base of the pan, if it does not, prop it up with upside-down ramekins or small empty cans. Pour 3 cans of water in the bottom of the pan and place the goat on the rack. Add water to the masa harina mixture if necessary to make a soft dough. Roll tennis ball sized pieces of dough between your palms to make long ropes about 3/4-inch in diameter, then press them firmly all around the top edges of the baking dish. Set the lid in place and press it into the masa to make a firm seal. Bake the goat for 3 hours. Break the seal by tapping the hardened masa with a cleaver or a mallet, then remove the lid and carefully lift out the goat meat, which will be very tender. Remove the rack from the pan and spoon off the fat. Measure the broth: you will need 1 quart, so make up the level with water if necessary. Pour the broth into a small saucepan ad again skim off the fat. In a mortar and pestle or a food processor, puree the roasted tomatoes and add them to the broth. Add the oregano and simmer the mixture over medium-low heat, covered, for 20 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of salt. While the broth is cooking, remove the bones, excess fat, and large baking sheet and brush with the reserved cl paste. Bake at 325 degrees for 10 minutes just to set the glaze and heat the meat through. Slice the meat across the grain and place it in large shallow heated bowls. Ladle over a generous amount of the broth and scatter a little diced onion and cilantro over each bowl. Serve with wedges of lime. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinot Noir, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 20662,&quot;French Toast Stuffed with Bacon, Onion Tomato Jam with Gruyere, and a Fried Egg 8 slices bacon, cut into 1/4-inch lardons Extra virgin olive oil 1 onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice Kosher salt Pinch of crushed red pepper 1 large beefsteak tomato, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice 2 sprigs of fresh oregano, leaves finely chopped 4 large eggs 1 cup whole milk Pinch of cayenne (optional) Kosher salt 8 slices tight-crumbed white bread 11/2 cups grated Gruyere cheese Extra virgin olive oil 4 large eggs 1 bunch of fresh chives, finely chopped (optional) Instructions: For the filling: Toss the bacon into a large saute pan with a few drops of olive oil. Bring the pan to medium heat and cook the bacon until brown and crispy, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the onion and season with salt and the crushed red pepper. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and very aromatic, 8 to 10 minutes.<br> Add the tomato, season with more salt, and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes or until the tomatoes are soft and mushy and most of the liquid has evaporated. Taste and reseason if needed. Stir in the oregano and let cool.<br> For the French toast: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.<br> In a wide, flat dish, combine the eggs, milk, cayenne (if using), and a pinch of salt. Beat until smooth and homogeneous.<br> Lay 4 slices of bread on a work surface. Using half the Gruyere, sprinkle each piece of bread lightly with cheese. Spoon a quarter of the bacon filling onto each piece of bread and then sprinkle with the remaining cheese.

Carefully place the chicken in the oil. Cook the chicken, 7 to 8 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken from the oil and let them rest, about 2 minutes. Carefully place the chicken back into the oil, about 2 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken from the oil and let them rest, about 1 minute.

Butter and flour two 9-inch diameter cake pans with 2-inch high sides. Pour the flour, baking powder, baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Use a whisk to stir together. This will get rid of any lumps and pseudo-sift the ingredients. In a separate large bowl, beat the sugar, butter and sweetened cream of coconut until fluffy and it resembles whipped cream, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and stir to incorporate all the ingredients. With the mixer on low speed, beat in 1/2 the dry ingredients, followed by the buttermilk, and the remaining dry ingredients, scraping down the sides in between each addition, just until blended. Using clean, dry beaters, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt in another clean large bowl until the egg whites are stiff but not dry. Cook&#39;s Note: You want to get the most volume from your egg whites, that&#39;s why it is essential that the beaters and bowl are clean. Just to be safe, I like to wipe the bowl out with a dash of vinegar, white or apple cider is best. The vinegar cuts through any fat in the bowl leaving only a sparkling bowl behind. And don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t be able to taste the vinegar-I promise! In batches, fold the beaten egg whites into the batter, being careful not to deflate the whites. Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Spread the batter with an offset spatula to level the batter in the pan. Bake the cakes until a tester inserted into center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a wire rack, about 10 minutes. Gently run a small sharp knife around the pan sides to loosen the cakes. Cook&#39;s Note: As the cakes cool they will shrink slightly, pulling away from the sides of the pan. By running the knife around the sides of the pan you are helping in the process by taking away any resistance. Turn the cakes out onto the racks and cool completely. With a pastry brush, gently brush any crumbs from the cooled cake layers. If the cake baked up with a slight dome in the center, you can trim it to even it out or just remember to place that cake layer dome-side down on the cake plate. Place 1 cake layer, flat-side up, on a cake plate. Spread 1 heaping cup Coconut Cream Cheese Frosting over the cake layer, leaving a 1/2-inch border of cake around the edge. This will give the filling a place to go or spread when the second cake layer is placed on top-you don&#39;t want it to bulge out the sides! Sprinkle 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut mix over the frosting. Top with the second cake layer, flat-side up. Spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake. For a retro look, I like swoopy swirls. The best way to achieve it is to spread the frosting using the back of a spoon. It&#39;s that easy! Sprinkle the remaining coconut mix over the cake, gently pressing into the sides to adhere. Coconut Layer Cake can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Beat the cream cheese in a medium bowl until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the butter and beat until smooth. Add the sugar, sweetened cream of coconut, vanilla extract and pinch of sea salt and beat until well blended, scraping down the sides as needed, for about 3 more minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: For a tropical twist, I add just a splash of fresh lime juice and a dash of finely grated lime zest to the mix! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 20665,&quot;Smirnoff and Energy Drink 1.5 oz.

Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer on medium-high speed, beat the eggs for 4 minutes. They will begin to lighten in color and become frothy. Add the granulated sugar and continue to beat for an additional 4 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low and stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Then mix in the melted butter, milk and 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla. Divide the batter among the cups and bake until the tops are golden brown, lightly spring back to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. While the cupcakes bake, mix together 1/4 cup of the confectioners&#39; sugar, the liqueur, espresso powder, cocoa powder and hot water, and stir until dissolved. When the cupcakes come out of the oven, poke 8 to 10 holes in each using a wooden skewer. Evenly but slowly spoon the coffee syrup over each cupcake. Let cool completely. When the cupcakes are cool, beat the mascarpone with the heavy cream and the remaining 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar and remaining 1/4 teaspoon vanilla until soft peaks form. Divide among the cupcakes. Garnish each cupcake with a dusting of cocoa powder and/or chocolate shavings if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 20680,&quot;Mustard-Crusted Loin of Pork with Mustard Sauce and Celery a la Mode 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 celery hearts, cut short and split in half 4 cups chicken stock 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/2 cup sliced shallot 1 teaspoon fresh thyme 1 cup white wine 1/4 cup veal stock 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, or to taste Salt and pepper, to taste 2 pounds trimmed loin of pork Salt and pepper, to taste 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup toasted and crushed mustard seed 1 cup bread crumbs Peanut oil for sauteing Unsalted butter, for sauteing Minced chive or chervil, for garnish Instructions: For the celery: Butter a shallow ovenproof pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter, place the celery in the pan, and season it with salt and pepper. Add the chicken stock to the pan to cover the celery by 3/4. Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, cover the pan, and transfer it to a preheated 400 degree oven. Bake the celery for 35 to 40 minutes, or until it is tender. Drain the cooking liquid, reserving the celery, into a large casserole and reduce it over high heat to about 2 tablespoons. Add the remaining butter, a little bit at a time, until it is emulsified and keep the celery sauce warm. Keep the reserved celery hot. For the mustard sauce: In a medium skillet melt the butter, add the shallot and the thyme, and cook the shallot over moderately high heat until it is just caramelized (a light blond). Deglaze the pan with the wine and reduce the liquid over high heat until it is almost evaporated. Add the veal stock and reduce it for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cream and reduce the liquid for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it starts to thicken. Add the mustard to taste, season the sauce with salt and pepper, and strain it through a fine sieve. Reserve the sauce. For the pork: Cut the pork into 4 pieces and season each piece on both sides with salt and pepper. Using a small spatula spread the Dijon mustard over each piece of pork. In a bowl combine the mustard seed and the bread crumbs, roll each piece of pork in the crumbs, and reserve the pork. To a preheated skillet melt enough peanut oil and butter to just cover the pan, heat the oil and butter over moderately high heat until it is hot, and add the pork. Cook the pork on 1 side until it is colored. Transfer the skillet to a preheated 400 degree oven and bake the pork, turning it to the uncooked side, for about 4 to 5 minutes, until the inside is just pink. Arrange the Spring Potato Puree on a platter, put the celery beside it, and glaze it with the warm celery sauce. Put a small ladle of the mustard sauce on the platter and arrange the pork, each piece cut into 3 slices, over the sauce. Garnish the dish with the herbs and serve the remaining sauce in a sauceboat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 20681,&quot;Samosas 2 1/2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup buttermilk or yogurt Extra flour as needed 2 large potatoes (the size of a large person&#39;s fist) 1 tablespoon butter 1 cup finely minced onion 2 medium cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger 1 teaspoon mustard seeds 1 teaspoon dried coriander (if available) 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups uncooked green peas (frozen, thawed=fine) 2 tablespoons lemon juice Cayenne, to taste 1/2 cup cider vinegar 1/2 cup water 3 tablespoons brown sugar 1 small clove garlic, minced 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Dough 1) Place the flour in a medium-sized bowl. Mix in the salt. 2) Make a well in the center, and add the buttermilk or yogurt. Mix first with a spoon and then with your hand, to make a smooth dough. 3) Add extra flour, as needed, to keep the dough from being sticky. The dough will be quite soft. knead in the bowl for about 5 minutes. Cover tightly and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble the pastries. Filling: 1) Peel the potatoes and chop them into 1-inch pieces. Place in a saucepan, cover with water, and boil until very soft. Drain and transfer to a medium-sized bowl. Mash and set aside. 2)Melt the butter in a heavy skillet. Add onion, garlic, ginger, mustard seeds, coriander, and salt. Saute over medium heat about 8 to 10 minutes, or until onions are quite soft. Add this to the mashed potatoes, along with the remaining ingredients. Mix well, but try not to smash the peas. Cool for at least 15 minutes before filling the pastries. To Assemble and Bake: 1) Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Generously oil a baking sheet. 2) Keep a small container of flour, a fork, a small bowl of water, and a pastry brush close at hand. Flour a clean surface, and, one by one, roll 1-inch balls of dough into 5-inch circles, using a rolling pin. 3) Place approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons filling in the center of each circle, and fold over, just like a turnover. Brush the inside edges of each circle with a little water, and fold the edges together to make a small hem. Crimp the edges firmly with a fork. Store in the refrigerator or freezer until baking time. 4) To bake: Place the samosas on the oiled baking sheet. Brush the tops with oil. Bake 15 minutes at 425 degrees F., then reduce heat to 375 degrees F. and bake for 10 minutes more. For maximum crispness, turn the samosas over when you turn the oven down. 5) Serve within 5 minutes of baking, with Dipping Sauce. A nice way to serve the sauce is in individual saucers or tiny bowls, so each person can hold both samosa and sauce directly under his or her face while eating, and the sauce bowl can catch the drips. (It does drip, but that&#39;s one of the charms of this ritual.) For the dipping sauce: 1) Place all ingredients in a small saucepan. Stir until the sugar dissolves. 2) Heat to boiling, then let simmer uncovered for about 10 minutes. it will reduce slightly. 3) Serve warm or at room temperature with hot samosas. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20682,&quot;Turkey Bolognese 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 onion, chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped 1 celery stalk, finely chopped 1 pound shredded cooked turkey (preferably dark meat) 3 cups marinara sauce 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound spaghetti Freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Heat the oil in a heavy large frying pan over medium heat.

Make the liquid seasoning: Combine the cherries, apple juice, jalape?o, brown sugar, honey and the reserved 2 tablespoons dry rub in a food processor and liquefy. Measure out 1 cup of the liquid seasoning and set it aside for the glaze. Brush the remaining liquid seasoning on the ribs and tightly wrap in the foil. Return to the cooler side of the grill, cover the grill and cook until the ribs are tender, about 1 more hour. Make the glaze: Combine the barbecue sauce with the reserved 1 cup liquid seasoning in a small bowl. Remove the ribs from the grill and unwrap. Brush the glaze on both sides. Return to the grill over direct heat. Cover the grill and cook, turning the ribs halfway through, until caramelized, about 10 minutes.

Return the cooking liquid to the saucepan and boil over high heat until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 8 minutes. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Add the onions, cover, and cook over low heat, stirring, until softened (about 15 minutes). Add the chicken stock and thyme and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over low heat until the onions are tender, about 8 minutes. In a medium saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the fava beans for 2 minutes or until tender. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a bowl and refresh under cool running water. Drain the favas and add them to the onions. Light a grill or heat a grill pan. Lightly oil the salmon fillets and season with salt and pepper. Grill the salmon over a medium hot fire, skin side down, until the skin is very crisp, about 4 minutes. Turn the salmon and grill over a medium fire until barely cooked through, about 4 minutes more, depending on the thickness of the fish. To serve, discard the thyme sprigs and rewarm the onions; add the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Bring the sherry-rhubarb liquid to a boil and add the cooked rhubarb. Cook over high heat, just until hot, about 1 minute. Spoon the rhubarb onto 4 large plates and over the onions.

Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Fill the individual cast-iron pans with 3/4 cup filling each and set on a baking sheet lined with foil. Take out the Perfect Pie Crust dough and separate into 6 even balls. Roll out the first one until about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out a circle from the dough slightly larger than the pan. Place the circle on top of a filled pan and press the edges slightly. Repeat with all the dough and pans. With a pastry brush, lightly wash the top of the pies with the egg wash. With a sharp knife, make small slits in the top of each pie to allow hot air to escape. Bake until the crusts are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. (The berries will bubble over slightly; that&#39;s normal.) Allow to sit for at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve each individual pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Mix the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the butter and vegetable shortening and work into the flour using a dough cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Heat butter and olive oil in a pan, then add shrimp. Cook until shrimp curls and turns pink, 1 to 2 minutes on each side (see Cook&#39;s Note). Ladle 1/4 cup Roasted Corn Emulsion on bottom of a plate. Place 3 hot Fried Green Tomato Slices side by side, on top. Add small scoops of Stone Ground Bacon Grits on each Fried Green Tomato slice. Place a shrimp on each of the stacks. Sprinkle diced tomato and chives on top. Then, dust with more Cajun spice and serve. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub corn cobs with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Place on a sheet tray and roast until cooked and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Once cooled, cut corn off of the cobs and set aside, saving the cobs. Combine shrimp base, 4 cups water and cobs in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until liquid is reduced by half, then remove cobs and discard. Add heavy cream to the pot and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate small pan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking, until it becomes the consistency of wet sand, 3 to 4 minutes, to create a roux. Remove from heat. Once the cream is simmering, whisk in the roux mixture. Reduce heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Add corn, chives and salt and pepper to taste. Stir until combined, then serve hot. Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar and Cajun spice in a large bowl to create a breading mixture. Combine buttermilk and honey in another large bowl and whisk until combined. Slice green tomatoes about 1/4-inch thick, roughly 4 to 5 slices per tomato. Place tomato slices in the honey-buttermilk mixture and gently toss to coat. Place each green tomato slice in the breading mixture, and coat both sides well. Set breaded tomatoes aside and save any remaining breading. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, to prepare for frying. Re-bread green tomato slices in the remaining breading mixture, then place in the skillet and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove fried green tomato slices from oil and place on a paper towel to absorb any remaining grease. Sprinkle with salt to taste, then serve hot. Cook the bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until browned. Add heavy cream, whole milk and 1 1/4 cups water to the pot and bring to a simmer. Stir in the grits with a wire whisk, making sure there are no lumps. Bring back to a simmer, then lower heat. Season with salt and pepper, and let simmer, stirring occasionally to ensure that no lumps form and the bottom does not burn, until grits are fully cooked, 20 to 25 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). Remove pot from heat. Whisk in mascarpone until well combined, and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot or refrigerate up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 20712,&quot;Shrimp with Garlic and Chili Pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 fresh red cl, according to size and taste, minced 2 garlic cloves, chopped 1/2 pound unshelled medium shrimp 1/2 cup white wine Salt, if needed 1 tablespoon chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Pour the olive oil into a wide, heavy-bottomed frying pan. Then add the cl and garlic and, over moderate to low heat, to infuse rather than to color, fry for 2 minutes, stirring all the time. Then turn the heat to high, add the shrimp, and stir-fry them for another 2 minutes or until they turn pink and are just, delicately, cooked; you want the flesh to stay tender. Pour in the white wine and let it bubble up. You don&#39;t want a liquid puddle around the shrimp, just enough wine to let the juices ooze into a winy sauce. Another minute or so should do it. Season with the salt, if necessary, and then turn into your bowl and sprinkle with parsley. Eat with some good hunks of baguette. I eat these carapace, head, and all: one of the reasons I designate them for solitary dinner.

Use your fingers and the flat bottom of a drinking glass to press the dough into an even layer in the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch tart pan. Place the pan in the center of the oven and bake until the tart is firm and golden brown, 12-15 minutes. Set aside. Make the almond cream: Whisk the sugar, flour and egg yolks until thick and smooth in a medium bowl. Bring the milk and almond extract to a gentle boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Pour about 1/2 of the milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly, then pour the whole mix back into the pot. Cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 5-8 minutes. Stir this mixture constantly, scraping the bottom as you stir, so the flour doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom and burn. Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with plastic wrap and cover it with a coating of plastic wrap so that it doesn&#39;t form a \\skin. Refrigerate until completely cooled. Assemble the tart: Place the tart bottom on a serving platter. Spoon the pastry cream on top. Arrange the kiwi slices, raspberries and blueberries on top of the pastry cream and brush with the jam until the fruit is coated with it. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of sliced almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 20718,&quot;Strawberry Soup 2 cups hulled and sliced fresh or (thawed) frozen strawberries 1 cup orange juice 1 cup vanilla yogurt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Whipped topping, as needed Fresh mint sprigs, optional Instructions: In a blender, combine all the ingredients but the whipped topping and mint and process until smooth.

Add the onions and sprinkle generously with salt. Bring the pan to a medium heat. Stir the onions to coat with oil. Cover the pot and sweat for 15 to 20 minutes. Once the onions have gotten very soft and let off a lot of water, remove the lid and let the onions cook looooow and sloooooooooow. That&#39;s right low and slow to really develop their rich brown color and sweet flavor. There is no shortcut or rush for this, DO NOT TRY! Caramelized onions take a long time, about an hour, accept it and move on. When the onions are very brown and have gotten considerably smaller, add the sherry and cook until the sherry has reduced by half. Add the bay leaves, thyme bundle and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and reduce heat and simmer for at least 1 hour. TASTE for seasoning, you probably will need to season with salt. If the stock reduces too much add water to keep the liquid level up- this IS a soup after all. When done, the soup should be thick and very full flavored. TASTE! You may need to resason, caramelized onions are very sweet and require a fair amount of salt. Toast or grill the baguette slices. Fill ovenproof crocks 3/4 of the way with the onion soup, float 2 toasts in each bowl and top with grated Gruyere. Place the crocks under the broiler to melt the cheese and make it brown and bubbly.

To the blender add the mustard, olives, garlic, anchovies and add half the sherry liquid. Pulse to begin and add the remaining sherry liquid slowly. Once all ingredients are homogenous add the 1/2 cup olive oil in a slow and steady stream. Vinaigrette should be emulsified and able to coat the vegetables. Adjust with the fresh ground black pepper; the olives should provide sufficient salt. Preheat a grill or grill pan. In a 2-quart pot of cold water, add the whole butter, a pinch of salt and the potatoes, bring up to a simmer. Cook until fork tender, drain. While still warm slice each potato into 3 equal parts and toss in the vinaigrette. In a pot of salted boiling water blanch and shock the summer beans. Drain and slice down the center to expose the beans inside the pod. Slice the tomatoes lengthwise and hold. Ten minutes before plating, lightly coat the tuna in the vinaigrette, before grilling.

Brush the mixture on the salmon fillets; season with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, brush a baking sheet with some melted butter. Unroll the phyllo dough and lay a sheet flat on a work surface. Brush the sheet with melted butter, then dust with some caraway and dill. Repeat with 2 more sheets of phyllo, stacking on top of each other. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, remove 4-inches off the side of the sheets to form a square. Now, cut criss-cross to make 4 even squares. Transfer the squares to the baking sheet. Lay a piece of salmon in the center of each square and fold up the corners. As you work, keep the phyllo covered with a damp, not wet, towel to prevent drying out. Brush the pastry lightly with butter and bake for 25 minutes or until the fish is opaque. In the meantime prepare the potatoes. Coat a saute pan with olive oil and cook the leeks until translucent. Cut the roasted potatoes in half lengthwise and place face down in the pan to give them color. Add creme fraiche, remaining mustard, dill, and currants.

Set the pork on a cutting board and score the fat in a crosshatch pattern, making the cuts about 3/4 inch deep and 1 inch apart. Make the rub: Combine the pimenton, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, brown sugar, celery salt, mustard powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a small bowl. Massage it into the meat. Place the pork in a roasting pan and pour the beer into the pan. Cover with foil and roast 3 hours. Check it periodically to make sure everything is going along just fine, and turn the roast over every hour. Remove the foil and continue roasting until the pork has reached an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, about 1 1/2 more hours. Remove from the oven, cover loosely with foil and let rest 30 minutes. Sometime during the marathon cooking time, make the sauce: Combine the vinegar, garlic, cl, brown sugar, tomato paste, dijon mustard and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Taste it to make sure it is delicious; set aside. Remove the cl. When the sauce is cool, I recommend putting it in a squeeze bottle for easy use. Pull the pork into long shreds using 2 forks. Get rid of the fat and anything else that doesn&#39;t look delicious. Toss the pork with any residual pan juices and add salt to taste. Serve the pork on slider rolls with a drizzle of sauce; top with coleslaw. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 20769,&quot;Vegan Cashew Cheese 2 cups raw peeled cashews 1/4 cup lemon juice 1/4 cup organic refined coconut oil 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 3/4 cup cashew milk 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley Crackers, for serving Instructions: Place the cashews in a bowl and cover with 4 cups water.

Stir and roast until the spices emit a roasted aroma and some turn a shade darker. Empty into a plate to cool, then grind in a clean coffee grinder or other spice grinder. (It is a good idea to sift the ground spices through a fine sieve, stirring them about with a spoon as they pass slowly through the mesh. This is not absolutely necessary, but it makes for a finer soup.) Add the turmeric and cayenne to the spice mixture. Put the chickpea flour in a bowl. Slowly add 2 tablespoons of the stock, mixing as you go. Add another 4 cups of stock and mix. Combine the chickpea flour mixture, spices, all the vegetables, the curry leaves, garlic, onion, and ginger in a large pan and bring to a boil.

Pour in the chicken stock and then add water as needed to cover the beans by 2 inches. Slowly bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. (If you heat them too fast, the skins may break.) Adjust the heat to maintain a bare simmer and cook, uncovered, until the beans are almost tender, 20 minutes or longer, depending on the age of the beans. Add salt, to taste, and continue cooking until the beans are tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and let the beans cool in the liquid. Meanwhile, make the bruschetta: Preheat a stove-top grill pan. Place the bread slices in a single layer on the grill pan and toast until each side is crisp and has grill marks, about 6 minutes. (You can also toast the bread in a 500 degrees F oven on a baking sheet.) Remove from the pan and lightly brush the bread slices on both sides with olive oil, then season lightly with salt. Let cool. Strain the cooled beans and other solids through a sieve, reserving the liquid. In a food processor, puree the beans and solids in batches with 3 1/2 cups of the cooking liquid and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Using a rubber spatula, push the solids through a fine mesh sieve into a clean large saucepan (you should have about 6 cups of soup in the saucepan). Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, then bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in a small skillet over high heat, warm the 1/4 cup olive oil. Turn on the fan above your stove. Add the garlic to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to turn brown.

Stir gently with your hand for about 30 seconds, then drain the water completely. Repeat, filling the bowl halfway up again with cool water, gently stirring the rice with your hand for about 30 seconds. Drain again. Combine the rinsed rice and 2/3 cup water in the bowl of your rice cooker. Follow the rice cooker\\u2019s manufacturer\\u2019s instructions for cooking short-grain white sushi rice. Stir together the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until the sugar dissolves, about 30 seconds. Once the rice is done cooking, let sit for about 10 minutes. Transfer the freshly cooked hot rice into a large bowl or hangiri (wooden sushi rice container; if using a hangiri, be sure to wet it first and give it a light wipe with a clean kitchen towel to prevent the rice grains from sticking to it). Add the vinegar dressing. Toss to combine, moving the rice paddle diagonally to avoid mashing the grains. Cover with a damp towel and let cool to room temperature, 30 to 40 minutes. For the deep fried onigirazu: Place a piece of plastic wrap on a work surface and place a nori sheet on top with the textured side facing up. Place 1/4 cup of the rice in the center of the nori sheet. With damp hands, gently form the rice into a flat diamond shape that is about 4 inches in diameter. Top the rice in this order: 4 slices avocado, 1/4 cup salmon, a flat layer of cucumber slices, 1/4 cup tuna and 2 tablespoons seaweed salad. Place about 1/4 cup rice on top and lightly press to create a flat layer. Cut 1 sheet of nori into four squares, about 4-inches each. Place 1 square on top of the stacked fillings. To wrap, start by folding the bottom corner of the base nori sheet into the center and hold it in place with your left hand. Use your right thumb to pinch in the right side of the nori, then bring the right corner to the center. Repeat pinching and folding the top and left corners of the nori until the filling is completely encased and is square in shape. Tightly wrap the onigirazu in the plastic wrap underneath. Repeat with the remaining nori sheets, rice, fillings and nori squares. Let the onigirazu sit for about 10 minutes. Put 1/4 cup of the flour and 1/4 cup of the cornstarch in a shallow medium bowl. To make the tempura batter, use chopsticks to combine the remaining 3/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup cornstarch with the ice water in a second shallow medium bowl. Put the panko in a third shallow medium bowl. Dredge each onigirazu in the flour and cornstarch mixture, then dip in the tempura batter and coat in the panko. Fill a large wok halfway with the oil.

After 15 minutes, massage and squeeze the cabbage until it begins to release liquid. Set aside for another 15 minutes, then massage again and set aside for another 15 minutes. Place the daikon in a medium bowl and season with the granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Set aside for 15 minutes. Whisk the gochugaru, water, brown sugar, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt in a third medium bowl to form a coarse paste. To make the kimchi flavor paste, use either a mini-food processor, mortar and pestle, or immersion blender and a jar to puree the pear, onion, 10 grams (about 1/6) of the ginger, 6 grams (about 1/4) of the garlic, and the salted shrimp until smooth. Add this to the gochugaru mixture and stir to combine. Squeeze as much liquid as you can from the daikon without breaking the pieces and add to the cabbage, along with the scallions, the remaining ginger and garlic, and the kimchi paste. Position a gallon-size zip-top bag inside a pitcher or some other vessel that will allow it to be held open for loading. Wearing disposable gloves, mix the kimchi paste into the cabbage mixture with your hands, being sure to thoroughly coat the cabbage with the paste (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Transfer the mixture to the plastic bag, then ditch the gloves and seal the bag, working out as much air as possible. The lactic acid bacteria that will magically transform the humble ingredients into kimchee prefer anaerobic environments. Place the sealed bag flat on a sheet pan or large baking dish and leave at room temperature until the mixture has bubbled enough to inflate the bag, at least 24 hours, but possibly up to 3 days. Transfer the kimchi and its liquid into two wide-mouthed quart-size glass jars with lids and refrigerate. Consume immediately for very fresh kimchi, or leave it for a month for a kimchi that\\u2019s deeply flavored, well-rounded, and slightly effervescent. Refrigerated, kimchi will basically never go bad and will actually improve in flavor for months after going into the jar. Cooking will mellow its flavors, so if it gets too funky for you, it\\u2019s time to make kimchi fried rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20784,&quot;Rollo De Salmon Ahumado Con Salsa Tartar Y Lentejas (Smoked Salmon Roll with Tartar Sauce and Lentils) 1/2 cup small French lentils, cooked until just tender and drained 2 tablespoons finely chopped gherkins 1 tablespoon capers, finely chopped 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh chives 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh parsley 2 spring onions, white part only, very finely chopped 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup mayonnaise 9 ounces smoked salmon, long slices (the slices should not be so thin that they fall apart) Toasted baguette slices, for serving Instructions: Put the lentils in a bowl. Then add in half the gherkins, capers, chives, parsley and spring onions. Dress with the olive oil, mustard and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. Put the mayonnaise in a bowl. Then add in the remaining half gherkins, capers, chives, parsley and spring onions. Set aside. Lay some plastic wrap on a cutting board, which will help to form the roll. Start to layer the sheets of smoked salmon on top, overlapping the slices, so that none of the filling escapes when you roll it up. Using an offset spatula (commonly used for frosting cakes), spread a thin layer of the tartar sauce right on the salmon, all the way to the outer edges of the salmon. Next, spoon on a layer of the prepared lentils over the tartar sauce layer. Using the plastic wrap to help, lift the salmon away from you and form it into a log form. (The plastic wrap helps to lift the delicate salmon. The plastic wrap should not get rolled into the salmon.) Once the roll is formed, use a very sharp knife to very gently slice the delicate roll into pieces, like a Japanese maki or sushi roll. Serve immediately on individual spoons or on top warm toasted baguette slices drizzled with a little olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20785,&quot;Johnny O Slaw 1 head green cabbage, diced 1 carrot, diced 1 1/2 cups your favorite slaw dressing Celery seed Instructions: Mix green cabbage, carrots, and slaw dressing in a bowl.

Begin adding simmering stock to rice, 1 ladleful at a time, stirring the rice constantly and continuing to cook at a constant low simmer. Add more stock each time the last addition is nearly, but not completely, absorbed. About 15 minutes after you begin adding stock, test rice by biting into a grain. It is done when it is almost cooked but still al dente, you should be able to feel a little bite in the middle of the grain, but it should not taste uncooked or gritty. Don&#39;t worry if you have not used all the stock. Remove risotto from heat and stir in butter, Parmesan and 1 cup of Cabernet wine until butter and cheese are melted.

In one bowl, add cold water according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions; the mixture should coat the back of a wooden spoon. In batches, dredge the stuffed mushrooms in the dry tempura batter mix, and then coat in the wet tempura batter. Shake off any excess batter and then carefully place the mushrooms into the hot oil, taking care not to burn yourself or splatter any oil. Fry until crisp, 5 to 8 minutes, and transfer to a plate layered with paper towels. Cooking time can vary wildly depending on the size of the mushrooms, the thickness of the batter and the number of mushrooms placed into the pan at the same time. If in doubt, take out a sacrificial stuffed mushroom and cut it in half. If the center of the crab mixture is still cold to the touch, then the rest of the mushrooms should cook for a while longer. A warm center indicates that the mushrooms are ready. For the mushroom sauce: Whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce and onion powder in a bowl. Add the corn syrup and mix until thoroughly combined. For serving: Cut the cooked stuffed mushrooms in half, drizzle some of the mushroom sauce on top and sprinkle with the black and white sesame seeds and remaining diced green onions. Serve with the remaining mushroom sauce on the side for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20804,&quot;Persian Beef Kebabs 2 pounds sirloin steak 1 medium white onion, roughly chopped 5 medium garlic cloves, crushed 1 medium lime, juiced (about 4 teaspoons) 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 2 pinches saffron (steeped a few minutes in 2 tablespoons boiling water) or 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 8 (12-inch) metal or wooden skewers, if wooden, soak in water for 15 minutes 8 medium Roma tomatoes Olive oil Lavash bread, for serving Plain yogurt, for serving Cilantro leaves, for serving Instructions: Trim any excess fat from the steaks, cut into 1-inch cubes, and place in a large nonreactive bowl.

Marinate for 1 hour at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put a baking sheet in the hot oven 30 minutes prior to using. When the baking sheet is hot, carefully remove it and place it on your stove top. Drizzle some olive oil on the baking sheet and toss with the beef and 1 cup sliced shallots. Return it to the oven and roast until the meat is medium rare, about 8 minutes. Season the spinach and radicchio with olive oil, salt and pepper and spread on a serving platter in a single layer. Place the beef and caramelized shallots on and around the leaves. Add the red wine vinegar to the baking sheet and scrape off the bits from the bottom. Add the extra-virgin olive oil and whisk the liquids together. Drizzle the salad with the vinaigrette and top with the blue cheese and Pecorino Romano. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 20848,&quot;Cookies in a Bowl (with Ice Cream) 4 cups (540 grams) all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 cup (2 sticks; 226 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 2 cups (400 grams) light brown sugar<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 2 cups (333 grams) semisweet chocolate chips<br> 1 cup (167 grams) dark chocolate chips<br> Flakey salt, for sprinkling<br> Vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, rainbow sprinkles and maraschino cherries, for topping<br> Instructions: Place an oven rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking powder until combined. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and brown sugar until just combined, scraping down the bottom and sides as needed. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and beat to incorporate. Add the flour mixture and mix slowly until just barely combined. Mix in the chocolate chips. Scoop out a slightly-heaping, 1/2-cup scoop of dough and place on a prepared baking sheet. Lightly press the dough to flatten into the shape of a hockey puck. Repeat with the remaining dough, placing 6 cookies on each baking sheet and making sure to evenly space apart. Sprinkle the tops with flakey salt. At this point, you can bake or freeze. Bake the cookies until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top, 15 to 20 minutes. (If baking from frozen, begin checking at 20 minutes.) While still warm, put a cookie in a bowl. Top with a scoop of ice cream, hot fudge, sprinkles and a cherry. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 20849,&quot;Dill Flakey Bread 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 cup pastry flour<br> 2 teaspoons sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder Oil, for greasing the bowl<br> 3/4 cup (12 tablespoons) butter, very soft<br> 1 cup chopped fresh dill<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the flour, pastry flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Create a well in the center and add 3/4 cup water. Mix until you have a shaggy dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead, adding additional flour as needed, until smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and divide into 6 balls. Keep them covered with plastic wrap when you&#39;re not working with them. Using your hands, spread 1 tablespoon butter on a large work surface, top one of the balls of dough with another tablespoon of butter and pat out into a flat circle. Put the buttered dough ball on top of the spot of butter on the work surface. Using a flat hand, gently massage the dough in circular motions (as if you&#39;re washing a window) to flatten it out into a very large translucent circle. It&#39;s ok if it tears and is not perfect just try to get it as thin as possible!<br> Top with a sprinkling of the dill and then roll it out into a long, skinny log. Roll the log into a coil and transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining dough. Roll out the coils into 7-inch-round circles by placing them between two pieces of wax paper and flattening with a rolling pin. The dough will probably want to stick to the wax paper, but it&#39;s ok if it tears while you&#39;re peeling it off. Alternatively, you can stick the rolled-out coils in the fridge for about 30 minutes, which will make them slightly easier to handle. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and cook one at a time until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Serve hot! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 20850,&quot;Banana Berry Smoothie 2 bananas 1/2 cup blueberries 1 cup plain yogurt Instructions: Peel bananas, slice and place on a cookie sheet.

Add the apples and cook until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of the brown sugar mixture and continue to cook until the apples are soft and the sugar is caramelized, about 10 minutes. Let cool.<br> Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Unfold 2 puff pastry sheets and cut a circle from each using a 7-inch bowl. Use the scraps to form the head, neck, wattle, feet and wing: Cut a piece vertically off one side of one of the scrap pieces, about 1 1/2 inches wide at the top and coming to a point at the bottom. Cut about 3 inches off the top of this strip. Pinch the pointed end and fold up and over to form the head and neck of the turkey. Next, cut 2 small triangles (about 1 1/2 inches) at the base for the feet. Cut 2 small triangles out of each foot to form 3 toes, then pinch these slightly to make claws. Cut one 2-inch-long narrow triangle with a slightly rounded base for the wattle. Cut a 4 1/2-inch triangle off the opposite corner of the scrap dough for the wing. Cut 2 small triangles from 2 of the edges and score each of these edges slightly with a few lines.<br> Transfer one of the pastry circles to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Use the egg wash to attach the head, neck, wattle and feet (the pieces should slightly overlap onto the pastry circle).<br> Unfold the remaining 2 sheets puff pastry and brush one side of one sheet with egg wash. Sprinkle the remaining brown sugar mixture in an even layer over the egg wash. Top with the second puff pastry sheet. Using the creases in the puff pastry as a guide, cut off a third of the pastry rectangle to make 2 rectangles, one large (two-thirds of the original rectangle) and one small (one-third of the original rectangle).<br> Cut 10 horizontal strips from the large rectangle, each about 3/4 inch wide, being careful not to cut completely through to the other side (these will be the feathers). Brush the right half of the pastry circle with egg wash and top with the feathers piece, curving it to follow along the right edge of the puff pastry round. Crimp with a fork to seal and twist each strip.<br> Cut the smaller rectangle into 10 horizontal strips. Twist and place around and between the larger twisted strips to fill out the feathers.<br> Add the apple mixture to the center of the puff pastry round. Brush the outside with egg wash and place the second round on top. Use a fork to seal and press down the edges of the rounds, sealing the pieces and the apples inside the round. Brush all over with egg wash (including the twists). Place the wing in the center of the round and brush with egg wash. Bake until very golden brown and puffed, 45 to 50 minutes.

When the cream starts to sizzle, stir in the curry paste into the cream like building a roux. Add the onion and half of the makrut lime leaf chiffonade. Stir-fry the paste until the paste starts to thicken, dry out, and become fragrant, about 1 minute. If the curry starts to sputter, add a small amount of coconut milk to keep the paste moving. Cook the paste until it has the consistency of peanut butter. Stir in the remaining coconut milk into the curry paste. Increase the heat to high until you reach a full rolling boil. Allow the curry to boil until it reduces by about 25% or coats the back of a wooden spoon, 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the chicken, tamarind paste, fish sauce and sugar. When the chicken is about halfway cooked, about 5 minutes, add the bell pepper and zucchini. Let simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.

Gradually whisk in the oil. For the chicken: In a medium bowl, combine the salami, pepperoncini, prosciutto, provolone and tomatoes with 1/4 cup of the dressing; toss to blend evenly. Place the chicken breasts, smooth-side down on the work surface with the thickest part at the top and the straight side on the left. Using a very sharp knife and starting on the right side, cut each chicken breast almost in half horizontally (stopping close to the left side), creating a pocket for stuffing. Open the chicken breasts like a book. Mound a fourth of the stuffing onto the right side of the breast, and press firmly to compact. Fold the left side (flap) of the chicken tightly over the stuffing. Lay three 10-inch pieces of string on the work surface 1 to 11/2 inches apart. Place the chicken on the strings and tie the strings around the chicken at intervals to keep the flap closed over the stuffing. Press in any stuffing pieces that fall out. Place the chicken breasts on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 1/4 cup of the dressing. Roast until the chicken is cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a sheet of foil. Let rest 5 minutes. For serving: Divide the arugula among four plates. Cut the strings off the chicken. Cut each breast on a slight diagonal into 1/2-inch-wide slices. Fan the slices of one breast over the arugula on each plate.

Place the butter and sugar in a clean bowl and mix together vigorously with a wooden spoon until the color and texture of the mixture becomes pale. Place the mixture into the bowl of a food processor and add the flour, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves and freshly ground black pepper. Blend the mixture. While the food processor is blending, gradually pour the eggs and honey down the funnel of the food processor&#39;s lid into the bowl until a dough has formed (you may not require all of the liquid if the dough has come together before it is used up). If the dough is too dry add a little water to the mixture. If the dough is too wet add a little flour. Halve the dough. Wrap 1 half of the dough in cling film, place it into a freezer bag, and refrigerate. Place the other half of the dough onto a floured work surface. Roll the dough, with a rolling pin, into a disk to about 1/4-inch thick. Using a set of Christmas biscuit cutters, cut decoration shapes out of the dough. Re-roll the remaining dough and cut out more shapes until the dough is used up. Remove the second half of the dough from the fridge and repeat this process. With the pointed end of a small icing nozzle, puncture a hole just below the top of each decoration (through which ribbon or wire can later be threaded to hang them). Arrange the decorations on baking sheets lined with a layer of reusable silicon baking parchment and cook for 20 minutes or until they are cooked through and golden-brown in color. Transfer the decorations to a wire rack to cool. Prepare the icing according to the packet instructions (the icing texture should be liquid enough to be easy to apply but thick enough not to run off the decorations). Ice the decorations using a teaspoon (use the tip of the spoon for dripping the icing onto the decoration and the back of the teaspoon for smoothing). Sprinkle the gold or silver balls over the decorations and press them gently onto the icing. Cut the ribbon into short lengths and thread the ribbon through the holes in the decorations. Tie the decorations to what ever needs decorating with the ribbon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 20923,&quot;Apple Butter Mustard Glaze 2 tablespoons neutral oil 2 bone-in pork chops Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 3/4 cup chicken stock<br> 1 shallot, diced<br> 1 tablespoon stone-ground mustard<br> 2 teaspoons apple butter<br> Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Heat olive oil in a medium saute pan, over high heat. Season pork with salt on both sides. Dredge pork in the spice rub and tap off any excess. Sear the pork on both sides until golden brown. Cook in the oven to medium doneness, about 8 to 10 minutes. Let pork rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 12 slices. Plate 3 slices per plate. Drizzle with the Bourbon-Ancho Sauce. Place a Sweet Potato Tamale, topped with Pecan Butter next to the slices of pork. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl. Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft. Add the bourbon and cook until completely reduced. Add the remaining ingredients and cook until reduced by half. Strain through a fine mesh strainer, return mixture to the pan, and cook to sauce consistency, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of bourbon and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt.<br> About 2 hours before you plan to form the tamales, clean the husks under running water. Soak them in warm water for 2 hours, or until softened. Puree the corn, onion, roasted garlic, and stock in a food processor. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and cut in the butter and shortening. Using your fingers, mix in the cornmeal, honey, and salt and pepper until there are no visible lumps of fat. Fold in the sweet potato puree, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and maple syrup. The mixture will be a lot looser than you think it should be, but when the tamales are steamed it will dry out. Remove the cornhusks from the water and set aside the best 20 husks. Drain and pat dry. Tear the remaining husks into 1-inch wide strips to be used for tying. Lay 2 husks flat on a work surface, with the tapered ends facing out and the broad bases overlapping by about 3 inches. Place about 1/3 cup of masa mixture in the center. Bring the long sides up over the masa, slightly overlapping, and pat down to close. (If the masa drips out a little at the seam, that is no problem.) Tie each end of the bundle with a strip of cornhusk, pushing the filling toward the middle as you tie. Trim the ends to about 1/2-inch beyond the tie. Arrange the tamales in a single layer on a steaming rack, cover tightly with foil, and steam over boiling water for 45 minutes. To Serve: slice a slit on top of each tamale and push both ends of the tamale toward the middle to expose the masa. Top each with 1 tablespoon of Pecan Butter. Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Scrape into a ramekin and refrigerate until solid, about 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo]&quot; 20937,&quot;Clam Chowder 10 cups clam juice 2 pounds baking potatoes, like russets, peeled and diced 4 pounds fresh or frozen clams, shelled and diced 1/4 pound salt pork, diced 2 small onions, diced 1 cup butter 1 cup flour 2 pints half-and-half Salt and pepper Dash hot pepper sauce Dash Worcestershire sauce Instructions: Bring the potatoes and the clam juice to the boil.

Prepare the grill. Put the soaked cobs on the hot grill and cook for 30 to 40 minutes, turning frequently. The corn is done when it feels soft when you press on it. While the corn is grilling make the lime butter: In a small bowl add the butter, lime zest, chervil, and salt and pepper, to taste. Mix well and spread onto a large plate. Spread the queso fresco onto another plate. Take the corn off the grill and carefully peel back the husks (it will be hot). Remove the corn silk and tie the husks in a knot so you can hold on to it like a handle. Roll in the lime butter and then roll in the queso fresco; sprinkle with the Ancho cl Rub. Place on a large platter and serve immediately. For the spice rub: Toast the ancho cl pieces over low heat in a dry skillet until fragrant, shaking the pan so they don&#39;t scorch.

Put a large bowl in the freezer to whip the cream. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the water, butter, and salt and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat, add the flour and cinnamon all at once, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon. Cook until the mixture forms a ball, has a slightly sweaty sheen to it, and has pulled away from the sides of the pan. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool for 3 to 4 minutes. It does not have to be cold, just cool enough so the eggs don&#39;t cook when you add them. Using an electric mixer or lots of good old fashioned elbow grease, beat in the eggs 1 at a time. Do not add the second egg until the first is fully incorporated. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag equipped with a large straight tip and pipe 1-inch balls onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Be sure to leave at least 1-inch between each of the balls, they grow! When done, dip your finger in water and smooth the top of each ball where the pastry tip was removed. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through the cooking time to insure even browning. The puffs should be light, airy, and dry inside. Cool on a rack. Put the heavy cream into the cold bowl and whip it to stiff peaks with a head mixer. Put the mascarpone in a large bowl and gently mix in the praline paste. When the praline paste is combined, begin to fold in the whipped cream. When the whipped cream is fully incorporated, spoon the mixture into a clean pastry bag. Cut the tops off each profiterole and fill with the mascarpone mixture. Replace the tops and drizzle with the warm chocolate sauce. Transfer to a large serving platter and garnish with chopped hazelnuts. Fill a medium saucepan with 2-inches of water and put it over medium heat. In a bowl large enough to sit on the saucepan without the bottom touching the water, add the chocolate, cream, butter, corn syrup, and cinnamon. Stir until the chocolate has melted and everything is combined. This is a pretty quick process. When the chocolate is melted, remove it from the heat, and spoon it over the filled profiteroles. This is best served warm!

We serve it on a fresh Oregon Hood strawberry-topped waffle with a sauce made from local rhubarb. It makes a lovely dessert piped or spooned into a martini glass with fresh strawberries or raspberries placed on top. Soften the gelatin in the cold water for 5 minutes in a microwave-safe container. After 5 minutes, microwave on high for about 11 seconds. Check to see if the gelatin is fully dissolved. If not, microwave in 2 second bursts, stirring each time, until gelatin is dissolved but not hot. Or, you could warm the gelatin in a saucepan over very low heat just to dissolve. Set aside. Place the cream and sugar into a food processor using the steel blade. Turn on and process until cream is softly whipped. This should take less than a minute. Alternatively, you could whip the cream with a mixer or whisk. Add the sour cream, rose water, and the food coloring, if using, to the processor. Turn on and immediately begin to pour the prepared gelatin in a steady stream into the food processor. Blend for 3 seconds, open the processor lid, scrape the sides and process again for a few seconds more.

Cover the wings with the Chicken Brine. Place a plate on top of the wings to keep them submerged, and allow the wings to brine for 4 hours in the refrigerator. Strain the brine from the wings and discard the brine. Place the wings back in the empty food storage container and cover with 32 ounces of the Calabrian cl Diavola Sauce. Mix the wings to coat in the wing sauce and marinate for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F with one oven rack set in the middle level for roasting the wings and another rack set to the upper level of the oven for broiling. Cover a large sheet pan with foil and brush with the olive oil to prevent the wings from sticking. Arrange the marinated chicken wings evenly on the sheet pan; be sure not to stack them. Roast the chicken wings for 15 minutes, then flip the wings over and place them back in the oven. Continue roasting the wings until the internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F when probed with a meat thermometer (avoiding bone), an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and rest it on top of the range. Set the oven to broil on the highest setting. Meanwhile, add all the roasted wings to a large mixing bowl. Add the Calabrian chiles, garlic and 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary to the wings. Toss a couple of times to coat the wings, then place them back on the sheet pan evenly. Broil the wings to create a little char on them, turning after 5 to 7 minutes to hit the other side. Arrange them on a large platter and scrape any remaining rosemary, garlic and chiles left on the pan over the wings. Arrange the celery sticks on the platter around the wings and have 6 saucers of the Doughgonzola dipping sauce and 6 saucers of the remaining Dough&#39;s Calabrian cl Diavola Sauce ready for your guests. Sprinkle the remaining rosemary over the platter and the dipping sauces for a nice color burst of flavor. Make it look nice, you worked so hard! Good job. Combine the hot water, salt, garlic, honey, peppercorns, parsley, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves and lemon zest and juice in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the salt. Remove from the heat and chill until cold. Add the olive oil to a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to appear wavy in the pan, add 15 ounces Calabrian chiles, the minced garlic and chopped onions. Saute until the onions become translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add 4 cups water and bring to a boil on high heat; reduce to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced by a quarter and the flavors have developed, about 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. Puree the mixture in a blender or food processor until smooth, scraping down the sides to capture any ingredients that stick. Continue blending the sauce and slowly add the vinegar until the mixture comes together as a sauce. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Add the reserved 5 ounces chopped Calabrian chiles for garnish. Place in a storage container and store in refrigerator. Process the buttermilk, sour cream, mayonnaise, Gorgonzola dolce and garlic in a food processor until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl and add the crumbled Gorgonzola. Blend with a spatula until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Store the dipping sauce in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Aglianico]&quot; 20980,&quot;Brownie Batter Truffles 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon baking powder Pinch fine salt 1/2 cup granulated sugar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon nonalcoholic vanilla extract Confectioners&#39; sugar or unsweetened cocoa powder, for rolling Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Microwave the flour in a small microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute.

Add a pinch of salt and squeeze in the lime juice (tip: if you roll and press the lime, you get more juice). The acid of the lime cooks the fish, so you will see it change colour. Remove the seeds from the pomegranate by bashing the back of each 1/2. Lay the fish on a plate, and from a height sprinkle on the lime zest and scatter over the pomegranate seeds. Use a sharp grater, such as a microplane, and grate the ginger over the top.

There will be extra starter left over once you remove 200 grams for the dough. Use this remaining starter as a base to refresh your leaven. (To refresh, mix 20 grams of the remaining starter, 75 grams water, 50 grams whole wheat flour, and 50 grams white flour; let it ferment 2 to 4 hours at room temperature and then place it back in the refrigerator.) Evening, First Day: Mix the dough. In a bowl, mix the starter and 400 grams water until the starter is dissolved, though lumps here and there are fine. Add the whole wheat and rye flours and stir until combined. Then add the white flour and mix for 1 to 2 minutes, until the flour dissolves and forms a shaggy mass.<br> Make an indentation on top of the dough and add the salt and 25 grams water into this well, so that the salt can begin to dissolve. Cover the bowl and let it sit for 30 to 40 minutes.<br> Moisten your hands, then shake off the water. Stretch and fold the dough by pulling the dough out from the edges and folding in toward the middle. You want to stretch the dough out to strengthen the gluten but ideally don&#39;t rip the dough. You can also pinch the dough between your thumb and fingers to further incorporate the salt. Stretch and fold the dough in a circular pattern, pulling the dough out, then folding the edges toward the middle 10 to 12 times. Turn the dough over, so that the seams are facedown and the smooth side is on top. This entire process should take about 2 minutes. At this point you can add the remaining water, letting it sit on top of the dough until the next round. Cover and let the dough sit for 30 minutes.<br> Repeat the stretching and folding for another round. Pinch the dough with your thumb and fingers to help incorporate the additional water. By this time, you should feel some tension in the gluten, but be careful not to rip the dough. Once this process is complete, turn the dough over so the smooth side is on top. Let the dough sit for 30 minutes.<br> Having completed two rounds of stretching and folding, the dough should be elastic. You may, however, add one more round of stretching and folding to further develop the gluten, after allowing it to rest for 30 minutes.<br> Remove the dough and clean and lightly oil the bowl, or move the dough to a lightly oiled container. Cover and let sit for another 30 minutes, then place it in the refrigerator or in a cool basement room ideally no warmer than 55 degrees F (13 degrees C). Let the dough rise for 8 to 12 hours, though it can rise for as long as 24 hours. However, the longer this first rise lasts, the more sour the flavor will be. Second Day: Place a rimmed baking sheet on the bottom of the oven and a baking stone on a rack in the middle. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).<br> After letting the dough rise in the cool environment, you should see fermentation bubbles, and the dough should have at least doubled in size. If it hasn&#39;t, let it warm at room temperature for another hour.<br> Dust the counter lightly with flour and gently remove the dough with a dough scraper, letting the smooth top of the dough fall onto the counter. The sticky underside will now be face up. Cut the dough in half (You can make two loaves simultaneously if they fit into the oven. Or refrigerate the remaining half the dough, then remove it and shape it into a second loaf after the first loaf is out of the oven.)<br> Preshape the dough. Stretch the four sides of the dough out and let them fall into the center. They can overlap. Then turn the dough over so that these seams are facedown. Dust with flour, cover with a light cloth or towel, and let the dough rest for 20 minutes.<br> Dust the counter with flour very lightly, then turn the dough over again so the seams are face up and the smooth side is on the counter. Stretch and then fold the edges in toward the center, so that you have an approximately round shape, which should take 6 to 8 folds. Apply light pressure in the center so the folds seal. Turn the dough over, so the smooth side is now face up, and, cupping your hands around the dough, use the outer edges of your palms and pinkies to stretch the skin of the dough and tuck it under the bottom, moving the dough in a circular motion so that you end up with a round shape. Try not to compress the loaf tightly, though the goal is to have a taut skin. (This last action takes time to master so don&#39;t worry if it doesn&#39;t come out perfect on your first attempt-there will be many more loaves to come.) Let the loaf sit while you prepare a colander lined with a floured towel. Then using the dough scraper to loosen the loaf from the counter, pick up the loaf and place the smooth side face down on the floured towel in the colander. The seams will be face up. Cover with a towel and let the loaf rise for about 90 minutes, or until the loaf springs back slowly when you lightly press it with your finger. If it snaps back into shape quickly and leaves no indentation, it is not done rising, so give it another 20 minutes and try again. This is a judgment call, but it is better to err on slightly underproofing the loaf rather than letting it rise until it collapses on itself.<br> Dust a peel or cutting board with semolina and flour or just flour. Turn the loaf out on the peel or board, so that the smooth side, which was on the towel, is now face up. Using a razor blade or bread knife, score the loaf with one cut, or in an X pattern, or in a square pattern, about 1/4 inch deep. Angle the blade while you slash the loaf with swift, sure cuts. Don&#39;t dawdle, fuss, or repeat the action.<br> Transfer the loaf to the hot stone and close the oven. Then open the oven and pour 1/2 cup water into the baking sheet and close the oven, trapping the steam. Turn the oven down to 460 degrees F (240 degrees C) and bake for 30 minutes. Open the door briefly to release the remaining steam. Then turn down the oven to 420 degrees F (215 degrees C) and continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is dark brown. Turn the oven off and prop open the door slightly with a wooden spoon, leaving the loaf in the oven for another 5 to 7 minutes. Ideally, the loaf will have a hollow knock when you remove it from the oven, signaling that moisture has adequately dissipated in the loaf. Alternatively, stick an instant-read thermometer in the bottom of the loaf. The center of the loaf should read at least 205 degrees F (96 degrees C).<br> Let the loaf cool on a bread rack for at least one hour before cutting into it. Since this loaf is made with sourdough, it will last a long time. For the first two days, I simply keep it wrapped in a towel or in a paper bag, the cut side facedown. If there&#39;s anything left after that point, I keep it at room temperature in a plastic bag. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21046,&quot;Crab Salad in Crisp Wonton Cups Nonstick cooking spray 18 wonton wrappers, thawed (if frozen) 2 teaspoons canola oil 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon lime zest 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1/4 teaspoons salt 1/8 teaspoon black pepper 1/2 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 pound lump crabmeat, picked over 1 stalk celery, finely diced 1/2 cup finely diced mango 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 2 mini-muffin tins with cooking spray. Brush the wonton wrappers with oil, and place each wrapper into a section of a mini-muffin tin. Gently press each wrapper into the tin and arrange so that it forms a cup shape. The wrapper will overlap itself and stick up out of the cup. Sprinkle with salt and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until browned and crisp. Remove from the tin and allow wrappers to cool. Meanwhile whisk together the zest, lime juice, salt, pepper, and pepper flakes. Add the oil and whisk until well combined. In a medium bowl, toss together the crabmeat, celery, mango, scallion and cilantro. Add dressing and toss to combine.

Combine the flour and some cayenne, salt and black pepper. Dredge each side of the pork chops in the flour mixture, and then set aside on a plate. Heat the canola oil over medium to medium-high heat. Add the butter. When the butter is melted and the butter/oil mixture is hot, cook 3 pork chops at a time, 2 to 3 minutes on the first side. Flip and cook until the chops are golden brown on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes (make sure no pink juices remain). Remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining pork chops. Delicious and simple! Serve with smashed new potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 21049,&quot;Grape and Grain Salad with Lemony Chicken 1/2 cup olive oil 1/2 cup sliced fresh mint 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 lemons, zested and juiced 1/2 medium shallot, finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each) 1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 cup quick-cooking barley 1 1/2 cups mixed red and green seedless grapes, halved 1/4 cup chopped walnuts 2 radishes, halved and thinly sliced 1 stalk celery, thinly sliced Instructions: Whisk the oil, 1/4 cup mint, honey, mustard, lemon zest, lemon juice, shallots, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper together in a medium bowl. Set aside 1/3 cup for the dressing. Add the chicken to the remaining marinade. Toss to coat, cover the bowl and allow the chicken to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour. Meanwhile, bring the chicken broth to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the barley, cover and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook until the liquid has evaporated and the barley is tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside to cool. Preheat a grill pan over medium-low heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, shaking off any excess. Sprinkle the chicken all over with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Grill the chicken, smooth-side down, flipping once, until cooked through and firm to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the chicken from the grill and set aside to cool. Stir the reserved 1/3 cup marinade and combine with the barley, grapes, walnuts, remaining 1/4 cup mint, radish and celery. Season with salt and pepper. Slice the chicken and serve over the salad.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 21050,&quot;Zucchini-Pistachio-Cherry Quick Bread with Cream Cheese Glaze 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter or vegetable oil, plus more melted butter, for the pan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 cup dried cherries 3/4 cup chopped toasted pistachios 1/2 cup plain yogurt or sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest, optional 1 cup shredded zucchini, excess moisture squeezed out 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 3 tablespoons cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons milk 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: For the quick bread: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush one 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan or three 6-by-3-by-2-inch mini loaf pans with melted butter and set aside. Combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add the dried cherries and pistachios and toss together. Set aside. Whisk together the melted butter, yogurt, vanilla extract, eggs and grated zest if using in a small bowl. Stir in the shredded zucchini. Fold this mixture into the flour mixture until just incorporated. Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan(s). Tap the bottom on a hard surface a few times and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes for the regular loaf and 35 to 40 minutes for the minis. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes, then turn the bread out and let cool completely on the rack. For the cream cheese glaze: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, cream cheese, milk and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Pour the glaze over the bread and allow to set at room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes.

Bring the cream and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a small saucepan, then pour over the chocolate. Shake the bowl so the chocolate is fully submerged in the cream, then let stand 1 minute. Using a small rubber spatula, slowly stir the chocolate and cream in the center of the bowl until it forms a shiny, smooth ganache. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and let stand in a cool place in your kitchen until it is thick like pudding, but still pourable and spreadable, up to 2 hours. (See Cook&#39;s Note about timing.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut three 8-inch circles out of parchment paper. Using 2 tablespoons butter, grease and flour three 8-inch round cake pans and line each pan with a round of parchment paper. Whisk the flour, baking powder and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until evenly combined. Combine the sugar and remaining 14 tablespoons butter in the bowl of a mixer and beat on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the almond filling, lemon juice and almond and vanilla extracts and beat until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the flour mixture, then stir with a rubber spatula until the batter is combined. Divide the batter equally among 3 bowls. Add the green, yellow and red food colorings to the batter in their separate bowls, then stir the colorings. Scrape each batter into a prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a small offset spatula or rubber spatula. Bake until the cakes are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the middle of each cake comes out clean, 20 minutes.<br> Transfer the cake pans to a wire rack and let cool 15 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the rack, remove the cake pans and discard the parchment paper rounds. Let the cakes cool completely, about 30 minutes. Flip the cakes right-side up and trim the top of each cake with a serrated knife so that it is flat, if necessary. Place the green cake on a cake stand and spread 1/4 cup jam evenly over the top. Place the yellow cake over the green and spread the remaining 1/4 cup jam evenly over the top. Place the pink layer on top, then loosely wrap the cake in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Unwrap the cake and scrape the ganache on top (the ganache will be the consistency of thick pudding). Using an offset spatula, spread the ganache evenly over the side and top of the cake, leaving a slightly thicker layer on top. Once the ganache is smooth all around, drag the tines of a fork in a wavy pattern across the top of the entire cake. Refrigerate the cake to set the ganache, about 30 minutes. Allow the cake to come to room temperature before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Pinot Noir]&quot; 21052,&quot;Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 20 ripe plum tomatoes, peeled and seeded Pinch crushed red pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 fresh basil leaves, chiffonade 1 pound spaghetti 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1-ounce freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, (about 2 tablespoons) Instructions: In a wide pan over medium-high heat, heat 1/3 cup of olive oil until quite hot. Add the tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and season lightly with the salt and pepper. (I always start with a light hand with the salt and pepper because as the tomatoes reduce, the salt will become concentrated.) Using a potato masher, mash the tomatoes finely. (This will be easier to do as the tomatoes begin to heat up.) Cook the tomatoes for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tomatoes are tender and the sauce has thickened. Meanwhile, stack and roll the basil leaves into a cylinder and cut thinly crosswise into a chiffonade. Bring a large pot of amply salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until just shy of al dente. Reserve a little of the pasta cooking water. Add the pasta to the sauce and cook over medium-high heat, gently tossing the pasta and the sauce together with a couple of wooden spoons and a lot of exaggerated movement (you can even shake the pan) until the pasta is just tender and the sauce, if any oil had separated from it, now looks cohesive. (If the sauce seems too thick, add a little pasta cooking liquid to adjust it.) Take the pan off of the heat and toss the butter, basil and cheese with the pasta in the same manner (the pasta should take on an orange hue) and serve immediately. Cook&#39;s Note: Here is a good tip for peeling and seeding tomatoes: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Have a large bowl of ice water nearby. Cut a small shallow X on the bottom of each tomato. Ease about 5 tomatoes into the pot and cook for about 15 seconds, and then promptly move them to the ice water. (Do this with the remaining tomatoes.) Pull off the skin with the tip of a paring knife. If the skin sticks, try a vegetable peeler using a gentle sawing motion. Cut the tomatoes in half and use your finger to flick out the seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 21053,&quot;Caprese Salad 2 cups balsamic vinegar 3 ripe tomatoes 12 ounces fresh mozzarella, thickly sliced Large bunch fresh basil leaves Olive oil, for drizzling Large pinch kosher salt Large pinch freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Measure the balsamic vinegar and pour into a saucepan. Bring it to a gentle boil over a low heat. Cook it until the balsamic vinegar has reduced to a nice thick glaze (but still pourable), about 15 minutes. Oh and one other thing, your house will stink. But it&#39;s a good kind of stink, it&#39;s a vinegary stink. Allow the reduction to cool to room temperature before you serve it. When you are ready to assemble the salad, cut the tomatoes into thick slices. Arrange them on a platter, alternating them with the mozzarella slices. Tuck the whole basil leaves in between the tomato and cheese slices. Drizzle on the gorgeous, almost black balsamic reduction. Then drizzle olive oil in a thin stream over the top. Finally, sprinkle on salt and pepper. You need this in your life.

If using a charcoal grill, bank very hot coals on one side of the grill. Put the cider, bourbon and honey in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until reduced by half. Whisk in the butter and hold the sauce in a warm place<br> Rub the chops with some olive oil, then sprinkle with the coriander and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Grill on the hot side of the grill for 3 minutes per side. Move the chops to the cooler side of the grill, cover with the lid and cook, occasionally brushing with the glaze, until they reach desired tenderness and temperature, 145 degrees F for pork.

Rinse a large stainless steel or enameled stockpot or soup pot with the sanitizing solution and pour the milk and cream into the pot. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring as necessary with a sanitized spoon so the milk doesn&#39;t scorch on the bottom of the pot. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the lemon juice. Continue stirring slowly until the milk curdles and white curds float to the top. Remove from the heat and cover. Wait for 5 minutes while the curds solidify slightly and become firmer. Rinse a colander and a large piece of muslin or several layers of cheesecloth in the sanitizing solution. Wring out the cloth to release the excess water. Line the colander with the cloth and set the colander in the sink or over a large bowl. Using a sanitized perforated spoon, gently ladle the curds into the colander. Let the whey drain for 30 minutes, or until the ricotta is still moist but fairly dry. After about 15 minutes, lift the edges of the cloth toward the center of the colander to loosen the cheese from the cloth and facilitate draining. If the ricotta is still too liquid and runny in texture after 30 minutes, gather the edges of the cloth together using 1 hand, wrap a piece of kitchen string around the gathered cloth to form a bag, and tie it closed. Hang the bag containing the cheese from the faucet or the handle of a kitchen cabinet door and allow the excess whey to drip from the bag into the sink or a bowl. If adding salt, transfer the ricotta to a sanitized bowl and stir in the salt. Place the ricotta in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator. Use within 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 21072,&quot;Grilled Mussels with Herbed Bread Crumbs 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 cloves garlic, peeled and \\pressed<br> Kosher salt 1 cup bread crumbs, toasted golden brown 1 cup washed, dried and coarsely chopped parsley leaves 2 sprigs mint, washed, dried, and leaves coarsely chopped 3 dozen mussels, scrubbed, \\beards\\ removed 1 or 2 lemons, halved Instructions: I love using the heat of the grill to open shellfish. I think they come out as juicy as if they were roasted in the oven. The flavors of garlic, parsley and mint make this a great opener to a meal or a nice side dish or nibble. The crunch of the bread crumbs is also a great texture contrast to the mussels and the flavors evoke the natural sweetness of the mussels. Preheat the grill or grill pan to medium. Heat a large skillet over low heat and add the olive oil. When the oil is warm add the garlic. Stir the garlic with a wooden spoon and season with salt, to taste. Give the garlic a minute to \\melt\\ into the oil but do not let it brown. Stir in the bread crumbs, parsley and mint. Taste for seasoning, Set aside. When the grill is hot, scatter the mussels on the grill in a single layer. Have a pair of tongs and a large platter ready. As the mussels open, use the tongs to remove them from the grill onto a platter. When they are all opened, squeeze the juice from the lemons over them and spoon the bread crumb mixture into the shells. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 21073,&quot;Belgian Cream Puffs with Chocolate Cherry Sauce 6 maraschino cherries, drained 1 (12 oz.) jar Smucker&#39;s?

Transfer to a large plastic zip-top bag and refrigerate overnight. At least 30 minutes before grinding the meat, place all of your tools (including the meat grinder parts, stand mixer bowl, stand mixer paddle attachment and sausage stuffer parts) in the freezer to chill. Using your meat grinder, grind the marinated meat mixture through the small die plate into the chilled bowl of the stand mixer. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes, then return the mixture to the mixer. Add the feta, olive oil and wine and beat on medium speed using the chilled paddle attachment until combined. Refrigerate until ready to use. Stuff the sausages (see Cook&#39;s Note) and, for best results, refrigerate overnight. Before cooking, pierce each sausage several times with a pin. Grill over medium heat until the center registers 160 degrees F, 10 to 12 minutes. (You can also pan-fry or broil the sausages.) Drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil, sprinkle with parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve the sausages with the tomato salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 21079,&quot;Oatmeal, Cranberry and Chocolate Chunk Cookies 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup sugar 1 large egg, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups old fashioned oats 1 cup dried cranberries 1 (4-ounce) 60 percent cacao bittersweet chocolate bar (recommended: Ghirardelli), chopped into 1/4-inch chunks Instructions: Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugars together until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until smooth. With the machine running, gradually add the flour mixture. Add the oats, cranberries and chocolate chunks. Mix until just incorporated (dough will be stiff). Using a 4-ounce cookie scoop, scoop slightly rounded mounds of the dough into 12 (2-inch-diameter) balls. Arrange 6 balls of dough, spaced evenly apart, on each baking sheet. Using the back of a spoon, flatten the tops slightly and bake until the cookies are slightly golden on the edges, about 13 to 15 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 21080,&quot;Braised Pork Fillets with Prunes and Cream Sauce 18 large dried pitted prunes 2 cups dry white wine 6 rib pork chops, 1 1/2-inch thick Canola oil 1/4 cup each diced carrot, celery, and onion 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup heavy cream or creme fraiche 2 teaspoons red currant jelly 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon minced parsley Instructions: Simmer the prunes in the wine over moderate heat, covered, until plump and tender, about 10 minutes. Strain and reserve the red wine. Bone and tie the pork fillets. Saute the fillets in the oil until they are a rich golden brown on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer fillets to a plate. Add the mirepoix and the bones to the pan and saute to brown lightly, 8 to 10 minutes. (Additional oil may have to be added to keep the mirepoix from burning.) Add the wine from the prunes and deglaze the pan. Place the pork fillets on top of the mirepoix (the liquid should come part way up the pork chops), cover, and simmer gently over very low heat or until the fillets are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, 5 to 8 minutes. Place the fillets in an oven pre-heated to 325 and immediately turn off the heat. The meat should be cooked within 10 and 15 minutes. Take care not to overcook the pork. Use tongs to transfer the meat to a heated platter and remove the strings. Arrange three prunes on each fillet, then cover the fillets with foil. Pour the rest of the contents of the pan through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing down on the vegetables to extract all the juices. Return the juices to the pan and reduce by half rapidly, stirring and scraping any brown bits that cling to the pan. Add the cream and continue to boil down rapidly until the color becomes a light beige and the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Whisk in the jelly and continue to cook, whisking, until the jelly is dissolved. Taste and correct seasoning of the sauce. Spoon the sauce over the fillets, sprinkle with minced parsley, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Garnacha]&quot; 21081,&quot;Chicken Tikka Masala 1 cup plain yogurt, whisked until smooth 3 tablespoons Ginger-Garlic Paste, recipe follows (or 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger and 3 cloves garlic put through a garlic press or finely minced) 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, poked with a fork, and cut into large bite-sized chunks 2 teaspoons olive oil 3 tablespoons butter 1/3 cup Ginger-Garlic Paste, recipe follows (or 6 cloves garlic and 2-inch thumb ginger minced) 2 serrano peppers, minced (seeds removed if you don&#39;t want it spicy) 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1 teaspoon garam masala 2 teaspoons paprika 8 Roma tomatoes, diced 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 to 2 cups water Oil, for grilling 1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves (optional) 1/2 cup heavy cream Minced fresh cilantro, for garnish Cooked rice, naan, or crusty piece of bread, for serving 1/2 cup cloves garlic, whole 1/2 cup fresh ginger, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch slices 1/4 cup canola oil Instructions: For the marinade: In a large bowl, mix together the marinade ingredients. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Marinate at least 30 minutes, or in the refrigerator up to overnight. For the sauce: When you&#39;re ready to make the curry, place a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and butter. When the butter has melted, add the Ginger-Garlic Paste and serrano peppers. Saute until lightly browned around the edges. Add the tomato paste and cook until the tomato has darkened in color, about 3 minutes. Add the garam masala and the paprika and saute for about 1 minute to draw out their flavors. Add the tomatoes, salt, and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, turn down to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. You may need more water depending on how much liquid the tomatoes give off. Meanwhile, fire up your grill. When it is nice and hot, lightly brush it with oil. Place the chicken on the grill, shaking off some of the excess marinade. Cook until it&#39;s charred, about 2 minutes on each side. (Don&#39;t worry that the chicken will still be a little uncooked, it finishes cooking in the sauce). Pour the sauce into a blender or food processor, or use an immersion blender, and process until smooth. Pour back into the skillet and bring back up to a boil. Add the chicken and fenugreek leaves, if using. Take the heat down to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes. Add the cream and stir through. Garnish with minced fresh cilantro, and serve over rice, with naan, or a crusty piece of bread! Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste. Save what you don&#39;t use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It&#39;s a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 21082,&quot;Radish Tzatziki 6 medium radishes, scrubbed and trimmed 2 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane zester<br> 1 1/4 cups plain whole milk Greek yogurt (10 ounces)<br> 1 tablespoon good olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1/4 cup minced scallions, white and green parts (2 scallions)<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons julienned fresh mint leaves<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Grate the radishes on a box grater.

Place them into the oven and roast 15 to 20 minutes, until very tender when pierced with a knife. Meanwhile, put the duck breasts on a cutting board skin side up and score all over in a tiny crosshatch pattern, so the fat will render and the skin will crisp. Season all over with salt and pepper and drizzle with 1 tablespoon sesame oil. Add the breasts to a stainless steel pan over medium heat, skin side down, and cook slowly for about 12 to 15 minutes until the fat is rendered and the skin is browned and crispy. Occasionally spoon the fat out into a bowl. Turn the breasts and cook 1 to 2 more minutes for medium-rare. Transfer the duck to a cutting board to rest. To serve, cut the duck breasts crosswise, on an angle, into 8 slices each. Mound the Sesame Noodles evenly between 4 bowls. Add half a sliced duck breast to each bowl along with a peach half. Garnish with watercress and lime wedges. Cold Sesame Noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the noodles and stir to keep them from sticking together. Cook until barely tender and still firm, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain immediately and rinse under cold running water to cool. Drain the noodles really well, transfer to a wide serving bowl, and toss immediately with 3 tablespoons of the sesame oil so they don&#39;t stick together. Meanwhile, make the sauce.

Prepare the crepe batter: In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and milk until well combined. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and let it bubble and foam. Continue to cook until the butter turns light brown, then whisk the butter into the milk and egg mixture. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, scallions, salt, and pepper. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture, whisking to prevent lumps. Do not overwork the batter. The batter should just coat the back of a spoon. If it seems too thick, whisk in a little milk or water. You should have about 2 cups of batter. Cook the crepes right away, or cover the batter and refrigerate for as long 24 hours. Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-heat. Add 1/2 teaspoon butter to coat the bottom of the pan. Add 1/4 cup of batter to the skillet. Remove the skillet from the heat and tilt it to evenly coat the bottom with the batter. Return the skillet to medium-high heat and cook until the underside is lightly browned, 50 to 60 seconds. Using a spatula or your fingertips, carefully turn the crepe over and cook on the second side for 10 to 15 seconds. Set the cooked crepe aside on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter to make 8 crepes total. Lightly spray the bottom of 2 (10-inch) pie plates with oil. Stack 2 crepes in the bottom of each plate. Spread a single layer of chicken over each stack of crepes and set 1 more crepe over each layer of chicken. Spread another layer of chicken on top. Finish the stacks with 1 more crepe on top of each.

In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until just crispy. Drain on paper towel lined plate and set aside. Crumble the bacon when cool to the touch. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the thyme and cream over low heat to a bare simmer. Turn off the heat and let steep for about 5 minutes. Remove the thyme sprigs. Remove the pie pan from the refrigerator. Slice the potatoes in half lengthwise and then finely slice the potatoes. Working in circles, arrange the potato slices in the pie crust, stopping to season each layer with salt, pepper, and about 1/4 of the crumbled bacon. Continue layering until the pie pan is nearly full. Top with an even layer of the cheese and gently pour cream around and over the entire pie, allowing it to seep down between the potato slices. (You may not use all the cream.) Roll out the remaining disk of refrigerated dough. Cover the pie with the dough and crimp the edges closed. Brush the top and edges of the crust with egg wash. Make a few slits in the center of the top crust, for the steam to escape, and put the pie pan on a baking sheet. Bake the torte until the crust is browned and crispy and the potatoes are cooked through, about 50 to 60 minutes. If the crust edges get too brown, cover them with some strips of aluminum foil. Remove the pie from the oven and let rest at least 15 minutes before cutting into wedges and serving. Put the butter, flour, and salt in the food processor, and pulse lightly just until the mixture resembles wet sand. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing briefly after each spoonful of water. Keep adding water until the dough just begins to gather into larger clumps. Transfer equal amounts of the dough into 2 resealable plastic bags and pat each into a disk. Let rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Remove 1 of the disks from the bag to a flour coated surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out to a 10-inch round. Gently fit the rolled dough into a 9-inch pie pan, and refrigerate while you prepare the torte ingredients. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 21118,&quot;Rice Fritters With Sesame Caramel 1/3 cup sesame seeds 1 large orange 1/2 cup sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup heavy cream Pinch of salt 4 3/4 cups whole milk Pinch of salt 1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 cup medium-grain white rice 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk 1/4 cup sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 11/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 large egg Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Make the caramel: Toast the sesame seeds in a skillet over medium heat until golden. Transfer to a dish. Remove the peel from the orange in wide strips, then squeeze the orange juice into a separate dish; set aside. Cook the sugar in a skillet over medium heat, swirling the pan, until deep amber. Whisk in the butter, cream and salt until dissolved. Add the orange peel and juice. Cook, whisking, until the sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the sesame seeds. (You can refrigerate the sauce, covered, up to 1 day; reheat before serving.) Make the fritters: Bring 4 cups milk, the salt and cinnamon to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the rice, reduce the heat to medium, and cook, stirring, until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Add the condensed milk and 2 tablespoons sugar; cook, stirring, until thick, 5 to 10 more minutes. Stir in the vanilla and let cool completely. Roll tablespoonfuls of the rice mixture into balls. Put on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet; cover and chill until ready to fry. Make the batter: Whisk the flour, baking powder and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl. Whisk the egg and the remaining 3/4 cup milk in a liquid measuring cup; gradually whisk into the flour mixture until smooth. Heat 2 inches vegetable oil in a wide saucepan until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350degrees F. Working in batches, dip the rice balls in the batter using a fork, then fry until golden, turning once, about 8 minutes per batch. (Return the oil to 350degrees F between batches.)

In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the half-and-half, cream and vanilla bean to a simmer, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer turn it off, do not let it boil! In a thin stream, whisk half of it into the egg yolk mixture. Then pour the egg-cream mixture into the saucepan containing the rest of the cream mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees, it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready, if the edges blur, it is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove from the heat. Meanwhile, remove the bowl from the freezer, put 4 handfuls of ice cubes in the bottom, and add cold water to cover. Rest a smaller bowl in the ice water. Strain the cream mixture through a fine sieve to remove the vanilla bean pieces, into a smaller bowl. Chill 3 hours, then freeze according to the directions for your ice cream maker. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21120,&quot;Tres Leches Cake 1 pound cake, loaf-style 6 ounces evaporated milk 8 ounces heavy whipping cream 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 1 cup heavy whipping cream 1/4 cup sugar Chocolate covered candies, all in 1 color (recommended: M&amp;M&#39;s) 1/2 cup crushed skittles Instructions: With a fork, punch some holes in the cake still in its loaf pan.

Place a sheet pan in the oven to preheat. Slice the pork tenderloin lengthwise, so it will open like a book, being careful to not cut all the way through. Open the loin and gently pound with a meat mallet until it is an even thickness and rectangular in shape. Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper. Spread the cream cheese in an even layer on the meat, leaving a 1/2 inch of pork uncovered around the edges. Spread the pesto on top of the cream cheese, then sprinkle on the pine nuts and sundried tomatoes. Top with an even layer of spinach. Starting on one of the longer sides of your rectangle, roll the meat closed into a long tube and set aside. Place a piece of plastic wrap on a flat surface and lay out the bacon so the slices overlap slightly. Lay the rolled pork tenderloin at one end of the bacon strip arrangement, seam-side down. Using the plastic wrap, roll the bacon up and around the meat. Using butcher\\u2019s twine, tie around the bacon at 2-inch intervals along the length of the roll, so that the bacon cannot come loose during cooking. Tuck the meat closed on both ends and secure with toothpicks. Place the pork, seam-side down, on the heated sheet pan and roast until the bacon is browned and the pork is cooked, about 45 minutes. Let the pork rest for a few minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 21142,&quot;Potato Chip Fried Chicken Wing with Chili-Lime Aioli 1 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice<br> 1 tablespoon chili powder<br> 1 teaspoon sugar<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup crumbled potato chips (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon chili powder<br> 1 tablespoon dried rosemary<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 12 jumbo chicken wings<br> 3 eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups canola oil<br> Instructions: For the aioli: In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, lime juice, chili powder, sugar and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper.

Allow the mixture to sit until quite bubbly, about 30 minutes. Mix together the white flour, rye flour and salt in a bowl. Stir 1 cup of this mixture and 1 cup of cold water into the sponge. Mix thoroughly and allow to sit another 30 minutes. Add the whole-wheat flour, chestnut flour and the olive oil. Knead the dough either by hand or in an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix until the dough is soft and elastic, about 5 minutes. You may need to add a little more flour if the dough is too wet, but you want a soft, slightly sticky dough. Very soft, moist dough makes the best crust! Put the dough in a large bowl, cover with a towel and allow it to rest in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours. If you are making the dough a day before, put the bowl in the refrigerator and let rise slowly overnight. To cook the doughboys, preheat a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pot, with enough oil to come halfway up the sides of the pot, to 375 degrees F. Be sure to use a frying thermometer to be accurate. Pull the dough into odd shapes that look like elephant ears, then drop them into the fryer, in batches, and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip them over with a chop stick and cook the other side until golden brown, a few more minutes. Repeat the process until all of the dough is used. Arrange them on a serving platter and serve with jam, maple syrup, and powdered sugar. Sit down, get coffee and eat.

Add the chili, coriander, cumin, and crushed cardamom pods and stir well. Add the peppers then break up the ground beef into the pan and, using a fork, keep turning it to separate it as the meat browns. Add the chopped tomatoes, ketchup, tomato puree, and water stirring to make a rich red sauce. When the chili starts to boil sprinkle over the cocoa and stir it in. Add the beans and simmer partially covered for 1 1/2 hours. At this point you can cool and freeze the chili, or just keep it in the refrigerator overnight. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Pour the chili into a large, wide dish or keep in the pan you cooked it in if it is ovenproof. Combine the salt, cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and cinnamon in a bowl. Whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, honey, and oil in a jug, and then stir into the dry ingredients mixing to make a vivid yellow batter. Pour the cornmeal topping over the chili con carne, or blob it over to cover the top as evenly as possible. Sprinkle the cheese over the top of the cornbread and then bake in the oven for 30 minutes or until the cornbread topping is risen and golden and the chili underneath is bubbling. How long this takes depends on the how cold or hot the chili was when it went into the oven. Since it&#39;s such a huge vat, you may find it easiest to reheat it on the stove in its pan first. Let the chili stand for about 5 minutes once out of the oven before cutting the cornbread top into squares or slices to serve with a helping of chili underneath.

In a separate medium bowl, combine the ricotta and egg. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add in the garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring frequently and controlling the heat to prevent browning, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the milk and chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a boil and continue whisking until the sauce has thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in 1/4 cup of the prepared pesto. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk 1/4 cup of the pesto cream sauce and the remaining 2 tablespoons prepared pesto into the ricotta mixture. Set aside the remaining sauce. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Working in batches, add the pasta sheets to the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes; transfer to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with the olive oil. Add 1/2 cup of the pesto cream sauce to the bottom of the baking dish. Place 1 pasta sheet on top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 cup of the ricotta mixture evenly over the pasta and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the mozzarella mixture. Drizzle 1/3 cup pesto cream sauce over the cheese.

Use a rubber spatula to fold in the horseradish and chives; season with salt and pepper. Hand-form the meat into 8 burgers, cover them, and chill in the fridge while preparing your grill. Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill and get it very hot. Burgers stick to a cold grill, so it&#39;s important that you give it plenty of time to heat. Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel then carefully and quickly wipe the hot grates of the grill; this will create a non-stick grilling surface. Grill the burgers for 8 minutes per side for medium; 7 minutes if you like your meat rare. When the burgers are just about cooked, put a couple of slices of cheese on top of each and cover the grill for 1 minute to melt the cheese. Remove the burgers to a clean side plate so you have enough room to toast the buns. Rub the grill rack with the same paper towel as before to clean the small charred pieces, then toast the hamburger buns cut-side down for 1 minute. Serve the burgers with your favorite condiment and any garnish you like, such as bacon, lettuce, sliced tomato, and onion. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 21188,&quot;\\Big Night\\ Appetite 2 tablespoons EVOO, plus more for drizzling 3/4 pound ground beef sirloin (80 percent lean)<br> 3/4 pound hot Italian sausage, bulk or cut from casing<br> 1 small to medium onion<br> 4 cloves garlic<br> 4 sprigs of fresh rosemary<br> Salt and pepper<br> 2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato paste<br> 1/2 cup red vermouth or red wine<br> Two 15-ounce or one 28-ounce can Italian cherry tomatoes or San Marzano tomatoes<br> 1 1/2 cups passata (tomato puree) or cherry tomato passata<br> 1 pound fusilli lunghi (long fusilli), fusilli short pasta curls or cavatappi (hollow pasta corkscrews)<br> Grated pecorino, to serve<br> Bruschetta with Ricotta and Walnuts, recipe follows Escarole and Fennel Salad, recipe follows 1/3 cup walnut halves A few stems of fresh thyme (a small handful)<br> 1 small lemon<br> About 1 1/2 cups of fresh ricotta cheese (sheep&#39;s milk or cow&#39;s milk)<br> 2 cloves of garlic<br> Salt and pepper<br> EVOO, for liberal drizzling<br> Crusty peasant-style white bread, sliced for bruschetta (1/2 inch thick)<br> Flaky salt, for sprinkling 1 head escarole, cleaned 1/2 bulb fennel<br> 1 small red onion<br> 3 ribs celery with leafy tops<br> 1 lemon<br> EVOO, about 3 tablespoons<br> Shaved pecorino, for serving<br> Salt and pepper<br> Instructions: Place water on to boil for pasta.

The first part of the tower you should make is the base. Spread the white chocolate on a parchment paper-lined work surface. When the chocolate is partially set, use an X-acto knife to cut a base that is large enough to accommodate the bottom of your tower. Using the template provided, cut the aluminum flashing into the shape of a side of the Eiffel Tower, being sure to make all of the cutouts. If you start with a small tower, you will have more success. Lay a parchment paper-lined sheet pan that is as large as your template on the work surface. Spread the bittersweet chocolate over the baking sheet. Make it thicker at 1 end (where you will place the bottom of the template) to create support for the height of the tower. When the chocolate is partially set, place the aluminum template on the chocolate and use an X-acto knife to trace it. Remove the template. Pick up the chocolate panel by the corners of the parchment paper and move onto a new sheet pan. Place a couple of rulers under the bottom of the chocolate panel, creating a curve at the bottom of your tower. Allow chocolate to set. When set, peel up the tower panel from the parchment paper, freeing it from the excess chocolate surrounding it. Cut 3 more tower panels using the same process. Make sure the curves in each piece are the same or your tower will not work. The next step is to assemble the tower, however assembly will be easier if you enlist the help of a friend. Place the base on your work surface. Use bittersweet chocolate to \\glue\\ the bottom half of two sides together creating a 90-degree angle, or one corner of the tower. \\Glue\\ them onto the base. When the chocolate sets, \\glue\\ the other two sides together and attach them to the base. Using a coronet, apply more chocolate on the bottom half of all of the seams to reinforce the tower. When that chocolate sets, go back and gently seal the tops of the tower sides with more bittersweet chocolate. Decorate the outside of the tower with a cornet filled with white chocolate. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 21199,&quot;Dave Grohl&#39;s Badass Lasagna 6 tablespoons olive oil 4 tablespoons lightly salted butter, plus more for greasing the pan 3 small onions, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 3 stalks celery, finely chopped 2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped 2 bay leaves 2 1/2 pounds plant-based ground beef alternative 3 tablespoons tomato paste\\u202f 7 ounces marinara sauce or tomato passata 1 1/2 cups red wine 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth 4 pinches ground nutmeg Sea salt\\u202fand freshly ground black pepper 9 no-boil lasagna sheets 14 ounces whole milk mozzarella, coarsely grated 2 ounces grated Parmesan Instructions: Heat the oil and butter in a large flame-proof pan over medium heat.

Roll out the pate sucre to a circle about 1/4 inch thick and large enough to slightly overlap a 9-inch metal tart pan. Fit the dough into the pan and trim the edges. Line the bottom and sides of the shell with parchment, or coffee filter papers, or aluminum foil. Fill the lining with dried beans, rice or aluminum beans and bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool and remove the beans and the lining. Return the shell to the oven and bake until golden, 5 to 10 minutes longer. In a large metal bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks, 1 cup sugar, lemon and lime juice, and zests. Set over simmering water and continue to whisk until the mixture is very thick, about 10 minutes. Turn off the flame and whisk in the butter, a few pieces at a time. (You don&#39;t want the mixture to cool down before all the butter is incorporated.) Strain the filling into a bowl. Scrape into the baked tart shell and smooth with a metal spatula. Cool and then refrigerate until firm, 3 to 4 hours, up to overnight. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar evenly over the top of the filling. With a propane blowtorch, caramelize the sugar. (This can also be done under the broiler. Place the tart on the broiler tray directly under the flame, watching carefully to prevent burning). Refrigerate the tart for at least 30 minutes. Or, if desired, eliminate the 2 tablespoons of sugar and arrange circles of raspberries on top of the tart. Sift a little powdered sugar over the berries just before serving. Cut into slices and serve. If you have caramelized the sugar, serve the tart with fresh strawberries or raspberries. In a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour and sugar. Add the butter and process until the texture resembles fine meal. In a small bowl, whisk together the yolks and 1 tablespoon of the cream. Scrape into the machine and process until a ball begins to form, using the additional tablespoon of cream, if necessary. Remove the dough from the machine, and on a lightly floured surface, press down into a circle. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 21206,&quot;Salted Caramel-Pecan Tart For the crust: Cooking spray 1 3/4 cups pecans 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 6 tablespoons cold salted butter, cut into small pieces 1 large egg yolk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract For the filling: 2/3 cup sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons salted butter, thinly sliced and at room temperature 2 large eggs 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 ounce semisweet chocolate, finely chopped Sea salt, for sprinkling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make the crust: Lightly coat a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom with cooking spray. Spread the pecans on a baking sheet and roast until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes; let cool. Transfer 1/2 cup of the pecans to a food processor; add the flour, sugar and kosher salt and pulse until the nuts are finely ground. Add the butter and pulse until it is in pea-size bits. Pulse in the egg yolk and vanilla until large clumps form. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and press it into the bottom and up the sides. Prick the bottom all over with a fork, then freeze until firm, about 20 minutes. Line the crust with foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until set, about 25 minutes, then remove the foil and weights and continue baking until golden, 10 to 15 more minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Make the caramel for the filling: Combine the sugar, 1/4 cup water and the kosher salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring just until the sugar dissolves. Cook, swirling the pan but not stirring, until amber, 8 to 10 minutes. Brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Remove from the heat and carefully whisk in the heavy cream, butter and vanilla (the mixture will bubble). Return to medium heat and simmer, whisking constantly, until thick enough to coat a spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Gently whisk the eggs and flour in a large bowl, then whisk in the caramel. Place the crust on a baking sheet, arrange the remaining 1 1/4 cups pecans in the bottom and add the filling. Bake until set around the edge, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Drizzle over the tart and sprinkle with sea salt. Let the chocolate set before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 21207,&quot;Butternut, Arugula and Pine Nut Salad 1 butternut squash, approximately 2 1/4 pounds 1 teaspoon kosher salt or 1/2 teaspoon table salt 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon ground ginger 2 tablespoons cold-pressed canola oil or olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons for dressing 1/3 cup golden raisins 1/4 cup water, from a freshly boiled kettle 1 teaspoon sherry vinegar 4 ounces (about 3 cups) arugula and other salad leaves 1/3 cup pine nuts, toasted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Don&#39;t bother to peel, but halve and seed the butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices, then cut each slice into four. Put the butternut pieces in a bowl with the salt, spices and 2 tablespoons oil and smoosh them about, then tip onto a lipped baking sheet (lined with aluminum foil). Don&#39;t clean the bowl yet. Cook the squash for 30 to 40 minutes. Check to see if it is cooked through by the time the half hour&#39;s up by piercing with a fork; some squashes cook faster than others. Add the golden raisins to the spice-smeared bowl and cover with the freshly boiled water; once cooled, whisk in the vinegar and the 2 tablespoons oil that remain. Put half of the salad leaves over a large plate or bowl and arrange the butternut pieces on top. Sprinkle with the remaining salad leaves and the toasted pine nuts. Scrape the raisin-studded dressing out of the bowl to dribble over it all and toss gently before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 21208,&quot;Crispy Pickled Pig Ears with Alabama White Sauce 2 pounds pig ears 2 cups champagne vinegar 1/2 cup smashed raw garlic 1/2 cup kosher salt 1 tablespoon cl flakes 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 tablespoon mustard seeds 5 sprigs fresh thyme 2 bay leaves 8 cups mayonnaise 1 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1 cup Worcestershire sauce<br> 1/2 cup chili garlic sauce<br> 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons celery seeds 2 tablespoons cl flakes Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cups frying oil Sea salt Sliced scallions, for garnish Instructions: For the pickle brine: Rinse the pig ears under cold water. Then pat dry with paper towels and place in 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Add 1 gallon water, the champagne vinegar, garlic, salt, cl flakes, coriander, mustard seeds, thyme and bay leaves. Soak the pig ears in the brine overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cook until you can pierce a knife through the ear, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the ears from the brine using a strainer, being carful to avoid tearing the ears. Place the ears on a baking sheet to cool and refrigerate for 1 hour. For the sauce: In a large bowl combine the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire, chili garlic sauce, cayenne, celery seeds, cl flakes and some salt and pepper. Whisk until mixed, and then adjust the seasoning if needed. Thinly slice the cooled ears. Heat the oil in a large pot or cast-iron pan until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. Gently add the sliced pig ears away from you, which will prevent the oil from splashing on you. Fry, stirring frequently to prevent the ears from sticking together, until crispy and golden brown, 3 minutes. Remove with a mesh strainer and place on a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle the ears with sea salt and transfer to serving plates. Top with scallions and serve the fried pig ears with the white sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 21209,&quot;Matzo Ball Soup 2 cups matzo meal 9 eggs 1/2 cup Kosher for Passvoer canola or vegetable oil Salt and pepper to taste 1 tablespoon salt 3 carrots cut into chunks 2 medium onions cut into chunks 2 parsnips cut into chunks 3 turnips cut into chunks 12 cloves of garlic 1 leek thinly sliced 3/4 teaspoon tumeric Pepper to taste Handful of parsley and dill Water Instructions: For the matzo balls: Mix all of the ingredients together until evenly distributed (there should be no lumps). Cover with waxed paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll dough into balls about the size of a golf ball. To keep batter from sticking to your hands, rub them with oil or water as needed. Drop balls immediately into a large pot of boiling water. Cook the balls for about 20 minutes or until done. They will sink to the bottom and then float back up to the top as they cook and the water returns to temperature. The balls should have expanded to be about 2 1/2 times their original size (about the size of a tennis ball). Check to make sure that the balls are done by cutting in half. The center should look grainy and yellow. Remove balls from pot and use immediately or set them in a pot of cold water and let cold water run over them until completely cooled. Set them in cold water in the refrigerator until ready to use. They may be reheated either in the broth or in the water. For the broth: In a large stockpot, add all ingredients and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for about 2 hours. Taste and adjust seasoning. Let cool. Strain vegetables out of the broth.

Remove the bowl from the saucepan; keep the steaming water over low heat. Gradually stir in the remaining bittersweet chocolate a few pieces at a time, until all of the chocolate is melted. Return the bowl to the saucepan if needed, 5 to 10 seconds at a time, to help melt the chocolate. Do not rush this step: It may take up to 10 minutes to melt the chocolate. Wipe off any moisture from the bottom of the bowl. Stir 3/4 teaspoon of the peppermint extract into the chocolate, then quickly pour into the prepared baking dish and spread in an even layer. Firmly tap the bottom of the dish against the counter to remove any air bubbles. Set aside. Meanwhile, put all of the white chocolate in a large heatproof bowl and repeat the melting process over the steaming water; dry off the bottom of the bowl. Stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract.<br> Dollop tablespoons of the white chocolate mixture over the bittersweet chocolate. Drag a toothpick in loops and swirls through the white and dark chocolate to create a marbling effect. Sprinkle immediately with the chopped peppermint patties and crushed candy canes, gently pressing them into the chocolate. Set aside at room temperature until firm, about 1 hour.<br> Lift the bark out of the dish using the foil and break it into pieces. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 21216,&quot;Stovetop Clambake 5 lbs. littleneck clams 2 (1 lb.) lobsters 2 ears corn on the cob, shucked and broken in half 1 lb. red new potatoes, parboiled 2 (12 oz.) bottles beer 2 cups salt water seaweed Instructions: Get a charcoal grill going. Lay down a bed of seaweed in a large metal pot or wash tub. Add a layer of potatoes, then corn, then lobsters and finally clams. Pour the salt water and beer over everything. Cover pot with a lid and place it directly down onto hot coals. Cook for about 15-20 minutes. Discard any clams that do not open. Split lobsters in half. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 21217,&quot;Buttermilk Scones 3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking soda 2 teaspoons cream of tartar 2 teaspoons superfine sugar 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) unsalted butter 2 tablespoons soft vegetable shortening 1 1/4 cups buttermilk 1 egg, beaten, for an egg wash (optional) 1 large lipped baking sheet or half sheet pan 1 (2-inch) biscuit cutter, preferably fluted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and line a large lipped baking sheet with parchment paper. Put the flour into a bowl with the baking soda, cream of tartar, and sugar. Chop the butter and the vegetable shortening into pieces and drop them into the flour. Rub the fats into the flour - or just mix any old how - and then pour in the buttermilk, working everything together to form a dough. Lightly flour your work surface. Pat the dough into a round-edged oblong about 1 3/4 inches thick and cut out 2-inch scones with a biscuit cutter. (Mine are never a uniform height, as I only pat the dough into its shape without worrying whether it&#39;s irregular or not.) Arrange the scones fairly close together on your lined baking sheet, and brush with beaten egg (to give golden tops) or not as you wish. Bake for 12 minutes, by which time the scones will be dry on the bottom and have a relatively light feel. Remove them to a wire rack to cool, and serve with clotted cream and your favourite jam. Make Ahead Note: Scones are best on the day they are made but day-old scones can be revived by warming in oven preheated to 300 degrees F for 5 to 10 minutes. Freeze Note: Baked scones can be frozen in airtight containers or resealable bags for up to one month. Thaw for 1 hour at room temperature and warm as above. Unbaked scones can be put on parchment-lined trays and frozen until solid. Transfer to resealable bags and freeze for up to 3 months. Bake direct from frozen, as directed in recipe, but allowing extra 2 to 3 minutes baking time. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 21218,&quot;Chipotle Salsa 4 ounces (about 25 to 30) dried chipotle chiles or 3 cups canned chipotle chiles, stemmed 8 ripe Italian Roma tomatoes, cored 12 garlic cloves, peeled 2 quarts water 2 tablespoons salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper Instructions: Combine all of the ingredients in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, about 20 minutes. The liquid should be reduced by one-third and the tomato skins should be falling off. Set aside to cool. Pour the mixture into a blender or a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Puree until smooth and then pass through a strainer. Serve chilled. Chipotle salsa can be stored in the refrigerator up to 5 days or frozen. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 21219,&quot;Penne with Five Cheeses Kosher salt 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup crushed tomatoes in thick tomato puree 1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano (1 1/2 ounces) 1/2 cup shredded imported Italian fontina (1 1/2 ounces) 1/4 cup crumbled Italian Gorgonzola (1 1/2 ounces) 2 tablespoons ricotta cheese 1/4 pound fresh mozzarella, sliced 6 fresh basil leaves, chopped 1 pound imported penne rigate pasta 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Bring 5 quarts of salted water to a boil in a stockpot. Combine all the ingredients except the penne and butter in a large mixing bowl. Mix well. Drop the penne into the boiling water and parboil for 4 minutes. Drain well in a colander and add to the ingredients in the mixing bowl, tossing to combine. Divide the pasta mixture among 6 shallow ceramic gratin dishes (1 1/2 to 2-cup capacity). Dot with the butter and bake until bubbly and brown on top, 7 to 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 21220,&quot;Broiled Bananas on Vanilla Ice Cream 4 ripe bananas, peeled and sliced in half lengthwise 1/4 cup rum A few shakes of cinnamon Your favorite brand of vanilla ice cream Several curls of bittersweet chocolate, peeled off a bar with a swivel peeler Instructions:</p>",119)]))}const g=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
