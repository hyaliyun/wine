For the syrup, combine the sugar and water, bring to a boil and cool. Stir in the liqueur. For the chocolate filling, bring the cream to a boil. Remove from heat, add the chocolate, and allow to stand 2 minutes. Whisk in the butter until smooth and cool. To make the Bavarian, combine the raspberries and sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes. Use a food mill or a fine sieve to puree and strain away seeds. Cool. Combine the liqueur and gelatin in a small, heatproof bowl and soak 5 minutes. Place the bowl over simmering water to make liquid again, then whisk into cool puree. Whip cream and fold it in. Slice the genoise into two layers and place one in the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan. Moisten with half the syrup. Whip the cooled chocolate filling to lighten and spread half over cake layer; pour on half the Bavarian. Repeat with remaining cake layer, syrup, chocolate filling, and Bavarian. Chill to set. To unmold, run a small knife between dessert and mold and lift off side of pan. Whip the cream and spread over sides of dessert. Press some of the chocolate shavings into cream. Arrange raspberries on top in two concentric circles around the top rim, then sprinkle center with shavings and confectioners&#39; sugar. One 9 by 2-inch round layer pan, or a 9-inch springform pan, buttered and the bottom lined with a disk of parchment or wax paper Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Sift together the cake flour, cornstarch, and cocoa through a fine-meshed strainer over a piece of waxed paper to break up any lumps in the cocoa. Set sifted ingredients aside with the strainer. Whisk together the eggs yolks, sugar, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and continue whisking gently until the mixture is lukewarm, about 100 degrees. This should take only a minute or two. Whip with the electric mixer on high speed until the mixture is cooled and increased in volume, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove bowl from mixer and sift in dry ingredients, in three additions gently folding each third in with a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread the top even with a spatula. Bake the layer about 30 minutes until it is well risen and the center is firm to the touch. If necessary, loosen the layer from the side of the pan with a small knife or spatula and invert the cake onto a rack. Place another rack on the cake and invert again. Remove the top rack, so that the layer cools right side up, still on the paper. Yield: 1 round layer, 9 inches in diameter by 2 inches deep &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Brachetto, Lambrusco]&quot; 28779,&quot;Stovetop Mac and Cheese with Mushrooms Kosher salt 1 pound penne 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 teaspoons fresh thyme<br> 1 clove garlic, minced<br> 1 pound white button mushrooms, sliced<br> Freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups whole milk<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 2 cups grated fontina cheese<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 6 slices taleggio cheese Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

First, turn the bird upside down with the back facing you. Cut out the backbone with poultry shears, be sure to cut close and not lose the underside of the breast meat attached to the back. Now, at an angle, carefully slit along both sides of the rib cage with a boning knife to remove the breast plate. Scrape away the meat as you cut. Using a towel, grab the thigh bones from inside the goose and pull the leg towards you out of the socket, leaving the meat attached to the body. Next, sever the wings at the joint as close to the body as possible. Reserve the wings and bones for the stock. Repeat the process with the other goose. The geese are now boneless. Carefully slice the breast to open them up and make an even thickness. Smear the surface of each goose with 1 tablespoon of softened butter; season with salt and pepper. Set aside while preparing the stock and stuffing. To prepare the goose stock, coat a large stockpot with olive oil and place over medium heat. Add the vegetables and saute for 2 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients, including all the geese bones, and cook for 1 hour. To prepare the stuffing, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrot and herbs. Saute for 5 minutes then add the wine. Simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce the wine to a tight paste. Add the wild rice, rye bread, and chestnuts. Stir and season with salt and pepper. Scrape the skillet mixture into a large bowl, blend in the egg, caraway seed and 1 ladle full of goose stock; mix thoroughly until evenly moistened. Spoon a layer of stuffing evenly to the edges of each goose and roll up like a jellyroll. Tie securely with butcher?s twine. Rub the outside of the goose roasts with butter, sage and marjoram for added flavor. Transfer the stuffed geese to a stovetop or conventional smoker and follow manufacture?s directions. Cook in a preheated 350 degree F oven for 20 to 40 minutes until juices run clear. Be careful not to overcook, as the meat would be extremely tough and dry. Let stand 10 minutes to allow the juices to settle. Cut off the twine and slice vertically to form pinwheels. To prepare the sauce, coat a stockpot with Port and place over medium heat. Bring up to a simmer then stir in the spices and orange peel. Add 1/4 cup dried cherries and simmer to reduce the alcohol, about 5 minutes. Add the goose stock and continue to simmer for 15 minutes. Strain the sauce into a smaller saucepan to remove the solids. Add remaining 3/4 cup of dried cherries and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 28797,&quot;Tuna Ceviche Cone 8 to 10 ounces fresh sushi grade tuna 1 lemon, juiced 1 lime, juiced 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar 1 teaspoon minced ginger 3 teaspoons red onion, minced 1 green onion, minced 2 sprigs each, cilantro and parsley, leaves chopped<br> 2 sprigs each, cilantro and parsley, leaves chopped 6 waffle cones, store-bought Instructions: Dice the tuna, against grain, into 1/4-inch cubes.

Cut the backbone out the chickens with kitchen scissors and reserve for another use or discard. In a shallow dish combine the thyme, 9 cloves crushed garlic, lemon juice and 1/3 cup of extra-virgin olive oil. Add the chickens and coat thoroughly in the mixture, cover and marinate in the refrigerator for up to 1 hour. Remove the chicken from the marinade, discard marinade. Turn the birds breast-side up and fold the wing tips back and under. Season both sides with some salt and pepper and the paprika. Place the chickens bone-side up on a broiler pan and position the legs in the center. Roast in the oven until the chickens are 3/4 cooked (about 140 to 150), about 25 to 30 minutes. Put the whole grape tomatoes, scallions, garlic cloves, and basil leaves in a large bowl, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Turn the vegetables until they are lightly coated. After the chickens have cooked for about 25 minutes, arrange the vegetables around them. Turn the oven to broil and broil until the vegetables are charred, about 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer should reach 170 degrees F. Transfer the chicken and vegetables to a cutting board. Pour off all except about 2 tablespoons of chicken fat from the pan and set aside. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of cold water to a boil and salt it generously. Add the spaghetti, and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes.

Butter one 4 x 3-inch round cake pan, one 6 x 3-inch round cake pan and one 8 x 3-inch round cake pan. Line the bottoms with parchment paper, and butter and flour the pans. Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars on high speed until light, approximately 5 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix well. Combine the buttermilk, sour cream, and coffee. On low speed, add the flour mixture and the buttermilk mixture alternately in thirds, beginning with the buttermilk mixture and ending with the flour mixture. Mix the batter only until blended. Divide the batter between the three pans and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake on the middle rack of the oven as follows: for the 4-inch pan 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean; for the 6-inch pan 70 to 75 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean; and for the 8-inch pan 85 to 90 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool the cakes in the pans for 10 minutes each on a cooling rack, carefully remove from the pans and allow to finish cooling. For the frosting, place the chocolate chips and heavy cream in a bowl set over a pot of simmering water, stirring occasionally, until the chips are completely melted. Off the heat, add the corn syrup and vanilla and allow the chocolate mixture to cool to room temperature. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the chocolate mixture and softened butter on medium speed for a few minutes, until it?s thickened.

Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and add the garlic and green cl, saute until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the black eyed peas, ham hocks, bay leaves, and water. Simmer for 45 minutes until the beans are tender, stirring when you think about it. Wait until halfway through cooking to begin seasoning with salt and pepper. You want the flesh of the bean to break down a little bit so it can penetrate the inside. Drain the black eyed beans and shred the ham hocks; set them aside to cool. To prepare the vinaigrette: Puree the tomato, chipotle, sugar, citrus juices, and zest in a blender until smooth. Pour in 1/4 cup of olive oil and puree again until emulsified and slightly thickened. To prepare the shrimp: Put the butterflied shrimp in a glass bowl and add the ancho powder, lime juice, half of the cilantro, and a drizzle of olive oil; tossing to coat. Marinate for 15 minutes while heating up the grill. Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Brush the grates with oil to keep the shrimp from sticking. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and season with salt and pepper. Lay the shrimp on the hot grill and cook 4 minutes on each side until charred and firm. To serve: Combine the black eyed peas, shredded ham hock meat, green onions, tomatoes, jalapeno, and the remaining cilantro in a large salad bowl. Add the grilled shrimp and vinaigrette; toss the salad well to incorporate all the ingredients and season with salt and pepper. This homemade chili powder will add a smoky depth to chili and as a dry rub for steaks. Toast the ancho cl pieces over low heat in a dry skillet until fragrant, shaking the pan so they don&#39;t scorch. Put the chiles in a mini food processor and pulse to a powder.

Microwave the milk and butter on a low setting until the milk is warm and butter is just melted, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Be sure not to overheat the mixture. In a separate bowl whisk together the egg and sugar until the sugar is dissolved. Add the warm butter and milk to the egg mixture. Whisk to combine then pour it into the yeast. In another bowl, mix together the flour, salt and nutmeg. With a wooden spoon, add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients. Mix until all the ingredients are smooth and well combined into soft dough 1 to 2 minutes. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel let sit in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. On a lightly floured work surface gently roll the dough into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle (about 10 by 18 inches). Cut the dough in 32 smaller rectangles, each about 1 by 1 1/2 inches. Sprinkle flour on 2 baking sheets to prevent the dough from sticking. Space the rectangles of dough about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Preheat the oil in fryer to 375 degrees F. Fry the doughnuts in the oil until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side, turning with tongs. Remove the doughnuts from the oil and place on a cooling rack, allowing some of oil to drain on a paper shopping bag or paper towels placed below rack. Once doughnuts have cooled to room temperature sift confectioners&#39; sugar over the top of the doughnuts. Move the doughnuts to a serving platter and sprinkle the tops of each one with 1/4 teaspoon of espresso. Serve warm or at room temperature. Chef&#39;s notes: These seem like they take a while to make but, really, all of the time is spent waiting for the dough to rise. A great way to serve these is to place a doughnut in top of a steaming cup of fresh-brewed coffee. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 28811,&quot;Glenda&#39;s Crawfish Etouffee 1 stick margarine 1 cup finely chopped onions 1/2 cup finely chopped celery 1/2 cup finely chopped bell peppers 1 teaspoon garlic, finely chopped 2 pounds Louisiana crawfish tails 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper Cooked rice, for serving Instructions: Melt the margarine, and then saute the onions, celery, bell peppers and garlic until tender.

In a sifter, combine the flour and cocoa powder. Sift onto a large piece of waxed paper and set aside until needed. Heat the water, 4 tablespoons butter, and 1 tablespoon sugar in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and add the sifted dry ingredients. Use a wooden spoon to stir until the mixture comes together in a ball-like shape (it should be a bit like putty at this point). Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring energetically and thoroughly incorporating each egg before adding another. Divide the dough in level tablespoons (approximately 1/2-ounce per puff) onto 2 nonstick baking sheets, 12 evenly spaced portions per sheet. Place the baking sheets on the top and center racks of the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to center halfway through the baking time (at that time also turn each sheet 180 degrees). Remove the puffs from the oven and cool to room temperature. Make the Chocolate Caramel Ganache: Place the chopped semisweet and unsweetened chocolate in a 4-quart bowl and set aside. Heat the heavy cream and 2 tablespoons butter in a 1 1/2 quart saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to keep the cream hot, but not simmering until needed. Combine 1/2 cup sugar and the lemon juice in a 3-quart saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar for 7 to 8 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then, light brown as it caramelizes). Remove the saucepan from the heat. Carefully pour about 1/3 of the hot cream into the caramelized sugar. Use a whisk to stir the caramel until it stops bubbling. Add the remaining cream and stir until smooth. Immediately pour the hot caramel over the chopped chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes before stirring with a whisk until very smooth. Refrigerate the ganache until just slightly firm but not hard (if the ganache is too firm, it will be difficult to pipe). Using a sharp paring knife, cut each puff in half horizontally. Transfer the chilled ganache to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe about 1 heaping tablespoon (approximately 1-ounce) of ganache onto the bottom half of each puff, then place the top half of the puff onto each portion of ganache. Serve immediately, or store in a tightly sealed plastic container at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 28817,&quot;Chicken Parmesan with Spaghetti 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 2 28-ounce cans whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand 1 teaspoon dried oregano Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 large eggs 2 cups breadcrumbs 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley<br> 1 teaspoon dried oregano 4 thin chicken cutlets (4 to 5 ounces each)<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Vegetable oil, for frying 8 1-ounce slices low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella cheese (packaged or deli-sliced) Grated parmesan cheese, for topping Chopped fresh basil, for topping Kosher salt 12 ounces spaghetti Instructions: Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.

In a medium bowl, combine the nuts, flour, sugars, cinnamon and salt. Stir to blend. Stir in the butter. The topping should form sandy clumps. Sprinkle the topping onto the baking sheet to break it up into smaller clumps. Refrigerate. For the coffee cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Use butter to thoroughly grease the bottom and sides of a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, \\cream\\ the butter and sugar together until light yellow and smooth, 5 to 8 minutes. Alternatively, this can be done with an electric hand mixer. Add the eggs, one by one, and beat until thoroughly integrated. Remove the topping from the refrigerator so it has a few minutes to come to room temperature before baking. Meanwhile, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk the sour cream until smooth. Turn the mixer on low and alternate adding some of the flour mixture with some of the sour cream. Add the lemon zest. When all has been mixed, give the sides and the bottom of the bowl a scrape and blend to make sure the batter is thoroughly integrated. Transfer the batter to the greased baking pan and \\tap\\ it lightly on the sides so it falls evenly in the pan and removes any air bubbles. Liberally sprinkle the cake with all of the topping. Take care to cover the whole top. Place the pan in the center of the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 22 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool for 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 28863,&quot;The Brownie with a Cheesecake Topping Nonstick cooking spray 6 tablespoons butter<br> 4 1/2 ounces bittersweet baking chocolate discs<br> 3/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 7 tablespoons lightly packed dark brown sugar<br> 2 large eggs plus 1 large egg yolk<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts, optional<br> 8 ounces cream cheese, softened 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> Pinch salt<br> 2 tablespoons sour cream<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1 large egg<br> 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, or more as desired 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Milk, optional Instructions: Candies or cookies for decorating, such as pirouette cookies, white, pink or chocolate curls, dragees, edible glitter, chocolate cigars or wafer cookies For the brownies: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray a 24-cup mini-muffin pan very lightly with nonstick cooking spray and line the bottoms with small rounds of parchment. In a double boiler, melt the butter and the chocolate together, stirring often to avoid scorching. Remove from the heat once everything is melted and combined. In a big bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs and egg yolk. Whisk in the salt and vanilla. Slowly add the chocolate mixture to the egg mixture to temper it and whisk just to combine. Gradually stir in the flour and mix until everything is combined and smooth. Stir in the walnuts if using. Set aside. For the cheesecake topping: With an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese with the granulated sugar and salt until smooth, then add the sour cream, vanilla and egg, and beat together just until incorporated. Transfer the cheesecake topping to a pastry bag or resealable plastic bag. Use a small ice cream scoop to add the brownie batter to the muffin pan (it should come halfway up the sides). Snip the tip off the pastry bag and pipe some cheesecake topping on top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan. For the buttercream frosting: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into a medium bowl. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high until smooth and light, about 1 minute. Add all but 1/4 cup of the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix on low just to combine. Add the vanilla and increase the speed to high, then beat until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. (Add more confectioners&#39; sugar or a bit of milk depending on how stiff or loose you want the frosting.) Frost the brownie bites with buttercream frosting, and decorate as desired with candy or cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 28864,&quot;Shrimp Creole 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons flour 1 cup chopped onion 1 cup chopped green bell pepper 1/2 cup chopped celery 1 tablespoon minced garlic 3 cups tomato concasse, juice reserved 2 cups shrimp stock or water 2 bay leaves 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined Steamed rice for garnish Chopped parsley for garnish Instructions: Heat oil and make a dark roux with flour.

Add the butter and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens into curd. Be sure to keep scraping the bottom of the pan during the few minutes this takes you; you don&#39;t want the eggs to scramble before the curd forms. If you&#39;re the nervous type, make the curd in a heatproof bowl over a pot of boiling water (the bowl shouldn&#39;t touch the water). The curd will take just a little longer to thicken, about 5 minutes. Strain the crud into a bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface so a skin doesn&#39;t form. Refrigerate until cool, at least 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a springform pan with 1 tablespoon of the butter and dust it with 1 tablespoon of the flour. Cream the remaining 8 tablespoons butter in a large bowl with 1 cup of the sugar until light and fluffy. Sift the remaining 1 cup flour, the baking powder, and salt together and stir into the creamed butter. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until they start to foam. Do not overbeat, or the cake will be tough. Add the eggs and ground almonds to the flour and butter mixture, mixing well. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Drop 8 individual tablespoons of lemon curd evenly around the outside of the cake, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Try to place the curd so there&#39;s an even amount of cake batter between each dollop of curd. Drop 3 tablespoons curd in the center. Refrigerate any remaining curd for another use (hint: breakfast toast). Sprinkle the top of the cake with sliced almonds and 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar, according to taste. Bake until the cake is toasty brown on top and a toothpick or knife inserted into the cake comes out clean (be sure not to insert it near the curd), about 40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes, then remove the sides of the pan and let cool completely on a rack. If serving the cake with whipped cream, add the almond liqueur to the heavy cream and beat until the cream is stiff. Sift a thin, even layer of confectioners&#39; sugar over the top of the cake. Present the cake at the table and offer the almond whipped cream on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28869,&quot;Stuffed Queso Meatloaf Three 6-inch corn tortillas 1 pound ground beef 1 pound ground pork 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 small onion, grated 1 clove garlic, minced 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 cup canned diced tomatoes with green chiles, drained Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces processed cheese, such as Velveeta, cut into 4 rectangular sticks<br> 1/2 cup pickled jalapeno slices 1 cup ketchup Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment.

Place the cooked french fries onto a plate. In a small saute pan, combine the Imperial Sauce and crab and bring to a simmer. Pour over the fries and place under the broiler until the sauce starts to bubble and turn golden brown, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove the fries from the broiler and garnish with lemon wedges and parsley.<br> Begin by making a bechamel sauce. In a 4-quart saucepan set over low to medium heat, add the butter and melt. Stir in the flour until a paste forms, and then cook for 3 to 4 minutes to achieve a blonde roux. Slowly whisk in the milk to avoid forming any lumps and bring to simmer. Cook for 30 minutes to cook out the flour taste.<br> While the bechamel sauce is cooking, in a separate bowl combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, egg yolks, Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard, cayenne pepper, celery salt, salt and black pepper, and whisk until fully incorporated.<br> After the bechamel sauce has simmered for 30 minutes, SLOWLY pour the sauce into the egg mixture while whisking. If the bechamel sauce is added too fast, the eggs mixture will scramble. Allow the sauce to cool, and then refrigerate for at least 8 hours to allow the flavors to blossom.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28880,&quot;Breakfast Pizza 1 -ounce (30 grams) fresh yeast or 3 (7 gram) sachets dried yeast 1 -ounce (30 grams) honey or sugar 1 pint (625 ml) tepid water 1 pound 2 ounces (500 grams) strong bread flour, plus extra, for dusting 1 pound 2 ounces (500 grams) semolina 1 -ounce (30 grams) salt 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 (14-ounce) (400 gram) tin Italian plum tomatoes 1 handful fresh basil, roughly chopped Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 field mushrooms 1 black pudding 5 slices back bacon 2 sausages 2 tomatoes, quartered Extra-virgin olive oil 4 ounces (115 gram) buffalo mozzarella 3 or 4 organic eggs Instructions: To make the bread dough, first dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/2 of the tepid water. Put the flour and semolina into a large bowl or on a clean surface, make a well in the centre, and pour in the yeast mixture. Mix together until all the yeasty liquid is soaked up, then pour in the rest of the water and gradually incorporate all the flour to make a moist dough. Knead the dough by rolling, pushing and folding it over for 5 minutes. Flour both hands, and lightly flour the top of the dough. Make it into a roundish shape and place it on a baking tray. Score it deeply with a knife, allowing it to relax and proof with ease until it&#39;s doubled in size. Ideally you want a warm, moist, draught-free place to get the wickedest proof. To make the tomato sauce, gently fry the garlic with the olive oil, then add the tomatoes. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 minutes, add the basil and season well to taste. When the dough has doubled in size, knock the air back by bashing it around for 1 minute. Now it is time to roll out your pizza into an irregular thin shape, and put it on a large baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F/200 Gas Mark 6. Tear up the mushrooms, black pudding and bacon and put them in a bowl. Break up the sausages into little rounds like meatballs, and add to the bowl with the tomato. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the pizza and scatter over your topping ingredients evenly. Tear the mozzarella over the top, then bake in the preheated oven for about 8 minutes. When the bacon looks crispy, crack on the eggs and put back in the oven until they&#39;re cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 28881,&quot;Shrimp Skewers 1/4 cup minced fresh parsley 1/4 cup minced fresh basil 1 teaspoon dry mustard 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup good olive oil Juice of 1 lemon 2 pounds jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled (tails left on) and deveined Instructions: Combine the parsley, basil, mustards, salt, pepper, olive oil, and lemon juice. Add the shrimp and allow them to marinate for 1 hour at room temperature or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Prepare a charcoal grill with hot coals, and brush the grilling rack with oil to prevent the shrimp from sticking. Skewer the shrimp on 6-inch skewers and grill for 1 1/2 minutes on each side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 28882,&quot;Ajo Blanco: White Garlic Soup with Grapes 6 ounces day old bread (a 3-inch cube), crusts discarded 1 cup blanched almonds 3 cloves of garlic 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 5 tablespoons wine vinegar or sherry vinegar 2 teaspoons salt 2 1/2 cup water 12 muscatel grapes, halved and seeded Instructions: Put the bread in a bowl and add water to cover. Let soak for 5 minutes until softened. Meanwhile, place the almonds and garlic in a blender container (or, if using a hand-held blender, into a mixing bowl) and pulse until almonds are finely ground. Squeeze out the water from the bread. Add to the food processor. Blend to a smooth paste. With the motor running, add the olive oil in a slow stream, then the vinegar and salt. Thin the ingredients with 1/2 cup of water to the desired consistency. Place the blended contents in a tureen, wooden bowl or pitcher and add about 2 cups of water. Taste for seasoning, add more salt and/or vinegar if necessary. The soup should be fairly tangy. Chill until serving time. Stir before serving into bowls. Garnish with grapes. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 28883,&quot;Pan Seared Beef Carpaccio with Potato Chips, Fried Capers and Lemon Aioli 1 tablespoon crushed coriander seeds 1 tablespoon crushed cumin seeds 1 tablespoon crushed mustard seeds 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon cracked black pepper 1 (1 1/2-pound) beef tenderloin 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 clove garlic 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 egg 1 cup olive oil Juice and zest of 1/2 lemon Kosher salt and cracked pepper 3 Yukon Gold potatoes, very thinly sliced 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1/4 cup small capers Vegetable oil, for frying 4 cups baby spinach 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and cracked pepper 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives Instructions: For the beef carpaccio: In a small bowl, mix the spices together. Completely coat the beef with the spice mix. In a pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat and sear the beef on all sides until golden brown and crusted, about 2 minutes on each side.<br> Wrap the tenderloin in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until ready to slice.<br> For the aioli: With the back of a knife, crush the garlic. Place in a bowl with 1 teaspoon salt and the Dijon mustard. Add the egg and whisk to blend. Slowly whisk in the oil, a little at a time, until all the oil is mixed in and the aioli emulsifies and becomes thick and creamy. Add the lemon juice and zest. If you need to thin the sauce, add water until you get the consistency you like. Season with salt and pepper. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. (Use within 24 hours.)<br> For the chips and capers: Rinse the potato slices under cold water and put them in a large bowl with the salt. Rinsing the potatoes will ensure they don&#39;t change color and will remove some of the starch. Add cold water to cover and set aside. (The longer the potatoes stay in the water, the crispier they will be when you fry them.) Drain the potatoes from the water and pat dry between paper towels. Dry off the capers with a paper towel and set aside.<br> Using a deep fryer, heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Working in small batches, fry the potato chips, stirring a few times, until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer the potato chips to paper towels to drain excess oil. Sprinkle with salt and reserve.<br> Fry the capers until golden, 30 to 45 seconds. Reserve on paper towels to drain.<br> Take the beef out of the refrigerator. Using a very sharp knife, cut slices as thinly as you can.<br> Mix the baby spinach with the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.<br> To serve: Plate the beef slices on individual plates, spoon the lemon aioli on the beef, garnish with the seasoned spianch, the potato chips, fried capers and chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 28884,&quot;Codfish in Ginger Soy Cream 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce 1/2 cup mirin 1/2 cup water 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tablespoon peeled and crushed ginger 1 teaspoon cornstarch, plus 1 tablespoon water, for slurry 4 (6-ounce) codfish fillets Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper All-purpose flour, for dusting Canola oil 8 large scallions, trimmed 2 tablespoons chopped ginger 1 small cl pepper, seeded and chopped 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 cup heavy cream 1 pound mussels<br> Chervil leaves, for garnish Instructions: Make the teriyaki sauce: In a medium saucepan over high heat, add the soy sauce, mirin, water, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger.

Cook and stir until the sauce thickens. Reduce the heat to low and keep warm. Season the codfish with salt and pepper, to taste. Dust the fillets lightly with flour, shaking off any excess. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add a thin layer of oil. When the oil is hot, add the codfish and cook until it&#39;s browned on both sides and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove the fish to a plate and keep warm. Cook the scallions in the same pan, adding more oil if necessary, until they are browned and have softened slightly. Heat another saucepan over medium-high heat, add a thin layer of oil, and cook the ginger and cl pepper until they are softened, about 2 minutes. Carefully pour in the white wine and cook until it has almost evaporated. Stir in the heavy cream and reduce it by half. Pour in a 1/2 cup of the teriyaki sauce. Add the mussels, cover, and cook until the mussels have opened, about 5 minutes. Put 2 scallions on each serving plate and arrange a piece of fish on top. Add a few mussels and spoon over some of the cream sauce.

Sprinkle the yeast on top and stir to dissolve; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Make the dough: Add the sugar, salt, vanilla and eggs to the bowl and whisk until blended. Add 2 cups flour and mix with the dough hook to combine, stopping to scrape down the bowl. (The dough will be sticky; if it&#39;s too wet, add the remaining 1/4 cup flour.) Add the butter and mix until smooth. Let it rise: Brush a large bowl with vegetable oil; add the dough and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in the refrigerator, at least 4 hours or overnight. Cut out the doughnuts: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment and dust with flour. Dust a clean surface with flour; turn out the dough onto the surface. Dust the dough with flour, then gently pat it out to make it easier to roll. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough until about 1/2 inch thick. Cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter; transfer to the prepared baking sheets. Reroll the scraps and cut out more rounds. Dust the dough rounds lightly with flour, cover with plastic wrap and let rest 1 hour in a warm place. Fry them: Heat 2 to 3 inches vegetable oil in a large pot until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the doughnuts, turning, until golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes total. Using tongs or a skimmer, remove to paper towels to drain.<br> Fill with jelly: Fit a pastry bag with a 1/8-inch-round tip; place the bag in a glass and cuff the open end over the glass. Fill the bag with jelly. Insert the pastry tip into the side of a doughnut and gently squeeze to fill. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve warm.

Pat the tenderloin dry with paper towels and sprinkle all sides with a generous amount of salt and pepper \\u2013 you should see the seasoning on the meat. Place a large skillet or roasting pan over medium-high flame, drizzle with the oil, and just when it begins to smoke lay the tenderloin in the hot pan. Brown on all sides until a crust forms and the meat is well-seared, about 7 minutes total. Toss the fresh thyme and rosemary on top of the tenderloin and transfer the whole thing to the oven; roast for 20 to 25 minutes for medium-rare. Remove the tenderloin to a cutting board to rest for 10 minutes before carving. Pour off the excess fat from the pan and put it back on the stove over medium-high heat. Add the shallots to the pan drippings, saute, stirring with a spoon to scrape up the flavors in the bottom. Take the pan off the heat and pour in the cognac (premeasure - never pour directly from the bottle!) Put the pan back on the heat and tilt it slightly over the burner to ignite the alcohol, or light with a kitchen lighter. The cognac will flame for a few seconds then go out as the alcohol burns off. Stir in the demi-glace and cream, simmer for about 1 minute to thicken the sauce so it coats a spoon. Finish the sauce by stirring in the mustard and peppercorns until incorporated. Taste and season with salt, if necessary. To serve: pile the watercress on a serving platter, cut the tenderloin into 1/2-inch thick slices and arrange it on top of the greens. Drizzle the sauce over the beef and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve the steak au poivre with pommes frites. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 28899,&quot;Curried Chicken Thighs 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon butter 6 chicken thighs Salt and pepper 1 cup chopped onion 3 teaspoons curry powder 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon cumin 2 carrots, peeled and sliced on diagonal 1 1/2 cups low sodium chicken stock 1 cup broccoli florets 1/4 cup heavy cream 3/4 cup frozen peas Cooked basmati rice, for serving<br> Instructions: Heat oil in large skillet and stir in butter to melt.

Add the onions and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are very soft and brown, about 20 minutes, reducing the heat to medium-low if the onions brown too quickly. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, stir together the sour cream, mayonnaise and Worcestershire sauce and season with salt and pepper. Add the onion mixture and stir until well combined. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. The dip can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container. When ready to serve, scatter the chives over the top and serve with potato chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28904,&quot;Dried Cherry Nougat Glace 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup water 1 cup skinned hazelnuts 1/3 cup sugar 3 tablespoons lavender honey 1/4 cup water 3 egg whites 1 1/2 cups dried cherries 1/4 cup kirsch 2 cups heavy cream Instructions: To make the praline, combine the sugar and water in a sauce pan and cook mixture, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals with a brush dipped in water, until mixture is clear. Let it cook, undisturbed, until deep golden. To caramelized sugar add the hazelnuts. Stir to coat. Oil a marble slab. Pour the mixture onto the marble, smooth it into even layer and let it cool completely. Once cooled, chop into approximately 1/4- inch pieces. To make the Italian meringue, combine in a pan the sugar, lavender honey, and the water. Cook it following same procedure as for praline, until a candy thermometer registers hard ball stage 248 degrees. Beat 3 egg whites to soft peaks. With machine running add, in a stream, the cooked sugar syrup. Beat until completely cool. Macerate 1 1/2 cups dried cherries in 1/4 cup kirsch for 30 minutes. Then drain over a bowl Whip 2 cups heavy cream. Fold half the praline, half the drained cherries and half the whipped cream into the meringue. Then do it again. Transfer to an 8 cup terrine, lined with plastic wrap. Cover mold with plastic wrap and freeze overnight. Unmold, remove the plastic wrap, and slice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 28905,&quot;Anginetti 3/4 cup granulated sugar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 3 tablespoons olive oil Zest and juice of 2 lemons 3 large eggs 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, or more as needed Instructions: With a mixer, combine the granulated sugar, butter, olive oil and lemon zest . Add the eggs, one at a time, and continue to beat for 1 minute. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt, and mix into the lemon mixture until a soft dough forms. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Divide the dough into thirds. Cut each third in half, then repeat. (You should have 12 small pieces of dough.)<br> On a surface lightly dusted with flour, roll each piece out into a 1/2-inch-thick log, then cut each into 3 pieces. Coil each piece into a small bun shape, bringing the end up over the top and pinching to seal. (Don&#39;t worry if they look funny; the glaze will cover any screw-ups.) Repeat with all the pieces, then arrange on the prepared cookie sheets at least 3 inches apart. Bake in batches, rotating the pans halfway through, 18 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool completely, about 20 minutes. Place the confectioners&#39; sugar in a small bowl and break up any large clumps with a whisk. Add the juice of 1/2 a lemon and whisk until a smooth glaze forms (if the glaze is too thick, add a bit more lemon juice; if it is too thin, add a bit more sugar). Dip the tops of each cookie into the glaze and allow the excess to drip back into the bowl. Place on a wire rack to dry, then store in an airtight container. Cookies will keep for 5 days at room temperature, or 3 weeks frozen. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28906,&quot;Fennel Crusted Tuna 3 tablespoons fennel seeds, lightly toasted 3 tablespoons coriander seed, lightly toasted 1 tablespoon white pepper, whole 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/2 pound center cut tuna loin 1 tablespoon olive oil, for brushing 1 tablespoon olive oil, for use in non-stick pan Instructions: Place toasted seeds, white pepper and salt in spice grinder.

Place the frozen blocks of spinach on top. Pour on the sauce and sprinkle on the curry powder. Gently stir the curry powder into the sauce. (Do not stir the chicken into the sauce; the goal is to prevent scorching the pasta sauce on the bottom while the cooker is coming up to pressure.) Lock the lid in place. Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Reduce the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 4 minutes for boneless chicken pieces or 12 minutes for chicken parts. Quick-release the pressure. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow excess steam to escape. Stir well. Taste the sauce, and add more curry powder and salt, if needed.

Wash the turkey inside and out, drain it well and pat it all over with paper towels. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the salt mixture in the cavity of the turkey and rub the rest on the skin, including under the wings and legs. Place the turkey in a shallow dish just large enough to hold it and wrap the whole dish tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 or 2 days. The day before you plan to roast the turkey, remove the plastic wrap and leave the turkey in the fridge. The skin will dry out and turn a little translucent. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Put the turkey in a large roasting pan, discarding any juices in the dish. Place the onion, lemon and thyme sprigs in the cavity. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tie the wings close to the body. Brush the turkey with the butter and sprinkle it generously with salt and pepper. Roast the turkey for 2 to 2 1/4 hours, until the breast meat registers 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer (put the thermometer in sideways). Remove from the oven and place the turkey on a carving board. Cut off the legs and thighs and put them back into the roasting pan, covering the breast and carcass tightly with aluminum foil. Place the roasting pan back in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dark meat registers 180 degrees F. Remove the dark meat to the carving board with the turkey, cover it tightly with aluminum foil, and allow it to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Pour a 1/4-inch layer of the gravy into a large (12-by-16-inch) ovenproof serving platter (make sure it&#39;s ovenproof!). Carve the turkey and arrange it artfully on top of the gravy. Place the platter uncovered into the oven for 15 to 30 minutes, until the turkey is very hot. Serve hot with extra gravy on the side. For the gravy: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute, stirring often, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the onion becomes browned and starts to caramelize. Sprinkle on the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 1/2 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, cognac, sage leaves, bay leaves, 2 teaspoons salt (depending on the saltiness of the chicken stock) and 1 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour and strain, pressing the solids lightly and then discarding them. Refrigerate until ready to use. After the turkey is cooked, remove it to a carving board to rest while you finish the gravy. Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat and add the wine. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring and scraping up all the bits clinging to the bottom of the pan. Slowly whisk the gravy base into the pan. Simmer for about 5 minutes, until the gravy is smooth and slightly thickened. Taste for seasonings and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir]&quot; 28909,&quot;Black Bean Avocado Salsa with Corn 1 ear corn, shucked 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for rubbing the corn 1 cup quartered cherry tomatoes 2 ripe but firm avocadoes, pitted and diced One 15.5-ounce can black beans, drained 1/2 medium red onion, diced 1 teaspoon agave syrup 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic Juice of 1 to 2 limes 1 serrano cl, seeded and finely diced Pinch cayenne pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 3 scallions, finely chopped Instructions: Preheat the grill over medium-high heat. Rub the shucked corn with olive oil and place onto the grill and cook until nicely charred on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. Allow to cool slightly prior to removing the kernels and transferring to a large bowl. Add the cherry tomatoes, avocados, black beans and onions to the grilled corn kernels. Mix together the 2 tablespoons olive oil, agave, cumin, garlic, lime juice, serrano, cayenne, and salt and black pepper to taste in a separate bowl. Whisk together, as you would to make a vinaigrette, and pour over the corn mixture. Mix together gently so everything is coated well, and then fold in the cilantro and scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 28910,&quot;Kimchi Grilled Cheese Sandwich 2 slices white sandwich bread 1/2 cup grated Cheddar 1/4 cup kimchi, drained and roughly chopped 2 tablespoons mayonnaise Instructions: Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat.

In a stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Mix in the vanilla. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Mix in the pumpkin puree. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt. Add the flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips. Divide the batter between the pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of each comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then lower the heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and celery and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage, crumbling it into small bits with a fork, and saute, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes, until cooked and browned. Add the figs and cranberries with the liquid, the chopped rosemary, and pine nuts, and cook for 2 more minutes. Scrape up the brown bits with a wooden spoon. Place the stuffing mix in a large bowl. Add the sausage mixture, chicken stock, egg, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and stir well. (The stuffing may be prepared ahead and stored in the refrigerator overnight.) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place a baking rack on a sheet pan. Lay the butterflied turkey breast skin side down on a cutting board. Sprinkle the meat with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Spread the stuffing in a 1/2-inch-thick layer over the meat, leaving a half-inch border on all sides. Don&#39;t mound the stuffing or the turkey will be difficult to roll. (Place the leftover stuffing in a buttered gratin dish and bake for the last 45 minutes of roasting alongside the turkey.) Starting at 1 end, roll the turkey like a jelly roll and tuck in any stuffing that tries to escape on the sides. Tie the roast firmly with kitchen twine every 2 inches to make a compact cylinder. Place the stuffed turkey breast seam side down on the rack on the sheet pan. Brush with the melted butter, sprinkle generously with salt and pepper, and roast for 1 3/4 to 2 hours, until an instant-read thermometer registers 150 degrees F in the center. (I test in a few places.) Cover the turkey with aluminum foil and allow it to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. Carve 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve warm with the extra stuffing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 28913,&quot;Turkey Breast Piccata 2 large eggs 2 cups panko breadcrumbs<br> 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 1 pound skinless turkey breast meat, sliced into five to six 1/4-inch-thick pieces and pounded a little thinner<br> Kosher salt 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons capers plus 2 tablespoons caper brine<br> Zest and juice of 1 large lemon<br> 1/2 cup tightly packed fresh flat leaf parsley leaves<br> Instructions: Fit a sheet tray with paper towels and a rack and set aside.

Dust a work surface with flour to keep the dough from sticking. Divide each dough ball into 12 equal-size pieces. Roll each piece into an 8-inch rope and twist into a knot. Arrange the knots around the edge of a 13-by-18-inch sheet pan, leaving 1/4 inch between each. Use the remaining knots to form 2 lines to divide the pan into 3 sections widthwise. Cover the pan with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the garlic oil. Combine the butter, olive oil, parsley, garlic powder, fresh garlic and 2 teaspoons salt in a medium bowl. Stir to combine.<br> Brush the knots with about 1/4 cup of the garlic oil and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Bake until just starting to brown, about 20 minutes. (The knots won&#39;t be fully baked.) Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, combine the cream cheese, ricotta, heavy cream, red pepper flakes, 1 cup mozzarella, the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan and 6 tablespoons of the garlic oil in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until fluffy and combined, about 3 minutes. Make the dips in the pan of half-baked knots. Divide the marinara sauce evenly between the far left and far right sections. Sprinkle half of the pepperoni over the right-hand section. Sprinkle half of the peppers and onions over the left-hand section. Then dollop and spread two-thirds of the ricotta mixture in the center section. Divide the remaining ricotta mixture between the right and left sections, dolloping it over the sauce and gently spreading with the back of a spoon or small offset spatula. Divide the remaining cup mozzarella between the far right and far left sections, sprinkling it on. Top the far right section with the remaining pepperoni and the far left section with the remaining peppers, onions and olives. Bake until the knots are golden and the dips are bubbling and lightly browned, 20 to 25 more minutes. Brush the knots with the remaining garlic oil and sprinkle the fresh basil over the center section. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 28993,&quot;Wood Chick&#39;s BBQ Smoked Beef Brisket 8 to 9 pounds beef brisket, choice grade Trim Tabb&#39;s Pig Powder, or your favorite BBQ dry rub Wood Chick&#39;s Mustard Sauce, recipe follows Wood Chick&#39;s Beer Based Mop Sauce, recipe follows Wood Chick&#39;s Brisket BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 1 cup yellow mustard 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce 3/4 cup cider vinegar 12 ounces beer 1/4 cup water 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 tablespoon BBQ dry rub 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 1/2 cup finely chopped onions 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup tomato sauce 1 cup ketchup 1/3 cup chili sauce 3/4 cup dark brown sugar 1/2 cup honey 1 cup white vinegar 1 teaspoon allspice 1 tablespoon dry mustard 2 teaspoons ground black pepper 2 teaspoons chili powder 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon paprika 3 tablespoons lemon juice 3 tablespoons maple syrup Instructions: Preheat charcoal smoker for half an hour.

Instructions: Place a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Spray the grill with vegetable oil cooking spray. For the pesto: Pulse the basil, nuts, lemon juice, garlic, lemon zest, salt and pepper until finely chopped in a blender or food processor. With the machine running, gradually add the oil until the mixture is smooth and thick. Add the cheese and pulse until just incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. For the skewers: Thread 1 round of zucchini onto a skewer. Thread 1 crumpled piece of prosciutto onto the skewer. Repeat 3 more times ending with a round of zucchini.

(Or you may place the frozen hash browns in the fridge overnight.) When they are thawed, preheat the waffle iron to medium-low heat. Place half the hash browns in the middle of a stack of three or four paper towels. Bunch up the potatoes and squeeze them to force out as much liquid as possible. Place the hash browns in a large bowl, then repeat with the rest of the hash browns. Drizzle in the butter, then add the pepper and toss everything together. Coat the surface of the waffle iron with cooking spray, then add 1/2 cup of the potato mixture to each well. (You should hear them start to sizzle!) Sprinkle the chopped ham evenly over the potatoes then add the cheese. Sprinkle about 1/4 cup of the potatoes over the top of each waffle. Then close the lid and let &#39;em cook! How long the waffles take to cook depends on the heat of your waffle maker and the moisture of the potatoes. Lift the lid and check on the waffles from time to time to make sure they aren&#39;t burning. The edges and the cheese will start to crisp up and get golden, but you&#39;ll want to keep it going until everything is deep golden. Use a dull knife or spatula to remove the waffles. Serve them with ketchup and dig right in! These are absolutely addictive. Crispy and wonderful! Change Things Up! For a simpler hash brown, omit the cheese and ham and just put 3/4 cup potatoes in each well. Add diced onion and green bell pepper along with the ham and cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 29005,&quot;Gnocchi with Bacon and Roasted Cauliflower 1 medium head cauliflower (about 2 pounds), trimmed and cut into small florets 2 tablespoons capers, drained 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 17.5-ounce package potato gnocchi 4 slices bacon 2 tablespoons pine nuts or roughly chopped hazelnuts 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh chives Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Grease and flour an 8-inch cake pan. Sift together the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and baking soda in a bowl. Cream the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on high speed until well incorporated. Add the sour cream, hazelnut paste and oil; mix well to combine. Add the chocolate and vanilla, and mix on low speed until very well incorporated. Add the dry ingredients and mix to combine. Spread the batter in the prepared cake pan. Bake until the cake springs back to the touch or a tester comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan to cool completely. For the hazelnut chocolate buttercream: Whisk the sugar and egg whites in a stand mixer bowl set over a hot water bath until the temperature reaches 140 degrees F. Transfer the bowl to the mixer and mix on high speed, using the whisk attachment, until stiff peaks form, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the butter, a few pieces at a time, and cream until well combined. Add the chocolate and hazelnut paste, and mix well. For the salted caramel: Heat the sugar and glucose syrup in a pan over medium heat until the sugar melts and caramelizes. Remove from the heat and add the heavy cream, salt, and vanilla seeds if using; stir to combine. Return the pan to the heat and cook until the caramel comes to a boil. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. To assemble: Slice the cake horizontally into three layers, each about 1/3-inch thick. Place one layer on a cake circle or serving plate and drizzle the salted caramel over the top. Using an offset spatula, spread some buttercream over the cake layer. Repeat with the remaining layers. Spread the sides of the cake with buttercream and smooth the edges with the spatula. Refrigerate until the buttercream is slightly firm to the touch, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 29007,&quot;Russian Tea Cakes 1 1/2 sticks butter 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon almond extract 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 teaspoons baking powder 4 cups sifted all-purpose flour Salt 1 1/3 cups roasted, salted, chopped pecans Confectioners&#39; sugar, for rolling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the butter to your standing mixer, put it on medium speed, then add your sugar right into the bowl. Turn it up so it gets nice and fluffy. Stop the mixer and scrape down the edges. Continue to beat it until it&#39;s almost white. Now you&#39;re ready for your eggs. Keep the mixer on low and add them 1 at a time. Wait to add the other egg until the first one is fully incorporated into the butter and sugar. Now add the almond and vanilla extracts. Add the baking powder to the flour and whisk really well, fully incorporating the baking powder into the flour and making sure any little clumps of flour are broken up. Add just a pinch of salt. Now add the flour mixture slowly to the butter mixture. Add in the pecans on slow speed. Scoop the batter with a small ice cream scooper, melon baller, or even a soup spoon, just make sure they are all the same size. And don&#39;t worry about spacing them out too much on the baking sheet, they aren&#39;t going to spread out, they&#39;re going to stay like little balls. Put the trays in the fridge for an hour or so. You want the butter to harden up, making the cookies crispy and delicious when baked. Bake for 15 minutes until they are golden brown.

Let marinate at least 2 hours, but preferably refrigerated overnight. Strain the beef and reserve marinade. In a very hot wok filled 1/4 with peanut oil, &#39;blanch&#39; the beef for 5 seconds only. Set beef aside and pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil. Stir-fry the onions and bell peppers for 3 minutes then add back the beef and the reserved marinade. Bring to a boil and reduce by 50 percent, until thickened. Stuff Hunan Beef in the Shao Bing and consume immediately. Suggested beverage: Loose teas and Hartley Ostini \\Hitching Post\\ Pinot Noir 1997 Prepare a saucepan filled with the vegetable oil over medium heat. Slowly add 2 cups of the wheat flour, stirring slowly to ensure that the paste achieves a smooth consistency. Cook for about 5 minutes and then set aside to cool. This is the oil paste. In a mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in a little warm water. Add 2 cups of the wheat flour and the baking powder and combine. Add more warm water to achieve a dough consistency. Cover the dough with plastic and allow the dough to rise, 45 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of boiling water with 2 pounds of the wheat flour. Mix until it has a slightly lumpy consistency and then add 1 or more cups of cold water. Continue mixing and kneading until the dough is soft and smooth. Cover the dough with plastic or cloth and let rest for 30 minutes. Add the warm water dough to the shao bing and knead until the doughs are incorporated. Cover the mixture and let sit for 15 minutes. On a well-floured surface, roll the dough into a flat, rectangular sheet, about 1/16 to 1/8-inch in thickness. Spread a generous layer of the oil paste over the surface of the dough. To prevent the oil paste from running off the dough, sprinkle lightly with flour. Starting from 1 edge, roll the dough until it becomes 1-inch in diameter. Be sure that the roll is tight. Cut the dough sheet so that the rolled dough may be removed when the diameter is 1 inch. Repeat the process until the entire sheet is transformed into rolls. Carefully, so as not to let the oil paste leak out, stretch out the rolls so that the diameter is reduced to 3/4 of an inch. Cut the stretched roll into 4-inch lengths. Place 1 of the rolls seam-side up and seal the end using a small rolling pin (this will prevent the oil paste from escaping). Fold the roll into thirds, so that the seam is covered. Then roll this tripled roll into a flat dough about 5-inches by 2-inches. Fold this piece into thirds. The stack should be about 2 by 3/4 inches thick. Flip the piece over so that the seam and fold are on the bottom. Cover and set aside. Repeat the process for the remaining rolls. Spread the sesame seeds onto a clean work surface. Flip the square with the smooth face over, onto the sesame seeds. Next, the square may be rolled into either a round or rectangular shape. The round is used in Northern China while the rectangular is common in the South. Rolling presses the sesame seeds into the face of the Shao Bing. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the Shao Bing, sesame seed side down, onto a cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes and then flip and bake for another 5 minutes to brown the bottom. The uncooked Shao Bing may be frozen for future use. Place the Shao Bing between layers of waxed paper to prevent them from sticking to each other. Using scissors as one does in China, cut open the Shao Bing, like you would a pita bread pocket. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Grenache, Tempranillo]&quot; 29011,&quot;\\Charcoal\\ Potatoes with Sour Cream and Vinegar 1 1/2 pounds creamer potatoes (ping-pong ball sized) 8 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons squid ink<br> 1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh chives<br> 1 cup sour cream<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> Malt vinegar, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat a smoker according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions.

Immerse the head of cabbage in the boiling water for a few minutes, peeling off each leaf with tongs as soon as it s flexible. Set the leaves aside. Depending on the size of each leaf, you will need at least 14 leaves. For the filling, in a large bowl, combine the ground chuck, eggs, onion, breadcrumbs, rice, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add 1 cup of the sauce to the meat mixture and mix lightly with a fork. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To assemble, place 1 cup of the sauce in the bottom of a large Dutch oven. Remove the hard triangular rib from the base of each cabbage leaf with a small paring knife. Place 1/3 to 1/2 cup of filling in an oval shape near the rib edge of each leaf and roll up toward the outer edge, tucking the sides in as you roll. Place half the cabbage rolls, seam sides down, over the sauce. Add more sauce and more cabbage rolls alternately until you ve placed all the cabbage rolls in the pot. Pour the remaining sauce over the cabbage rolls. Cover the dish tightly with the lid and bake for 1 hour or until the meat is cooked and the rice is tender. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 29029,&quot;Green Goddess Dressing 1/2 cup plain whole-milk yogurt 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1 tightly packed cup fresh basil leaves 1 tightly packed cup fresh dill, tough stems removed 1 tightly packed cup fresh parsley leaves 1/2 cup fresh chives (about 1 small bunch), roughly chopped 1 clove garlic 1 teaspoon lemon zest, plus 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Add the yogurt, mayonnaise, basil, dill, parsley, chives, garlic, lemon zest, juice, vinegar, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper to a blender. Puree until smooth, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula as needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days; stir well before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 29030,&quot;The Best Coconut Cream Pie 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 1/8 teaspoon fine salt 1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, diced 1 large egg, lightly beaten 3 large egg yolks 1/4 cup cornstarch<br> 1 cup whole milk<br> 1 cup half-and-half<br> 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut<br> 3 large egg whites 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> 6 tablespoons sugar<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1/3 cup unsweetened flaked coconut, toasted<br> Instructions: For the pie crust: Pulse the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor fitted with the metal blade until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 4 to 5 times until the dough forms a ball. (If the dough is very dry add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Transfer the dough to a work surface. Form the dough into a disk, wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.\\u202f<br> Roll the dough on a lightly-floured surface into a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan and trim the edges, leaving about an extra inch hanging over the edge. Tuck the overhanging dough underneath itself to form a thick edge that is even with the rim. Flute the edge as desired. Freeze the pie shell for 30 minutes.\\u202f<br> Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Put a piece of parchment paper or foil over the pie shell and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake on a baking sheet on the center rack until the dough is set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and lift the sides of the parchment to remove the beans. Continue baking until the pie shell is lightly golden brown, about 10 more minutes. Cool on a wire rack.<br> For the filling: Whisk together the egg yolks, 1/4 cup of the milk and the cornstarch in a medium bowl until smooth and well combined. Stir together the remaining 3/4 cup milk, the half-and-half, sugar and kosher salt in a large saucepan. Heat over medium heat until barely simmering. Temper the egg yolks by slowly pouring the hot milk and cream into the egg yolks while continuing to whisk. Pour the custard back into the pan and place over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the custard is very thick and smooth, about 5 minutes; it will be the consistency of a pudding. (If the filling has scrambled a bit, or doesn&#39;t look smooth, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve into a separate bowl before adding the coconut.) Stir in the butter until melted, then stir in the vanilla and shredded coconut. Spread the filling into the cooled pie crust. Place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pie and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours, but preferably overnight.<br> For the meringue: Add the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and kosher salt to the bowl of a stand mixture fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk to combine. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture feels very hot to the touch. Transfer the bowl to the mixer and add the vanilla. Whisk on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, 5 to 6 minutes.<br> Remove the plastic wrap from the pie and gently mound the meringue on top of the filling. Use an offset spatula to completely cover the filling and meet the crust all around the edges. (This will completely seal in the filling and help prevent weeping.) Use the offset spatula to form swirls and peaks in the meringue. Toast the meringue using a kitchen torch or broil in the oven until golden brown, keeping an eye on the meringue if broiling. Sprinkle all over with toasted coconut and serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29031,&quot;PB and J Chocolate Truffles 1 cup heavy cream 1 pound bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped 1/4 cup chambord liqueur 1 cup finely chopped peanuts Instructions: In a small saucepan, scald the cream over medium heat. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, add the hot cream and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Add the liqueur and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours. Using a small scoop or teaspoon, scoop up about 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of the chocolate mixture and quickly roll into a ball about 1-inch in diameter. Roll in the chopped peanuts to coat on all sides. Place on a sheet tray covered in parchment or waxed paper and repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Heat the ingredients on the stove top to 300 degrees on a candy thermometer. Remove from the heat and cool to 275 degrees over a water bath. Dip a fork in the sugar syrup and stretch the sugar syrup back and forth across the bottom of a pre-greased bowl, going as quickly as possible. Gently gather the spun sugar and place it on a dessert plate. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Prosecco]&quot; 29034,&quot;Beef Braciola 1/4 cup pine nuts 6 cups cubed country bread, tough outer crust removed 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped 1 bunch scallions, chopped (about 1/3 cup) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 3-pound flank steak 3 ounces sliced prosciutto (about 5 slices) 4 ounces sliced provolone (about 7 slices) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium onion, finely chopped 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/2 cup dry red wine One 28-ounce can whole plum tomatoes, crushed by hand 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 dried bay leaf 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley One 1-pound box rigatoni, cooked according to package directions, 1/2 cup cooking water reserved 1/2 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: For the braciola: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the pine nuts in a small skillet over low heat until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Cool and chop. Combine the bread and 2 cups warm water in a medium bowl, then let soak until softened, about 5 minutes. Squeeze out the excess water, then add to a large bowl with the Parmesan, parsley, garlic, eggs, scallions and pine nuts and mix to combine well. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper. Set the flank steak on a cutting board. Use a knife to score the steak down the middle against the grain, cutting only halfway through its thickness. Working from the center out toward the edges, cut thin flaps from the score to the edge, like a gatefold. Pound with the flat side of a meat mallet to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. Sprinkle both sides of the steak with salt and pepper. Layer the prosciutto over the steak, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Layer the provolone over the prosciutto. Pat the stuffing in an even layer over the provolone. Roll the steak around the fillings like a jelly roll, from short side to short side. Tie closed at 2-inch intervals around the circumference with kitchen twine. Tie 1 more piece of twine lengthwise around the meat. Sprinkle the outside of the braciola with salt and pepper. For the sauce: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. When the oil is hot, brown the braciola on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Remove to a plate. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Pour in the red wine and bring to a boil. Reduce the wine until almost gone, then add the tomatoes, oregano and bay leaf. Add the braciola back to the pot with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the braciola (1 to 2 cups). Bring to a simmer, then cover and bake until fork tender, 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. For serving: Remove the braciola to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the sauce to a simmer on the stove top. Stir in the parsley. Untie and slice the braciola into 6 thick slices on a slight bias. Spread about 1 1/2 cups sauce on a rimmed platter and arrange the braciola slices on top. Add the cooked pasta to the simmering sauce and toss to coat, adding up to 1/2 cup pasta cooking water if it seems dry. Sprinkle with the Parmesan, then toss and serve alongside the braciola. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 29035,&quot;Mapo Tofu 2 teaspoons whole Sichuan peppercorns 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 3 tablespoons hot bean paste (such as toban djan)<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 2 tablespoons hot sesame oil or hot cl oil 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil 4 cloves garlic, minced One 1-inch piece of ginger, finely chopped 2 tablespoon salted fermented black beans, rinsed and finely chopped<br> 1 pound ground pork<br> One 14-ounce package firm tofu, drained, patted dry, and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1/3 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and light green parts only 5 cups steamed jasmine rice, for serving Instructions: Heat a wok over medium-high heat and toast the Sichuan peppercorns until fragrant, about 10 seconds.

Seal the bag and move around vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes to distribute the honey and dissolve the salt. Set the bag in a leak-proof container and refrigerate for 1 hour. For the pastry: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Whisk together the flour and salt in a small mixing bowl and set aside. Combine the milk, water, and lard in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, approximately 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, add the flour all at once, and stir with a wooden spoon until combined and the mixture begins to form into a ball of dough. Place the dough onto a floured work surface and knead until cooled, approximately 5 minutes. Divide the dough in half, and divide one of the pieces in half again. Set aside. For the egg wash: Combine the egg and water in a small bowl. Set aside. To build the pot pie: Remove the hen from the brine and pat dry. Use kitchen shears to cut away the skin from the breast of the hen. Place the dried fruit into the cavity of the hen and tie the legs with butchers twine. Place the hen in the center of a piece of parchment and trace an oval approximately 1/2-inch larger than the hen, approximately 8 1/2 inches long by 6 1/2 inches wide. Remove the hen from the parchment and turn the paper over to avoid getting pencil on the dough. Roll the two quarters of dough into ovals according to the template; this is the base and the top of the pot pie. Place one of the ovals in the center of the parchment. Set the other oval aside. Roll the remaining half of dough into a 1/2-inch thick and 4-inch wide strip of dough that will go around the oval piece and surround the hen. Brush around the edge of the base pastry with egg wash. Place the thyme sprigs on the base, then top with the hen. Place the 4-inch wide strip of dough around the hen, forming a \\wall\\ around the hen. Press the ends together. Press down to seal this to the base pastry. Sprinkle the hen with the allspice, black pepper, cumin, and paprika. Brush the top of the \\wall\\ with egg wash. Place the remaining oval of pastry on top of the hen and crimp, attaching the top to the wall. Patch any holes with excess dough. Brush the entire pastry with egg wash. Bake until the hen reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F, about1 hour and 15 minutes.

(Cut the leaves at the base, where they connected to the root; the leaves should be about 9 inches long.) Using a vegetable peeler, shave down the center rib of each leaf so it will roll up more easily. Set aside. Combine the cream cheese, spinach and basil in a food processor and puree until smooth. Season with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Lay two of the romaine leaves out on a clean work surface. Cover the leaves with 2 slices of turkey. Spread 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture over the turkey and line up 1/4 of the pepper strips along one end. Line up 1/4 cup of the shredded carrots just above the peppers. Roll up the wrap tightly, starting from the edge with the peppers and carrots, so the wrap holds together and the peppers and carrots end up in the center of the roll. Place the wrap on a plate seam-side down. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Combine the cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, salt, basil and thyme in a bowl and incorporate. Completely cover the roast with the dry rub ingredients. Combine the beef broth, beer and Worcestershire in a large roasting pan, then add the bay leaves, carrots, onions and celery all around the edges. Put the roast in the center. Cover pot tightly with 2 layers of aluminum foil. Bake \\slow and low\\ until it is soft, 8 to 10 hours. Remove the roast and shred with a fork. Save all the meat juices in the pan for the gravy. For the debris gravy: Melt the butter, then add the flour a little at a time, whisking constantly. Cook, whisking, until a blonde roux forms, about 10 minutes. Put roast beef drippings in a pot with 2 cups shredded beef and bring to a boil, then reduce heat. (Add canned beef stock if you want it thinner.) Slowly whisk in the blonde roux and cook, whisking, until it achieves desired gravy thickness. New Orleans-style po&#39;boy sandwiches are traditionally served \\dressed. That means lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and mayonnaise (the eggier the better!). You will need toasted and split French baguettes (hollow them out to make more room for the beef). Fully dress those suckers! (Add onions if you like.) Also, a good Louisiana-style hot sauce is recommended. Put lots of hot shredded roast beef on the sandwich and top it generously with piping hot \\debris gravy. Eat it with an ice-cold beer for the authentic experience.

When the fold is opened it should be a full circle. It is okay if it is not a perfect circle-a heart shape is even better. Reserve. In a bowl combine the zucchini, butternut squash, Brussels sprouts and leeks. Toss generously with olive oil and season with the thyme leaves and salt. Oil and salt the halibut as well. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Open the parchment paper circles (or hearts) and brush the paper with olive oil leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Divide the seasoned vegetables between the 4 papers, placing them in the center just above the crease. Lay the fish fillets on top of the vegetables and place a lemon slice on top of each fish fillet. Fold the paper over the fish. Working from 1 end of the parchment to the other fold the bottom of the paper over the top to crease and seal the packets. The closure needs to be very secure so the steam will not escape during the cooking process. Before the package is completely sealed, carefully add 1/2 cup wine in each then seal. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 9 minutes. Remove the fish from the oven, place on serving dishes and serve immediately.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself. Start with 2 colors. I used green (mint) and yellow (lemon). Place the sugar pieces side- to-side. Pull and lengthen. Cut in half. Place them side-to-side again. Pull to lengthen. Cut in half and place them side-to-side. Now you have a flat piece of sugar that you are pulling long. Cut off the ends, (they are bulky), when the sugar starts to harden. Make some waves to create the ribbon. Join the 2 edges to make a circular ribbon. Voila! Beautiful for the holidays. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 29078,&quot;Grilled Lavash Pizza with Spicy Hummus, Grilled Eggplant, Feta, Red cl Oil, and Mint 1 soft lavash bread Olive oil 2 small Japanese eggplants, halved Salt and freshly ground black pepper Spicy Hummus, recipe follows 12 ounces crumbled feta cheese Red cl Oil, recipe follows Chopped fresh mint, for garnish 1 1/2 cups dried chickpeas, cooked until soft 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1/4 cup tahini 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 lemon, juiced 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 3 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves 2 ancho chiles, stemmed and chopped 1 New Mexican red chili, stemmed and chopped 1 teaspoon cl de arbol powder 1 cup canola oil Salt Instructions: Preheat the grill to high.

Place the corn, still in its husks, directly on the oven rack and roast for about 20 minutes until the corn is soft when you press on it. Take the corn out of the oven and let it cool a little until you can handle it, or until you&#39;re ready to serve. When you&#39;re ready to eat, place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat an outdoor gas or charcoal barbecue and get it very hot. Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel. Then carefully and quickly wipe the hot grates of the grill to make a nonstick grilling surface. When the grill or grill pan is hot, peel down the husks from the roasted corn and pull out the corn silk. Then tie the husks in a knot so you can hold on to the knot like a handle. Char the corn on the grill or grill pan, turning, until the kernels are slightly blackened all around and start popping, about 6 minutes. Brush the corn with mayonnaise, and sprinkle with the Parmigiano and a little cayenne pepper so it&#39;s nicely coated.

Brush the pork chops with 1 tablespoon of the oil, then season - sparingly - all over with the Peck Seasoning, patting it into place. Add the chops and reduce the heat to moderate. Brown the chops on both sides, about 4 minutes per side, slide the chops over to the indirect heat side of the grill, adjusting the heat so they cook without burning the coating. Continue to cook until the internal temperature reaches 140?F, 25 to 30 minutes. In a large bowl, toss the pepper strips with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and salt and pepper to taste. While the pork chops finish cooking over indirect heat, cook the peppers in a single layer on the grill over moderate, direct heat, turning them occasionally, until they are charred in spots and softened but not mushy, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the pork and peppers to a warmed serving platter. Squeeze the lemon half over both and serve with the lemon wedges on the side. Michael&#39;s Notes: To get some nice caramelization on the peppers, be sure not to crowd them. If stacked, they will steam instead of sizzle. Combine the garlic and lemon zest on a cutting board and chop finely. Add the sage and rosemary and mince everything together until very fine. Add the pancetta and mix it in well with your fingers. Add the salt and pepper and gently incorporate all the ingredients by hand until the mixture resembles a moist seasoning salt. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM (Grenache, Syrah, Mourvdre)]&quot; 29095,&quot;Southwestern Chicken Fajita Mason Jar Salad 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds) 2 red bell peppers, sliced 2 zucchini, sliced 1 yellow onion, sliced 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon fajita seasoning blend (no added sodium) 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 medium roasted sweet potatoes, diced 3 cups greens of choice, such as spring mix Serving suggestions: avocado, cheese, cilantro, lime juice and sour cream, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Add the chicken, bell peppers, zucchini and onions to a large baking sheet.

Add the garlic and red pepper, and saute until fragrant, stirring, about 30 seconds. Add the white wine and tomato sauce, increase the heat to high, cover and bring to a boil. Add the mussels and replace the lid. Cook over high heat 3 minutes. Remove the lid and stir once gently. Continue to cook until the mussels are completely open and firmly cooked, about 4 minutes more. Remove the pot from the heat and transfer the mussels gently from the pot to a large bowl with a Chinese wire mesh skimmer. Return the pot to the heat and increase the heat to high. Boil for a minute or 2, until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon. Pour the sauce over the mussels and serve immediately. Place the canned tomatoes in a large bowl and place your (clean) hands in the bowl and crush the tomatoes so they breakup into a range of small pieces. In a 5-quart Dutch oven heat the olive oil over medium heat until it is fragrant, but before it smokes, about 40 seconds. Add the bay leaves and stir them in the oil until they begin to brown, about 10 seconds. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until it starts to turn golden brown, then add the onions, carrots, and oregano. Cook the vegetables until they are very brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir occasionally, just enough to prevent them from scorching. Add the crushed tomatoes with their juice, the tomato paste, salt and pepper, and 1 1/2 cups of water, (white wine or clam juice can be added depending on the intended use) and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer, partially covered until the sauce level has reduced by 2 or 3 inches and the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Cook the sauce for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally so it doesn&#39;t stick. Remove from heat, cool down in the pot, then when at room temperature, transfer to a sealed plastic container and refrigerate until ready to use. This sauce will keep 10 days in a well-sealed container in the refrigerator. Using my recipe for basic Red Sauce, you can make a quick and spicy \\fra diavolo\\ sauce that is delicious drizzled over grilled squid and other seafood. For equipment you will need a 3-quart saucepan and a wooden spoon. Heat the olive oil in a 3-quart saucepan slightly over medium heat and saute the garlic and crushed red pepper until the garlic is fragrant and beginning to brown, about 40 seconds. Add the Red Sauce, clam juice, and salt, to taste, and simmer, stirring occasionally over medium-low heat, until the sauce returns to the thickness and quantity of the Red Sauce, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 29149,&quot;Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cake with Beurre Noisette Buttercream for the Yule Log Tree Stump 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pans, softened 1 1/4 cups sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs One 15-ounce can pumpkin puree 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips Beurre Noisette Buttercream, recipe follows 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream or milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.

Use the lemon juice for cocktails, or splash a bit into the marinade if you really love citrus. Mix all the marinade ingredients together. To make the Stuffing: Mix the stuffing ingredients together. To prepare the Lamb: Cut the rack in 1/2 crosswise so that each piece contains 4 chops. Insert a long, skinny knife into 1 end of the meat and push it through until the tip emerges from the other end. Then, remove the knife and use the handle of a wooden spoon to ream out a 1/2-inch hole, forming a tube through the 4 chops. With your fingers, press half the stuffing into the rack, making sure it&#39;s distributed evenly. Repeat with the other half of lamb. Place the lamb in a zipper baggie, spoon the marinade onto the meat, and rub it in a little bit. Marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Roast the chops for 25 minutes for medium rare, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 135 degrees F. Let the meat rest for 10 minutes (during which they continue cooking, and the juices run back to the center).

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix together the butter and 1 cup of sugar until they are just combined. Add the vanilla. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and salt, then add them to the butter-and-sugar mixture. Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a surface dusted with flour and shape into a flat disk, about 1-inch thick. Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes, until firm but still pliable. Roll the dough 1/2-inch thick on a lightly floured surface and cut with a 3-by-1-inch finger-shaped cutter. Place the cookies on an ungreased baking sheet and sprinkle with sugar. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges begin to brown. Allow to cool to room temperature. When the cookies are cool, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Put 3 ounces of the chocolate in a glass bowl and microwave on high power for 30 seconds. (Don&#39;t trust your microwave timer; time it with your watch.) Stir with a wooden spoon. Continue to heat and stir in 30-second increments until the chocolate is just melted. Add the remaining chocolate and allow it to sit at room temperature, stirring often, until it&#39;s completely smooth. If there are still bits of unmelted chocolate after about 5 minutes, return to the microwave in 5-second intervals, stirring, until completely smooth. Stir vigorously until the chocolate is smooth and slightly cooled; stirring makes it glossier. Drizzle or dip 1/2 of each cookie with just enough chocolate to coat it. Place the cookie back on the parchment-lined baking sheet and let stand at room temperature until the chocolate has firmed up, about 20 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: If a 3-by-1-inch cookie cutter is not available, you can cut the shortbread into rectangles using a fluted pastry wheel for decorative edges or simple cut with a butter knife. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29177,&quot;Charred Pepper and Sausage Hero Sandwiches 4 medium red bell peppers Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Pinch granulated sugar 8 spicy Italian-style pork sausages 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 medium yellow onions, halved, thinly sliced 6 large cloves garlic, cut into thin rounds 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 4 crusty hero sandwich rolls, split lengthwise Crushed red pepper flakes, for sprinkling Instructions: Place the peppers directly on a gas flame. Char on all sides until the skin burns. Refrigerate to cool quickly, 10 to 15 minutes. Place on a flat surface and open, seed, peel and discard the skin. (I use a kitchen towel to wipe the skin away. Don\\u2019t rinse the peppers under water, as it washes away flavor.) Slice the peppers into 1/2-inch slices. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and the sugar. Set aside. Split the sausages lengthwise. In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Arrange the sausages cut-side down in a single layer in the oil. Sprinkle with salt. Cook, flipping once sausages with tongs, so each one browns hard on both sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove them from the skillet and set aside. In the same skillet, add the onions and fresh garlic with a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring from time to time with a wooden spoon, until the onions soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the peppers and cook for 4 to 5 minutes more. Add the vinegar, granulated garlic, oregano and some Parmesan and stir to combine. Taste for seasoning. While the onions are cooking, spread butter on the cut sides of the rolls, then sprinkle with some crushed red pepper flakes. Toast on a griddle over medium-low heat until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Stuff the rolls with some of the pepper-onion mixture, then top with the sausages, some more pepper-onion mixture and a sprinkle of Parmesan.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the fish on top. Drizzle the fish evenly with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Mix the paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over each of the fillets. Bake until the fish is opaque and can be easily flaked with a fork, about 10 minutes. Let cool until warm, about 10 minutes. Flake the fish (leave the skin on the baking sheet; the meat should easily pull away from it) and transfer to a medium bowl (you should have about 339 grams fish). Add the panko, mayonnaise, capers, dill, chives, lemon zest, celery, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds black pepper and mix to combine. Form the mixture into tablespoon-sized patties (about 16 grams each). (You should get 20 to 24 patties.) Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in two batches, fry the patties until golden brown and can easily pull away from the pan, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat with the remaining patties. Dollop with some sour cream, a few sprigs of dill or sliced cornichons on top and secure with a toothpick.

Stir to combine, then increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to marry the flavors. Reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook until the lentils are tender, start checking at 20 minutes. Continue cooking, uncovered, stirring to break down the lentils and thicken the soup, another 10 to 15 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve in bowls with a drizzle of olive oil, a dollop of yogurt and fresh cilantro leaves, or use the bread bowls. If using the bread bowls, cut a circle around the top of each with a paring knife, then gently pull out the tops. Remove some of the bread innards and have as a snack. Fill each bread bowl with hot soup and garnish with a dollop of yogurt and fresh cilantro leaves. Combine the flour, milk powder, yeast and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk together. Add the water and oil and mix with the dough hook until a dough forms, scraping down the sides. Knead on medium-high speed until it pulls away from the side of the bowl and makes a smacking noise, 12 to 15 minutes. (The dough will be very sticky and soft, but do not add more flour.) Scrape out into a liberally oiled bowl, then toss to coat in the oil and cover in plastic. Allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Place an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Prepare a parchment or silicone mat-lined baking sheet. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured countertop and gently fold over onto itself to deflate some of the gas. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll into tight balls. Evenly space the balls on the prepared baking sheet and cover with plastic. Let proof until puffy and almost doubled; depending on the temperature, this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. Snip the tops of the dough balls with scissors in an X and bake until golden brown and puffed up and they feel hollow when you tap, begin checking at 15 minutes.

Add the masa harina and beat for 2 minutes more. Add the baking powder and salt and continue to beat until incorporated, about 5 minutes. Add the broth and continue to beat until the masa is soft and fluffy (the masa should come off the bowl easily). Set aside, cover with a damp towel and let rest for about 10 minutes, or until ready to use. Put the corn husks in a large pot, cover with water and bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, until soft, about 8 minutes. Drain. To fill the tamales: Holding an open softened corn husk in one hand, spread about 2 tablespoons of the dough on the husk beginning 1 inch from the wider top and ending at least 1 1/2 inches from the narrower bottom, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border on either side. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of filling down the center of each tamal. Fold the sides of the husk up and over the filling, tucking the ends under. Continue with the remaining dough. Put the folded tamales in the steamer basket of a large pot. Add enough water to cover the bottom of the pot by several inches, but not enough to touch the tamales themselves. Bring to a boil, cover with a towel and lid and steam over medium-low heat for 1 hour, adding additional water to the pot as necessary; do not allow the pot to boil dry. Open a tamal and check for doneness; the tamal should be firm and pull away from the husk without sticking. If still sticky, continue steaming until done, up to another 15 minutes. Char the poblanos directly over a gas flame on the stove or under the broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in a plastic bag and let steam for about 10 minutes. Peel, stem, seed and devein the chiles. Slice into 1/4-inch strips lengthwise and season with salt. Place 2 to 3 rajas (pepper strips) and 1 tablespoon shredded cheese in each tamal. For the guajillo chicken filling: Put the chicken, 3 cloves of the garlic, the halved onion and the bay leaves in a large heavy saucepot and add enough water to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes, then skim and cover the pot. Continue to simmer until the chicken is fully cooked, 30 more minutes. Set aside until the chicken is cool enough to handle. Add the chiles, remaining 4 cloves garlic and the quartered onion to a pot with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Transfer the ingredients to a blender. Add the cumin and cloves and process until smooth. Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large heavy saucepot. Transfer the cl mixture to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and simmer for 15 minutes. Shred the chicken, discarding the bones and excess fat.

Put the cut-out cookies in the fridge for 10 minutes to firm up before baking, so they don&#39;t spread too much in the oven. Bake until the cookies are just turning golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack before decorating with Royal Icing and your favorite sprinkles. Add the egg whites to a bowl and whisk until frothy soft peaks form. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar gradually, mixing until the royal icing is uniform and nice and shiny.

Butter a 9-inch springform pan. Put the chocolate and butter into the top of a double boiler (or in a heatproof bowl) and heat over (but not touching) about 1-inch of simmering water until melted. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar in a mixing bowl until light yellow in color. Whisk a little of the chocolate mixture into the egg yolk mixture to temper the eggs - this will keep the eggs from scrambling from the heat of the chocolate; then whisk in the rest of the chocolate mixture. Beat the egg whites in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form and fold into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the prepared pan and bake until the cake is set, the top starts to crack and a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out with moist crumbs clinging to it, 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes, then remove sides of pan. While the cake is cooking, make the whipped cream. Whip the cream until it becomes light and fluffy.

Cut the leaves 2 or 3 at a time into fine julienne. If the leaves are more than 4 or 5 inches long, fold them under to make them easier to julienne. Juluienne the carrots and turnip into 3- inch lenghts. The easiest way to do this is first to slice them with a benriner cutter (a Japanese slicer) and then with a chef&#39;s knife. Cut the celery stalk into 4-inch sections and julienne it as finely as possible. Combine the julienned vegetables, bouquet garni, and just enough water to cover- about a quart- in a 4-quart pot. Simmer gently, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Add the wine and simmer for 10 minutes more. Strain the vegetable broth, reserving the cooked vegetables and broth. About 10 minutes before you&#39;re ready to serve, put the cooked vegetables with 1/4 cup of the broth in a covered saucepan over low heat. Bring the remaining vegetable broth to a simmer in a saute pan just large enough to hold the scallop in a single layer. (If the pan is too large, there won&#39;t be enough liquid to cover.) Gently slide the scallops into the simmering broth. If there&#39;s not enough liquid to cover the scallops. Poach the scallops for 8 minutes. Spread 3/4 quarters of the julienned vegetables in shells. Carefully arrange the scallop on the vegetables. Add the chopped parsley to the simmering poaching liquid, season the liquid with salt and pepper, swirl in 1/4 cup tarragon butter and ladle enough over the fish to come about a third of the way up the sides of the fish. Arrange the rest of the julienne over the fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 29231,&quot;Caprese Salad with Roasted Mango Dressing 1 green (unripe) mango 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro, plus extra picked leaves for garnish 2 quarter-size coins peeled fresh ginger 1/2 Fresno cl (or 1 jalapeno pepper), seeded if desired, and chopped 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling 1/2 teaspoon amber agave nectar or honey 4 assorted heirloom or vine-ripened red tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices 1 ball fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices (or 1 package mozzarella medallions) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Wrap the mango in aluminum foil, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast it for 1 hour, rotating halfway through. The mango should be soft. Remove the foil and let it cool. When the mango is cool enough to handle with your hands, slice off the cheeks and scoop the flesh into a small food processor or blender. Repeat with the remaining mango, scooping as much flesh off as possible. Add the minced cilantro, ginger, cl, cumin, vinegar, olive oil and agave nectar. Blend until smooth and add a little water if the dressing is too thick. Arrange the tomatoes and mozzarella on a platter and season them with salt and pepper.

Mix lightly with your fingertips until pastry forms peasized pieces. You should be able to see chunks of fat, and the pastry should be moist enough to begin to stick together. If the pastry is too dry, add up to 2 more tablespoons of water. Turn the pastry out onto a lightly floured work surface, dust with flour, and knead it until the pastry is smooth, about 3 to 4 times. Transfer to a plastic bag and form pastry into a disk. Refrigerate a minimum of 30 minutes, or as long as 3 days. Cook bacon in a skillet over low heat until tender, not crisp. Add leeks, salt and pepper, and saute until leeks are soft and bacon is crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain off excess fat, if any. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and arrange the rack in the middle of the oven. On a generously floured surface, roll pastry from center out, lifting pastry, turning it slightly, and occasionally flipping to prevent sticking. Roll pastry to 1/8inch thickness. Lightly butter and flour a 9inch pie pan and line with pastry, leaving about 1/4inch overhang for shrinkage. Pinch up excess pastry to form a rim and flute the edges. Prick the bottom all over with a fork. Line pastry with a sheet of parchment or aluminum foil larger than the pan, and fill with pie weights, rice, or beans. Bake about 20 minutes, until the edges begin to color. Remove the paper and weights, and spread the mustard over the bottom of the pastry. Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. In a bowl, beat the eggs lightly with the milk. Stir in bacon and cheese mixture. Pour the custard into the pie shell to within 1/4inch of the top of the crust. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until custard puffs. Allow to cool 10 minutes before serving.

Mix the fennel seeds, sage, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl. Rub the spice mixture all over the brisket, pressing it into the meat to make sure it sticks well. Mix the beef stock or broth, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar and garlic in a large liquid measuring cup and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot with a lid over medium-high heat. Add the brisket fat-side up and cook until golden brown and no longer sticking to the bottom of the pot, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until it is golden brown and some of the fat has rendered, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the brisket to a plate and lower the heat to medium. Add the onions, carrots and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot, until the onions are softened and starting to caramelize, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the balsamic mixture and tomatoes to the pot and bring to a boil. Return the brisket to the pan and nestle it into the sauce and vegetables fat-side up. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven and braise until the brisket is tender but not shredding or falling apart, about 3 hours 30 minutes. A fork should easily pierce through the meat. Remove from the oven, uncover and let the brisket rest in the pan for 30 minutes. Remove the brisket to a cutting board. Bring the vegetables and sauce to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until slightly thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Thinly slice the brisket across the grain and place on a platter.

Shake to mix, and then serve in a martini glass. &quot;,&quot;[Gin, White Wine, Lime Juice]&quot; 29254,&quot;Chilaquiles Frittata 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 8 scallions, white parts only, thinly sliced 1 serrano cl, minced 1 cup corn kernels (cut from the cob or thawed if frozen) 1 cup chopped tomatoes One 4-ounce can diced green chiles 10 large eggs 2 cups crushed tortilla chips 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup grated Monterey Jack-Cheddar cheese blend Sour cream and salsa, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the scallions and serrano chiles and saut until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the corn, tomatoes and canned chiles and cook until the corn is cooked through and the tomatoes have softened, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the eggs. Add the tortilla chips, cilantro, salt and pepper. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and top with the cheese. Transfer to the oven and bake until lightly browned and fluffy, about 20 minutes. (Note that the temperature is low, and this recipe cooks longer than a typical frittata; I find that cooking eggs low and slow results in better flavor and texture.) Cut into wedges and serve with the sour cream and salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 29255,&quot;Minty Couscous 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups/about 450 g quick-cooking couscous 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more if desired Leaves from 2 large bunches fresh mint, chopped Instructions: Bring 3 1/2 cups/875 ml water to a boil in a large saucepan and salt it.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add walnuts and blanch for 30 seconds. Drain and transfer nuts to a medium bowl. While nuts are still hot and slightly wet, add confectioners&#39; sugar and toss to coat nuts. Stir and toss until all the sugar has melted into the nuts; if bits of un-melted sugar remain on the nuts, they will not fry properly. Stir the nuts again before frying. Using a large slotted spoon, transfer a few nuts to the hot oil, allowing the foam to subside before adding another spoonful. (Otherwise, the oil could foam over and burn you.) Fry in small batches until the nuts are medium brown, about 45 seconds; be careful not to overcook. Scatter on an unlined baking sheet to cool slightly. In a small bowl, stir together cayenne, cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and pepper. While the nuts are still warm, transfer them to a bowl and sprinkle evenly with about half of the spice mix. Toss well to distribute the spices and then taste a nut. Add more spice mix, to taste, and toss well after each addition. When cool, pack in an airtight jar. They will keep at room temperature for at least 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29257,&quot;Peanut Butter and Jelly Pizza 1 whole-wheat or multi-grain English muffin 2 tbsps.

Let soak until the dasima doubles in size and the water turns a slight green-yellow, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, remove and discard the heads of the anchovies. Split the anchovies in half along the spines to remove the innards; discard the innards and set the anchovies aside. For the gochujang sauce: Stir together the gochujang, sugar, soy sauce, corn syrup, and gochugaru in a small bowl and set aside.<br> For the plain tteok: Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Soak a rice paper wrapper in a large shallow bowl of warm water until slightly bendy but still stiff, about 15 seconds, then lay on a cutting board. Repeat soaking with another rice paper wrapper then lay directly on top of the first wrapper. Repeat soaking with a third wrapper and place on top of the stacked wrappers. Push out any air bubbles, letting the wrappers adhere together. (If the wrappers are too wet and slippery to roll, then pat them with a paper towel to remove the excess water.) Starting from the edge of the stack closest to you, roll the stack into a tight log away from you. Place the log on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining rice paper wrappers to create 6 logs. Cut each log into 3 equal pieces, each about 3 inches long, to yield a total of 18 tteok.<br> For the cheese tteok: Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Soak a rice paper wrapper in a large shallow bowl of warm water until pliable, about 15 seconds, then lay on a cutting board. Place a mozzarella slice on the bottom half of the wrapper, leaving 1/2 inch space from bottom. Fold the sides of the wrapper over the mozzarella, then fold up the bottom flap and roll up into a tight log. Place the log on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining rice paper wrappers to create 4 cheese tteok.<br> Bring the dasima anchovy broth to a boil over medium heat and boil until the broth starts to foam around the sides, 1 to 2 minutes. Discard the square of dasima, then add the reserved anchovies. Boil for 5 minutes, then remove the anchovies with a slotted spoon and discard them. Add the gochujang sauce to the broth and boil, stirring, until incorporated and the resulting sauce is homogenous and slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and fish cakes (see Cook&#39;s Note) and cook until the onions are slightly softened and the fish cakes are warmed through, about 2 minutes.

Set aside. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 7 minutes. Add the turkey and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink on the surface, about 5 minutes. Stir in the ketchup, chili sauce, 1/2 cup water, the chili powder and garlic powder; continue cooking until the meat is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes. Split the baked potatoes open lengthwise, dot with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and gently fluff the flesh with a fork.

When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer, turn off the heat and let sit 10 minutes to infuse the flavor. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. In a thin stream, whisk the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Then pour the egg-cream mixture back into the saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees F it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you do not have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Whisk in the mascarpone. Meanwhile, in a bowl, put in 2 handfuls of ice cubes and add cold water to cover. Rest a smaller bowl in the ice water. Pour the cream mixture through a fine sieve or chinois (to remove the vanilla bean pieces) and into the smaller bowl. Chill until cool, about 1 hour, then stir in the crystallized ginger and continue according to the directions of your ice cream maker to freeze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 29262,&quot;Crab Cakes and Caesar Salad 1/2 teaspoon crushed garlic 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus 1/2 cup 4 flat anchovy fillets, drained 1/8 teaspoon dry mustard 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 2 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1 head baby romaine lettuce 1 coddled egg 4 long focaccia croutons, crushed, recipe follows 4 spring onions 2 teaspoons chopped chives 14 ounces crab meat Salt and pepper 4 ounces mayonnaise 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 8 ounces fresh white bread crumbs Olive oil 8 plum tomatoes, chopped 1 bunch chives, cleaned 2 ounces black olives, pitted 2 teaspoons grain mustard 4 ounces fish cream sauce, recipe follows 8 slices cooked lobster tail meat 1 medium Focaccia loaf, sliced thinly 1/2 cup olive oil Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon minced shallots 1 tablespoon butter 4 ounces fish stock 4 ounces heavy cream Instructions: Crab Cakes: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Line standard-size cupcake pans with 16 cupcake liners. In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy milk, agave nectar, canola oil, cane sugar, vanilla extract and apple cider vinegar, and set aside. In a large bowl, sift the flour, cocoa powders, baking powder, baking soda and salt and whisk them together. Add your wet mixture to the dry and whisk until the mixture is evenly moist and only a few lumps remain. Set aside. For the ganache: Whisk together the chocolate chunks, soy milk and agave nectar in a microwave-safe bowl. Place the bowl into a microwave and heat for 1-minute increments, whisking in-between, until the mixture is thick and smooth. Take your cupcake batter and start to stream in about 1 cup of the chocolate ganache and gently fold it into the batter. Do not fully mix it into the batter, it should be swirled in. Fill the liners three-quarters full and bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the salted caramel sauce: In a nonstick saucepan, add the coconut milk fat. Add in the brown sugar, vanilla and salt, and whisk well. Bring the mixture to a boil on medium-high heat, whisking occasionally. Once the mixture starts to boil, reduce the heat to a low bowl and cook for 35 to 45 minutes, whisking every couple of minutes, until the sauce has reduced by half. The resulting mixture will be thick and golden. Allow the caramel to cool slightly and use immediately. For the buttercream: Whip the shortening and margarine together in a mixer bowl with the paddle attachment until fluffy. Scrape down the bowl and put back onto the mixer on low-speed and slowly add the powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Once the mixture is fully incorporated, stream in 1 cup of the chocolate ganache. Once the ganache is added, you may turn the mixer to medium-high and whip until the buttercream is very fluffy. To assemble: Poke a hole in the center of each cupcake using the end of a wooden spoon or small offset spatula. Fill the hole completely with salted caramel sauce. Using a round frosting tip, generously frost the top of each cupcake with the dark chocolate buttercream. Drizzle the top of each cupcake with more salted caramel sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 29294,&quot;Veggie Burger with Gruyere and Mushrooms 1 Grillers Prime?

Put some of the turkey mixture in the center of each tortilla, drizzle with some of the Creamy Avocado Sauce, roll and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 29304,&quot;Speck and Mustard Greens Pizza Kosher salt 1 bunch mustard greens, washed well All-purpose flour, for dusting Four 12-ounce balls Pizza Dough, at room temperature, recipe follows Extra-virgin olive oil 8 ounces mozzarella, grated 4 ounces fontina, grated 6 ounces thinly sliced speck 1 package dry active yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 1/2 cup lukewarm water 4 cups bread flour 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup cold water 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for bowl Instructions: Preheat a wood-fired pizza oven to very hot 4 hours before cooking. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the mustard greens and cook about 3 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Chop into large pieces.<br> Sprinkle some flour on your pizza peel. Using a rolling pin, stretch your dough to a very thin 10-inch round.<br> Drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil on each round, leaving a 1-inch crust. Sprinkle with a quarter of the mozzarella and a handful of fontina.<br> Gently put the pizza on the floor of the pizza oven. Bake until the cheese is just melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pizza and top with a quarter of the greens and a quarter of the slices of speck. Place back in the oven and bake for another minute. Remove the pizza and drizzle with olive oil. Slice and serve immediately.<br> Repeat with the remaining 3 balls of pizza dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer, stir the yeast, lukewarm water and 1/2 cup bread flour. Mix well and let sit until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Whisk together the remaining 3 1/2 cups bread flour and salt in another bowl.<br> Once the yeast mixture is nice and bubbly and looks like foamy beer, add the cold water and olive oil. Using a dough hook, turn the mixer on and add the flour in increments. Mix the dough until the dough starts creeping up the dough hook and comes away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes.<br> Place the dough in a large bowl lightly greased with olive oil. Turn to coat all sides with oil. Cover the bowl loosely with a tea towel. Let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Punch the dough down, and let rise another hour.<br> Divide the dough into 4 equal disks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 29305,&quot;Cold Sesame Noodles 1/2 pound dried buckwheat (soba) noodles 9 tablespoons dark sesame oil 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and crushed with the side of a knife 2 garlic cloves, crushed with the side of a knife 1 red Thai bird cl, minced, seeds and all 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 1/4 cup rice vinegar 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce 6 tablespoons water, room temperature 1 tablespoon chili sauce 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, for garnish 2 green onions, thinly sliced on the diagonal 1 lime, cut into wedges, for serving Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.

Begin preparing rice by soaking in water for 20 minutes. Drain and set aside. Prepare masala 1 by grinding together garlic clove and ginger to a fine paste. This can be done through the feed tube of a running food processor and finished with a mortar and pestle or molachete. Prepare masala 2 by grinding coriander seeds, fennel seeds and poppy seeds (either manually with a mortar and pestle or with a coffee grinder). Then make a fine paste by adding the red chiles through the feed tube of a food processor followed by the dry ground spices. Prepare masala 3 by grinding together coconut, cashew nuts and yogurt (in that order) through the feed tube of a running food processor. To begin cooking the lamb, heat 4 teaspoons ghee in a wok and swirl to coat inside surface. Add 3 cloves, 3 cardamom pods, and 3 cinnamon sticks, and \\toast\\ briefly in the wok. Then, add chopped green chiles and onion and fry until mixture turns golden brown (be careful not to burn). Add masala 1 and stir well, cooking for a few minutes. Add masala 2 and stir well, cooking for a few minutes to integrate flavors. Add the diced tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer marinated lamb to wok and also add cilantro and mint leaves. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, then add 1/2 cup water and salt. Cover and cook for 15 minutes, then stir in masala 3. Cover and cook until the sauce becomes thick. For the rice: Heat 3 teaspoons ghee in another wok or saucepan and add cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, bay leaf and cumin seeds, and fry for 1 minute. Add the rice and stir for about 2 to 3 minutes to \\toast\\ the rice. Add the 3 1/2 cups water and salt, bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and let cook until the water is absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. When rice is done, remove from heat and allow to cool. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. The biryani will be layered in a dish. A 13 by 9-inch ovenproof dish (such as the type used for lasagna) or something similar would be suitable. Divide rice into 3 parts and the lamb mixture into 2 parts. Grease the dish and arrange 5 alternate layers of rice and meat, beginning and ending with rice. Dissolve the saffron (or yellow food coloring) in the 1/4 cup milk and spoon it over the top layer of rice. Cover the biryani (with foil) and bake for 30 minutes. Let rest for a few minutes before serving. Transfer to a serving plate to reveal layers. Garnish with fried onions, cashew nuts, raisins and hard boiled eggs. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 29312,&quot;Ma&#39;s Morning Mocktail 2 cups orange juice, fresh squeezed or store-bought with pulp, chilled 1/2 cup fresh or frozen strawberries with green tops removed, plus optional strawberry slices for garnish<br> One 750-milliliter bottle sparkling apple cider (see Cook&#39;s Note) Orange slices, for garnish, optional<br> Instructions: Add the orange juice and strawberries to a blender and blend until smooth.

Pour the egg mixture into a baking pan large enough to give you room to turn and soak the bread. (A 13 by 9-inch pan works well.) Lay the bread slices in the egg mixture and let them soak, turning them several times, until the bread has soaked up all the egg. Turn them gently so they don&#39;t break apart on you. Heat the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. When it starts to bubble, lay the soaked bread in the pan. Cook, turning once, until the bread is nicely browned and the egg in the center of each slice is cooked through, about 12 minutes. Serve warm with the Orange-Rum Bananas. Note: If your skillet isn&#39;t large enough to hold all the bread slices at once, cook them in batches. Before you start your first batch, preheat your oven to 200 degrees F (or \\Warm). Keep the cooked slices warm on a baking sheet in the oven while you cook the rest. Heat rum, sugar, butter and orange juice in a large skillet until the butter is melted. Add the bananas. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then lower the heat so the sauce is bubbling gently. Cook until the bananas are softened, about 4 minutes.

Place flour in an oven bag and shake to coat the interior. Add cracked pepper and brisket to bag and shake to coat surface of meat with pepper. Place bagged brisket in roasting pan. Add honey mustard, horseradish and 1/2 cup of water and seal bag. Bake for about 45 minutes per pound. On the episode we cooked this dish sous vide, French for \\under vacuum,\\ and which applies to cooking vacuum packed foods at a very low temperature of around 140 degrees F usually in liquid. Because of food safety concerns, special equipment is required for true sous vide cooking. If you happen to own one of the appliances which vacuum seals food in plastic bags which are safe for boiling, you may wish to use their \\boil-in-bag\\ method, which is similar to sous vide. However, be sure to follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Alternatively you may wish to use a \\faux sous vide\\ cooking method (done similarly to sous vide, only without a vacuum). To do this you would wrap the ingredients in plastic and immerse them in a court bouillon - the term for a \\poaching liquid\\ consisting of a vegetable broth - and simmer on the stovetop at a low temperature (necessary to avoid melting the plastic) for about 2 hours. (A \\simmer\\ in classical cooking is just below a boil.) While the corned beef is cooking, prepare the honey mustard sauce: Combine the milk, onion, bay leaf, cloves and nutmeg in a heavy-gauge, non-corrosive saucepan over medium heat. In a separate pan create a roux by cooking the butter and flour for a few minutes, stirring continuously, without browning, until it emits a nutty aroma. Remove from the heat. When the milk is fairly hot, pour a small amount of it into the cooled down roux, stirring until the milk is thoroughly blended in. Return this to the remaining milk, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and season, to taste, with salt and white pepper. Whisk in honey mustard and cover with a piece of plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Let corned beef rest 10 minutes before carving. Serve slices on open face rye with honey mustard sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 29318,&quot;Red and Black Checkerboard Cookies 2 sticks unsalted butter, softened 3/4 cup sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> Red gel food coloring<br> 2 tablespoons Dutch-process cocoa powder, such as Hershey&#39;s Special Dark<br> Instructions: Beat the butter, sugar, vanilla and salt together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups flour and beat on low until incorporated. Divide the dough in half. (This recipe relies on precision, so use a scale if you have one.) Return half of the dough to the bowl and add about 8 drops food coloring and the remaining 2 tablespoons flour. Beat until thoroughly incorporated. Add more food coloring until the dough is a true, bright red, beating well to fully distribute the color. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until just firm, about 30 minutes. Put the remaining dough in the bowl and add the cocoa powder. Beat until evenly distributed. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until just firm, about 30 minutes. Use a ruler to draw a 7-inch square on 2 pieces of parchment. Invert one piece of parchment and put one piece of dough in the square. Cover with another, unmarked parchment and pat and roll the dough to the dimensions of the square, making sure it is an even thickness. Trim the edges of the square if necessary. Carefully transfer the dough on the parchment to the refrigerator and chill until firm. Meanwhile, repeat with the other piece of dough and chill. Take out one square of dough and use a ruler to carefully cut it into 9 3/4-inch-thick strips (there may be extra dough). Carefully return the dough to the refrigerator until firm and repeat with the other square of dough. Refrigerate until firm. Lay out a clean piece of parchment paper. Carefully arrange three strips of dough directly next to each other on the parchment, alternating colors (i.e. red, black, red). Top each strip with a strip of the opposite color to make a second layer. Continue to layer, again alternating colors, to make a cookie brick; it will be 3-by-6 inches. Use a ruler or the side of a bench scraper to straighten the edges of the brick. Wrap the brick in the parchment paper, gently turning and pressing against the work surface to flatten out all the sides. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Slice the brick crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick cookies, arranging them about 1/2 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake the cookies, switching the positions of the baking sheets halfway through, until slightly puffed and just set, 12 to 13 minutes. Cool on the pans 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29319,&quot;Pork Milanese with Warm Autumn Salad and Poached Egg 1 cup all-purpose flour 6 large eggs 1 cup panko bread crumbs 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving 2 boneless pork loin chops, butterflied and gently flattened with the bottom of a saute pan Kosher salt 1 tablespoon white vinegar Extra-virgin olive oil 1 small red onion, sliced Crushed red pepper flakes 1 cup porcini mushrooms, cut into bite-size pieces 1 cup baby arugula 1 radicchio trevisano, julienned 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Set up a standard breading procedure by putting the flour, 2 eggs beaten with 1 tablespoon water, and panko mixed with 1/4 cup grated Parmesan in separate wide flat containers. Season the pork, generously, with salt on both sides. Using 1 hand for wet ingredients and the other hand for dry ingredients, coat the meat in the flour, then the eggs, and then the bread crumbs, pressing the panko onto the pork to adhere. Set aside until ready to cook. Line a baking sheet with a silpat or parchment paper. Spread a tablespoon of the grated parmesan into a thin circle about 3-inches in diameter to form a frico. Repeat 3 more times. Put the baking sheet into the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and reduce the heat to 200 degrees F. In a large saucepan over high heat, bring 2 to 3 inches of water to a boil. Add the white vinegar and reduce the heat to bring the water to a bare simmer. Carefully crack the remaining 4 eggs into the water and cook until the whites are set but the yolk is still soft, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and place them into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Keep the water on the fire to reheat the eggs when you are ready to serve. In a large skillet over medium heat add olive oil until it is about a 1/2-inch deep. Check the temperature of the oil by dipping the edge of the pork into the oil, if it does not sizzle and bubble STOP and WAIT! Check it again in another minute. If the oil is smoking it is too hot. When the oil is at the proper temperature gently add the meat. Do not crowd the pan or you will end up with greasy pork, it may be necessary to work in batches. When the pork is beautifully golden brown on each side and cooked through, remove from the pan and blot on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and put them in a warm oven on a sheet pan. In another large skillet over medium-high heat, pour in a thin layer of olive oil. Add the onions and a pinch of red pepper flakes, season with salt, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt, and cook until they are soft and wilted, about 3 to 4 minutes. If the pan is looking dry add another few drops of olive oil. Add the arugula, radicchio and red wine vinegar. Toss to combine and add more olive oil if needed. Season with salt, if needed. When you are ready to serve, remove the poached eggs from the ice bath and put them back into the hot water. Arrange a piece of pork in the center of each serving plate and top it with some of the salad. Remove each egg from the hot water and pat dry. Put it on top of the salad and sprinkle with a few red pepper flakes. Carefully remove a frico from the baking sheet and prop it up next to the egg. Sprinkle some extra Parmesan all around and drizzle with some olive oil. You rock! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 29320,&quot;Hybrid Caramel Creme Brulee Apple 4 cups cream 8 ounces sugar 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 8 egg yolks<br> 4 cups goat milk 1 cup sugar<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cinnamon stick<br> 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped, optional 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 12 crab apples<br> Instructions: For the creme brulee: In a medium saucepan, bring the cream, sugar and vanilla bean to a boil. Add the egg yolks and continue to cook, whisking until slightly thickened. Remove the pan from the heat, strain and set aside for later use. For the caramel: Stir together the milk and sugar in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. (Make sure the liquid only goes three-quarters of the way up the sides, as it will froth when the baking soda is added.) Add the vanilla extract, salt, cinnamon stick and vanilla bean with seeds if using. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat, constantly stirring, and bring to a boil, about 15 minutes. Keep your eyes on the pot-- it boils over easily and quickly! Quickly remove from the heat and add the baking soda to the pot. The mixture will rise and become frothy, just keep stirring the mixture. Return the pot to medium heat, and stir frequently, about every 10 minutes. Make sure the milk stays at a gentle simmer rather than a raging boil, and stir across the bottom of the pot to make sure the mixture is not scorching. Adjust the heat as needed. Cook until the milk starts to turn golden brown, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick and the vanilla pod. At this point, it will start to thicken quickly, so it&#39;s important to keep stirring so the milk doesn&#39;t burn on the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring until the mixture is a rich brown and thick enough to coat the back of the spoon, 15 to 30 minutes. Cool the sauce slightly and then pour into an airtight container. Store the mixture in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Using a melon baller, hollow out the crab apples. Fill the centers with the creme brulee and bake until the creme brulee is set. Chill overnight. Reheat the caramel until soft enough for dipping. Dip the stuffed apples using a stick or fork. Chill for 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 29321,&quot;Carrot Cookies 3/4 cup all purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon grated orange zest 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/3 cup vegetable oil 1 large egg 1/3 cup sugar 1/3 cup cooked and pureed carrots 1/4 cup golden raisins Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a 4- or 6-quart cast iron Dutch oven, or other heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid, combine the tomatoes, 2 cups of the wine, the 1/2 cup of the water, sliced onions, peppercorns and tarragon. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes. Raise the heat back to high. Add the lobsters to the pot; cover the pot immediately with a heavy, tight-fitting lid. Steam the lobsters until they are bright red and you can pull out the long feelers on the head with no resistance, about 13 minutes. Using tongs, immediately plunge the lobsters into the bowl of ice water and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove the lobsters from the ice water and set on a rimmed baking sheet. Using kitchen shears, remove the lobster meat from the tails and claws. Use a knife to chop the meat into bite-size pieces. You should have about 1 pound of lobster meat, set aside. Rinse the lobster shells, including the heads, and place all the shells back into the pot with the lobster poaching liquid. Add 2 1/2 quarts of water and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 hour. Strain the lobster stock through a fine mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth. Transfer the stock to a clean saucepan and return to a simmer. Reduce the stock until you have about 6 cups remaining. For the pappardelle with lobster: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the papardelle and cook until al dente, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove 1/2 cup pasta cooking water from the pot and drain the pasta through a colander. Transfer the pasta to a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, cover and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the corn and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the garlic and continue to cook and stir for another minute.

Add the butter, pulsing until you have pea-sized pieces. Mix together the vodka and apple cider vinegar in a small bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of the vodka mixture to the flour mixture and pulse, adding more of the vodka mixture a tablespoon at a time as needed, until the dough comes together when gently pinched (you may not need to add all of it). Dump the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap, flatten into a disc and wrap tightly. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Put the dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll into a 1/4-inch-thick round. Use the rolling pin to help guide the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Press gently into the corners of the pie plate and crimp the edges decoratively. Refrigerate for 1 hour.<br> Arrange an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Prick the bottom of the dough all over with the tines of a fork. Place a piece of parchment on top of the dough and fill with pie weights or baking beans. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the parchment and pie weights and bake until golden around the edges and light golden in the center, an additional 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely.<br> For the filling: Add 2 tablespoons triple sec to a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over top; set aside.<br> Add the cranberries, orange zest and juice, ginger, 1/2 cup sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons triple sec to a small saucepan and place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and continue to cook until the cranberries begin to pop and break down, about 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the gelatin mixture until completely dissolved and combined. Transfer the mixture to a blender and let cool slightly, then puree until very smooth. Pour into a large bowl and set aside to cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.<br> When the mixture has cooled, add the heavy cream to a stand mixture fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on high, streaming in the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar slowly, until the mixture reaches stiff peaks. Stir one-third of the whipped cream into the cranberry mixture to lighten it. Then fold the cranberry mixture into the remaining whipped cream until no streaks remain. Add the filling to the pie crust. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.<br> For the decorations: Before serving, beat the egg white together with 1 tablespoon water. Toss the cranberries in the egg white mixture, then drain completely using a wide-mesh strainer. Put the sugar in a medium bowl, add the cranberries and toss to coat completely. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet to dry.<br> Pile whipped cream in the center of the pie, top with the cranberries and sprinkle with the orange peel strips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 29324,&quot;Garlic Red Bliss Mash 3 pounds red bliss potatoes<br> 4 cloves garlic Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons butter, room temperature 1/2 to 1 cup heavy cream, room temperature Instructions: In a large pot, cover potatoes and garlic with water by 1 inch.

Slice the bottom and stem ends off the pepper and cut the ends into corn kernel-size pieces. Remove the seeds and cut the pepper into 4 rings. Scatter the tomatoes down the center of a baking sheet and arrange the pepper rings next to the tomatoes on whichever side you&#39;d like. Drizzle 1 teaspoon of the oil over the tomatoes and sprinkle with salt, pepper and about half of the BBQ rub. Toss together the corn, pepper pieces, cheese, yogurt, cilantro, a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper in a bowl. Fill the pepper rings with the corn mixture. Bake the vegetables until slightly browned, about 20 minutes.<br> While the vegetables are in the oven, brush each salmon fillet with dijonnaise and sprinkle with the remaining BBQ rub, some salt and a few grinds of pepper.<br> Once the vegetables are browned, remove the baking sheet from the oven and drizzle the empty side with the remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Add the fillets, return to the oven and cook until the sides of the salmon feel firm when gently squeezed and the flesh is just slightly flaky, 5 minutes more. Sprinkle with cilantro leaves and serve with lime wedges.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 29326,&quot;Green cl Chicken 1/2 cup olive oil 3 tablespoons lime juice<br> 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, or more to taste 2 cloves garlic<br> 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts<br> 6 poblano chiles<br> 8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, cut into 6 slices<br> Instructions: First, make the marinade for the chicken: Combine the olive oil, lime juice, cumin, salt, pepper, chipotle peppers and garlic in a blender and mix until totally pureed. Pour into a large resealable plastic bag with the chicken breasts. Seal the bag, smush it around to coat the chicken and place it in the fridge to marinate for at least 4 hours (overnight if possible). After the chicken has marinated, roast the poblano chiles one-by-one over the flame of your stovetop, using metal tongs to hold them, until the skin is totally charred. (If you don&#39;t have a gas stove, you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your oven&#39;s broiler.) When the skin is totally blackened, place the chiles in a large resealable plastic bag and seal the bag to allow the chiles to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Remove the chiles and use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Slice the chiles in half lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds and membranes. Lay out the cl halves so they&#39;ll be ready for the next step. Preheat a grill pan to medium-high heat (or use a skillet). Grill the chicken (or saute in the skillet) for 4 minutes on the first side. Turn the chicken over and lay 2 cl halves and a nice slice of cheese on the cooked side of each piece. Turn the heat to medium low and allow the chicken to finish cooking until it&#39;s totally done in the center, 4 to 5 minutes. The cheese should melt on its own; if it needs a little help, invert an iron skillet over it (or put the lid on the skillet, if using). Serve! &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 29327,&quot;A Salad with Crunch and Substance: Bean and Vegetable Tostadas Vegetable oil, for frying 4 (6-inch) corn tortillas 2 pinches coarse salt 1 (14-ounce) can spicy vegetarian refried beans (vegetarian beans contain no lard) 1 cup shredded smoked Cheddar, Monterey Jack, or pepper Jack 1 heart Romaine lettuce or 1/2 head of iceberg lettuce, shredded 2 small plum tomatoes, diced 1 small white skinned onion, finely chopped 2 tablespoons (a palm full) chopped cilantro or parsley Instructions: Heat 1/8 to 1/4-inch oil over medium high heat.

Mix all the dry ingredients together in a large bowl, make a well in the center and pour all of the buttermilk in at once. Using 1 hand, stir in a full circle starting in the center of the bowl working towards the outside of the bowl until all the flour is incorporated. The dough should be soft but not too wet and sticky. When it all comes together, a matter of seconds, turn it out onto a well-floured board. WASH AND DRY YOUR HANDS. Roll dough around gently with floured hands for a second, just enough to tidy it up, flip the dough over. Pat the dough into a round about 1 1/2-inches deep. Sprinkle a little flour onto the center of a baking sheet and place the loaf on top of the flour. Cut a deep cross on it with a sharp knife, prick the four sections to let the fairies out. Let the cuts go over the sides of the bread to make sure of this. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 400 degrees for 20 minutes, or until just cooked. If you are in doubt, tap the bottom of the bread: if it is cooked it will sound hollow.

Using a large flat plate prepare the \\dredging flour\\ with salt and pepper and set aside. Take 2 of the maple sausage links and cut them into half so you have 4 pieces. Open the chicken breasts and remove the \\fillet\\ and reserve for another use. Make a small pocket in the inside of the breast. Place 1 of the sausage pieces in the pocket and wrap the breast around it creating a closed container surrounding the sausage. Dredge the breasts in the prepared flour and set the 4 breasts on a clean plate. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in an oven safe lidded skillet. Starting with the open end first, brown the breasts fully being careful not to open the closed breast. As the breasts cook, the opening will seal making it easier to finish the searing and browning. Once fully browned cover and place in the oven and cook through. Using a small saucepan, combine basil pesto and cream and mix well. Over medium heat reduce the pesto/cream mixture by 1/3 and set aside. For the spinach: Plump the raisins in a cup of warm water and set aside. Cut the remaining sausage in to small pieces and set aside. Remove the frozen spinach from the package. Carefully cut the blocks into 8 large pieces. Using a lidded skillet, saute the onion in 2 tablespoons of olive oil for 2 minutes. Add the sausage and lightly brown. Add the frozen spinach and cover. When the spinach has totally thawed combine the onion and sausage and season with salt to taste. Add the raisins and their liquid and finish cooking, about 10 minutes. Allow the liquid to evaporate but do not dry out completely. Tomatoes, zucchini flowers and string beans: Using a non-stick pan quickly sear the tomatoes in some butter. Do not cook them longer than 30 seconds on each side. Reserve the pan and juices for cooking the zucchini flowers. Gently open the zucchini flower and remove the piston from its center. Replace it with a small piece of brie and close the flower. Using the same pan from above quickly cook the zucchini flowers. They are done when you see the Brie melting. Remove from the pan and place 1 on each of the seared tomato slices. Set aside. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the string beans and cook until your desired doneness. Dress with extra virgin olive oil and some freshly squeezed lemon. Season with the freshly ground black pepper. Remove the roasted chicken breasts from the oven and remove the skin. Place one breast centered on the lower third of the individual plate. Place a zucchini flower topped tomato on each plate centered above the breast. Frame the plate with some dressed sting beans on one side and the sauteed spinach on the other. Slowly re-heat the basil pesto sauce and place 2 to 3 spoonfuls of the sauce on each breast. Serve warm and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 29345,&quot;Blueberry Coleslaw 1 head Savoy cabbage, sliced 1 cup onion, sliced 1 carrot, julienne 1 pint blueberries 1 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon cumin seed, toasted Instructions: When shredding the cabbage and other vegetables, use a Japanese mandolin on its thinnest setting.

Add a small potato about the size of a golf ball to the water. It will sink to the bottom. Now begin pouring salt into the water, mixing gently, until the potato bobs to the surface of the water. Discard potato. Place salmon fillets in brine and allow to soak in a cool place for 1 hour. Remove salmon fillets from brine solution and pat dry. Set aside. In a measuring cup, blend together honey and whisky. Gently brush fillets with blended honey and whisky mixture. Smoke fillets for 9 hours in smoke house or water smoker. Alternatively, soak wood shavings or chips (apple, beech, or untreated cedar) in water for about 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare a small charcoal fire in a dome-shaped barbecue. You are trying to maintain a covered temperature somewhere between 200 and 300 degrees F. When the coals are glowing, place salmon fillets on the grill on the side opposite to the coals. Sprinkle damp wood chips over coals and cover grill. Because this method is somewhat hotter than smokehouse or smoker methods, smoke fish for about 45 minutes. Check progress halfway through cooking. You are looking for a bronzed, shiny exterior and a firm buttery interior. Serve fillets with a side of mixed greens and dressing. Top fillets with a small drizzle of Islay whisky. Make dressing. In a small bowl whisk together the first 6 ingredients in the order in which they appear. Toss mixed greens with dressing until evenly coated. Arrange greens to one side of plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 29348,&quot;Chez Louis Roast Chicken 12 whole cloves garlic, roasted 2 (3 to 3 1/2 pound) chickens, cleaned weight 10 tablespoons olive oil 10 tablespoons corn, peanut or vegetable oil 1 large head of fresh garlic, cut crosswise through center 6 sprigs fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried 12 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried 4 teaspoons red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup white wine 2 cups fresh or canned chicken broth Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste 2 tablespoons butter Instructions: To roast the garlic, preheat oven to 425 degrees. Break the garlic into individual unpeeled cloves, season with salt and pepper and 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Place the garlic in a heat-proof baking dish and place in the oven. Bake 25 minutes and set aside. Put chickens in a large bowl and add olive oil, corn oil, split head of garlic, rosemary and half the thyme sprigs. Cover and refrigerate. Let stand turning occasionally, for 24 hours. When ready to cook, scrape the herbs from the chickens, season with salt and pepper. It is not necessary to truss them. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Heat a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chickens in one layer without crowding, or use 2 skillets. Place the chickens in the skillet(s) breast side down. Cook until the breasts are nicely browned, about 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the chickens to the opposite side and then on their backs. Brown each part of the chickens as they are turned. Place the chickens in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the chickens from the skillet and pour off the fat. Add the wine and vinegar (if 2 skillets are used, use half the remaining ingredients for each skillet), the broth, the roasted garlic cloves, the remaining thyme sprigs tied in a bundle and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and cook for about 2 minutes. Swirl in the butter, stirring, and add any liquid that may flow from the inside of each chicken. Carve the chickens and arrange on dinner plates. Garnish each serving with thyme sprigs and roasted garlic cloves. Spoon the sauce over and serve Note: For a wood smoke flavor to the roast chicken - place a roasting pan on top of your stove burner. Add 1 cup of apple wood chips and cover with a wire rack. This must be done in a well ventilated area, or you can heat the pan on the stove and then bring it outside. Heat the pan on the burner on high heat until the wood chips begin to smoke. Place the chickens into the rack and cover with another pan (inverted) or aluminum foil. Smoke for about 5 minutes then remove from pan and begin browning. An old roasting pan should be used for this technique. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 29349,&quot;Spanish Omelet with Romesco Sauce 1/4 cup hazelnuts (with skin) 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1/4 cup roasted almonds 1 slice crusty bread, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 cloves garlic, sliced 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more to taste 1 whole peeled canned tomato 1/4 cup jarred roasted red peppers (preferably piquillos) 1/2 to 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar Kosher salt 5 large eggs Kosher salt 1 scallion, minced 1/2 cup coarsely grated manchego cheese 3 thin slices iberico or serrano ham Instructions: Prepare the sauce: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Wrap in a clean towel while still warm and rub to remove the skins.

(I lay two pieces of plastic wrap crosswise in the pan, overlapping in the center.) Place the pan in the freezer. Place a large heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Place the butter in the bowl, then the chocolate and coffee powder and heat until just melted, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula. As soon as the chocolate and butter are melted, take the bowl off the heat and whisk in, one at a time, and in order, first the confectioners&#39; sugar, then the cocoa powder, egg yolks, Cognac and salt. Set the bowl aside for 15 minutes to cool. Place the egg whites and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on high speed until the whites form firm but not dry peaks. Fold the whites into the cooled chocolate mixture with a rubber spatula. Without cleaning the bowl or whisk attachment, pour the cream and vanilla into the bowl and beat on high speed until it forms firm peaks. Fold the cream carefully but thoroughly into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the prepared loaf pan, smooth the top, fold the plastic wrap over the top and chill for 4 hours or overnight. To serve, turn the terrine out of the mold and unwrap it. Spoon a puddle of Orange Sauce in the middle of each dessert plate and place a slice of the terrine in the middle. Sprinkle each serving lightly with orange zest and fleur de sel. Beat the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed for 3 minutes, until very thick. Reduce to low speed and mix in the cornstarch. With the mixer still on low, slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture (I use a liquid measuring cup for pouring). Pour the mixture into a clean, small, deep saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it reaches 180 degrees F on a candy thermometer and thickens to the consistency of heavy cream. The mixture will coat the spoon. Don&#39;t cook it above 180 degrees F or the eggs will scramble! Immediately (it will keep cooking in the saucepan), pour the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and stir in the vanilla, Cognac, Grand Marnier and orange zest.

Bring to a boil, adjust the heat and simmer until they are tender when pierced with a fork or the tip of a paring knife, about 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set them aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the potato skins with a paring knife and cut the potatoes into large chunks. Pass the chunks through a potato ricer (see Cook&#39;s Note) onto a clean work surface. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of salt over the potatoes; cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, pulse the matzo meal in a spice grinder or blender until very finely ground (it should be similar in texture to flour). Line a baking sheet with parchment.<br> Sprinkle 2 cups of the matzo meal over the cooled potatoes. Pour the eggs over the matzo meal and begin to work the mixture together with a fork. Once the mixture begins to clump together, use your hands to gently knead until the ingredients are fully combined, about 2 minutes. Gather the dough together into a smooth ball and let rest for about 15 minutes.<br> Lightly dust a work surface with a some of the reserved matzo meal. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough into a 12-inch rope. Use a knife or bench scraper to cut the rope into 3/4-inch pieces; place the cut gnocchi on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Gnocchi can be prepared to this point up to 2 days ahead; wrap the baking sheet in plastic and refrigerate.<br> For the sauce: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until brown flecks appear and the butter smells nutty, 5 to 6 minutes. Sprinkle in the sage and nutmeg and continue to cook, swirling the pan, until the butter is golden brown, about 1 minute more. Be careful not to let the butter burn. Remove from the heat and season with salt and black pepper; set aside while you cook the gnocchi.<br> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches, add about a third of the gnocchi at a time and cook until they begin to float and the water returns to a rapid simmer, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spider to transfer the gnocchi to the skillet with the butter sauce as they are cooked. Reserve 1/4 cup of the gnocchi cooking water.<br> Toss the gnocchi gently in the butter sauce. Add half of the cheese and 2 tablespoons of the reserved cooking water and toss again; add more water if necessary so the sauce coats the gnocchi.

Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and swirl to coat the pan. When the oil shimmers, add the eggs, which will puff up. Allow to set, about 5 seconds, and using a wok spatula or similar tool, push the sides of the egg mass toward the center to allow uncooked egg to reach the pan and solidify. Flip the mass, allow it to set, about 5 seconds, and slide it onto a dish; do not overcook. With the edge of the spatula, break the eggs into small pieces. Set aside. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil to the wok and swirl to coat the pan. When the oil shimmers, add the garlic and ginger and stir fry until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the la chang, the white parts of the scallions and the rice and toss thoroughly until heated through. Add the soy sauce, pepper and reserved eggs and toss. Correct the seasonings, adding the salt if necessary, transfer to a platter, and garnish with the scallion greens.

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then lower the heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and celery and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage, crumbling it into small bits with a fork, and saute, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes, until cooked and browned. Add the figs and cranberries with the liquid, the chopped rosemary, and pine nuts, and cook for 2 more minutes. Scrape up the brown bits with a wooden spoon. Place the stuffing mix in a large bowl. Add the sausage mixture, chicken stock, egg, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and stir well. (The stuffing may be prepared ahead and stored in the refrigerator overnight.) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place a baking rack on a sheet pan. Lay the butterflied turkey breast skin side down on a cutting board. Sprinkle the meat with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Spread the stuffing in a 1/2-inch-thick layer over the meat, leaving a half-inch border on all sides. Don&#39;t mound the stuffing or the turkey will be difficult to roll. (Place the leftover stuffing in a buttered gratin dish and bake for the last 45 minutes of roasting alongside the turkey.) Starting at 1 end, roll the turkey like a jelly roll and tuck in any stuffing that tries to escape on the sides. Tie the roast firmly with kitchen twine every 2 inches to make a compact cylinder. Place the stuffed turkey breast seam side down on the rack on the sheet pan. Brush with the melted butter, sprinkle generously with salt and pepper, and roast for 1 3/4 to 2 hours, until an instant-read thermometer registers 150 degrees F in the center. (I test in a few places.) Cover the turkey with aluminum foil and allow it to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.

Set aside to cool at room temperature, without stirring for 2 to 3 hours, or until the frosting is cool and thick enough to spread. Or, refrigerate the frosting for about 45 minutes or more (but not until it is hard) without stirring, then let it stand at room temperature until it is the desired consistency. SCHARFFEN BERGER Chocolate Cupcakes: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, and salt together thoroughly. Add the butter, eggs, and vanilla and beat on medium speed for one minute. Add half of the water and beat for 20 seconds. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the remaining water. Beat for 20-30 seconds until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin enough to pour. Divide it evenly among the lined cups. Bake 18-22 minutes (rotating the pan from front to back half-way through the baking time), just until a toothpick inserted into a few of the cupcakes comes out clean. Set the pan on a rack to cool. Frost the cupcakes when they are completely cool. Store and serve at room temperature. TIP: For light tender cupcakes, spoon flour and cocoa lightly into measuring cups (instead of dipping the cups into the flour or cocoa) and then sweep the measures level without tapping or shaking them. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]</p><p>Given the following recipe, provide the wine types that would pair well with the recipe.
