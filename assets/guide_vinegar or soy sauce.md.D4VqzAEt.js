Combine the pancetta, rosemary, red pepper flakes, garlic and lemon zest in a small food processor and pulse several times to make a coarse paste, scraping down the bowl as needed. Open the turkey like a book, skin-side down, on a large cutting board. (It should look like an irregular rectangle with the drumsticks on one side and the wings on the other.) Pull off the long, thin tenderloins from the breast, and lay them on the inside of the thigh meat to even out the thickness of the turkey. Sprinkle the inside of the turkey with some of the salt mixture, and top evenly with the pancetta mixture.<br> Roll up the turkey starting at the edge closest to you, and continue to roll forming a tight log, finishing with the seam-side down. Tie with kitchen string at 1-inch intervals, maintaining as tight a log as possible. Adjust the string to make the drumstick as straight as possible. Tuck the wings behind the turkey&#39;s back and sprinkle the outside with the remaining salt mixture. (The turkey can be prepared to this point up to 1 day in advance.)<br> Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven, remove the top racks and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Fit a wire rack into a baking sheet and put the turkey on top. Brush all over with olive oil and turn the turkey seam-side up. Roast until the skin is browned and crisp, about 1 hour. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully flip the turkey using a large spatula.<br> Return the turkey to the oven and continue cooking until the top is deep golden brown, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the turkey registers 155 degrees F, 50 to 60 minutes more. Remove from the oven, tent loosely with foil, and let rest 20 minutes before slicing. (The turkey will continue cooking as it rests.) Cut off the string with scissors, taking care not to tear the skin. Cut the turkey into 1/2- to 3/4-inch slices and separate the drumsticks and wings.

Bring the remaining blended oil to 385 degrees F in a rondo or Dutch oven. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Sear both sides of the lamb shanks until dark golden brown. Add carrots, celery and onions and cook until caramelized. Add garlic and cook for 10 more minutes. Deglaze the pan with red wine, adding it and stirring with a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the rondo. Cook, letting the alcohol evaporate, about 8 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, veal demi and chicken stock. Salt and pepper to taste. Place lamb shanks in a roasting pan, then add vegetable mix over top. Add bay leaves. Cover with a layer of parchment paper and then a layer of aluminum foil. Bake for 2 1/2 hours. Let it rest, covered, for 30 minutes, then strain the sauce with a fine chinois. Place 1 ladle of the Risotto in the center of a plate. With the back of the ladle, press down to create space for plating lamb shank vertically. Plate lamb shank. Ladle the braised lamb sauce around the Risotto. Finish with a drizzle of 1 tablespoon Gremolata over top of lamb. Repeat to make 3 more plates. Start by making saffron stock, combining chicken stock with 1 sachet saffron in a pot. Bring to a simmer, then turn off the heat and set aside for later. On medium-high heat, using a copper risotto pan, add half of the butter and the rice. The goal here is to toast outer shell of rice, but not brown it. This technique allows rice to have a more al dente texture when the cooking process is complete. Using a wooden spoon, stir the rice around the pot, keeping it moving at all times. Add onion and cook until they turn translucent and fragrant. Your rice should be seared but not browned. Deglaze with white wine and cook off alcohol. Add saffron stock 1 cup at a time. Cook, constantly stirring the risotto with a wooden spoon and scraping the bottom of the pot so nothing sticks to it. (The idea behind constant stirring is so all the rice cooks evenly; otherwise the rice at the bottom of the pan is at a hotter temperature and higher humidity, thus, it will cook faster than the rice on the surface of the pot. Add stock as needed. You want your risotto to be al dente, so make sure that when it comes to al dente you have as little liquid in the mix as possible.) The consistency you are looking for is that the risotto will barely run off the end of the wooden spoon. When the saffron stock is absorbed, finish with the Italian technique called \\manteca\\ ...meaning to finish with remaining butter and Parmesan. Heat up a saucepan on low heat and add oil. Stir in garlic and simmer for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in parsley, lemon and orange zests. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 51827,&quot;Fall Chicken Skillet 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon smoked paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 to 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 red onion, quartered and separated 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme 6 to 8 fresh sage leaves, minced 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves minced 2 cups halved Brussels sprouts 2 cups cubed butternut squash 1 head cauliflower, cut into small florets 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds Balsamic reduction, for finishing Toasted loaf of crusty bread, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Preheat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Mix the cumin, paprika and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle over all sides of the chicken. Add the olive oil to the skillet and add the chicken skin-side down. Sear until golden, 5 to 6 minutes, then flip and sear the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add the garlic, onion and some thyme, sage and rosemary, holding a few of the herbs back for later. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Brussels sprouts, butternut squash and cauliflower. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Nestle the chicken into the vegetables and sprinkle over the remaining herbs and a drizzle of olive oil. Transfer to the oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds. Drizzle with the balsamic reduction. Serve alongside a toasted loaf of crunchy bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 51828,&quot;Oven Roasted Beef Tenderloin with Citrus-Chanterelle Vinaigrette Warm Sesame-Spinach Roulade and Risotto Cake 2 tablespoons rock sugar or brown sugar 3/4 cup red wine 2 medium sized shallots, chopped 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger 1/2 cup green onion, chopped 1/4 cup cilantro 2 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons red miso 1 cup canola oil 2 pounds cleaned beef tenderloin, cut into 4 (8-ounce) portions 1 1/2 cups shallots, chopped 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only 3 cups chanterelles 1/2 cup white wine 1 cup mushroom stock 2 tablespoons mushroom soy sauce or soy sauce 1 lemon, juiced 1 cup canola oil 1/2 cup truffle oil Salt and pepper, to taste 3 cups chicken stock 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/2 cup onion, small dice 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 cups canaroli rice 1/2 cup white wine 1/2 cup Parmesan, plus a little for sprinkling 1/2 cup reserved chanterelle mushroom mixture, from above recipe, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped 2 tablespoons chives, chopped 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon canola oil Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the rock sugar with the red wine and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine the shallots, garlic, ginger, green onion, cilantro, thyme, red miso, soy sauce, reserved red wine, and the oil. Mix well. Add the beef to the mixture and marinate for 4 to 6 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare an oven safe, medium saute pan over high heat. Season the beef with the salt and pepper. Sear the beef for 2 minutes. Place the pan in the oven to finish cooking, about 8 to 10 minutes for medium rare. Take care that the beef does not burn as the marinade contains sugar. In a large saute pan over high heat, cook the shallots, garlic, ginger, and thyme, for 4 to 6 minutes. Add the chanterelle and cook for another 5 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine, then add the mushroom stock and the soy sauce. Set aside 1/2 cup of the mixture to be used in the risotto cake. Extract about 8 of the larger mushrooms to be used as garnish. Reduce the liquid by 1/3 and then puree the mixture in a blender. Add the lemon juice, canola oil, and truffle oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the chicken stock in a large pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and keep warm. Coat a large saucepan over medium heat with the olive oil. Sweat the onions and garlic, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the rice and saute for 4 additional minutes. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and reduce until almost dry. Slowly add the warm chicken stock allowing the rice to absorb the liquid. Stir the rice occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Keep adding the chicken stock until the rice is cooked al dente. Season with salt and pepper and add the reserved mushrooms, herbs, cheese, and butter. Bring a stockpot filled with salted water to a boil. Quickly blanch the spinach and then immediately plunge it into a bowl of ice water. Strain the spinach from the water and allow to dry. In a mixing bowl, combine the spinach, sesame seeds, sesame oil, Korean cl flakes, salt and pepper. Place the spinach mixture in the middle of a 12 by 12-inch piece of aluminum foil. Fold the mixture to form a roll with a one-inch diameter and twist the ends of the foil to secure the spinach. Place the foiled roll in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Remove the roulade from the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature. Using a serrated knife cut the roulade with foil intact into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Be sure to remove the foil before serving. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the sesame paste, rice wine vinegar, canola oil, shallot, ginger, salt, and pepper. Set aside. In a small mixing bowl, combine the truffle oil and the lemon juice. Add the radishes and chives and season with the salt and pepper. Set aside. Plating: Place the risotto near the top of the plate with the roulade resting on top of the risotto. Drizzle the sesame dressing over the roulade and sprinkle with sesame seeds, and then add the radish on top of the roulade. Cut the beef in half and rest it against the cake. Drizzle the vinaigrette around the plate and garnish with the reserved chanterelles, about 2 per plate. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Barolo]&quot; 51829,&quot;Surf and Turf for Two 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 6 jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined (tails intact) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Juice of 1/2 lemon 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, plus 2 to 3 sprigs Freshly ground pepper 6 slices pancetta (about 2 ounces) 1 10-ounce piece beef tenderloin, trimmed Sea salt 8 asparagus spears 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Instructions: Make the herb oil: Pulse the parsley, chives and olive oil in a mini food processor until smooth. Thin with water, if necessary, and add 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Transfer to a small bowl, cover and set aside. (This can be done up to 2 hours ahead.) Prepare the surf and turf: Toss the shrimp, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped thyme, and pepper to taste in a bowl. Wrap each shrimp with a piece of pancetta. Preheat the broiler. Arrange the shrimp on a foil-lined broiler pan. Season the beef with sea salt and pepper, press the thyme sprigs into the meat and set aside. Snap off the tough ends of the asparagus. Put the asparagus in a microwave-safe dish with 1/4 cup water and a pinch of sea salt. Heat a medium ovenproof skillet over high heat and add the butter. When the foam subsides, sear the beef until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Using tongs, hold the meat and brown the sides. Transfer the skillet to the broiler and cook until a thermometer inserted into the beef registers 125 degrees F for medium rare, about 4 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to rest while you cook the shrimp. Broil the shrimp until the pancetta is crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Meanwhile, microwave the asparagus until tender, about 2 minutes. Slice the beef into 4 pieces. Serve with the shrimp, herb oil and asparagus. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 51830,&quot;Hash Brown Breakfast Bundt 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing the pan 12 large eggs 1/2 cup heavy cream Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Two 20-ounce bags frozen, shredded hash browns, thawed (and drained if needed) 18 thin slices Cheddar or American cheese<br> 15 thin slices deli ham (about 3 ounces) 15 frozen, fully cooked sausage patties (about 12 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean and the tops are nicely browned. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 51835,&quot;Milk Chocolate and Almond Croissants 1 (17.3-ounce) package or 2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed Flour, for dusting, if needed 4 (1/2-ounce) mini milk chocolate bars, each broken into 4 equal pieces (recommended: Hershey&#39;s) 1 large egg, beaten Sugar, for sprinkling 1/2 (7-ounce) package almond paste, divided into 1/2 to 1 teaspoon pieces, shaped like a log or rolled into a ball Almond slices, for garnish Instructions: Special equipment: pizza cutter or kitchen shears, ruler Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 1 sheet thawed puff pastry on the work surface like a sheet of paper or portrait (not horizontal or landscape). If the puff pastry is very sticky, very lightly flour the work surface. Using a pizza cutter or kitchen shears, cut the puff pastry in half, widthwise. Using a ruler as a guide, make an indentation at 2-inch intervals (for the base) across the bottom of each puff pastry half. Cut each half into 8 triangles, with the base of each triangle measuring 2 inches. (They will be very long isosceles triangles.) You&#39;ll end up discarding the 2 end pieces to get the most out of your puff pastry piece. This sheet of triangles will be reserved for the chocolate croissants. Repeat the cutting for the second puff pastry sheet that will be used for the almond croissants. For the chocolate croissants: Place 1 chocolate piece just above the 2-inch edge of 1 pastry triangle, folding the dough over the chocolate as you tightly roll up the dough, enclosing the chocolate. Repeat with the remaining puff pastry and chocolate. Place the pastry rolls on the baking sheet, seam-side down. Cover the croissants with plastic wrap and place the baking sheet in the refrigerator until the dough firms up. (You can make these croissants 1 day ahead up to this point.) Just before baking, remove the croissants from the refrigerator, brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with sugar. For the almond croissants: Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon almond paste, shaped like a small log, just above the 2-inch edge of 1 pastry triangle, folding the dough over the almond paste as you tightly roll up the dough, enclosing the almond paste. Repeat with remaining puff pastry triangles and almond paste. Place the pastry rolls on a baking sheet, seam-side down. Cover the croissants with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator until the dough firms up. (You can make these croissants 1 day ahead up to this point.) Just before baking, remove the croissants from the refrigerator, brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle lightly with sugar and sliced almonds. Bake until the pastries are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. Cook&#39;s Note: These croissants are so easy and so good you&#39;ll want to stuff them with practically everything. They are perfect as is-chocolate croissants and almond croissants, but if you&#39;re feeling a little adventurous combine the chocolate and almond paste (scale back just a touch on the almond paste) in one croissant for a decadent treat. But don&#39;t stop there, you can stuff these mouthwatering minis with savory fillings too. Ham and cheese croissants are crazy good! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 51836,&quot;S&#39;mores Bars Nonstick cooking spray 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup whole-wheat flour<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature<br> 1 cup dark brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 4 cups miniature marshmallows<br> 2 cups dark chocolate chips<br> 3/4 cup caramel bits<br> 14 graham crackers, broken into small pieces<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine until the masa turns into a soft dough and forms a ball. Grab a small ball of dough about the size of a lemon and form a patty 1/2-inch thick. In a saute pan, add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and lightly fry the patty on both sides for 2 to 3 minutes each side. Remove from the pan and cool slightly. Add more vegetable oil to the pan, about a 1/2-inch up the side of the pan, and heat. In the meantime, start forming the sopes by pushing into the center of each patty to create a small shallow bowl or \\sope. Fry the sopes for a second time until golden brown. Set aside. For the clam salsa: Bring a small pot of water to a boil and add the tomatoes, onion and jalapeno. After 10 to 15 seconds, pull out the tomato and peel the skin. Place in a blender. Continue to boil the onion and jalapeno for 10 more minutes. Remove from the pot and add to the blender. Add the clams to the water and cover. Cook over high heat until the clams open, about 5 minutes. In the meantime, add the cilantro, garlic and salt to the blender and pulse 1 to 2 minutes. Pour into a bowl and set aside. Once the clams have cooked, remove the meat from the shells and add to the salsa. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. For the huevos rancheros: In a saute pan over medium heat, add the olive oil and eggs. Just as the eggs start coming together, add the tomatoes, cilantro and beans. Scramble until soft. Season with salt and pepper. To build the sopes: On each sope, place a spoonful of the eggs, top with salsa and include 3 to 4 clams. Top with some cojita cheese and a drizzle of hot sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 51838,&quot;Roasted Edamame Salad 12 ounces fresh or frozen shelled edamame, about 2 cups 1/2 cup fresh corn kernels, about 2 ears of corn 1/4 cup finely diced scallion 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon olive oil 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup chopped fresh tomato 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the pork and garlic to the pan and cook until the flavor permeates and the pork browns. Then turn the heat to medium-high, add the cabbage and carrots, and stir-fry until the vegetables soften. Next, add the noodles, soy sauce, onions, sugar, ginger and pepper, and continue to stir-fry until all of the ingredients are mixed and the entire dish is coated with soy sauce. You will know when it is done is when the whole dish is steaming hot, light brown and the noodles are transparent with a shiny glaze. To assemble, use cooking tongs to hold and twist the stir-fry and transfer on to a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 51840,&quot;Pescabrat 1 pound skinless salmon, cod or other firm flaky fish 8 ounces sea scallops 1 tablespoon dried tarragon 1 teaspoon mustard powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3 egg whites Oil, for brushing grill 6 potato buns Malt vinegar, mustard or mayonnaise, for serving Instructions: Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Roast the salmon on a baking sheet until just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Let cool, and then break apart with a fork.<br> Combine the scallops, tarragon, mustard, salt and egg whites in a food processor and pulse until smooth. Mix the scallop mixture with the cooled salmon.<br> Divide the fish mixture into 6 equal portions, about 1/3 cup each. Unroll a 10- to 12-inch-long piece of plastic wrap and place 1 portion of the mixture in the center. Use the plastic wrap to make a casing by folding the plastic wrap over itself and rolling the mixture into a sausage shape.<br> Twist the ends until the package is tight, and then tie knots or use small zip ties to secure both ends. Repeat with the remaining mixture.<br> Bring 4 inches water to a boil in a large pot. Preheat a grill to high heat.<br> Carefully drop the pescabrats into the boiling water. Let the water return to a boil, and then boil for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the sausages and let cool completely before unwrapping. I like to put them in the freezer for 30 to 40 minutes before grilling, but as long as they are cool, you can grill away. The brats are edible at this point, but the grill will add some scorchy flavors.<br> Brush the grill grates with oil. Grill the sausages just until they get grill marks and are warm, 5 to 6 minutes.<br> Serve on the potato buns with malt vinegar, mustard, or mayo. Not ketchup. That&#39;s the only rule. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51841,&quot;Herb Smoked Pacific Salmon with Shaved Fennel and Dill Salad 2 tablespoons Kosher salt 1/4 cup sugar 2 teaspoons coriander seeds 2 teaspoons fennel seeds 15 whole black peppercorns 3 bay leaves 1 1/2 cups dry white wine 8 (5 ounce) salmon fillets, cut thickly and uniformly 1/3 cup snipped fresh dill Olive oil, for grilling 2 medium fresh fennel bulbs, shaved paper thin 1 medium cucumber peeled, cut in half, seeded and cut into long thin strips 1 fresh endive separated into individual leaves Walnut-Dill Vinaigrette (recipe follows) Instructions: This is a simple dish to prepare but timing is crucial. The cure can be made in quantity and stored refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. It is imperative that the salmon not stay in the cure for longer than 30 minutes before grilling or the surface will become dry and tough. It can cure for as short a time as 15 minutes. In volume situations, the salmon can be undercooked slightly and flashed in a hot oven to just heat through just before serving. The fennel needs to be shaved paper thin and ideally done just before serving. Do not store shaved fennel in ice water unless absolutely necessary - - it loses its fresh, aromatic flavor. Once shaved it can be held covered and refrigerated for up to 3 hours without browning. Garnish: Daikon or Sunflower sprouts, rinsed fresh salmon roe and basil oil In a saucepan over high heat, combine the salt, sugar, coriander and fennel seeds, peppercorns and bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the dill and let cool completely. Place the salmon fillets in a baking dish large enough to hold them in a single layer. Pour on the cooled wine mixture and let the salmon \\cure\\ for 30 minutes only, turning once. Meanwhile prepare a charcoal fire along with some soaked hardwood chips or shavings. Lightly oil the grill. Remove the salmon from the \\cure\\ and drain off any excess liquid. It is fine if spices or dill adhere to the salmon. Lightly brush the salmon with some olive oil. Place hardwood chips on coals, cover and smoke/cook the salmon over medium coals for 5 to 6 minutes or until just done. Be careful not to overcook the salmon or it will become dry and lose its wonderful texture. It should still be translucent in the center. To serve: Toss the fennel and the cucumber together and dress to taste with Walnut-Dill Vinaigrette. Arrange attractively on top of the endive leaves on chilled plates. Place salmon on top and garnish with the sprouts, salmon roe and drizzles of the basil oil around the plate. Salmon can be served warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 51842,&quot;Grilled Sweet Potato Salad 2 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes 1/4 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon salt 1 small jalapeno pepper, diced fine 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 scallion 2 teaspoons fresh lime juice lime wedges 1/4 cup fresh coriander leaves Instructions: In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch and simmer, covered, until just tender, about 15 to 30 minutes, depending on size of potatoes. In a colander drain potatoes and cool to warm. With a sharp knife peel potatoes and cut cross-wise into 1/2 inch-thick slices.<br> While potatoes are boiling, prepare grill. In a small bowl whisk together oil, salt, jalapeno pepper and cumin and brush some onto both sides of potato slices, reserving remaining cumin oil. Grill slices on an oiled rack set 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side, and transfer with tongs to a platter.<br> Thinly slice scallion diagonally and sprinkle over potatoes.

Using tongs or a slotted spoon lift from the water and set aside to cool. When cool, chop coarsely. Bring the water back to a boil and cook the sausage for about 15 minutes, until cooked through. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the sausage from the water and immediately plunge in cold water to stop the cooking. When cool, remove the meat from the casing and crumble. (You should have 6 cups of sausage.) In a large saute pan, over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil and cook the garlic for about 30 seconds, until browned. Add the broccoli rabe and red pepper flakes to the pan and season to taste with salt. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes, until very tender. In a bowl, mix together the Romano and fontina cheeses. Spread about 3/4 cup of the Romano-fontina mixture over each Pizza Crust, top each with equal amounts of broccoli rabe and sausage and then slide them back to the edge of the hot section of the grill. Rotate them for every 3 to 4 minutes until the bottoms are evenly golden brown. Cut the pizzas and serve. Mix the water, yeast, and molasses in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let this stand for 12 minutes to activate the yeast (the water will foam slightly.) Add the salt and oil to the bowl and mix well. With mixer on low speed add the all-purpose flour and the whole wheat flour to the bowl and mix until all the flour is absorbed and the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. Remove the dough from the bowl and cut the dough into 6 (5 1/2 ounce) portions. Roll the portioned dough into balls and place on an oiled baking pan. Brush the ball lightly with olive oil and cover with plastic wrap. If you are going to use the dough right away let the dough sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before using. You can store the dough after portioning for 1 day in the refrigerator, but you must let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before using. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 51844,&quot;Basil Pesto 2 cups loosely packed basil leaves, washed and dried thoroughly 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper to taste Instructions: In a food processor, combine the basil, pine nuts, Parmesan, garlic, and salt and puree.

Hold one half of the orange over a mixing bowl and use a spoon to scoop the flesh into the bowl, catching the juices and avoiding breaking through the peel. Repeat the process with the other half of the orange. Use kitchen shears to cut the pulp into smaller pieces. Add the almond butter, oats, dried cranberries, pepitas and 1/4 cup sunflower seeds to the bowl with the orange. Use a rubber spatula to mix until evenly combined. Set aside. Use a wooden skewer to pierce a hole through an orange peel about 1/2 inch below the cut. Continue to thread the skewer through the orange to reach the other side. Pierce through the orange, creating 2 holes directly across from each other. Remove the skewer and repeat the same process crosswise on the orange, so that you now have 4 holes. Repeat the same process with the other orange half. Take one piece of kitchen twine and use the skewer to help the ends of the twine through two of the mirroring holes. Tie a knot at either end of the twine to secure it to the inside of the orange. Repeat the process with the remaining twine. Use one of the wooden skewers to poke from one side of the orange to another, creating a perch. Repeat the process with the remaining skewer, creating an X. Repeat with the second orange half. Fill the oranges with the almond butter mixture. Top with the remaining 1/4 cup sunflower seeds. Hang the bird feeders outside on a sturdy branch. Any leftover almond butter mixture can be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days to refill the feeders.

Add the pepperoncini with their liquid and the beef broth. Cover and cook on low until the meat is very tender and easy to pull apart, 7 to 8 hours. For the caramelized onions: When the slow cooker has about 15 minutes left, heat the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the roast to a bowl and shred using 2 forks, then return it to the slow cooker to keep warm. For the sandwich assembly: Preheat the broiler. Put the rolls on a baking sheet and spread each with a tablespoon of butter. Broil until toasted, about 2 minutes. Heap a generous portion of meat on each roll, then spoon some of the cooking liquid over the meat. Top with a few pepperoncini from the slow cooker and plenty of caramelized onions. Put 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich and return to the broiler just to melt the cheese, about 1 more minute. Serve with potato chips and extra cooking liquid on the side for dipping.

Cook until golden brown, approximately 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the pan to a plate and set aside. After removing sausage add a 1/4 cup of canola oil to the pan and stir in 1/2 cup of flour. Stir to create a roux, and cook for approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Slowly add the chicken stock, stirring while you pour and let simmer, stirring frequently, until it thickens, approximately 6 to 8 minutes. In a separate saucepan heat 2 cups of canola oil on medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F. In a large bowl combine the stuffing, parsley, thyme, and scallions and mix together. Take quarter-sized or 1 tablespoon of stuffing mix and wrap it around the individual sausage balls. Cover the sausage completely and set aside Once all of the sausage balls have been coated in stuffing, dredge them in the remaining 1/2 cup of flour. When all the balls are lightly coated in flour, carefully drop them into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove them from the oil, to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Once all of the balls have been fried and drained turn off the heat to the gravy and add the fried sausage stuffing balls.

Use the pan to trace a heart onto a piece of parchment. Cut out the heart and line the bottom of the pan with it. Prepare one of the cake mixes according to the package instructions. Pour the cake batter into the prepared cake pan and bake according to the package instructions for a 9-by-13-inch pan or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool, then remove from the pan. Line two 12-cup (or one 24-cup) mini cupcake tins with brown or black mini cupcake liners. Prepare the second cake mix according to the package instruction. Add about 1 tablespoon of batter to each cupcake liner. Bake until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 5 to 8 minutes. Let cool, then remove the cupcakes from the tins. Use any leftover batter to make more cupcakes. Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler. Set aside. Using a serrated knife, slice off the domed top of the heart cake to create a flat even surface. You want the final height of the cake to be about 1 inch. Save any cake scraps to make cake pops. Place a 16-inch round cake board on top of the cake and flip upside down so the parchment paper is on top. Carefully remove the parchment paper and discard. Cut some strips of parchment paper and slide them under the cake a little bit to cover the cake board; this will help keep the cake board clean when you frost the cakes. Set the cake aside. Carefully dip the top of 16 mini cupcakes into the Chocolate Ganache to cover each cupcake to the paper liner. Carefully dip the tops of the remaining 8 mini cupcakes into the melted white chocolate. Let set for about 5 minutes. For the 16 ganache-coated cupcakes: Top 3 with 3 chocolate-covered espresso beans and 3 with white chocolate shavings; drizzle 3 with melted white chocolate; dip 4 in the cocoa powder and top 3 with red heart sprinkles. For the 8 white chocolate-topped cupcakes: Top 4 with pink heart sprinkles and 4 with a pinch of chopped pistachios. Feel free to mix it up and do any combination of these decorations. Frost the entire cake with the red frosting. Remove the parchment paper strips and discard. Cut the icing sheet into 1 1/2-inch-wide strips to go around the heart cake; the strips should come up about 1/2 inch above the surface of the cake. You will need 4 strips to make it around the entire heart cake; the fourth strip will need to be shorter, so cut it to fit cleanly between the end of the first and third strips. Carefully press the icing strips around the cake to form the rim of the box. Arrange the cupcake \\candies\\ inside the box on top of the cake.<br> In a small pot, bring the cream to a simmer. Put the chocolate chips in a small bowl. Pour over the hot cream and let stand for 2 minutes. Wish until blended and smooth. Whisk in the corn syrup. Let stand before using until the consistency is similar to pancake batter. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 51862,&quot;Aloo Pies 2 pounds all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1 tablespoon shortening (recommend: Crisco) 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 2 pounds Idaho russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 1/2 bunch freshly chopped cilantro leaves 1 small habanero pepper, seeded and chopped 1 teaspoon ground cumin salt, or to taste Instructions: For the dough: Mix all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl until incorporated.

Serve with room temperature butter and jam if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51875,&quot;Orange Glazed Chicken Wings 12 whole chicken wings 1 (6-ounce) can frozen orange juice concentrate 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce 2 teaspoons honey 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes Instructions: Place a 6-quart saucepan with a steamer basket and 1 inch of water in the bottom, over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Remove the tips of the wings and discard or save for making stock. Using kitchen shears, or a knife, separate the wings at the joint. Place the wings into the steamer basket, cover, reduce the heat to medium and steam for 10 minutes. Remove the wings from the basket and carefully pat dry. Lay the wings out on a cooling rack set in a half sheet pan lined with paper towels and place in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Replace the paper towels with parchment paper. Roast on the middle rack of the oven for 20 minutes. Turn the wings over and cook another 20 minutes or until meat is cooked through and the skin is golden brown. During the last 20 minutes of cooking the chicken, place the orange juice concentrate, hoisin sauce, honey, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and red pepper flakes into a small saucepan, stir to combine and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the mixture to about 1/2 cup, approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool at least 5 minutes. Remove the wings from the oven and transfer to a large mixing bowl along with the glaze and toss to coat. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51876,&quot;I.C. Fennel Cordial 1 quart vodka 2 cups fennel fronds, loosely packed<br> 85 grams granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon cardamom seeds<br> 10 green cardamom pods<br> 1 whole star anise<br> Instructions: Install an immersion circulator in a water bath and set it to 140 degrees F. Place the vodka, fennel fronds, sugar, fennel seeds, cardamom seeds, green cardamom pods and star anise in a one-gallon zip-top freezer bag (see Cook&#39;s Note). Remove as much of the air from the bag as possible then seal and submerge the bag in the bath for 1 hour (see Cook&#39;s Note). Transfer the unopened bag to an ice water bath. Once cool, strain the mixture through a coffee filter set inside a sieve and discard the solids. Don&#39;t squeeze or press the solids to extract additional liquid: It will cloud the liqueur and release off flavors. Chill before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 51877,&quot;Pine Nut Tart 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the surface 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cubed and chilled<br> 1 large egg yolk<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 2 tablespoons ice water 1/3 cup honey 1/4 cup light brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed and chilled<br> 1/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1 large egg yolk<br> Zest and juice of 1 lemon<br> 1 1/2 cups pine nuts<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar, for serving<br> Instructions: For the tart crust: Add the flour, granulated sugar and salt to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until combined. Add the butter and pulse until small pebbles form. With the machine running, add the egg yolk, vanilla and water and pulse until the dough just comes together. Remove to a piece of plastic wrap and press together into a dough ball. Flatten into a disk then refrigerate, at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the honey and pine nut filling: Add the honey, brown sugar and salt to a medium saucepan over medium heat and whisk to combine. Cook, whisking occasionally, until the sugar melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the butter and whisk until melted. Pour the mixture into a large bowl and allow to cool for 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to a 13-inch circle and place in an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Chill 30 more minutes. Prick the bottom of the tart with a fork. Place a piece of parchment in the center of the tart and fill all the way to the top with dried beans. Bake until the crust is set but still slightly pale, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool, then remove the parchment and beans.<br> Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F.<br> Meanwhile, whisk the heavy cream, egg yolk, lemon zest and juice into the cooled filling. Place the cooled tart shell on a rimmed baking sheet and scatter the pine nuts inside the shell. Evenly pour the filling into the tart crust and bake until the top is golden brown, the filling is set and the very center still has a slight jiggle, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool completely before slicing, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Serve dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51878,&quot;Gingery Watermelon Petit Fours 1 cup sliced fresh ginger, from one 4-inch piece 4 tablespoons honey Zest of 1 lime plus 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 small seedless watermelon 2 ounces room-temperature cream cheese Instructions: Combine the ginger, 3 tablespoons of the honey and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat. Let sit until cooled to room temperature. Strain, discarding the ginger. Stir in the lime juice. Meanwhile, cut the watermelon crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices. Cut off the skin, leaving each slice a square or rectangle. Cut each slice again until you have twenty-four 1-inch cubes. (You will have watermelon left over.) Put the cubes in an 8 by 8-inch baking pan. Pour the cooled syrup over the watermelon and let sit, refrigerated, 1 to 4 hours, turning the cubes halfway through. Just before serving, mix the cream cheese and the remaining 1 tablespoon honey in a small bowl until smooth. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag. Push the mixture towards one corner of the bag and twist the top to make a handle. Use scissors to snip a small hole at the corner. Remove the watermelon from the liquid and transfer the cubes to a serving tray. Pipe a small dollop of the cream cheese mixture onto the top of each cube. Sprinkle the lime zest over the tops of the cubes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 51879,&quot;Bistro Steamed Clams with Roasted Shallots and Saffron 3 pounds fresh clams, rinsed 1/2 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup mirin wine 1/3 cup ouzo 1 lemon, zested 1/2 lemon, juiced 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads 6 shallots, roasted and coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 4 tablespoons unsalted butter Salt Freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: In a large stock pot over high heat, combine clams, wine, mirin, ouzo, lemon zest and juice, saffron, roasted shallots, and garlic.

In a shallow dish, spread the toasted coconut. Place one 1/2-cup scoop of ice cream in the center of 6 cookies. Press down on the ice cream with the scoop to push the ice cream out to the cookies&#39; edges. Top with the remaining cookies, pressing together to form sandwiches. With a butter knife, smooth the ice cream around the edges. Roll the sandwiches in the toasted coconut and place on a baking sheet. Freeze until just firm, about 10 minutes before serving. (Or, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and keep frozen until ready to serve.) In the top of double boiler set over medium high heat, melt the chocolate. Remove from the heat. In a medium saucepan, bring the cream to a gentle boil. Remove from the heat. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until slightly thickened. Whisk 1/2 cup of the hot cream into the egg mixture. Whisk in the coffee powder. In a slow, steady stream, gradually add the egg mixture to the pan of hot cream. Cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and strain the mixture into a clean bowl through a fine mesh strainer, pressing against the strainer with the back of a spoon. Add the melted chocolate and vanilla. Pour into a container and cover with waxed paper or plastic wrap, pressing down against the surface to keep a skin from forming. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. When cold, pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine. Churn and freeze according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. When the ice cream has come together, transfer to an airtight container and place in the freezer until ready to serve. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet and set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Add the egg, almond extract, and vanilla and mix well. Onto a sheet of waxed paper or into a bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture and mix well. Fold in the chocolate and nuts. With a 1/4-cup scoop, portion out the dough onto the baking sheet, leaving 2-inches between each piece. Bake until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still slightly soft, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. With a spatula, transfer cookies to a wire rack and let cool before assembling the ice cream sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51881,&quot;Buffalo Chicken Bagel Spread 2 cups shredded cooked chicken breasts (from about 2 breasts) One 8-ounce block cream cheese<br> 1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese<br> 1/4 cup hot sauce (I like Frank&#39;s)<br> 1/4 cup Greek yogurt<br> 3 tablespoons minced fresh chives<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Put the chicken, cream cheese, blue cheese, hot sauce, yogurt, chives, salt and pepper in a bowl and use an electric mixer to blend until creamy.

Put the kabocha squash on the rack and follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid. Set to pressure cook on high for 3 minutes. Follow the guide again for releasing pressure, then carefully remove the lid. Remove the squash from the pressure cooker and set aside until ready to use. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the mushrooms and saute until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside until ready to use. Set the same large skillet over medium-low heat. Carefully scoop the coconut cream (the thick, almost solid white stuff) out of the can of coconut milk into the skillet. Set aside the remaining liquid in the can. Cook the coconut cream until it resembles yogurt and is sizzling around the edges, about 5 minutes. Add the curry paste, ginger and garlic. Turn the heat up to medium. Saute until the paste has deepened in color and the oil starts to separate from the paste, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, sugar, remaining canned coconut liquid and 1 teaspoon fish sauce. Taste; add more fish sauce if it&#39;s not salty enough. Stir well and bring to a boil. Add the squash, mushrooms and green beans. Stir well and turn the heat to low. Simmer until the green beans are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Finish with the lime zest, a squeeze of the lime wedge and the basil. Serve over rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51884,&quot;Creme Caramel 1/2 pound granulated sugar 2 cups milk 1/2 lemon, zested 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 drops yellow food coloring 4 eggs Instructions: In a large heavy saucepan, combine all but 1/2 cup of the sugar with 2 cups of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, without stirring, until thick and amber in color. When caramelized, remove from the heat and divide among 6 individual crme caramel cups or ramekins.

Place a layer of plastic wrap over the pie plate and press smoothly to stick. Scatter the smaller waffle pieces to cover the bottom of the pie plate and place the larger shards against the sides in an uneven mosaic-like pattern. Be artistic; pointy pieces of waffle cone will create a more dynamic border. Put the chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave in 30-second increments, stirring in between each round, until the chocolate is melted. Drizzle the chocolate over the crust in a decorative pattern. Chill until set, about 10 minutes. Spread the softened ice cream over the chocolate layer, smoothing the top. Wrap with plastic and place in the freezer until set, at least 2 hours. Drop the dulce de leche in small blobs around the top of the pie; this will make it easier to spread. Spread as evenly as you can to the edges of the crust. (Don&#39;t worry if there are small gaps.) Return the pie to the freezer to let the dulce de leche set, about 30 minutes. Bring the pie to room temperature for about 10 minutes before eating. Sprinkle the toasted peanuts over the top of the pie and slice with a warmed knife. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Malbec]</p><p>&quot; 51888,&quot;Anko 1 cup dried azuki beans 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons raw cane sugar, such as Sugar in the Raw 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as vegetable oil Kosher salt Instructions: Place the beans in a medium bowl and add enough cold water to cover by about 2 inches. Cover and refrigerate until the beans have swelled, about 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Drain the beans and transfer to a 5-quart Dutch oven or medium saucepan.

Fill the pot with another 4 cups cold water, cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.<br> Remove the lid, reduce the heat to low and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very soft, about 45 minutes. Add warm water as needed to keep the beans covered.<br> Drain the beans, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid. Clean the pot and set aside. Transfer the beans to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until most of them are broken down, about 10 to 15 pulses. If the beans aren\\u2019t moving much in the food processor, add some of the reserved cooking liquid.<br> Return the beans to the cleaned pot and add the sugar, oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the paste is thick enough for you to see the bottom of the pot when you run a spatula across it, 10 to 20 minutes. Transfer the paste to a baking sheet or wide shallow bowl, spread it out evenly and let cool completely. It will thicken as it cools. The cooled bean paste can be used immediately or stored in airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week or in a resealable plastic freezer bag in the freezer for up to 3 months.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51889,&quot;Santa&#39;s Hat Crispy-Cheesecake Squares : Food Network Cooking spray 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 5 ounces mini marshmallows (about 1 cup tightly packed)<br> 2 teaspoons honey 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Kosher salt 4 cups crispy rice cereal One 1/4-ounce package unflavored powdered gelatin Two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup sour cream 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 25 medium strawberries, hulled 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Line a 9-inch square pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides. Lightly coat the foil and a wooden spoon with cooking spray. For the cheesecake squares: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Add the sour cream, 1/4 cup of the broth, butter, salt and pepper, and beat on low speed with a hand mixer until the potatoes are light and fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. If the mixture is too dry, add the remaining 1/4 cup broth. Do not overmix. Cover and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 10-inch round baking dish with nonstick spray. Prepare filling: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally until browned and almost crisp, about 7 to 8 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a plate; set aside. Add the oil to the drippings in the skillet and put over medium heat. Add the onions and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are very soft and just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle in the sugar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to caramelize, about 3 minutes. Stir in the beef and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat, until the beef begins to brown, about 7 minutes. Add the carrots, peas, and garlic and cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and flour and cook, stirring, until well blended, about 2 minutes. Add the beer, bring to a boil and boil for 3 minutes.

Slice off the 4 long sides of each of the sweet potatoes so the potatoes are squared off and sit flat on a cutting board. Slice the potatoes lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick planks, about 5-inches-by-2-inches (you should get 3 planks per sweet potato). Combine the sweet potatoes and melted butter in a medium bowl and toss gently to coat. Spread them out on a baking sheet and roast, flipping halfway through, until lightly browned and tender when pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes. Remove the sweet potato toasts to 2 plates.<br> Meanwhile, combine the cider, maple syrup, cinnamon, apples and remaining tablespoon butter in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then cover and cook until the apples are soft, about 20 minutes. Uncover, mash with a potato masher or the back of a fork and continue to cook until most of the liquid has evaporated and it has the consistency of chunky applesauce, about 5 minutes. Stir in the figs and let cool slightly. Divide the applesauce among the toasts and sprinkle with the granola.

Heat the sugar over medium heat, stirring with a fork until it begins to melt. Once it is melted, stop stirring. Cook the sauce, giving the skillet a swirl every now and again, so the sugar melts evenly. Cook until it is dark amber in color, and then remove from the heat. Keep an eye on the sugar because it can go from dark amber to burnt in a blink. Put an oven mitt on the hand you will be using to stir in the ingredients and stand back to avoid splattering. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the butter, 2 tablespoons water, the bourbon, vinegar and salt and cook over low heat, stirring to incorporate all the ingredients and scraping up all the caramel from the bottom of the pan. Add the cream, bring to a boil and allow to cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring, and then remove from heat. Allow to cool slightly. For the beignets: Set the oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Heat the oil in a medium heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl, beat the egg with a fork, stir in the sparkling cider and 1 tablespoon oil until nice and foamy. Cook&#39;s Note: Make sure you use a sparkling cider-it makes the batter lighter and fluffier. In a large, shallow bowl, stir together the 1 1/4 cups flour and cinnamon if using. Make a well in the center of the flour (similar to the way you would if you were making pasta). Pour the cider mixture into the center of the well. Stir in a circular motion, with the fork slowly dragging in and incorporating the flour. Stir until a lumpy batter forms. Put the remaining 1/2 cup flour in a plate or pan. Working in batches of 3, dredge the apple rings in the flour, shaking off the excess, and then dip in the batter to coat, letting the excess drip off. Carefully slip the rings into the hot oil and fry, gently turning over once with a slotted spoon, until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes total per batch. Lay the beignets on a paper towel-lined plate to drain the excess oil. Transfer to a cookie sheet and keep warm in the oven. Return the oil to 375 degrees F between batches. Just before serving, dust the warm beignets with confectioners&#39; sugar. Make sure the butter bourbon dipping sauce is warm, then drizzle over the top and serve more on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51893,&quot;Pear Cranberry Pie 6 ounces unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 ounces vegetable shortening, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 5 to 7 tablespoons cranberry juice 12 ounces all-purpose flour, about 2 3/4 cups, plus extra for dusting 1 teaspoon table salt 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 3 to 3 1/2-pounds pears, a mixture of Bartlett, Bosc and/or Anjou 1/2 cup sugar, divided 6 ounces dried cranberries 3 tablespoons tapioca flour 2 tablespoons cranberry jam 1 tablespoon cranberry juice 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg Instructions: For the crust Place the butter, shortening and cranberry juice into the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Add the shortening and pulse another 3 to 4 times until incorporated. Remove the lid of the food processor and sprinkle in 5 tablespoons of the cranberry juice. Replace the lid and pulse 5 times. Add more cranberry juice as needed, and pulse again until the mixture holds together when squeezed. Weight the dough and divide in half. Shape each half into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Peel and core the pears. Slice into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick wedges. Toss all of the pears with 1/4 cup of the sugar, place in a colander set over a large bowl and allow to drain for 1 1/2 hours. Transfer the drained liquid to a small saucepan, place over medium heat and reduce to 2 tablespoons. Set aside to cool. Toss the pears with the remaining sugar, cranberries, tapioca flour, jam, cranberry juice, lemon juice, salt and nutmeg. For assembling and baking the pie: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove 1 disk of dough from the refrigerator. Place the dough onto a lightly floured piece of waxed paper. Lightly sprinkle the top of the dough with flour and roll out into a 12-inch circle. Place into a 9 1/2 to 10-inch tart pan that is 2 inches deep. Gently press the dough into the sides of the pan, crimping and trimming the edges as necessary. Set a pie bird in the center of the bottom of the pan. Place the pears into the unbaked pie shell in concentric circles starting around the edges, working towards the center and forming a slight mound in the center of the pie. Sprinkle the cranberries a little at a time as you go. Pour over any liquid that remains in the bowl. Roll out the second pie dough as the first. Place this dough over the apples, pressing the pie bird through the top crust. Press together the edges of the dough around the rim of the pie. Brush the top crust with the reduced juice everywhere except around the edge of the pie. Trim excess dough. Place the pie on a half sheet pan lined with parchment paper and bake on the floor of the oven for 30 minutes. Transfer to the lower rack of the oven and continue to bake another 20 minutes or until the pears are cooked through but not mushy. Remove to a rack and cool a minimum of 4 hours or until almost room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51894,&quot;Lentil and Tempeh Sloppy Joes 1/2 cup lentils 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 yellow onion, diced (about 2 cups) 1 green bell pepper, diced (about 2 cups) 3 garlic cloves, minced 8 ounces tempeh, crumbled 1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies 1 tablespoon chili powder 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup organic ketchup 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar 1/2 teaspoon celery seed 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 8 hamburger buns, for serving Sliced avocado Pickles Instructions: Place lentils in a medium saucepan and cover with water.

Arrange vegetables on a second platter.<br> Fill a hot pot or nabe pot 2/3 full of dashi set on a burner on the table. Each diner picks up a piece of meat from the serving platter and swishes it around in the simmering broth until the red meat becomes pink, or cooked to the degree desired. Diners may alternate between meat and vegetables. The tofu breaks easily, so be careful when adding it to the pot. Diners eat from the pot, dipping the food into the dipping sauces which are placed in individual cups at each person&#39;s place. Combine the water and kelp in a large pot. Bring the water to a boil, removing the kelp just before water boils since it emits a strong odor. If the fleshiest part of the kelp is still tough, return it to the water for a few more minutes, along with a little cold water. (Soft kelp means sufficient flavor has been extracted.) Remove the kelp and bring stock to a full boil.<br> Add 1/4 cup cold water to bring the temperature down quickly and add the bonito flakes. Bring to a boil, and then immediately remove from the heat. (If bonito flakes boil too long, the stock becomes bitter.) Allow the flakes to settle to the bottom of the pan, then filter the stock through cheesecloth. Yield: About 2 quarts Combine the dashi, soy sauce, and mirin in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Let boil for a few minutes to reduce by 1/3, then remove from heat and cool. Stir in vinegar to taste. Pour sauce into individual cups. Toast the sesame seeds in a heavy pan until lightly browned. Transfer warm seeds to a mortar and grind to a paste, or whirl in a blender. Add the dashi, soy sauce, mirin, sugar and sake, and mix well, using a spatula to blend and smooth the sauce. Add cayenne to taste. Pour sauce into individual cups. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 51896,&quot;Stuffed Cha-Cha Crab Chilies 12 tomatillos, husked and rinsed 1 small onion, quartered and peeled 6 medium cloves garlic, peeled 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon chipotle hot sauce 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 6 large poblanos 4 ounces smooth, mild goat cheese 3/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese 12 ounces cooked crabmeat, picked through for shells and cartilage Instructions: Preheat broiler.

Ready to serve! &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barolo]&quot; 51904,&quot;Mole Verde 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 large white onion, sliced into 1/8-inch julienne 1 large russet potato, peeled and cut to 1/2-inch dice, reserved in water 3 sage leaves, whole 2 bay leaves 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 2 quarts water 2 Anaheim peppers, stems and seeds removed and rough chopped to 1/2-inch pieces 1 large head broccoli, broken into small florets and cores sliced thin 1 cup parsley, stems and leaves, rough chopped 1 cup sunflower seeds (plain, not salted or roasted) Instructions: First things first, get all of those vegetables chopped and your other ingredients ready to go before you begin! The timing of adding each ingredient is important so you don&#39;t want to burn your onions while you&#39;re trying to chop the broccoli, okay?! Okay, grab an 8-quart pot, add the tablespoon of oil and set on a medium-high burner. Once the oil is hot but not smoking add the onions and potatoes. You want to cook the onions til they just start getting a bit of color. Keep stirring them with a wooden spoon. Bonus points if you have a flat bottom wooden spoon! When the onions are ready, add the sage leaves, bay leaves, garlic, salt and pepper. Stir all that up real good and saute until you can really smell the sage and garlic, 1 to 2 minutes. Now add the water, scrape the bottom of the pot with your spoon to get up all those good bits and bring this up to a boil. Let this boil until your potatoes are soft, about 5 minutes. While you wait for the potatoes to get soft you want to set up your blender and a fine mesh strainer over another pot, bowl or container that you&#39;ll strain the sauce into. When the potatoes are soft, you&#39;ll add the Anaheim peppers and broccoli to the pot and stir to combine. Cook until the broccoli stems are just soft, aka al dente. This is a key step so don&#39;t get distracted! Put your phone in another room and focus on the vegetables! You want your sauce to be bright green so pay attention. As soon as the broccoli is ready, kill the heat on the pot and add the parsley and sunflower seeds and give it a good stir. Immediately take your pot to where you&#39;re going to blend the sauce. Blend the mole in two or three batches, depending on the size of your blender. Remember that your mole is piping hot so make sure to start your blender on low and increase the speed slowly, unless you want mole on your ceiling. As you increase the speed, reserve enough of the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil for each successive batch add the oil to the blender. Let the mole blend on high for about a minute until it&#39;s really well blended. As you work each batch you may want to adjust the amount of liquid in the blender. If it seems too thin, then don&#39;t add as much of the cooking liquid on the next batch and vice versa. Think rich, silky potato soup you could scoop up with a tortilla. Strain each batch through your strainer. You can use a ladle to help push the mole through the strainer and speed things up a bit. After you have blended up and strained all the mole, whisk it together so the final sauce is consistent throughout. At this point the mole is ready to serve. If you&#39;re making ahead of time, try and get the mole into an airtight container and cooling in the fridge as quickly as possible to keep that bright green color. You can also freeze the mole for that dinner party you&#39;re having in a month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 51905,&quot;Bulgogi (Barbecued Beef) 2 pounds sirloin, sliced across the grain on the diagonal bias 3 cloves garlic, minced 3 scallions, chopped 1 onion, chopped 1/3 cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons sesame oil 2 teaspoons honey Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon kochujang (Korean red pepper paste) 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 1 head green leaf lettuce Instructions: With the back of a knife, pound each slice of beef lightly to tenderize it.

Fill shaker with crushed ice, close, and shake until shaker is frosted and mixture is foamy, about 20 seconds. Strain into a martini glass, top with a dollop of Coffee Whipped Cream, and serve. Place very clean glass or metal bowl and metal whisk in freezer just until cold, about 5 minutes. When everything is cold, place cream in bowl and begin to whisk until it froths up and starts to thicken, about 1 minute.

Pulse the flour, 1/3 of the butter, Parmesan, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a food processor until the mixture looks like fine meal. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the mixture is in pea-size pieces. Add the egg and pulse until the dough begins to come together. Divide the dough in half; place each half on a sheet of plastic wrap and pat into a disk. Wrap the disks tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour up to overnight, or freeze for up to 2 months. For the filling: Meanwhile, add the oil to a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery and thyme and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, stirring, until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add the broth, peas and carrots and sour cream. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, about 3 minutes. Stir in the chicken and parsley and add salt and pepper to taste. Allow the mixture to cool completely. (The filling can be made a day ahead.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment. Roll 1 disk of dough between two sheets of parchment to about 1/8-inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cookie cutter, cut into nine rounds. Gather the scraps, reroll and cut out 3 more rounds. Cover the rounds with a clean, damp towel to prevent the dough from drying out. Repeat with the remaining disk of dough, for a total of 24 rounds. (If the dough gets too warm while you&#39;re working with it, chill it until it&#39;s easier to work with.) Place 1 round of dough on a clean, lightly-floured work surface and roll out to about 4 1/2 inches. Place 1/3 cup of filling in the center and brush the edges with beaten egg. Roll another round of dough out to 4 1/2 inches and drape over the filling; seal the edges and crimp with a fork. Brush the entire pot pie with more egg, cut a few slits in the top, sprinkle with some pepper and place on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Bake the pot pies until they&#39;re golden brown and the filling begins to bubble, 20 to 24 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving. Alternatively, freeze the unbaked pot pies for up to 1 month, then bake, from frozen, in the oven, preheated to 375 degrees F, until they&#39;re golden brown and the filling begins to bubble, 20 to 24 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 51913,&quot;Blackberry-Maple Cobbler Unsalted butter, for the baking dish 6 cups blackberries 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup pure maple syrup 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 to 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour For the topping: 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 large egg 1/2 cup buttermilk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and butter a 2-quart baking dish.

Make the topping: Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Using your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it looks like fine meal; set aside. Whisk the egg, buttermilk and vanilla in a small bowl; stir into the flour mixture until just incorporated. Drop heaping spoonfuls of the batter evenly over the berries and sprinkle with sugar. Set the dish on a baking sheet and bake until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 40 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51914,&quot;Osso Buco with Gremolata 3 tablespoons EVOO 4 to 6 veal shanks, tied with kitchen string Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 to 5 cloves garlic, sliced 2 to 3 small ribs celery and leafy tops, chopped 1 large carrot, chopped 1 onion, chopped 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme 2 tablespoons tomato paste 2 large fresh bay leaves 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup dry white wine 2 cups chicken stock 1 healthy pinch saffron threads One 15-ounce can diced tomatoes in juice Zest and juice of 1 orange, with 1 strip unzested, peel reserved 1 fresh red Fresno cl, halved and seeded or 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes Crusty bread, for serving Zest of 1 lemon 1/4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves 1/4 cup toasted pistachio nuts, processed into crumbs Instructions: For the osso buco: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat the EVOO in a large Dutch oven over medium-high to high heat. Sprinkle the shanks with salt and pepper and brown all over, turning occasionally, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Stir the garlic, celery, carrots, onions and fennel seeds into the pot, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rosemary, thyme, tomato paste and bay leaves, sprinkle with salt and pepper and stir 1 minute. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir 1 minute, then pour in the wine and deglaze the pot, scraping and stirring 1 minute longer. Add the chicken stock and saffron, followed by the tomatoes. Add the orange peel, juice and cl. Scrape down the pot and add the meat back into the pot. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook, turning the meat once about halfway through, 2 hours. For the gremolata: When the meat is about ready to come out of the oven, combine the orange zest on aboard with the lemon zest. Finely chop the parsley and combine with zest and the chopped or processed nuts. For serving: Transfer the shanks to a platter and cut off the kitchen string. Split the crusty bread and warm through in the oven. Fish the bay leaves out of the sauce and place the Dutch oven back on the stove over medium-high heat. Whisk the sauce to combine and thicken, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve the shanks in shallow bowls topped with the chunky sauce and gremolata. Serve the crusty bread on the side for mopping. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 51915,&quot;Kao Neuw Kati: Sweet Sticky Rice Dessert 2 cups long-grain Thai jasmine sticky rice, cooked, method follows 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons palm sugar or light brown sugar 2 to 3 long strips pandanus leaves or 1 to 2 drops orange or almond extract 1 cup fresh unsweetened coconut milk 2 to 3 long strips pandanus leaves or 1 to 2 drops orange or almond extract 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon sea salt 1-cup fresh unsweetened coconut cream Sliced, mango, pears, peaches and kiwis Instructions: Sticky Rice: Line a steamer basket insert of a pot with fresh corn husks or soaked dried corn husks (used as Mexican tamale wrappers). Spray the corn husks with vegetable oil spray to prevent sticking. Spread the soaked rice evenly over the husks. Fill the pot with water to come to just under the steamer basket insert. Put the steamer basket insert into the pot, cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Steam the rice for at least 20 minutes, or longer. Transfer the rice to a serving bowl when ready to serve. Cover the rice with some corn husks to keep it moist and warm. Reheating Sticky Rice: Divide the leftover cooked rice into small serving portions, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate. The rice will keep well for 2 to 3 days. The easiest and best way to reheat the sticky rice is by microwave. Warm the wrapped sticky rice in the plastic it was store in on high power for1 to 2 minutes, or until hot. To reheat by steaming, unwrap the sticky rice and follow the above method for cooking sticky rice. After you&#39;ve prepared the rice, make the sauce syrup: Combine the sugar, palm sugar, pandanus leaves, if using, and the coconut milk in a 2-quart saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved. Without increasing the heat, allow the coconut cream to come to a gentle boil, and boil and thicken for 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Cover to keep warm. Leave the pandanus leaves in the syrup until you are ready to make the syrup for topping, or, if you are using extract, add it now. To make the topping syrup, if you are using pandanus leaves, pull them out of the sauce syrup and place them in a 2-quart saucepan. Add the sugar, salt, and coconut cream. Heat over low to medium-low heat until the sugar and salt dissolve; do not let the coconut cream boil, or it will curdle. Let the syrup simmer slowly until it thickens, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Leave the panadus leaves in the syrup until ready to be used. Or, if you are using extract instead, add it now and stir well. Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and set aside. To make sticky rice dessert, put the hot rice in a large mixing bowl. Pour the warm sauce syrup over the rice, mixing well with a wooden spoon. The mixture will be soupy. Cover tightly with clear plastic wrap and let the rice absorb the syrup for about 10 minutes, then stir the rice mixture again with the wooden spoon. Cover tightly with plastic wrap again and let it rest for another 10 minutes. To shape the rice for serving, dip your hands in a bowl of cool water and shake off excess droplets. Scoop a handful of rice at a time from the bowl and mold it into an oval shape. Or shape the rice by using a rubber spatula to scoop up a mound of rice onto a large oval wooden spoon, shape it with the spoon, and transfer the mound to a serving platter. The rice may stick to the spatula, so dip it in cold water and shake off excess droplets before scooping more rice. Put the rice on a serving platter or individual plates. Spoon the thickened coconut syrup topping over the rice. Garnish with sliced fruits, such as, mango, pears, peaches or kiwi. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 51916,&quot;Straight-Up with a Pig Patty Burger 2 heads garlic Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 12 ounces thinly sliced applewood smoked bacon 32 ounces ground beef (80/20 blend) 2 ounces Mornay Sauce, recipe follows, optional 8 slices yellow American cheese or Cheddar 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth mixed with 2 tablespoons water 4 soft brioche hamburger buns, cut in half \\Donkey\\ Sauce, for serving, recipe follows 1 kosher dill pickle, finely sliced 1/2 Vidalia onion, very finely sliced 1 heirloom tomato, finely sliced 1/4 head iceberg lettuce, finely sliced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup whole milk, warmed 1 teaspoon kosher salt Pinch grated nutmeg 3 ounces grated yellow American cheese 1 cup prepared mayonnaise 1/4 cup roasted garlic 1 teaspoon regular yellow mustard 4 dashes Worcestershire sauce 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 4 pinches ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut off the top third of the garlic head to expose the cloves. Place onto a piece of foil. Drizzle with some olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover the garlic with the foil and place into the oven for about 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to the touch. Remove the garlic cloves from their husks. Reserve until ready to use. Mince 1 teaspoon of the roasted garlic and melt with the butter in a small saucepan. Season with salt. Gently warm until the garlic becomes fragrant. Set aside in the fridge to slightly firm up again. Begin by preparing the bacon for the pig patties. Set a large pot of cold water over high heat and add the bacon. Bring to a medium boil and cook until the bacon is very tender and almost falling apart, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Drain and set aside to cool. Set a flat cast-iron grill pan over high heat. Divide the bacon into 4 even portions, form each portion into a patty and place on the grill. Press down with the foil-covered brick to squash the bacon together and into a flat patty so it crisps. Cook until golden and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and keep warm. Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions (8 ounces each) and form into 4 tight balls. Sprinkle the hamburger \\ball\\ all over with salt and pepper. To the griddle pan (which still has some of the bacon fat on it) place the hamburger balls on and flatten with a strong, flat metal spatula. Flatten to approximately 1/3-inch thickness and continue to press down with the spatula as it cooks. Cook until the burgers develop a crust on the first side, 1 1/2 minutes. Flip over and cook on the second side to develop a crust on that side, 1 minute. Add 2 ounces Mornay Sauce, if using, to the top of the hamburger and top with a slice of cheese. Place a dome lid over the top of the burger. Pour the chicken broth mixture on to the flat top so the liquid runs under the dome and creates steam to cook the burger and melt the cheese. When the burger is at desired point of doneness and the cheese is completely melted, remove the dome lid and set the burgers aside. Brush the cut sides of the buns lightly with the garlic butter. Toast the buns on the flat top until golden and crisp, 3 to 4 seconds. Flip and toast the outsides so they are also lightly toasted, 3 to 4 seconds. To assemble: Smear the \\Donkey\\ Sauce on the cut side of both bun halves. Layer the base with pickle slices and the hamburger patty. Top with a bacon \\pig patty.\\ Top with the onions, tomato and lettuce, and then place the top half of the bun on top. Wrap in waxed parchment paper and serve immediately. In a medium saucepan, add the butter and set over medium heat. Allow the butter to melt, and then sprinkle with the flour and stir with a whisk. Cook over low heat until the butter and flour combine into a mixture like wet sand. Once combined, stir for 1 to 2 minutes to cook the flour (but without adding color). Pour in the milk slowly as you whisk to combine. Continue stirring until the mixture thickens up, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the salt, nutmeg and cheese and stir until the cheese has melted and the mixture is smooth. Set aside and keep warm until ready to use. Yield: 1 cup. Mix the mayonnaise, roasted garlic, mustard, Worcestershire, salt and pepper together until smooth. Yield: about 1 cup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 51917,&quot;Hungarian Style Swedish Meatballs, Served on a Noodle Schmata 1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms 3 cups beef stock or water 1 1/2 pounds ground (beef) chuck 1 large onion, finely minced 6 slices white bread, cut into 1/4-inch dice (get thin slice) Salt and pepper 12 ounces crimini mushrooms (or mixed exotic mushrooms) 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon sweet Hungarian (Szegedy) paprika 1 cup sour cream plus more for serving 6 sheets pasta, cooked Instructions: Simmer dried mushrooms in beef stock for 15 minutes.

On a lightly floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle 1/8-inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and place another sheet pan on top of it. Bake between the 2 sheet pans until it barely begins to take on color, about 10 minutes. The puff pastry may rise unevenly in sections. If that happens, release the air by gently piercing the dough with the tip of a paring knife. Mix the corn syrup and water together. Remove the puff pastry from the oven and brush the top with the corn syrup mixture. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and flip over the puff pastry. Peel off the parchment paper that is now on top and brush this side with the corn syrup mixture. Using a sharp paring knife and a plate as your guide, cut about a 10-inch circle from the half-baked puff pastry. Discard the excess dough. I cut the circles when the dough is half-baked so they will keep their shape. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Place the puff pastry circle back in the oven and continue to bake until crispy and golden brown, about another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack until completely cooled. Using a pastry brush, coat one side of each cooled circle with the tempered chocolate and allow the chocolate to set at room temperature, about 5 minutes. This layer of chocolate keeps the tarts from getting soggy. When the chocolate has set, spread about 2 tablespoons of pastry cream on each tart shell on top the chocolate coating. Cover with assorted sliced fresh fruit. It looks best to arrange the fruit in a sunburst pattern, fanning each type of fruit from the center of the circle toward the edge. Sprinkle the tops of the tarts with powdered sugar right before you serve them. A great finish for this dessert is a sugar cage over the top. Suggested presentation: Sugar cage, recipe follows. For the Classic Puff Pastry: Place the flour, salt, melted butter, and most of the water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for about 1 minute. Stop the mixer as soon as the ingredients begin to form a dough and pull away from the side of the bowl. If the dough appears too dry and does not come together, add the remaining water and mix just until combined. Do not over mix or you will over-develop the gluten. It is very important to keep gluten development to a minimum in this recipe, or the finished puff pastry will be tough and chewy instead of delicate and crispy. Remove the dough from the mixer and pat it into a 5-inch square about 2-inches thick. Wrap the dough completely in plastic and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Resting the dough allows the gluten strands that have developed to relax. Work the cold butter into a square that is about a third smaller than the dough square, and about 1-inch thick. Place the butter on a lightly floured work surface and, keeping it square shaped, use a rolling pin to give it a few quick raps. This will soften the butter. It should be about the same consistency as the puff pastry dough. Lightly flour the butter and rolling pin as needed to keep it from sticking. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to make a mark about 1-inch from each corner of the dough. Roll only this part of each corner away from the center of the dough until it is 1/4-inch thick. The center of the dough should be about 1-inch thick. Place the butter square in the center of the dough square. Pull the rolled-out corners up and over the butter, completely enclosing it in a dough package. When the butter has been added, the dough is referred to as a paton. The paton is now ready to be folded. You will need to give the dough six single folds, allowing the dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours after every 2 folds. To begin, use a rolling pin and roll the paton into a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Try to keep it an even thickness. Place the dough horizontally in front of you so it will be easier to fold. Fold the dough in thirds by first folding the left end over the middle and then folding the right third over it. Rotate the dough to make sure the seam is on your right. This is known as a single fold, or a letter fold because it resembles the way a letter is folded. Repeat the single fold starting with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle placed horizontally in front of you. To show that you have folded the dough two times, make two indentations in the dough with your fingertips. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and give it two more single folds, starting each time with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Make four indentations in the dough with your fingertips representing the four folds. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day. For the Pastry Cream: Sift together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Pour the milk and the remaining 1/4-cup sugar into a 2-quart saucepan and place the saucepan over medium-high heat. While the milk is heating, use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the heating milk and bring to a boil. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk by carefully pouring about half of the milk into the egg mixture. Immediately whisk to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Continuously whisk to ensure that the mixture cooks evenly. Once the pastry cream has come to a boil, continue to whisk and cook for another 2 minutes to fully develop the flavor of the pastry cream and to cook out the flavor of the starch. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any pieces of cooked egg and the vanilla bean. If you would like to add butter, this is the time to add it. Cut the butter into small chunks and stir it in until it is well incorporated. Pour the pastry cream into a clean, airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool at room temperature, then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, until ready to use Flavor the cream according to your taste. For example, with a whisk or spatula, slowly fold about 1 tablespoon of any flavored liqueur into the cream at any point in the recipe, tasting often. If you add too much, the cream will become runny and lose its shape. If you prefer to add flavor without alcohol, place the zest of 1 orange in the heating milk to infuse the flavor into the pastry cream. Store the pastry cream well wrapped in the refrigerator until ready to use. Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 311 degrees F, or what is known as the \\hard crack\\ stage. Remove from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-sized, microwave-able glass bowl. Wash, dry, and lightly but thoroughly coat with cooking spray a clean, dry bowl that matches the diameter of whatever you&#39;re placing the sugar cage over. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the inside of the bowl, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly on the sides and bottom of the bowl, making sure to come all the way to the rim, however, not so thick that you can&#39;t see the bowl through the sugar. Using a sharp chef&#39;s knife, slice the edge of the cage clean by scraping the blade of the knife along the rim of the bowl. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. To unmold the cage, place your thumbs on the outside of the bowl and your fingers on the inside of the sugar cage. Gently pull the cage loose from the side and bottom of the bowl; you will be able to see the cage release from the inside of the bowl. You will need to apply this gentle pressure all around the inside of the bowl. Once the cage has released from the bowl, carefully lift it out and place it over the dessert. If the sugar is still too warm, the cage may begin to collapse. A good idea is to release the cage from the bowl but leave it in the bowl until it has cooled completely. This will ensure that it keeps its shape. (At this stage, the cage can be stored, right side up, in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for one to two days.) How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]&quot; 51937,&quot;Citrus Marmalade-Glazed Chicken Livers with Roasted Potatoes and Crispy Brussels Sprouts 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 6 red potatoes, quartered 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, finely chopped, divided 3 strips Canadian bacon, chopped 1 pound chicken livers 2 tablespoons Big Chef&#39;s Bold Citrus Marmalade, recipe follows 1 pound Brussels sprouts, sliced thin 6 Ruby Red grapefruits, peeled and sectioned, 1 thinly sliced peel reserved 1 cup granulated sugar 1 cup dry sweet wine (recommended: German Riesling) 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Melt 1 tablespoon butter. On a baking sheet, toss the potatoes with the melted butter, 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, salt, pepper, and 1/2 tablespoon thyme. Put them in the oven for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet and add 1 tablespoon oil. Add the chopped bacon and cook for a few minutes. You don&#39;t want to over-crisp the bacon before you add the livers. If the bacon gets too crisp before the livers go in just take it out and lay on a paper towel to drain. Season the livers with salt, and pepper, and add to the pan. We are looking for a great dark sear on each side so let the livers cook about 3 minutes per side. Put the livers on one side of pan and the bacon on the other. After the livers are cooked, add the marmalade and the remaining thyme and give it a good toss or stir. Turn off the heat and let stand. While the livers are resting, in another saute pan add 1 tablespoon oil and 1/2 tablespoon butter. Put the pan over high heat and when the butter starts to brown, add the sliced Brussels sprouts and spread out across the entire pan. Cook for 2 minutes, add salt, and pepper, and toss like a pancake or simply stir them up. The edges will start to brown and you&#39;ll get a deep nutty crispness.<br> Place the Brussels sprouts down on a plate and lay the livers on top and then flank it with the new potatoes.

Add the onions, cover and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the cover; increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the onions are brown and caramelized, about 30 minutes. (Stir the onions frequently toward the end of this stage in the cooking so they do not scorch or burn.) Add the thyme and garlic; cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour in the wine and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon; simmer until the wine is reduced by about half. Stir in the broth and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook for 30 minutes. Add the cognac if using and season with pepper. (The soup can be made to this point a day ahead and refrigerated.) Preheat the broiler. Divide the soup evenly among 6 heatproof crocks or bowls.

Transfer the quail from the marinade to a clean plate. Pour enough of the batter over the quail to coat well, reserving a little batter. Deep fry until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain on a clean towel and toss in the reserved sauce. Quail is best when still pink on the inside. Coat the green onions with the remaining batter and fry until golden, 1 or 2 minutes. Drain on clean toweling. To serve, arrange the pineapple slices in a circle around the outer edges of a large ovenproof plate. Warm in the oven. Pile the quail in the center and poke the green onions into the quail at various intervals. Serve immediately. In a saucepan, heat the oil. Stir in the cl pepper flakes and remove from the heat. Cool. Store in a covered jar and use as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 51944,&quot;Chicken Cacciatore Lasagna 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 2 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 2 onions, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary<br> 3/4 cup dry white wine 4 bay leaves (preferably fresh) 2 28-ounce cans whole San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand<br> 1 1/4 pounds fresh lasagna noodles<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the dish 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 4 cups whole milk Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Working in two batches, add the chicken to the pot and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove to a plate. Add the onions to the pot and cook, stirring, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and rosemary and cook, stirring, until softened, about 30 seconds. Stir in the wine, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer until reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Return the chicken and its juices to the pot. Add 3 bay leaves to the pot along with the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Bring the sauce to a boil and stir, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thickened, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Line a baking sheet with a kitchen towel. Cook the lasagna noodles in the boiling water a few at a time until just al dente, 2 minutes. Carefully remove the noodles with a slotted spoon, transfer to the ice water and let cool, then remove the noodles to the baking sheet and blot dry. Drizzle the noodles very lightly with olive oil to prevent sticking; set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 ? F. Make the bchamel: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour; cook, whisking constantly, until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high and whisk in 1 cup milk until combined. Continue whisking in the remaining 3 cups milk, 1 cup at a time, until combined. Add the remaining bay leaf, a big pinch each of salt and pepper and the nutmeg and cook, whisking, until the sauce comes to a simmer. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Discard the bay leaf. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Shred the chicken in the sauce with two forks; discard the bay leaves. Spread 1 1/2 cups of the chicken sauce in the baking dish and top with a layer of noodles, overlapping them slightly and trimming if necessary. Top with another layer of the chicken sauce, 1/2 cup bchamel and 1/4 cup Parmesan. Repeat the layering three more times (noodles, chicken sauce, bchamel, Parmesan), then top with a final layer of noodles (you might not use all of the noodles). Top with the remaining bchamel and parmesan. Put the lasagna on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake the lasagna until bubbling around the edges and lightly browned on top, 30 to 35 minutes. Let sit 15 minutes before serving. Top with more Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 51945,&quot;Spicy Calabrian Shrimp 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 teaspoons Calabrian cl paste<br> 1 teaspoon lemon zest (1 lemon)<br> 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails on<br> 1/2 small lemon<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, pancetta, and garlic and saute until the onion is tender, about 3 minutes. Add the broth, beans, and sachet of herbs. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then decrease the heat to medium and simmer until the vegetables are very tender, about 10 minutes. Discard the sachet. Puree 1 cup of the bean mixture in a blender until smooth*. Before putting the puree back into the soup, add the macaroni and boil with the lid on until it is tender but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Return the puree to the remaining soup in the saucepan and stir well. Season the soup with ground black pepper and red pepper flakes. Ladle the soup into bowls. Sprinkle with some Parmesan and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil just before serving. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 51947,&quot;Easter Crudites Basket with Spinach Dip Spinach Dip: One 10-ounce package frozen spinach, thawed and drained 1 cup sour cream<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise<br> 3 green onions, chopped<br> 1 carrot, peeled and finely diced<br> 1 clove garlic, grated<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Veggies: 2 bunches asparagus 2 bunches kale, rinsed 6 carrots, cut into sticks<br> 6 stalks celery, cut into small sticks<br> 2 red bell peppers, cut into strips<br> 1 head broccoli, broken into florets<br> 1 small head cauliflower, broken into florets<br> 1 bunch radishes, halved 1 bunch green onions<br> 1/2 jicama, cut into strips<br> Hollowed-out head of red cabbage, for holding the dip Instructions: For the spinach dip: Mix together the spinach, sour cream, mayonnaise, green onions, carrots, garlic, lemon juice and some salt and pepper in a medium bowl until well combined.

Spread a thin film of the Besciamella Sauce on the bottom of the pan. Cover with a fresh pasta sheet, about 1 cup of the Ragu and about 1/2 cup more of the Besciamella. Lightly cover the surface with some of the grated cheese. Repeat this layering process until all of the pasta is used. Bake the lasagna uncovered, rotating once halfway through, 40 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool 1 hour, cut and serve.<br> Warm the milk and bay leaf over medium-high heat until just below a boil. Melt the butter over medium heat in another saucepot. When the butter is fully melted and begins to bubble rapidly, add the flour and whisk until fully incorporated. Continue to cook over medium heat until a smooth, blond-colored paste is formed, 4 to 5 minutes. Add about half of the scalded milk to the butter and flour paste, whisking constantly. Once it is fully incorporated, add the thickened milk mixture back into the remainder of the scalding milk, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the sauce comes to gentle boil and is fully thickened. Season with the salt and nutmeg, whisk to combine and strain through a fine mesh strainer. Cover the surface of the besciamella with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming and allow to cool to room temperature. Place the garlic, celery, onions and carrots in a food processor and process until very finely chopped. Add the oil and butter to a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.

Cover with the other half of the biscuit and enjoy. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and baking soda in a large bowl. Toss the butter in the flour and cut it in with a fork or pastry cutter until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. With a rubber spatula, gently fold the buttermilk into the dough. Knead the dough a few times on a lightly floured work surface until it comes together. Pat the dough into an 8-by-10-by-3/4-inch rectangle. Cut out biscuits using a 2 3/4-inch biscuit cutter; cut straight down, don&#39;t twist. Cut the biscuits as close to each other as possible to lessen the scraps. Gather any scraps and knead just a few times to bring them together. Pat them back to an even 3/4-inch thickness, and cut out 3 or 4 more biscuits. (The reworked scrap biscuits might not rise as much as the other biscuits, but they will still taste good!) Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet and drizzle with the honey.

Heat a large braiser pan over medium-high heat and add the oil. Sprinkle the lamb shanks all over with 2 teaspoons salt. When the pan and oil are hot, sear the shanks on all sides until deep brown, rotating often, about 8 minutes. Remove the lamb to a plate. To the pan, add the carrots, celery, onions and garlic and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables are soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the oregano, rosemary and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes to caramelize the paste. Deglaze the pan with the wine and simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, then add the lamb shanks back to the pan. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover the pan. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the lamb is fork tender, about 2 hours, turning the shanks halfway through. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the honey, Dijon and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add the escarole and radicchio and toss well to coat. Arrange the bitter greens on a large serving platter. When the lamb is tender, remove the shanks to the platter with the greens. Simmer the sauce until reduced slightly, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Spoon some of the sauce over the lamb.

In a large saucepan, bring the water, butter, salt, and granulated sugar to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, 30 seconds to evaporate some of the moisture. Scrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running, and working 1 egg at a time, add 3 of the eggs, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add the remaining egg and mix until incorporated. Using a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip, pipe the dough onto the baking sheet, in 2-inch diameter rounds or balls. Whisk the remaining egg with 1 1/2 teaspoons water. Brush the surface of the rounds with the egg wash to knock down the points (you may not use all the egg wash). Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F and bake until puffed up, and light golden brown, about 20 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. To fill the cream puffs, place a pastry tip on your finger and poke a whole in the bottom of each puff. Whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla until stiff. Pipe whipped cream into each cream puff and chill until ready to serve, no more than 4 hours. Notes about the recipe: The moisture in the eggs turns to steam and puffs the batter to try to release itself. You can fill them with anything. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 51958,&quot;Grilled Watermelon and Tomato Salad 2 large cloves garlic 1 large shallot, halved 2/3 cup olive oil 1/4 cup honey 1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 to 3 limes) Zest of 1 lime (about 1 teaspoon) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons salted butter 1 cup pecan halves 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 small seedless watermelon (about 9 1/2 pounds) One 5-ounce container baby arugula One 16-ounce container Campari tomatoes, cut into wedges 4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled 1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion Instructions: Make the honey-lime vinaigrette: Add the garlic and shallot to a food processor and pulse until minced. Turn off the motor and add the oil, honey, lime juice and lime zest. Process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Make the salad: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

Spread the potatoes out neatly in one layer on a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, roll the towel up, and squeeze lightly to dry the potatoes without breaking them up. Put the potatoes into a bowl and toss them with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a small (8-inch) omelet pan (a saute pan with sloped sides) over medium heat. Add half of the potatoes to the pan and press lightly with a large metal spatula to make the shreds lie flat. Cook them undisturbed for 5 minutes. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the butter around the edge of the pan and cook the potatoes for another 3 to 5 minutes, until nicely browned on the bottom. Loosen the galette gently around the edge with the metal spatula and flip it over. (Be careful! The oil and butter underneath are very hot!) Add another tablespoon of butter around the edge and cook the galette for 4 to 5 minutes longer, until the second side is nicely browned. With the metal spatula, transfer the galette to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes and butter to make a second galette. Place the two galettes on a cutting board. Spread each galette with 2 tablespoons of the creme fraiche and a layer of smoked salmon, covering the galette completely. Sprinkle with minced chives and sprinkle lightly with salt. Use a large chef\\u2019s knife to cut each galette into 6 wedges and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51963,&quot;Spinach, Artichoke and Almond Dip 1 pkg.

Cover and bring this to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Pat the bottom round dry and rub with vegetable oil and salt on all sides. Heat a large saute pan over high heat; add the meat and brown on all sides, approximately 2 to 3 minutes per side. When the marinade has cooled to a point where you can stick your finger in it and not be burned, place the meat in a non-reactive vessel and pour over the marinade. Place into the refrigerator for 3 days. If the meat is not completely submerged in the liquid, turn it over once a day. After 3 days of marinating, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Add the sugar to the meat and marinade, cover and place on the middle rack of the oven and cook until tender, approximately 4 hours. Remove the meat from the vessel and keep warm. Strain the liquid to remove the solids. Return the liquid to the pan and place over medium-high heat. Whisk in the gingersnaps and cook until thickened, stirring occasionally. Strain the sauce through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps. Add the raisins if desired. Slice the meat and serve with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 51967,&quot;Smoked Salmon Deviled Eggs 8 extra-large eggs 1/2 cup sour cream 2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons good mayonnaise 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives, plus extra for garnish 4 ounces good smoked salmon, minced 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 ounces salmon roe Instructions: Place the eggs in a pot large enough to hold them in a single layer. Cover the eggs with cold water and bring to a full boil over high heat. As soon as the water boils, turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let the eggs stand for 15 minutes. Drain the eggs and fill the pot with cold water. Set aside until the eggs are cool. Peel the eggs and then slice them in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks carefully. Place the yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and arrange the whites on a platter in a single layer with the cut sides up and sprinkle with salt. To the egg yolks, add the sour cream, cream cheese, mayonnaise, lemon juice, chives, salmon, salt, and pepper. Beat on medium speed until fluffy. With a small spoon, fill the egg whites with the egg yolk mixture. Cover loosely with plastic wrap (you don&#39;t want to flatten the filling) and refrigerate for 30 minutes for the flavors to blend. When ready to serve, garnish with a dollop of salmon roe and some extra chopped chives. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51968,&quot;Pistachio Crusted Salmon 1 (2 to 3-pound) side salmon, skin on 2 lemons, juiced 4 tablespoons stone-ground mustard 1 cup shelled pistachio nuts 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs 4 tablespoons canola oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange the side of salmon on an oven proof baking sheet, skin side down. Mix the lemon juice and mustard together in a small bowl and spread sparingly over the top of the salmon. Coarsely grind the pistachios in a food processer. Add the panko bread crumbs, the oil and salt and pepper, to taste. (The bread crumbs should be slightly wet, as it helps the stick to the salmon.) Sprinkle the pistachio mixture over the mustard to cover the salmon evenly. Put in the preheated oven and bake until the salmon reaches the correct doneness, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven to a serving platter. Remember the fish needs to rest outside of the oven for at least 5 minutes. It will continue to cook, so remove the salmon from the oven with this in mind. Enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 51969,&quot;Tentacle Tacos 2 preboiled 6-inch octopus tentacles, about 1-inch round 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/4 large jicama, peeled and cut into matchsticks 1/2 red onion, sliced lengthwise into thin strips 1 lime, juiced, plus wedges for garnish 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 4 tablespoons olive oil 4 fajita-sized flour tortillas 1 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves, plus sprigs for garnish Instructions: Add the octopus to the soy sauce to a medium-size bowl and set aside.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the sugar has just dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the cornstarch, egg yolks and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a large bowl until smooth. While continually whisking, slowly pour in about 1/2 cup of the warm milk mixture. Continue to whisk until smooth. (This is called tempering, and it will prevent the yolks from scrambling.) Continue whisking and adding 1/2 cup of the warm milk mixture at a time until completely combined and smooth.<br> Transfer the mixture back to the saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Cook, whisking constantly, until thickened and the texture of pudding, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, then whisk in the butter until smooth and glossy.

Cut the leeks in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Immerse them in a bowl of cold water, swish to remove any grit and lift them out into a colander. Clean the bowl, change the water and repeat until the water remains clear. You should have 6 cups leeks. Once they are all in the colander, toss them a bit with your fingers to separate the leaves. Heat a large skillet over high heat until hot. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Add half the leeks and a generous pinch each salt and pepper. Spread the leeks into a single layer and cook, without stirring, until slightly charred, about 1 minute. Stir in a small pinch pepper flakes and continue cooking, without stirring, 1 minute. Toss and stir until the leeks just start to wilt, about 1 more minute. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with 1 tablespoon of the oil, the remaining leeks, a generous pinch each salt and pepper and another small pinch pepper flakes, adding the leeks to the bowl when done. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the skillet (let it get really hot). Add the shrimp, garlic and another pinch pepper flakes (or to taste). Season with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing, until the shrimp just starts to turn pink in spots, less than 1 minute. Add the leeks and toss to combine; the shrimp should now be pink.

Immediately turn off the heat and set aside. In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring constantly, to caramelize the mixture. (You&#39;ll smell a characteristic nutty-caramel odor when the butter browns, signaling that the mixture is ready.) Whisking constantly, gradually add the butter/brown sugar mixture to the hot milk/cream mixture. If the mixture is not smooth, blend for 20 seconds with a hand blender or pour through a fine sieve. Put the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture. Whisk in the cornstarch and salt until dissolved. Whisk in the cornstarch mixture back into the hot mixture in the saucepan. Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Turn off the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour into 6 to 8 custard cups, ramekins, or mugs and chill, uncovered, at least 2 hours or overnight.

Line a 9-by-13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, and spray with nonstick spray. Toss the oats with the quinoa, almonds, pumpkin seeds and salt in a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup coconut oil (if it has hardened in the jar, melt it in the microwave or on the stove over low heat) and agave. Toss until the mixture forms clumps; if it seems dry, add more coconut oil, 1 tablespoon at a time. Spread the crouton mixture onto the prepared baking sheet in a thin, even layer. Bake on the middle oven rack until light golden brown, about 45 minutes--it will feel sticky when just out of the oven but will crisp up as it cools.<br> Remove the baking sheet to a baking rack and let cool completely. Break into clusters. (Makes about 3 cups. Extra can be stored at room temperature in a tightly covered container for 3 days.)

Cut off the wings. Remove the legs and separate the thighs. Remove and discard the backbone. Cut the breast into 2 pieces and then cut each breast in half. Mix 4 teaspoons salt, the brown sugar and baking powder in a small bowl until completely combined and no lumps of sugar remain. Sprinkle the salt mixture all over the chicken pieces. Place the seasoned chicken on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Wrap the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate, at least 3 hours and up to 24. (Overnight works best.) Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne and 1/4 cup salt in a large bowl until completely combined. Whisk together the buttermilk, hot sauce and eggs in another large bowl. Working with 1 piece at a time, dredge the chicken in the seasoned flour, turning to coat and packing it into any crevices. Shake to remove any excess and return to the rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Pour 6 tablespoons of the buttermilk mixture into the seasoned flour and work it in with your fingers; it should feel like sand with some clumps. (These clumps will give the chicken a crispy, shaggy crust.) Dip the dredged chicken into the remaining buttermilk mixture, allowing any excess to drip off. Then pack the moistened flour firmly onto the chicken. Very gently shake off any excess and return to the rack. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours. Pour enough oil into a large heavy pot to come halfway up the sides. Clip a deep-fry thermometer to the pot. Heat the oil over high heat until the thermometer registers 300 degrees F. Working in 3 batches, fry the chicken, turning often and adjusting the heat to maintain the temperature, until deep golden brown, about 8 minutes for the wings, 10 minutes for the legs and 12 minutes for the thighs and halved breasts (an uncut breast will take 15 to 18 minutes). Transfer to a clean wire rack set over paper towels to drain. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 51993,&quot;Masala Burgers with Tangy Tamarind Sauce and Red Onion-Mint Relish 1 (14-ounce) package frozen tamarind pulp, thawed (recommended: Goya or La Fe brand) 3/4 cup light brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 ounces fresh ginger, chopped 2 ounces garlic cloves, chopped 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil (recommended: Colavita) 2 tablespoons garam masala 2 teaspoons ground cayenne 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 pounds ground sirloin 2 cups thinly sliced red onion 2 medium-sized Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced lengthwise 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing on the grill rack and buns (recommended: Colavita) 6 whole-wheat hamburger buns, split 1/2 head iceberg lettuce, sliced Instructions: Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill with a cover, or preheat a gas grill to medium-high.

With a paring knife, trim off the peel and white pith from the grapefruits, removing as little of the grapefruit flesh as possible. Working over a bowl, cut the segments free of the membrane, letting the segments drop into the bowl. After you&#39;ve cut all the segments, squeeze all the juice out of the membranes into the bowl. Refrigerate the segments in the juice until needed, up to 2 hours. Just before serving, cut the avocados in half, remove the pit and peel the halves. Slice each half lengthwise into 6 thin slices. Drain the grapefruit and reserve the juice (for the salad, if using, or as a treat for the cook). Add the avocado to the grapefruit along with the olives and lime juice. Toss gently to mix, while adding just enough olive oil to coat the avocado. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and toss again.

Remove both wings at the joint between the wing and drumette. Remove the thigh quarters by slicing down on either side of the back end of the breast. Grab both legs, pop the joints that connect to the back, and turn the bird over. Remove the thighs and legs by slicing where they attach to the backbone. Hold the thigh and leg together, feel for the slight indentation where the joints meet and make an incision at this joint. Set the leg and thigh down and slice to separate. Repeat with the other leg piece. Turn the bird back over, breast side up, put your knife against the breastbone and slice down along the rib cage, cutting the breast meat away from the bone. Be sure to include the drumette when removing the breast. Repeat on the other breast. Freeze the carcass for making stock or discard. Put the chicken pieces in a 1 gallon resealable plastic bag with the water, honey, and salt. Seal the bag and move around vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes to distribute the honey and dissolve the salt. Set the bag in a leak-proof container and refrigerate for 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, combine curry powder, chili powder, cocoa powder, adobo powder, cumin, and hot smoked paprika in a 1 gallon resealable bag. Pat the chicken with paper towels until very dry. Do not rinse. Put the chicken in the bag with the spice mixture and shake to thoroughly coat the chicken. Lay the pieces on a cooling rack set inside a half sheet pan. Rest for 30 minutes. Spritz 2 pieces of newspaper lightly with vegetable oil and put in the bottom of a charcoal chimney starter. Fill the chimney starter with natural chunk charcoal, 2 to 3 pounds, and set on the charcoal grate of a kettle grill until hot and ashy, approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Prepare a ring of heavy-duty aluminum foil with the center 9-inches in diameter. Put this ring over the chimney starter and lay on the charcoal grate. Carefully and evenly distribute the hot charcoal outside the ring. Set an aluminum pie pan in the center of the ring to catch any drippings. Set the cooking grate in place and heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Lightly oil the cooking grate. Arrange the chicken pieces, skin side down, on the grate over the hot coals. Turn the legs a quarter turn every 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the thighs, wings, and breasts after 4 to 5 minutes. Skin should blister and darken in color. Adjust intensity of heat by turning the grill grate to expose chicken pieces to cooler or hotter coals, as needed, and to avoid flare-ups. After 9 to 10 minutes total cook time, move the breast to the center of the grill and cover with a second aluminum pie pan. After 10 to 11 minutes total cook time, put the wings on top of the pie pan. Lean the thighs and legs against the side of the aluminum pie pan away from the direct heat of the coals. Turn every 2 minutes. Put any pieces that finish cooking on top of the pan. After 18 to 20 minutes total cook time, check the temperature with an instant-read thermometer inserted in the deepest part of each piece. The pieces should reach 155 degrees F. Remove the chicken to a clean, medium bowl. Cover with a tea towel and rest 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 52006,&quot;Fried Chicken 2 whole free-range, organic chickens Vegetable oil of choice, for frying the chicken 6 cups all-purpose flour 5 tablespoons salt 4 tablespoons ground black pepper 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon onion powder 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 2 cups buttermilk Instructions: Cut the whole chickens into 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 legs and 4 wings and set aside. Preheat your oil, in either a heavy pan on the stove or a deep-fryer, to 325 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne pepper until thoroughly mixed. Set aside. Pour the buttermilk into another bowl large enough for the chicken to be immersed in the buttermilk. Prepare your dredging station. Place your chicken in a bowl. Next to that, your bowl of buttermilk, and next to that, your dry mixture. Take your breasts, lightly dust them with your flour mixture, then dip them in the buttermilk until they are coated, and then place them in the flour mixture. Take the breasts that are in the flour mixture and aggressively push the flour mixture into the wet chicken. Make sure that the chicken in very thoroughly coated, or you will not achieve the crust and crunch you are looking for. Gently place the breasts in your hot oil. Next, repeat the dredging steps with your other pieces of chicken in this order: thigh, leg then wing. When you place the last wing into the fryer, you should have 16 pieces of chicken in the oil. Set a timer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, take a probe thermometer and check the temperature of a breast. If it reads 180 degrees F, all of your chicken is done. (Keep in mind that it will continue to cook after it has been removed from the fryer.) Remove the chicken from the oil and let it drain for 5 minutes. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 52007,&quot;Warm Wax Bean Salad with Roasted Tomatoes and Sun-Dried Tomato Dressing 1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained, plus 1/3 cup of the oil (or use olive oil) 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon honey<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups mixed color cherry tomatoes, cut in half<br> 1 small red onion, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 pound wax beans (or green beans if not available), trimmed Instructions: For the sun-dried tomato dressing: Put the sun-dried tomatoes, red wine and balsamic vinegar, honey and some salt and pepper in a blender and puree until smooth.

Brush the edges with the egg wash and fold over the dough carefully, pressing out the air from the filling, allowing it to seal. Using a fluted cutter, cut between each of the ravioli to separate. Put the ravioli in the refrigerator to let them set while you wait for your water to come to a boil. Bring a pot of water to a boil and salt heavily. Add the ravioli in batches, and cook for 3 minutes, allowing the filling and pasta to cook through. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Put the butter in a large, high-sided saute pan and cook over medium-low heat until it reaches a noisette stage, when the butter is bubbling and starting to get a little bit brown. Throw in your crushed walnuts and sage and stir to combine. When the ravioli are cooked, scoop them out of the water and place them in the pan with the butter sauce, tossing to coat. Plate the ravioli and garnish with the remaining Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 52030,&quot;Salt Cod Fritters 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 large russet potato, about 12 ounces, peeled and cubed (about 3/4 cup) 1 cup shredded salt cod (about 6 ounces), recipe follows 1/4 cup finely chopped green onions 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley leaves 2 large eggs 1/8 teaspoon cayenne Vegetable oil, for frying 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 3 1/4 teaspoons Essence or Creole seasoning, recipe follows 3 tablespoons milk 2/3 cup fine dry bread crumbs 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme 1 pound dried salt cod, cut into 4-inch pieces Instructions: In a small saucepan, bring the potato and enough water to cover to a boil. Reduce the heat and cook just until fork tender, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl to cool for 10 minutes. With the back of a heavy fork, mash the potatoes until smooth but still slightly lumpy. Add the salt cod, green onions, parsley, 1 egg, the salt, and cayenne and mix until smooth. In a large, deep heavy pot or electric deep fryer, heat enough oil to come halfway up the sides to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the flour and 1 teaspoon of the Essence. In another bowl, beat together the remaining egg, the milk, and 1/4 teaspoon of the Essence, and in a third bowl, combine the breadcrumbs with the remaining 2 teaspoons Essence. Divide the cod mixture into 24 and form into balls, about 1 1/4-inches in diameter and 1 heaping tablespoon each. One at a time, dip the cod balls in the flour and roll to coat evenly on all sides. Shake to remove any excess flour, dip in the egg wash, and then roll in the seasoned breadcrumbs. Place on a baking sheet. In batches, gently add the balls to the oil and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 2 1/2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \\New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch Published by William and Morrow, 1993. In a large glass or ceramic dish, lay the salt cod in a single layer. Add enough water to cover the fish by 1-inch, cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 6 hours. Drain the fish in a colander and rinse under cold running water. Place the fish on a work surface covered with paper towels and press each piece firmly with your hands. Pat the fish dry with paper towels and return to the soaking dish. Cover with fresh water, soaking and draining a total of three more times (for a total of 4 times in all). Place the rinsed and dried salt cod in an airtight container until ready to use, and refrigerate for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 52031,&quot;Elderflower Tarte 2 ounces Rhubarb-Infused Elderflower Liqueur, recipe follows 3 wild strawberries 3/4 ounce Meyer Lemon Air, recipe follows 1 bottle elderflower liqueur (recommended: St. Germain) 6 stalks fresh rhubarb, chopped 1/2 cup fresh Meyer lemon juice 1 pinch soy lecithin Instructions: Pour the Rhubarb-Infused Elderflower Liqueur into a shot glass.

With the motor running, pour in the beaten eggs and pulse until the dough gathers around the blades. Turn out the dough and pat into a rectangle. Wrap in plastic wrap and set aside 30 minutes at room temperature. Meanwhile, make the filling: Pulse the leeks, bacon and carrots in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a skillet; add 1 cup water and cook over medium heat, stirring, until evaporated, about 7 minutes. Add the nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Increase the heat to medium high; cook until the vegetables start to brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, stir in the parsley and let cool. Mix in the ricotta, gruyere and egg yolks; cover and chill until ready to make the ravioli. Dust the dough with flour and cut into 6 pieces. Pat 1 piece of dough into a 4-by-2-inch rectangle (keep the rest covered with plastic wrap). Feed a wide side through a pasta machine at the thickest setting. Continue to feed the dough through the machine, reducing the thickness setting each time, until the pasta is about /16 inch thick. Lay the pasta sheet on cornmeal-dusted parchment paper and cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining dough. Line a baking sheet with parchment and dust with cornmeal. Uncover 1 sheet of dough; lay out with a long side facing you (keep the remaining sheets covered). Place small mounds of filling, about 2 inches apart, in a line along the bottom edge. Brush the top half of the sheet with water and fold the dough over to cover the filling; press around each mound to seal. Cut into squares with a pizza wheel or chef&#39;s knife; transfer to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. If not using immediately, wrap the baking sheet in plastic and freeze for up to 3 days. Make the sauce: Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and cook, stirring, until tender, about 4 minutes. Add the scallions and garlic; cook, stirring, 1 more minute. Add the tomatoes and cook 4 more minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the basil and parsley. Cook the ravioli: Bring 3 inches of salted water to a boil in a large pot. Add the ravioli in batches and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a baking sheet (reserve the cooking water). Cover the ravioli loosely with foil to keep warm. Add 1 1/2 cups of the ravioli cooking water to the sauce, bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and season with salt and pepper. Divide the ravioli among plates; top with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Garnacha]&quot; 52033,&quot;Cherry Glazed Pork Chops with Smashed Potatoes 1 pound baby yellow potatoes 7 tablespoons olive oil 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 boneless pork chops (about 6 ounces each) 1 shallot, chopped 2 tablespoons sweetened dried cherries 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup cherry jam 5 ounces mixed baby salad greens (about 4 cups) Instructions: Position an oven rack 5 to 6 inches below the heat source and preheat the broiler to high. Pierce the potatoes all over with a fork. Put the potatoes on a microwave-safe plate with 2 tablespoons water and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave until tender, about 10 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Carefully uncover, drain the potatoes and transfer them to a baking sheet. Top with 2 tablespoons olive oil and half the chopped thyme. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Smash each potato by pressing down with a metal spatula until it flattens. Set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels and sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. Sear until golden brown on one side, about 2 minutes, then flip and cook until golden brown on the second side, about 2 minutes more (the pork chops will not be cooked through at this point). Transfer to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the shallot, dried cherries and the remaining thyme and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup water and simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the cherry jam and season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. Transfer 2 tablespoons of the glaze and the remaining 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar to a large bowl and whisk to combine. Slowly whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil to make a vinaigrette.

In large mixer bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy with a heavy duty mixer. Add the melted chocolate and mix well. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix thoroughly after each addition. Add the vanilla and mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Add half of the flour to the mixer bowl along with 1/2 cup of the half-and-half. Mix until the flour is mixed in, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the rest of flour mixture and the other 1/2 cup half-and-half. Mix until the batter is smooth and all of the flour lumps are gone. Fill 24 cupcake liners half full and bake for 20 minutes in the convection oven or 28 minutes in the standard oven. The tops of the cupcakes should be lightly browned. Check the cupcakes to make sure no batter sticks to a wooden toothpick when inserted into the cupcake. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the ganache: Put the chocolate chips, heavy cream and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each time, until the chocolate chips are melted and the ganache has the consistency of hot fudge. It will look like a mess at first but as you continue to stir it will start to form a thicker mixture. If the ganache becomes too thick to dip, put it back in the microwave for about 15 seconds and stir again. For the chocolate whipped mousse filling and topping: In large mixer bowl, beat the heavy cream, half-and-half and pudding mix until light and fluffy using heavy duty mixer. It should have the consistency of whipped cream. Put the filling in a pastry bag or zipper bag with a corner cut off. To assemble: Make a hole in the middle of each cupcake using a sharp knife. Be sure and leave a small amount of cake in the bottom of the hole. Fill the cupcakes using the filling in the bag. Using the same bag, frost the tops of the cupcakes with the filling. Put in the freezer until the topping mixture is cold and somewhat stiff, about 20 minutes. Dip each cupcake in ganache and immediately sprinkle with mini chocolate chips and garnish with a piece of chocolate bar. Let the cupcakes sit until the ganache is set. Then serve, or refrigerate until time to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 52040,&quot;Margherita and Prosciutto Pizzettes 3 1/4 cups (423 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar 1 packet (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) instant yeast 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 cup warm water 1/3 cup (67 grams) neutral oil, plus more for the bowl and grill, if using 2 large eggs 6 tablespoons (84 grams) extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 3 garlic cloves, sliced 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 2 to 3 Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced Kosher salt 1 pound (452 grams) or two 8-ounce balls fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced 3 ounces (84 grams) thinly sliced prosciutto 1/2 cup (40 grams) grated Parmesan cheese Fresh basil, sliced, for sprinkling Instructions: For the dough: In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix together the flour, sugar, yeast and salt. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the water, neutral oil and eggs. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and mix on low to combine. Knead, either by hand on a floured surface or with a dough hook, for 7 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary (but resist any urge to add too much!), until you have a smooth and slightly sticky dough. Transfer the dough to a large, oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours. Alternatively, you can stick it in the refrigerator overnight and then let it sit at room temperature for about an hour before shaping. For the garlic oil: In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add the olive oil, red pepper flakes and garlic. Cook until the garlic is very light golden and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the parsley. Set aside. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 8 balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart. Lightly cover with plastic wrap or a clean towel and rest for 30 minutes until puffed. For the toppings: In the meantime, line a baking sheet with paper towels. Arrange the tomato slices in an even layer on the paper towels. Lightly season the slices with salt to draw out excess moisture, which can make your pizzettes soggy. Allow to sit for 10 minutes. Pat dry, remove to a plate and set aside for when you\\u2019re ready to assemble your pizzettes. Remove the plastic wrap or towel from the dough, and then, using a rolling pin, roll them into ovals that are about 7 inches long by 3 inches wide and 1/4 inch thick. To grill on the stovetop: Preheat a cast-iron grill pan over medium-low heat. Oil the grill pan well. Add the dough ovals to the grill pan in batches and grill for 2 to 3 minutes until deep grill marks appear. Flip and brush with the garlic oil. Top with the sliced mozzarella and tomato. Cover and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes until the cheese is melted and the dough is cooked through. Remove from the grill pan onto a baking sheet or serving platter. Add the sliced prosciutto. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese and basil and drizzle with the garlic oil. To grill on a gas or charcoal grill: Preheat the grill to a low heat. Oil the grates well to prevent the dough from sticking. After shaping the dough ovals above, carefully add them to the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until deep grill marks appear and the dough is crusty. Flip and brush with the garlic oil. Top with the sliced mozzarella and tomato. Cover and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes until the cheese is melted and the dough is cooked through. Remove onto a baking sheet or serving platter. Add the sliced prosciutto. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese and basil and drizzle with the garlic oil. To bake the pizzette in the oven: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. After shaping the dough ovals above, put them back on the baking sheets and brush them with the garlic oil. Arrange the sliced mozzarella and tomato on top. Bake, rotating the baking sheets halfway through baking time, until the pizzettes are golden on the bottom and the cheese is brown and crusty, 15 to 17 minutes. Arrange the prosciutto on top and sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese and basil. Drizzle with the garlic oil and serve. While these are best hot from the oven, wrap leftover pizzettes in foil and reheat in the oven at 400 degrees F for a few minutes to bring them back to life (remove the basil and prosciutto first). The leftover pizzettes will keep for up to 2 days in the fridge. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 52041,&quot;Pink&#39;s Guacamole Dog 1 steamed all-beef hot dog 1 soft hot dog bun 1/2 cup guacamole Instructions: Place hot dog on a warm, soft hot dog bun, and top with guacamole. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 52042,&quot;Lemon Moscow Mule 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons Limoncello, recipe follows 3 ounces vodka<br> Ice cubes<br> One 12-ounce bottle ginger beer<br> Lemon wheels, for garnish 14 organic lemons 1 liter vodka<br> 3 cups sugar<br> Instructions: Add the lemon juice, limoncello, vodka and a few ice cubes to a Moscow mule mug.

Beat until the bowl is just barely warm to the touch and the egg mixture is shiny and forms stiff peaks, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the butter one piece at a time, beating after each addition, until all the butter has been added. (If the icing looks curdled, just keep beating until it becomes smooth.) Add the hazelnut spread and vanilla and mix on medium speed until evenly incorporated. Scoop the buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a large round tip.<br> Pipe the buttercream on top of the cupcakes in a swirling motion, working upwards like a soft-serve ice cream cone. Refrigerate the cupcakes until the buttercream firms up, about 1 hour.<br> For the decorations: Put the marshmallows in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for about 30 seconds, then stir to combine. If lumps remain, microwave 10 to 20 seconds more, repeating until the mixture is smooth. Mix in the purple food coloring, if using, until no streaks remain. Allow the marshmallow mixture to cool until it is warm and melted but cool enough to handle, about 30 seconds.<br> Take a big pinch of marshmallow between your fingers and pull apart between your hands to form strands that resemble a web. Wrap the marshmallow web around the hardened buttercream on a cupcake. Sprinkle sanding sugar over the top, if using. Repeat with the remaining marshmallow, sanding sugar and cupcakes. If the marshmallow becomes too thick and hard to pull apart, reheat in the microwave in 10-second increments until slightly thinned. The cupcakes can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52045,&quot;Pasta with Tomato and Peas 1 pound linguine 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 shallots, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 carrot, diced 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 5 tablespoons tomato paste 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon dried parsley 1 1/2 cups frozen peas, thawed 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup grated Romano Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.

Pour 3 ounces of limoncello into each glass and top off with about 3 ounces of sparkling water to create your float. Garnish with lemon twist. Wash the lemons thoroughly. Using a peeler, take off the skins being careful not to get any of the white lemon \\pith\\ onto your peelings or it will add bitterness to your limoncello. Place peels into a large wide-mouth jar with all the vodka. Seal tightly. Place the jar in a cool, dry place for 2 to 3 weeks. Shake the jar to remix everything everyday or so. You will notice the color of the liquid changing to yellow as the peels lose their color. After 1 week, dissolve the sugar completely with the water by heating it on the stove in a large saucepan. Let simple syrup cool to room temperature. Strain the lemon peels from the alcohol and discard. Mix the alcohol with the simple syrup. At this point you can serve it right away or pour the alcohol into a bottle with the simple syrup and place in the freezer to chill.

Add to a large soup pot and cook over medium-high heat to render the fat and get crispy on all sides, about 8 minutes total. The more brown the better; just don&#39;t burn them. They are perfect when they are more chewy than juicy. Remove bacon chunks and set aside on a paper towel lined plate. Pour off all but 2 to 3 tablespoons of fat from the stock pot. Add the onion, carrot and celery with a pinch of salt and pepper and saute until onions are just translucent, about 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cumin and let cook another minute before adding the split peas and stock. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the peas are al dente (cooked through, but slightly firm and whole), about 20 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes. Ladle out about 3 cups of the peas and carefully blitz the remaining soup using an immersion blender or countertop blender until creamy. If using a countertop blender be sure to only fill it about 1/3 the way up and start on a slow speed, then raise to a higher speed. This method will take a bit longer due to the need to blitz in batches. Pour the soup back into the pot. Return the 3 cups of peas to the soup and stir to combine and heat through. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and top with bacon, tomato and a squeeze of lime. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 52050,&quot;Pecan Crusted Filet Mignon 1/2 cup pecans, toasted 1/2 cup flour 1 whole filet mignon, trimmed Vegetable oil 1/2 cup Dijon mustard Salt and pepper, to taste Port wine sauce, recipe follows 1/4 cup chopped shallots 3 ounces butter 1 tablespoon peppercorns 6 ounces Port wine 1/8 cup balsamic vinegar 1/4 bunch fresh thyme, leaves 1 1/2 quarts demi-glace Instructions: Preheat oven 375 degrees F.

Cut each cutlet across in 1/3rd&#39;s, to make 3 (4-inch) long pieces from every cutlet. Season each piece with salt and pepper, then place 1/2 teaspoon of softened whipped butter on each slice and spread it evenly across. In a mixing bowl, add the bread crumbs, onions, garlic, parsley, and both of the grated cheeses, season with cracked black pepper and toss well to mix. Drizzle the bread crumb mixture with the olive oil to moisten the crumbs, and mix well with your hands to incorporate. Place a heaping tablespoon of the mixture on each slice and roll up, tucking in the sides as you go, spring roll fashion, to secure the filling inside. Some veal rolls will be longer than others, and can be cut in 1/2 to even out. Save the extra rolls to make 1 more skewer. Top each veal roll with 1 fresh bay leaf and 1 red onion wedge, and then place 3 of the topped rolls on 1 skewer, so that each skewer has 3 of everything on it. You should make 12 skewers with 3 rolls per skewer, by using the extra meat you trimmed from the longer rolls. Place on a pregreased hot grill, and grill for about 2 minutes on each side, brushing again with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. If you do not have a grill, you can place under the broiler about 8 to 10 inches from the flame, and watch carefully, cooking for 2 minutes per side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 52070,&quot;Gingerbread House and Ornaments 6 1/2 cups honey 12 cups bread flour 1 1/2 ounces powdered baker&#39;s ammonia (ammonium carbonate) 1 cup water 4 eggs 1 (16-ounce) bottle light corn syrup (2 cups) 8 cups all-purpose flour, sifted 4 tablespoons ground cinnamon<br> 3 1/2 tablespoons ground nutmeg 4 tablespoons ground clove 4 tablespoons ground ginger Milk, for brushing dough 4 egg whites, room temperature 5 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon cream of tartar 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice Instructions: For Honey Dough: In a large saucepan, bring the honey to a boil over medium heat. Immediately remove the pan from the heat. Pour the honey into the large bowl of a stand mixer and slowly add the bread flour, using a bread hook. Continue mixing until dough is smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes. Allow the dough to cool, then wrap with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature. This dough needs to set up overnight at least, but can rest up to 2 months. For Spice Dough: Dissolve the baker&#39;s ammonia in the water in a large mixing bowl of a stand mixer. Add the eggs and corn syrup and mix until combined. Sift the flour and spices in a separate large mixing bowl and gradually add the flour mixture to the wet mixture using a bread hook on the electric mixer. The dough will become very stiff; do not overmix, simply incorporate the flour. Cut the honey dough into 3 portions and add it into the spice dough, 1 portion at a time. You need to make sure that the honey dough and spice dough&#39;s are completely combined. To make sure that they are, you must knead the dough by hand in a fold-and-press motion on a lightly floured work surface. This will take a long time, but is totally necessary. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Lightly flour your work surface and work with 1 portion at a time. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out until it&#39;s about 1/4-inch thick. While rolling, flour the work surface and rolling pin, as needed. Using your gingerbread house template, cut out desired shapes with a floured butter knife. Transfer the shapes to a greased cookie sheet or sheets, using a large floured spatula, placing them 1-inch apart. Reroll the scraps to make the additional cookies or decorations used for the gingerbread house. Lightly brush dough with milk and bake until firm to the touch in the center and the edges begin to darken, 10 to 14 minutes. If the dough begins to bubble at all, pierce it with a toothpick to remove the air, and then carefully smooth out the surface. Remove the house pieces from the oven and allow to completely cool on the cookie sheet. For Royal Icing: Do not begin to make the icing until the gingerbread house pieces are completely cooled and you are prepared to assemble the house. Beat the egg whites until light and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes, in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed. Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and cream of tartar; beat until combined. Add the lemon juice and beat on high until the mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks, at least 5 to 7 minutes. When finished, cover the icing with plastic wrap, making sure that the wrap touches the icing completely. For Gingerbread House: Cut out a large cardboard base that is large enough for your gingerbread house and strong enough to hold the weight. Cover it with aluminum foil or wrapping paper. Spoon some of the royal icing into a pastry bag fitted with 1/4 to 3/8-inch diameter tip. Keep the remaining icing covered so it does not dry out. Assemble the walls of the house, piping thick lines of the icing onto the sides of the walls that meet. Use cans of food to support the walls when drying. If the edges of the pieces are not straight, you will need to cut them. If they are not smooth, you can run a nutmeg grater over the edge to smooth it out. Allow the icing to dry completely before attaching the roof pieces. Once the roof is secured and the icing is dry, you may decorate the house with the remaining icing, cookies and candies as desired. Cook&#39;s Notes: You will need to set aside a few days to make the house. The honey dough needs to rest overnight. Once the gingerbread pieces are baked, we suggest you allow them to cool for at least 4 hours. Once they are cooled completely, you can assemble the house. Allow the icing to totally dry and harden, then decorate the house as desired. Baker&#39;s ammonia is also known as ammonium carbonate, and can be found at drugstores. It must be finely ground. You may notice an odor of ammonia while baking, but this will quickly dissipate and will not have an odor or taste when completed. When preparing the royal icing, you MUST make sure that the bowl and all utensils used are free from any traces of grease. The smallest trace of grease will not allow the icing to firm up. When you are deciding on a gingerbread house template, please keep in mind that it cannot be larger than the cookie sheet you are using to bake the pieces. When combining the honey dough and spice dough, it is very important that you combine them completely. Otherwise, the house pieces will cook uneven and the flavor will not be consistent. This process will require a lot of \\elbow grease\\ when combining. Because the dough is so thick, you will need to do it by hand. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52071,&quot;Chocolate Coconut Balls 1 cup toasted chopped Macadamia nuts 1 cup sweetened condensed milk 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract 8 ounces sweetened shredded coconut One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate morsels, melted 1 tablespoon shortening Instructions: In a bowl mix together the nuts, condensed milk, almond extract and coconut.

Bring to a boil and then simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and let stand covered, for 10 more minutes. Mix in the seasoned rice vinegar and let cool to room temperature.<br> Peel the carrot and cucumber and slice into long, thin pieces. Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit and peel off the outside. Cut the avocado into thin slices.<br> Place 1 nori sheet, rough-side facing up, on a bamboo mat or sheet of waxed paper. Using a bamboo paddle or spoon, flatten a 1/8-inch thick layer of rice over the nori, leaving the furthest edge from you bare. Keep the paddle or spoon wet, this helps spread the rice easily. Lay equal amounts carrot, cucumber, avocado, and faux chicken strips horizontally across the rice, about a 1/4-length of the nori away from you. A small amount wasabi can also be spread across the rice.<br> To roll the sushi:<br> Start with thumbs underneath the closest edge of the bamboo mat or wax paper. Lift up with thumbs, and use the index and middle fingers to push the top edge of the nori down and around the ingredients. Pull the bamboo mat or waxed paper away from the nori as you roll away from yourself. Once the sushi is rolled tightly, use wet fingers to moisten the outside of the bare edge of the nori, this will help seal the roll. Repeat all steps with the remaining ingredients.<br> Use a serrated knife to cut the sushi roll into 1-inch thick slices. Serve with soy sauce and wasabi, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 52074,&quot;Hoisin-Glazed Cornish Hen 1 (1 1/2-pound) Cornish hens Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup hoisin 1/4 cup honey 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/4 cup scallions, sliced Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Heat a 10-inch nonstick saute pan with 1 teaspoon unsalted butter. When butter begins to crackle pour in beaten eggs and cook for 10 seconds, just so the eggs begin to set on the bottom. Immediately scrape the sides towards the middle using a plastic utensil. Stir almost continuously until the omelet is cooked to your liking. Allow 2 minutes for a well cooked omelet. To roll the omelet, flip one half over toward the middle, while tilting the pan. Add the filling of your choice and continue rolling omelet over itself. Roll the omelet on to a serving plate. Make a slit with a paring knife to expose some of the filling and drizzle some melted butter on top, if desired. <em>Chef&#39;s Note: To serve a make-your-own omelet bar, make omelets to order and offer toppings: Spinaci alla Padella, Grilled Red Onions, Salami Bits, Caponata and a selection of cheeses. Bring 1 gallon of water to boil in a large pot with 2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt. Add the spinach, pushing it down into the water with a skimmer, and immediately remove it to a bowl of ice water. Drain the spinach once cooled (don&#39;t leave it in for too long) and squeeze out the water. Divide spinach into 4 sections and compress each into a ball (each ball will be about 1 cup and they can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to a day). Cut each ball in half and then in half again to chop up the spinach. Place 1/4 cup of the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the garlic to the pan and shake the pan often, for about 1 minute or until the garlic is lightly browned. Add the spinach and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste. It will seem dry. Remove the spinach to a bowl, sprinkle with a little olive oil and garnish with lemon wedges. Variations: Try adding some chopped anchovy with the garlic. For creamed spinach: substitute butter for half of the oil and add 1 cup of heavy whipping cream as you cook the spinach.

Peel and grate the potatoes on the large holes of a box grater or in a food processor. Sprinkle the potatoes well with salt and pepper and toss to coat. When the skillet is hot, add the potatoes, pressing them down and flattening them out to evenly cover the bottom of the skillet. Cook until the potatoes are well browned on the bottom, monitoring the heat as you go so they don&#39;t burn. Carefully flip over the pancake, keeping it in one piece, and brown it on the other side. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and keep warm. While the potatoes are cooking, put a small skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter has melted, add the shallot and cook until it softens. Sprinkle over the flour and cook for a minute or 2. Pour in the cream and bring to a boil. Add the whiskey and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for a few minutes until it thickens a bit. Turn off the heat and add half the cheese. Stir to melt the cheese. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm. In another medium skillet over medium-low heat, add the remaining tablespoon butter. Whisk the eggs well, and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.

Add the butter and using two knives or a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour mixture until you get a pebbly, course texture. In a small bowl combine the buttermilk and ice water. Using a fork, gradually mix the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture. Pat the dough into a 4-inch round and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F, and prepare the filling. Peel the pears, core them and cut into 1/4-inch slices. In a large bowl toss the pear slices with the lemon juice. Sprinkle in the cornstarch, brown sugar and cinnamon and toss until the pears are evenly coated. Set aside. On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a large circle about nine inches in diameter. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and draping the dough over the rolling pin, transfer to the prepared baking sheet. If the dough breaks at all patch it up with your fingers. Arrange the pears in a mound in the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch boarder. Fold the border over the filling. It will only cover the pears partially and does not need to be even. Bake the tart for 15 minutes, and then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, keeping the tart in the oven all the while, and bake for another 40 minutes, until the pears are tender and the crust is golden brown.

Taste and adjust the seasoning. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 52085,&quot;Crispy Cheese Curd Risotto Cake 10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) salted butter 1/2 cup finely diced sweet onion<br> 1 cup carnaroli or Arborio rice<br> 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt<br> 3/4 cup dry white wine<br> 1 to 1 1/4 cups freshly grated Parmesan 1 pound white cheese curds<br> About 1 cup rice flour<br> Instructions: Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large, high-sided skillet, and add the onion. Cook over medium heat until soft and sweet, about 10 minutes. Add the rice and salt and cook, stirring, until well coated in butter, about 2 minutes. Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring, until it evaporates. Add 1/2 cup water and cook, stirring frequently, until it has been absorbed. Repeat, adding 1/2 cup water at a time, until the rice swells and becomes tender. This should take about 15 minutes and about 3 to 3 1/2 cups water. The texture of the risotto should be softly flowing but not soupy. Stir in the Parmesan, and transfer the risotto to a wide bowl. When it is cool enough to touch, fold in the cheese curds. Line an 8-inch-square baking dish with plastic wrap, leaving plenty of overhang on all sides. Pour the risotto into the dish, smooth the top, and cover with the overhanging plastic. Refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours, or as long as overnight. Before serving, clarify the remaining 8 tablespoons butter: Heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat until it foams and starts to turn dark blond on top, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the butter sit for a few minutes. Then tilt the skillet toward you and gently spoon off and discard the top layer of foam. Pour the clear golden butter into another bowl, discarding the dark dregs at the bottom of the skillet. Unmold the risotto cake onto a cutting board. Cut it into eight 1-inch-wide slabs, and then cut each rectangle into thirds to make 24 pieces. Put the rice flour in a shallow dish. Dip the tops and bottoms of the risotto cakes in the flour, and transfer them to a platter or baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Heat a large nonstick saute pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add enough clarified butter to lightly coat the bottom, and when it&#39;s hot, add as many risotto cakes as will fit in the pan. Fry until a dark golden brown crust forms on both sides and the cheese inside is melted, about 4 minutes. Keep the fried risotto cakes warm in the oven while you fry the rest of them. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52086,&quot;Coconut-Lime Tres Leches Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 6 large eggs, separated<br> 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Zest of 1 lime<br> 1 cup toasted coconut<br> One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk One 12-ounce can evaporated milk<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 tablespoon powdered sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup toasted coconut<br> Zest of 1 lime<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with cooking spray. Set aside. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Set aside. Beat the egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment on medium speed until foamy, about 1 minute. With the mixer still on, slowly add 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Continue until shiny medium-stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Remove the egg whites to a medium bowl and set aside.<br> Add the egg yolks and remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar to the same bowl of the stand mixer with the same whisk attachment (no need to wash). Beat on medium speed until pale yellow and doubled in volume, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the milk and vanilla, then the lime zest and coconut, beating constantly. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture until just combined.<br> Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg white mixture into the batter in 3 additions until the egg whites are no longer visible.<br> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a tester comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer the pan to a rack and let cool slightly.<br> For the tres leches: Whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk and whole milk in a large measuring cup with a spout. Using a round metal skewer or a fork, poke holes all over the top of the cake, but don&#39;t go all the way down to the bottom (this will help the cake absorb the milk!). Pour the milk all over the cake very slowly and a little at a time (this will help distribute the milk throughout the cake). When all of the milk has been poured into the cake and absorbed, cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours, preferably overnight.<br> For the topping: Combine the heavy cream, powdered sugar, cinnamon and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Dollop, then spread over the top of the cake. Sprinkle with the coconut, then then the lime zest. Cut into 15 rectangles.

Grease the bottom and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans with 2 tablespoons of the butter. Make the cake batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar on medium speed until smooth, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the eggs, one by one, and then add the lemon zest and juice. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Remove the bowl from the machine and stir in the dry ingredients. Do not overmix. Bake the cake: Fill each prepared cake pan with half of the batter. Place the pans in the center of the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake emerges clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on wire racks until cool enough to handle, then turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. For the filling: In a medium bowl, whisk the ricotta until smooth. Sift in the confectioners&#39; sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix to blend. In a separate bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), beat the heavy cream until fairly stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the cream into the ricotta mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips and lemon zest. For the rum glaze: Bring the rum to a simmer in a medium pot over low heat. Sift in the confectioners&#39; sugar and a pinch of salt and simmer, whisking, until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Cool. Assemble the cake: Place one layer of the cake on a flat surface. Brush some of the rum glaze on the first layer and top with all of the ricotta filling. Place the second cake squarely on top and gently press the two layers together. Brush the second cake with rum glaze. For the toppings: Frost the whole exterior of the cake with the whipped cream. Sprinkle on the chocolate chips over top. Serve immediately or refrigerate until serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 52094,&quot;The Porker 2 pounds pork butt 2 tablespoons Brown Sugar Rub, recipe follows 8 ounces sliced smoked Cheddar 2 hot link sausages (we make ours in house but you can use any spicy store-bought sausage) 4 hamburger buns 4 tablespoons South Carolina Mayo, recipe follows 1/2 cup pickled chiles 8 ounces Maple Bacon, recipe follows Hand-cut fries, potato salad or chips, for serving<br> 1 tablespoon brown sugar 2 teaspoons chili powder 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon granulated onion 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 cup yellow mustard 2 fluid ounces cider vinegar 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 teaspoon pink salt, optional (optional, only necessary if smoking the bacon) 2 pounds skinless pork belly 2 tablespoons Michigan maple syrup or (or your favorite purereal maple syrup) Instructions: Grind the pork butt twice through a meat grinder with a large die and form into four 8-ounce patties. Sprinkle the patties generously with the Brown Sugar Rub and grill to desired temperature (we recommend medium or pink in the center). Top with smoked Cheddar and melt it with your grill closed. Cut the hot links in half and split down the center. Grill on both sides until crispy. To assemble the sandwich, spread the bottom bun with the South Carolina Mayo and top with pickled chiles and Maple Bacon. Next, add the pork patty and then top with the split hot link. We serve our hand-cut fries on the side, but the sandwich is great with potato salad, chips or anything else. Mix the brown sugar, chili powder, salt, granulated garlic, granulated onion, black pepper and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Cover tightly and leave out at room temperature.<br> Whisk together the mustard, vinegar, brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Let sit overnight to develop flavor (we also use this sauce as a mustard- based BBQ sauce without the mayo). Whisk together the sauce and mayonnaise and set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use. Use any extra for sandwiches, dipping fried things in... really anything.<br> Combine the kosher salt, brown sugar and, if smoking the bacon, the pink salt if smoking the bacon, and mix thoroughly. Then whisk in the maple syrup. Rub the cure over the entire pork belly and place in a zip-top bag (remove the air from the bag before sealing). Place in the refrigerator for 7 days, flipping the belly every day to balance out the cure. On the eighth day, remove the belly from the cure and rinse thoroughly. Then place in the refrigerator uncovered, preferably on a rack for better air flow. Leave overnight to dry and form a pellicle (the skin made from proteins that form on the surface to allow the smoke to penetrate the meat better). If you have a smoker, smoke the belly for 3 hours at 200 degrees F to an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. Remove from the smoker, cool and slice about 1/4-inch thick. If you do not have a smoker, put the belly on an oven rack for 3 hours at 200 degrees F and cook to an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. Then cool and slice about 1/4-inch thick. Place the bacon slices on a baking sheet and bake at 375 degrees F until brown and crispy.

When the beans are tender, season with salt and pepper and reserve. Heat the clarified butter or oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat until lightly smoking. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook for 1 minute longer. Add the mushrooms and corn. Deglaze the pan with the red wine and reduce the liquid by 3/4 over high heat, while scraping the pan with a spatula to dissolve the solidified juices. Add the demi-glace, chipotle puree, sage, reserved beans and tomato. Reduce the liquid by one third, add the basil, whisk in the butter and season with salt. Keep sauce warm while grilling steaks and preparing onion rings. Prepare a medium-hot fire in a grill with charcoal briquettes. Grill steaks to desired doneness, about 5 to 7 per side for medium rare. Serve with sauce and onion rings. Pour enough canola oil in a frying pan to come 3 to 4 inches up side of pan. Heat to 350 degrees F. For the onion rings, pour enough milk in a large mixing bowl to cover sliced onions; let soak for 20 minutes. Thoroughly combine all the dry ingredients in a bowl, except salt and cayenne. Shake excess milk off the onions and toss into flour mixture until well coated. Fry in canola oil until golden. Remove from oil and season with salt and cayenne to taste. To prepare smoker: Soak 6 to 8 small chunks of aromatic wood (preferably hickory) for 20 minutes in water. Build fire in smoker with hardwood charcoal briquettes and electric starter (avoid chemical starters since they impart unpleasant flavors in the smoke). When briquettes are still glowing but somewhat gray (about 20 minutes from starting fire), add soaked wood chunks. Let burn for 5 minutes. The temperature of the smoker should register about 180 degrees. Place chiles and vegetables on grill over water pan and cover with top of smoker. Smoke ingredients for 20 minutes. Remove ingredients from smoker and place in a 2 quart saucepan with the veal stock. Bring to a boil and reduce liquid by 1/3. Whisk in mustard. Strain and set aside. In small saucepan, whisk together the vinegar and sugar. Bring to a boil and continue cooking until mixture becomes syrupy, about 3 minutes. Add syrup to the strained veal stock and whisk in the catsup. Strain sauce through fine strainer. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 52125,&quot;Ricotta and Vanilla Ravioli with Orange Mint Dipping Sauce Ravioli 1/2 cup whole milk ricotta cheese 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves 1 1/2 teaspoons orange zest, from 1 medium orange 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 1 egg, beaten 24 round potsticker (Gyoza) wrappers * 1/2 cup fresh orange juice, from 1 medium orange 1 cup sugar 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves Instructions: Dipping Sauce; *Can be found at specialty Asian markets.

Set aside. Heat a 3 1/2-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and butter, and heat until the butter is melted. Add the shallots and garlic; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until soft and fragrant, 2 minutes. Add the salt and stir in the rice; cook for one minute. Deglaze with the wine and reduce the heat to medium; simmer, stirring, until the wine is almost fully absorbed. Stir in the chicken broth and rosemary; cook, stirring often, until the rice is tender but not mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the corn puree. Spread the risotto out on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Let cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold. For the arancini: Set up a breading station with three shallow bowls. Combine the flour and salt in the first bowl; whisk the eggs in the second bowl; mix the panko and cornmeal in the third. Using a 1-tablespoon ice cream scoop, scoop a ball of risotto into the palm of your hand. Press a piece of chicken sausage into the center of the ball, then shape the ball to make sure it is completely covered. Roll the ball in the flour, then in the egg, and, finally, in the breadcrumbs, making sure the ball is completely coated. Place the arancini on a rimmed baking sheet and continue with the remaining risotto. Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches of oil. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.

Combine the sugar and kosher salt. Pour 1 cup of the sugar/salt mixture on a flat surface such as wooden board or marble. Unfold each sheet of puff pastry onto the sugar and pour 1/2 cup of the sugar mixture on top, spreading it evenly on the puff pastry. This is not about sprinkling, it&#39;s about an even covering of sugar. With a rolling pin, roll the dough until it&#39;s 13 by 13-inches square and the sugar is pressed into the puff pastry on top and bottom. Fold the sides of the square towards the center so they go halfway to the middle. Fold them again so the two folds meet exactly at the middle of the dough. Then fold 1 half over the other half as though closing a book. You will have 6 layers. Slice the dough into 3/8-inch slices and place the slices, cut side up, on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Place the second sheet of pastry on the sugared board, sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar mixture, and continue as above. (There will be quite a bit of sugar left over on the board.)

In a medium bowl, whisk together the reduced grapefruit juice, vinegar, mustard, honey and soy sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil and whisk until emulsified. Set aside. Make the crab salad. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, tarragon, lemon juice, vinegar and Dijon. Add the celery and stir to coat. Gently fold in the jumbo lump crab and season with salt. Assemble. Supreme a grapefruit by trimming the top and bottom poles so it stands up straight on a cutting board. With a very sharp knife, slice off the peel and pith from top to bottom, working in sections and following the shape of the grapefruit. Once peeled, hold the grapefruit on its side in your hand over a bowl to catch the juices. Use a small paring knife to slice between the membranes on either side of the top segment, releasing the segment. Place the segment into a separate bowl. Repeat, rotating the grapefruit as segmented, until all the segments have been removed. Arrange 5 or 6 grapefruit segments, with the straight sides of the segments facing outwards, to form a circle on the plate. Repeat with the remaining grapefruit and 3 other plates. Halve an avocado crosswise, not lengthwise, and remove the pit. Remove the skin, being careful not to mar the flesh. Trim off a little from the bottom of the bottom half of the avocado so that it sits upright. Place the avocado bottom in the center of a circle of grapefruit segments on a plate. Repeat with the remaining avocados. Divide the crab mixture among the avocado bottoms, piling the crab up high. Cover each with their top avocado halves to form whole avocados.

In a large ovenproof skillet heat the vegetable oil over high heat. Season the pork loin all over generously with salt and pepper. Sear the meat until golden brown on all sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a plate and set it aside. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, herb sprigs, and 2 tablespoons of the butter to the skillet. Stir until the vegetables are browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in the sliced apples, then push the mixture to the sides and set the pork loin in the middle of the skillet along with any collected juices on the plate. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the loin until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 140 to 150 degrees F, about 30 to 35 minutes. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Transfer the pork a cutting board and cover it loosely with foil while you make the sauce. Arrange the apples and vegetables on a serving platter and set aside. Remove and discard the herb sprigs. Return the skillet to a high heat and add the vinegar scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon to loosen up any browned bits. Reduce by half then add the cider and reduce by about half again. Pull the skillet from the heat and whisk in the mustard, and the remaining 2 tablespoons of cold butter. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove the strings from the roast and slice into 1/2-inch thick pieces and arrange over the apple mixture. Drizzle some sauce over meat and serve the rest on the side. Cook&#39;s Note: Pork cooked this way will be slightly pink. If desired, cook the pork to 160 degrees F, but be aware that this lean cut will not be as moist at the higher temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52147,&quot;Spicy Pesto Wings 1 cup canola oil 5 teaspoons red cl flakes<br> 1 clove garlic<br> Zest of 1 lemon<br> 1 cup fresh basil leaves 1/3 cup grated Parmesan Romano cheese blend<br> 3 tablespoons pine nuts<br> 3 cloves garlic<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for greasing the baking sheet 2 pounds chicken wings Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Grated Parmesan, for sprinkling Instructions: For the peppered canola oil: Combine the canola oil, red cl flakes, garlic and lemon zest in a pot and cook over low heat for 40 to 50 minutes.

Lightly coat the mango slices and onion discs in olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place mango slices on a medium high grill approximately 2 minutes on each side. Grill onions approximately 2 to 4 minutes on each side, being careful to turn only once (this will help keep them together and avoid pieces falling through the grill). When mangos have nice grill marks after a couple minutes on each side, remove from grill. Once onions have slightly charred, but still retain moderate firmness, remove from grill. Chop the mango and onion and place in large mixing bowl. Combine all of the above ingredients including juice of lime and orange and add salt and pepper to taste. In the mixing process a large amount of juice will gather at the bottom of the bowl. I recommend draining the juice, and placing the salsa in a refrigerator, covered for approximately 20 minutes. Then, use the salsa on top of grilled fish or serve as a side dish. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 52176,&quot;Trumpet Royale Mushrooms with Celery Root and Apple Slaw 1 large celery root, peeled and julienned 2 Granny Smith apples, julienned 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, divided 4 trumpet royale mushrooms, or some other large mushroom Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup creme fraiche 2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup prepared horseradish 1 1/2 cups mache lettuce 1/2 red onion, sliced thinly in rings Instructions: Combine the celery root and apples in a large bowl, toss with 1/2 of the apple cider vinegar and season with salt.

Then pour the yolk mixture into the cream and do not return to the stovetop. Add the rum, vanilla and chocolate, and whisk slowly until the chocolate melts and is completely incorporated. Pour the mixture into six 6-ounce ramekins and bake in a water bath until the creme is set, about 1 hour. Cool in the refrigerator until cold, overnight. For the butterscotch: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan and set over medium-high heat. Add the brown sugar and stir to dissolve. Cook until the sugar thickens and reaches the soft-ball stage, a candy thermometer will read 235 degrees F, the sugar will just start to darken in color. Whisk the cream and salt in slowly, being careful as the cream will steam and the sugar mixture may clump. Keep whisking and cooking until smooth. Remove from the heat and add enough food coloring to make the sauce bloody!

Combine the water, milk and olive oil in a small bowl or measuring cup, then stir it into the flour mixture. Knead, either by hand on a lightly floured surface or with the stand mixer on medium speed, adding more flour if needed, until smooth, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel, and let it rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Mix the ketchup and harissa together in a small bowl until smooth and combined. Set aside. Oven method: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts and keep it covered when you&#39;re not working with it. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll out a long skinny snake and wrap it firmly and evenly around a hot dog. Roll it back and forth on your work surface a couple of times so that the coils of the dough stick together, then place it on the baking sheet. Continue with the remaining dough and hot dogs, placing them 1 1/2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Let them rise for 30 more minutes and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat together the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Brush the tops and sides of the dough evenly with the egg wash. Bake until lightly browned, about 18 minutes. Let cool slightly and enjoy with lots of harissa ketchup. Campfire method: Start a bonfire! For each bagel dog, wrap a piece of foil around one end of a long 1-inch-diameter wooden dowel so that it covers about 6 inches of length at the tip. (Just the tip.) Divide the dough into 8 equal parts and keep it covered when you&#39;re not working with it. Take a piece of dough and roll it into a snake; wrap it firmly around the foil-covered part of the dowel. Roll it between your hands a few times to make sure there are no holes in the dough, then stick it right above the fire. Rotate it so that it cooks evenly and cook it gradually until it is browned evenly on all sides. (Make sure that it&#39;s not touching the fire at all; otherwise it will brown quickly on the outside but still be raw on the inside.) As you cook the bagel, stick a hot dog or sausage on a pointy stick and warm it right alongside the bagel in the fire. Let the bagel cool briefly, then remove it from the dowel, using a paper towel to shield your hands in case it&#39;s still quite hot. The bagel should slip off pretty easily. If it doesn&#39;t, cook it a little bit longer. Slide the hot dog or sausage into the bagel coil and enjoy with the harissa ketchup!

I&#39;d almost be embarrassed even owning up to trying to improve it, were it not for the fact that I read an article by Simon Hopkinson, a revered British chef, in which he advised using said strawberries in a pie. So I did. Well, that&#39;s not quite true: I am lazier than him, so I made a crumble. I don&#39;t know what, how or why it happened, but this is a crumble of dreams. The oven doesn&#39;t, as you&#39;d think, turn the berries into a red-tinted mush of slime, but into berry-intense bursts of tender juiciness. This is nothing short of alchemy: you take the vilest, crunchiest supermarket strawberries, top them with an almondy, buttery rubble, bake and turn them into the taste of English summer on a cold day. Naturally, serve with lashings of cream: I regard this is obligatory not optional. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the hulled strawberries into your pie dish (I use a round one) and sprinkle over them the sugar, almond meal, and vanilla extract. Give the dish a good shake or two to mix the ingredients. Now for the crumble topping: put the flour and baking powder in a mixing bowl and rub in the cold, diced butter between thumb and fingers (or in a free standing mixer).When you&#39;ve finished with it, it should resemble rough, pale oatmeal. Stir in the sliced almonds and turbinado sugar with a fork. Tip this over the strawberry mixture, covering the strawberries in an even layer and giving a bit of a press in at the edges of the dish. Set the dish on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven for 30 minutes, by which time the crumble topping will have darkened to a pale gold and some pink-red juices will be seeping and bubbling out at the edges. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving, and be sure to put a pitcher of chilled heavy cream on the table alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 52222,&quot;Slow-Cooker Soy-Citrus Chicken 1 orange, halved and thinly sliced 1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs (5 to 6 thighs) 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup sweet chili sauce 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce 1 1-inch piece ginger, peeled and minced 3 cloves garlic, minced 6 ounces thin rice noodles 1 bunch watercress, tough stems removed, coarsely chopped 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Lay the orange slices in a 6-quart slow cooker.

Blend until smooth. Reserve half for drizzling on the fajitas. Place the remaining half in a large resealable plastic bag. Marinate the steak: Place the steak in the bag with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal. Rest at room temperature for up to 2 hours. Make the peppers: In a large straight-sided pan with a lid, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to swirl, add the poblano, bell, and jalapeno peppers, and the onion. Season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened and slightly caramelized around the edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the beer, cover, and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until all the vegetables are plump and tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Grill the steak: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high. Remove the steak from the marinade and discard the marinade. Season the steak with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper on both sides. Grill the steak, flipping just once, until cooked to medium rare, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer the steak to a plate, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Warm the tortillas: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Wet your hands and rub each side of the tortillas with your hands, then stack the tortillas, wrap them tightly in aluminum foil, and place on the center rack of the oven until steamy, about 10 minutes ( or place them in a warmer). Assemble the fajitas: Slice the steak into thin slices on the bias, against the direction of the muscle. Place a few strips of meat on each warmed tortilla and top with the peppers.

Once the coals are ashy white, transfer to a kettle grill and spread evenly. Set grate over coals. Lightly brush all sides of fruit with oil and grill for 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Remove from the grill to a cutting board, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Lightly oil the bottom and sides of the Dutch oven and spread the fruit evenly over the bottom. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until frothy and lightened in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the flour and whisk just to combine. Add the milk and vanilla and whisk. Pour the batter over the fruit and cover with the lid. Carefully set 22 to 23 coals on the lid and leave only 18 to 19 coals under the grate. If you have more coals than this, remove them from the grill or push them to the edges so they are not directly under the Dutch oven. Set the Dutch oven on the grate, 2 inches above and directly over the coals. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. Allow the clafoutis to cool for 30 minutes before removing from the Dutch oven to a serving plate. Slice and serve.. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 52254,&quot;Chapatis 2 cups Atta flour (or whole wheat, sifted) 1 teaspoon salt Approximately 1 cup warm water Instructions: You will need a medium-sized bowl, a rolling pin, a castiron griddle or heavy skillet, and a small cotton cloth or a paper towel. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the salt and the flour. Make a well in the middle and add just less than 1 cup warm water. Mix with your hand or with a spoon until you can gather it together into a dough (depending on the condition of your flour, you may need a little extra water or a little extra flour to make a kneadable dough). Turn out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth or a plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes or for up to 2 hours. The longer the dough stands, the more digestible the breads. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and flatten each with lightly floured fingers. Continue flattening with a rolling pin until each piece is 8 inches in diameter. Once you have started rolling, roll out each bread without flipping it over. To keep the bread from sticking to your bread board, make sure that the bread is lightly floured underneath. Cover the breads with the damp towel or plastic wrap as you roll out others (make sure not to stack the rolled out breads; if you don&#39;t have enough counterspace for the breads, roll out just a few and begin cooking, rolling out the others as the breads cook). Heat a castiron griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. When the griddle is hot, place a chapati on the griddle, top side of the bread down first. Let cook for only 10 seconds and then gently flip to the second side. Cook on the second side until small bubbles begin to form, approximately one minute. Turn the chapati back to the first side and finish cooking (another minute approximately). At this stage, a perfect chapati will start to balloon. This process can be helped along by gently pressing on the bread. The bread is hot, so we find the easiest method is to use a small cotton cloth or a paper towel wadded up to protect your finger tips. Gently press down on a large bubble forcing the bubble to extend itself wider. If the bread starts to burn on the bottom before it has ballooned, move the bread (with the help of your paper towel) across the skillet, dislodging it from the point at which it is beginning to burn. When you are satisfied with your chapati, remove it and wrap in a clean towel. Continue to cook the other breads, stacking each as it is finished on top of the others. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Barbera, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 52255,&quot;Roasted Striped Bass with Corn Relish and Chipotle Potato Salad 2 1/2 pounds new red potatoes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup mayonnaise, such as Hellmann&#39;s 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon chipotle in adobo puree 1/2 tablespoon grainy Dijon mustard 5 green onions, sliced, green and pale green parts 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, leaves chopped Canola oil, for the pan 3 ears corn, shucked and kernels removed<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 ounces jarred piquillo peppers, drained and sliced or diced<br> 1 jalapeno, finely diced<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed<br> 4 green onions, thinly sliced, green and pale green parts<br> 1 lime, zested and juiced<br> 1 cup packed spinach leaves 1 cup olive oil<br> 1/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 whole striped bass, broken down into fillets Canola oil, for the pan Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Finely grated zest of 1 lemon<br> Instructions: For the chipotle potato salad: Put the potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold water and add a generous amount of salt. Bring to a boil and cook until a skewer inserted in a potato meets with no resistance, about 25 minutes. Drain and transfer to a baking sheet. Let cool for 5 minutes, then slice into 1/4-inch-thick slices. While the potatoes are cooking, whisk together the mayo, vinegar, chipotle, mustard and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl; add salt to taste. Add the potatoes, green onions and cilantro and mix gently to combine. Season with more salt and pepper, if needed. For the corn relish: Heat some canola oil in a saute pan over high heat. Add the corn, season with salt and pepper and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add the piquillo peppers and jalapeno and cook for a few minutes longer. Transfer the corn mixture to a bowl, add the olive oil, green onions and lime zest and juice. Let sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. For the basil oil: Prepare an ice bath. Bring a small pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the spinach to the boiling water and blanch for 20 seconds. Remove with tongs and plunge immediately into the ice bath. Let sit 5 minutes, then drain and squeeze out any excess water. Set aside. Combine the oil and basil leaves in a blender, add salt and pepper to taste and blend for a few minutes until the basil is completely pureed. Add some of the spinach (to make it greener).

Mix in eggs and 1/2 cup Romano cheese and mix well. Add turkey and gently combine, being careful not to overwork the meat. Season with salt and pepper. Shape into golf-size balls. In a large skillet heat the oil over medium high heat. When almost smoking, add meatballs and without moving or turning the meat, allow it to brown for about 3 minutes. Turn meatballs and brown other side. Continue to cook until all sides are golden brown, about 8 minutes total. Add tomato sauce and bring to a boil. Lower heat and allow meatballs to simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off heat and keep warm on stove. Be careful not to overhandle the meatballs since they are soft and fragile.<br> In a large pot, bring to a boil 6 quarts of salted water. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain pasta in a colander. Do not rinse pasta with water since you want to retain the pasta natural starches so that the sauce will cling to the penne. Remove meatballs from sauce and place in serving bowl. Pour some tomato sauce over meatballs, but leave about 1 cup of sauce in skillet. Place the cooked penne into the skillet with the remaining sauce and toss well. Pour sauced pasta into a large serving bowl. Serve alongside the meatballs. In a large casserole pot, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5-10 minutes. Add tomatoes and bay leaves and simmer uncovered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors. Add half the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce. If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 cup portions into freezer plastic bags.

Seal and shake the bag to combine. Add the lamb and shake to coat. Add the yogurt to the bag, seal and squish to coat. Refrigerate the bag in a leak proof container for 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Spritz 4 to 5 pieces of newspaper with vegetable oil and put in the bottom of a charcoal chimney starter. Fill the chimney with half of the charcoal and light the newspaper. When the charcoal is lightly covered with gray ash, carefully pour it onto the bottom grate of a kettle grill and spread evenly. Top with the remaining unlit charcoal, spreading evenly so as not to suffocate the lit charcoal. Set the second grate in the kettle and cover until ready to cook. Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a 12-inch straight sided saute pan over medium-high, until it shimmers and almost begins to smoke. Add the onion and remaining teaspoon of salt, and cook until the onion is browned around the edges, 11 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the garlic, ginger and cl. Cook, stirring constantly, until the onions have softened and browned completely, approximately 7 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of garam masala and stir several times to coat. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until they have reduced slightly and deepened in color, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the lamb from the yogurt mixture, leaving as much yogurt on the meat as possible. Thread the pieces of lamb, 1/4-inch apart, onto the skewers. Grill until the yogurt has slightly charred or blackened, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove the lamb from the skewers. Add the lamb and coconut milk to the tomato mixture and stir to combine and heat through. Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with mint or cilantro and serve over basmati rice. Combine all of the seeds, peppercorns, cloves, cl, and cinnamon in an 8-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, moving the pan constantly, until you smell the cumin toasting, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the mixture to a plate and spread out to cool for 5 minutes. Once cool, add the toasted mixture and nutmeg into a spice grinder. Process until a fine powder is formed, approximately 1 minute.

In a mixing bowl combine the masa harina, flour, Southwest Seasoning, salt, and pepper; mix thoroughly. Cut the lard into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in the water a little at a time, stirring gently. Knead the dough several times on a lightly floured surface, touching the dough as little as possible. Form the dough into a log about 12 inches long by 3 inches across and refrigerate for about 20 minutes. In a skillet, heat the olive oil. Season the duck meat with 1 teaspoon of the Southwest Seasoning. When the pan is smoking hot, add the duck and stir-fry for 1 1/2 minutes. Stir in the corn, peppers, salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper and the remaining 1 teaspoon of Essence. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the shallots and garlic and continue cooking for 1 minute. Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the stock and bring to a boil. Combine the remaining 1/2 cup stock with the cornstarch and whisk into the filling mixture. Cook for 5 minutes over high heat. Remove from the heat and strain off the gravy. Return the gravy to a small saucepan and bring up to a gentle boil and let reduce for 5 minutes. Allow meat mixture to cool slightly. Divide the dough into 8 equal sections. Carefully roll each piece out between sheets of plastic wrap into a 5-inch circle. The dough must be handled with care to keep it from cracking. Brush the dough rounds with some of the egg wash. Mound the filling in the middle of each round of dough, fold over to form a half-moon pie shape, and crimp the edges with a fork. Brush the tops of the empanadas with more egg wash; place them on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. In a small mixing bowl, combine the sour cream, lemon juice and fresh chopped cilantro together. Mix thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, spoon the gravy on the bottom of each plate.

Using a mandolin, V-slicer or the slicing attachment on a food processor, slice the potatoes approximately 1/8-inch thick. (If you don&#39;t want to slice all the potatoes at once, slice them one at a time and build the gratin as you go.) Create the first layer by laying the slices in overlapping rows. Once the first layer is down, season lightly with salt and pepper, then scatter with mushroom slices and a couple tablespoons of the cheese. (Don&#39;t over-do it on these layers, if you create a barrier between the adjoining potato layers, the gratin won&#39;t set.) Continue building layers until you&#39;re out of potatoes or out of room to build, but be sure to save 1/2 cup of the cheese for the top. Pour 2/3 cup of the half and half over the gratin then spread both hands over the surface and push down to work the air out from the layers. Add remaining liquid only if half and half does not come to the surface when you push down. Sprinkle the gratin with cheese, cover loosely with foil and place in middle of oven for 1 hour. Check for doneness by inserting the point of a paring knife straight into the gratin. If it goes through smoothly, remove the foil, return to oven, and turn on the broiler just long enough to turn the top golden-brown. Remove, and allow to sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52272,&quot;Santa Maria Style Beans 1 pound tri tip, fat trimmed off 1 gallon ranch beans 1/2 red onion, diced 6 fresh jalapenos, diced Instructions: Grill tri tip on BBQ over red oak.

Remove meatloaves from their pans and place on a cutting board. Cut two thick slices of meatloaf. Heat the oil in a cast-iron pan and cook the slices until browned on both sides. In a separate pan, cook the sliced onions until tender. Place the onions on the meatloaf, top with BBQ sauce and then with the provolone. Place 1 slice of Anadama Bread in the pan, set the meat tower on the bread, cover with the other slice of Anadama Bread and cook until the cheese is melted. Transfer to a cutting board, cut in half on the diagonal, and serve. Warm the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions and cook until tender. Add the ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire, parsley, salt, black pepper, cayenne and 3 cups water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Combine the cornmeal and 5 cups water in a saucepan. Heat until starting to thicken, then remove from the heat and allow to cool. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment, combine the cornmeal mash, molasses and yeast. Mix, then turn off and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the high-gluten flour and mix until smooth. Let sit until the dough doubles in size (about 10 minutes).

Peel and core the apples and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Pat apple rings dry. In a large, shallow bowl, put 1 1/4 cups of flour and make a well in the center. In a small bowl, beat the egg with a fork, stir in the cider and 1 tablespoon oil, and pour into the well. Stir in a circular motion with the fork slowly incorporating flour, and stir until a lumpy batter forms. Over medium-high heat, heat 2 inches of oil in a 5 to 6-quart heavy pot to 375 degrees F. Line a cookie plate with paper towels. Working in batches of 3, dredge the apple rings in the remaining 1/2 cup flour, shaking off excess, and then dip in the batter to coat, letting the excess drip off, and fry, gently turning over once with a slotted spoon, until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes total per batch. Lay the beignets on the plate and allow the paper towel to absorb excess oil. Transfer to a cookie sheet and keep warm in the oven. Return the oil to 375 degrees F between batches. Just before serving, dust the warm beignets with confectioners&#39; sugar. Make sure the Butter Bourbon Dipping Sauce is warm, and serve on the side. In a large, heavy skillet, heat the sugar over medium heat, stirring with a fork until it begins to melt. Once it is melting, stop stirring and cook, swirling the skillet occasionally so the sugar melts evenly. Cook until it is dark amber in color, and then remove from the heat. Put an oven mitt on the hand you will be using to stir in the ingredients and stand back to avoid splattering. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the butter, water, bourbon, vinegar, and salt and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until caramel has dissolved.

Have rack 1 rung up from center in oven. Gather your ingredients. Lightly flour work surface and roll out dough a bit; cut into 4 to 6 portions (I cut rectangles to keep it easy and based on how many people I&#39;m feeding). Cut a small hole in center of each piece of dough with a 1-inch round or heart shaped cookie cutter, or freehand cut some slits or designs with tip of sharp small knife. Using a fork, beat an egg in a small dish with a splash of water. Line a baking sheet with a sheet of parchment and arrange dough pieces. Brush dough with egg wash and bake until puffed and golden, 20 to 22 minutes. Peel and chop the onion and potato. Halve the celery and carrot lengthwise and chop. Halve the leek, trim top tough greens and roots and run under cold water while fanning the leek to release grit. Shake the leek of excess water and thinly slice. Peel and slice planks off the apple around the core, then stack and dice 1/4 inch. Heat a Dutch oven or large deep skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Melt butter and when it foams add the onion, potato, celery, leek, apple, bay and herb bundle and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cook to soften, 8 to 10 minutes, partially covered and stirring occasionally. Add flour and stir a minute. Add stock and whisk in to thicken a bit. Separate the chicken from the bones and skin and pull meat. Add to sauce to reheat. Remove bay and herbs. Remove chicken from heat and stir in Dijon mustard, cream and lemon juice.

Chocolate-and-berry-flavored marshmallows are delectable-even addictive-and these surprisingly easy candies make a great gift or special treat. Line an 8-inch-square baking dish with wax paper, allowing it to overhang two opposing sides by about 1 inch. Thoroughly coat the paper with cooking spray; the marshmallow will stick to any uncoated areas. Sprinkle gelatin over juice concentrate in a small bowl; let stand, stirring once or twice, until the gelatin softens, about 6 minutes. Stir together sugar, corn syrup, water and salt in a 3- to 4-quart saucepan. Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Then increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a full boil, stirring. Stir in the gelatin mixture and vanilla and return to a boil, stirring. Boil for 1 minute more. Remove from the heat and continue stirring until the gelatin completely dissolves. Pour the mixture into a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer (using a whisk attachment if possible), gradually raising the mixer speed from low to high, until the mixture is thickened, lightened in color and greatly increased in volume, 5 to 7 minutes. (It&#39;s better to overbeat than underbeat.) Beat in food color (if using). Scrape the marshmallow into the prepared dish, using a rubber spatula coated with cooking spray. Spread evenly to the edges. Thoroughly coat a second sheet of wax paper with cooking spray and pat it down on the marshmallow surface. Set aside until the mixture cools and firms up, about 4 hours. Transfer to the freezer for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours before cutting. To cut the marshmallows, sift about a third of the confectioners&#39; sugar onto a large clean cutting board. Peel off the top sheet of wax paper, then invert the chilled slab onto the sugar. Remove the pan and peel off the second sheet of wax paper. Sift about a third of the remaining sugar over the top. Using a large, sharp, lightly oiled knife, trim off the uneven edges all around. Mark, then evenly cut the slab lengthwise and crosswise into eighths to make 64 squares. Generously dust all the cut surfaces of the marshmallows with more sugar to keep them from sticking together. Clean off and re-oil the knife as needed. Cover and return the marshmallows to the freezer until chilled, about 45 minutes. To dip the marshmallows, line 2 baking sheets or trays with nonstick foil (or coat regular foil with cooking spray). Place chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. (Alternatively, see \\No Microwave?\\ below.) Microwave on High for 1 minute. Stir well, then continue microwaving on Medium, stirring every 30 seconds, until mostly melted. Stir until the remaining chocolate melts completely. If the chocolate seems a little thick for dipping the marshmallows, stir in oil 1 teaspoon at a time until smooth; microwave on Medium for 15 seconds, then stir again. Working with a batch of about 15 marshmallows (keep the remainder in the freezer), submerge them one at a time in the chocolate and use a large dinner fork to turn and coat completely. Lift the marshmallow out with the fork, tapping it against the side of the bowl several times and scraping it against the edge to remove as much excess chocolate as possible. Stir the bowl of chocolate occasionally to keep it blended. If it cools and stiffens at any point, microwave on Medium for 10 seconds, stir well and continue dipping. Place dipped marshmallows on the prepared pan, pushing them off the fork with the tines of another fork if needed. If a pool of chocolate forms around the base of the marshmallows, tap off more excess chocolate as subsequent candies are dipped. Refrigerate the dipped marshmallows until the chocolate is thoroughly chilled and firm, at least 1 hour. Gently pry the marshmallows from the foil with a table knife (fingertips will mar the surface). If desired, trim off the uneven edges around the bottom of the marshmallows with a paring knife. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve. Serve chilled or let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes before serving.

Pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse 12 to 15 times, or until the butter is the size of peas. With the motor running, add the ice water all at once through the feed tube. Keep hitting the pulse button to combine, but stop the machine just before the dough becomes a solid mass. Turn the dough onto a well-floured board and form into a disk. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Flour a rolling pin and roll the pastry into an 11-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Transfer it to a baking sheet. For the filling, peel, core, and cut the apples into 8ths. Cut each wedge into 3 chunks. Toss the chunks with the orange zest. Cover the tart dough with the apple chunks leaving a 1 1/2-inch border. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and allspice in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade.

Stir the ham and cheese together in another small bowl. Heat a Japanese rectangular omelet pan over medium heat until hot. Brush with little bit of oil. Add just enough of the egg mixture to coat the bottom of the pan when tilted. Let the egg cook until just set on the bottom, then use chopsticks or a rubber spatula to roll the sheet of egg into a log shape and push it to the far end of the pan. Brush the pan with more oil and again add just enough egg to coat the bottom when tilted, this time lifting up the rolled egg so that the raw egg flows underneath it. (If the egg is browning or setting too quickly, control the heat by lifting the pan off the burner for a moment.) When the underside is just set, roll the log towards the handle of the pan, then push the log back to the far end. Repeat; when you have made 3 layers, make another layer in the same manner and add half the ham and cheese. Make another layer, using the rest of the ham and cheese. Finish making the omelet in the same manner with the remaining egg. Turn the omelet out onto a plate, sprinkle with chives and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 52320,&quot;Beef-Mushroom Burgers 2 large portobello mushrooms, stems removed and gills scraped out, quartered 12 ounces extra-lean ground beef sirloin 1 clove garlic, grated 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 4 slices light Swiss cheese (about 2 ounces) 1 14-ounce package frozen edamame pods 4 whole-wheat English muffins, split Ketchup, lettuce, sliced red onion and/or sliced pickles, for topping Instructions: Pulse the mushrooms in a food processor until finely chopped.

Place the beans in a pot or jar large enough to cover them with water by at least 3 inches. Leave the beans in a cool place or in the refrigerator overnight to rehydrate. The next day, strain the beans through a colander (discard the water). Add the beans to a medium saucepan with enough water to cover by at least 2 inches, about from the tip of your finger to your knuckle. Turn the heat to medium-high, bring the liquid to a boil, then return to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally and skimming off any foam that rises to the top, until the beans are tender, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Add additional water when necessary to keep the beans submerged. When the beans are done, turn off the heat, add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and stir to incorporate; set aside. Put the salt pork in a medium pot over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until crispy, about 12 minutes. Remove the salt pork and discard. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat. Add the tomato paste to the pot, and cook until it darkens, about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups of the cooking water from the beans, and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain the beans, add them to the pot and cook just long enough to heat them through, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a rolling boil, and cook the pasta according to the package directions for al dente. Add as many pasta shapes as you wish, as long as their cooking times are within 2 minutes of one another (according to the package directions). Drain, reserving 2 cups of the cooking water.

Toast, swirling the pan frequently, until fragrant. Remove from the pan and set aside. Then, add the ancho, guajillo and pasilla chiles (you may have to work in batches depending on the size of the pan) in an even layer and toast on all sides, continuing to move the pan frequently, until fragrant, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove from the pan and set aside. To the carafe of a spice grinder, add the toasted fennel and cumin seeds and pulse until a fine powder is formed. Remove and set aside. Meanwhile, heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush lightly with olive oil. Grill the tortillas, tomatoes, tomatillos, garlic, jalapeno and onion in batches until charred with grill marks on all sides, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the carafe of a bender. To the blender, add the chicken stock, peanuts, almonds, chipotle in adobo and 1 tablespoon of the fennel-cumin mixture and blend until smooth. Transfer to a medium saucepot over medium heat. Add the brown sugar, chocolate, bay leaf and toasted cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Cook for at least 30 minutes, but longer is always better, so up to 2 hours. Adjust the consistency with more chicken broth if the mixture is too thick. For the corn and tomato rice: Coat a small saucepot with olive oil and turn the heat to medium. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, rice, tomatoes and bay leaf and season with a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove the cover, fluff the rice and stir in the corn and cilantro. Meanwhile, season the pork chops with the remaining fennel-cumin mixture and some salt. Heat the large cast-iron pan used to toast the spices over medium-high heat and coat generously with olive oil. Sear the chops on all sides until brown (brown food tastes good!), about 6 minutes per side. Cook to medium, until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F or to desired doneness.

Peel, core and slice the apples, then peel, core and grate the quince. Fill a pie pan with the fruit, sprinkling sugar over each layer, and mounding it up toward the center of the pan. Pour the water into the pan to come halfway up to the fruit. Roll out the dough. Cut off a thin strip and attach it to the rim of the pan, brushing the rim with water first. Brush the strip with water and cover the pan with the sheet of dough, cutting off all the overhanging bits. Crimp the edges, brush the top with eggwash, and strew over the demerara sugar. Bake for 20 minutes before turning the temperature down to 375 degrees F and cooking for a further 20 minutes. Eat warm or hot with heavy cream. Use approximately twice the weight of all purpose flour (preferably organic) to unsalted butter. Some recipes call for half butter, half lard. Sift the flour and a pinch of sea salt into a food processor, then cut the cold butter into small pieces on top of it. I process it for 20 to 30 seconds, then add ice-cold water through the top, a tablespoon at a time, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes should be enough for about 10 ounces of dough, with the machine running. If the paste is still in crumbly little bits after 1 or 2 minutes, add a tablespoon more water, but remember, the more water you use, the more the crust will shrink if you bake it blind. One solution is to use a bit of cream or egg yolk instead of water. The moment the dough has cohered into a single ball, stop, remove it, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. If you&#39;re making pastry dough by hand, sift the flour into a large bowl with the salt, add the chopped butter, and work as briskly as you can to rub the fat into the flour. Use the tip of your fingers only, rather like running grains of hot sand through your fingers. Add the water bit by bit as above; wrap and chill the dough. If you&#39;re making a double-crust pie, divide the dough into roughly 2/3 and 1/3. Then scatter a bit of flour on your work surface, roll your rolling pin in it, dust the palms of your hands, and start rolling. Always roll away from yourself, turning the dough as you go, and keep the rolling pin and work surface floured to prevent sticking. Preheat the oven to 375 to 400 degrees F. Line your greased pie pan with dough. Never stretch it; it will stretch back. Try to leave at least 30 minutes for the unbaked dough to commune with the inside of your fridge. Or put it in the night before you need it. Tear off a piece of waxed paper a little larger than the pie pan and place it over the dough. Cover the paper with a layer of dried beans; the idea is to prevent the pastry from rising up in the oven. When the dough is nearly cooked (the timing depends on the rest of the recipe), remove the paper and beans and prick the bottom of the pie shell to let out trapped air that would otherwise bubble up. Return the tart to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes to dry the bottom. Brushing the partly baked pie shell with a light coating of beaten egg or egg white ensure a crisp finished tart. Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Rub in 2 tablespoons of the butter, as for shortcrust pastry dough, or use a food processor. Mix in the water and then gently knead the dough on a floured surface, preferably marble. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Keep the rest of the butter out so that it softens, then flatten it into a rectangle 1 inch thick. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into the same size as the butter. Place the butter in the center of the pastry and then fold over the top and bottom of the dough to cover the butter. With the rolling pie, press down on the edges to seal in the butter, then give the dough a quarter turn clockwise. Now roll the dough out so that it returns to it&#39;s original length. Fold over the ends again, press them together with the rolling pin, and give a further quarter turn clockwise. Repeat the process once more, then rest the dough in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, remembering which way it is facing. Repeat the rolling and turning process twice more, then refrigerate for a final 30 minutes before using or freezing. If the dough gets warm and buttery at any stage during the process, put it in the fridge to chill. If you prefer not to make your own, you can buy ready-made puff pastry, but try to find the very best available. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52336,&quot;Strawberry Blackberry Summer Trifle 5 cups strawberries (about 2 pounds) 3 cups blackberries (about 10 ounces) 3/4 cup sugar 2 cups whipping cream, chilled 1/3 cup elderflower syrup or lychee syrup 1 prepared angel food cake Instructions:</p><ol><li>Reserve a handful of whole strawberries and blackberries to top the cake.</li><li>Hull and halve all but reserved strawberries; toss them with sugar in a medium bowl.

Toss in the garlic clove, crushed red pepper, bacon, and a couple drops of olive oil. Bring the pan to a medium heat. When the garlic is golden and very aromatic, remove it and discard. When the bacon has become crispy, toss in the Swiss chard stems, half of the chicken stock, and season with salt. When the chicken stock has reduced, toss in the Swiss chard leaves and season with salt. Cook the leaves until they are just wilted, about 3 to 4 minutes. Coat another saute pan with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Pat the halibut fillet dry with a paper towel and season with salt. When the oil in the pan is very hot but not yet smoking, place the fish flesh side down and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. As the fish cooks it will turn from translucent to opaque. Turn the fish over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. When the fish is done it should be golden and firm but still moist. Place the Swiss chard in the center of the serving plate. Lay the fish directly on top. Top the fish with the Salsa Cruda. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Season generously with salt. Taste to make sure it is delicious. Adjust seasonings if needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 52341,&quot;Strathearn Roasted Chicken 1/2 cup honey 1/2 cup kosher salt 2 bay leaves 2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed 2 sprigs fresh thyme 3 cups ice cubes One 4- to 5-pound chicken, cut into 10 pieces, backbone removed 1/4 cup honey 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar Juice of 1 orange 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound assorted fancy mushrooms (e.g. cremini, oyster, shiitake, king trumpet) 1 tablespoon thinly sliced garlic 1 tablespoon finely minced shallot Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth Truffle oil, for drizzling 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> For the chicken brine: Combine 1 cup water, the honey, salt, bay leaves, garlic and thyme in a large saucepot.

Blanch the tomatoes for 5 seconds, then dip them into ice water until cold. Peel, cut in half crosswise, and squeeze out the seeds. Finely chop the tomatoes and set them aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan over mediumhigh heat. Add the garlic and shallots, lower the heat slightly, and saute until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the thyme and rosemary. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Lower the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes. Take out the thyme and simmer until the mixture is thick, about 8 minutes longer. (The confit can be made up to 3 days ahead. Store in the refrigerator in an airtight container.) For the pastry, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lay 1 sheet of phyllo dough on a work surface, keeping the rest covered with a damp cloth until needed. Brush with melted butter and top with another sheet of phyllo. Repeat until all of the phyllo and butter are used. Using the ring as a guide, cut out 6 circles of phyllo, discarding the scraps. Line a large baking sheet With parchment paper and put the phyllo circles on the pan (or bake in 2 batches if necessary to fit). Cover with another sheet of parchment, pressing the paper into the phyllo. Bake until the pastry is well browned, about 12 minutes. Set aside. To make the shrimp, use the ring as a guide to cut out 12 circles of parchment paper. Brush 6 of these with butter. Put the ring over 1 of the buttered rounds, as a guide to keep the shrimp in an even circle. Arrange the shrimp halves in a radial pattern on top of the parchment, cut side up, as close together as possible so they completely cover the paper. Repeat with the remaining shrimp, covering the 6 buttered papers. Place the shrimp rounds on a baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to use. (The recipe can be made to this point early on the day you plan to serve.) To serve preheat oven to 550 degrees. Pull the top sheet of parchment off the shrimp. Season with salt and pepper. Spread each phyllo round with 3 tablespoons of tomato confit. Work quickly from this point on or the pastry will get soggy. Invert the shrimp rounds over the phyllo so the edges line up perfectly. Pull off the parchment. Season the top of the shrimp with salt and pepper and sprinkle very lightly with cayenne. Scatter the saffron and thyme over the shrimp and drizzle each pizza with 1 teaspoon of oil. Put on a baking sheet (or divide between 2) and bake until the shrimp turn pink, about 5 minutes. Scatter the basil over the pizzas and drizzle another 1/2 teaspoon of oil over each one.

Mix the oxtail meat with the cabbage mixture in a bowl. Season with the mirin, soy sauce, salt and pepper. (Mirin adds sweetness, soy sauce adds umami and salinity, black pepper adds floral heat, and salt is, well, salt. It&#39;s totally fine to taste as you go because the meat is already cooked.) Once mixed, add a small portion (about 1 tablespoon) of the mixture to the middle of a gyoza wrapper and seal with a wet finger, creating the classic gyoza creases as you seal with your fingers. Repeat the process until you&#39;ve used up all the mixture. For the sauce: Combine the vinegar, soy sauce, sriracha, sesame oil and xanthan gum in a blender and blend at high speed. Add 1 tablespoon oil to a large, high-sided saute pan over medium-high heat. Gently add the gyoza to the pan in an upright position and cook until the bottoms are crispy and browned, about 5 minutes. Add 2 ounces water to the pan, then cover and continue to cook until the wrapper is tender, about 5 more minutes. Serve with the sauce.

Process for about 30 seconds, then remove cover. Dough should be in a well-defined, barely sticky, easy-to-handle ball. If it is too dry, add warm water a tablespoon at a time and process for 5 to 10 seconds after each addition. If it is too wet, which is unlikely, add a tablespoon or two of flour and process briefly. With floured hands, shape dough into a ball, cover with plastic and let rest for at least 30 minutes. (At this point, you may wrap dough tightly in plastic and refrigerate it for up to a day; bring to room temperature before proceeding.) When ready to grill, pinch off a piece of dough and roll as thin as is practical. Dust lightly with flour to keep from sticking and cover with plastic or a damp cloth while you roll out remaining dough. (It is okay to overlap them a bit, but do not stack them.) Or just roll as you grill. Grill chapatis until they start to blister, char and puff up a bit, about a minute or so. Turn and repeat. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 52384,&quot;Fresh Fruit Coffeecake 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) softened unsalted butter, plus more for pan 3 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 3/4 teaspoon salt 2 cups ripe fruit (such as whole berries, or fruit cut into 1/2-inch pieces) 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup light brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups buttermilk Edible flowers and powdered sugar, for garnish (optional) Instructions: Arrange the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Blend in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until smooth paste is formed. Add the 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Spread the paste evenly over the skirt steaks, making sure that all sides are painted. Marinate the steaks and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. Place the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a very large, heavy saucepan or heavy dutch oven. Over medium high heat, add the minced onion and the chopped green pepper. Saute for about 5 minutes, stirring, or until the onions and peppers are just starting to brown. Turn heat to low. Add the ground cumin and stir well. Saute for 1 minute. Turn heat to high and add the black turtle beans. Stir well. Add 3 cups of water and bring to the boil as quickly as possible. Reduce heat to a very slow simmer and cook, partially covered, until the black beans are just tender. This will take no more than an hour and 15 minutes. Strain the beans, reserving both the beans and the bean stock. Season the bean stock with salt and pepper; you should have about 1 cup. When ready to serve, prepare a hot charcoal fire. Place the skirt steaks on the fire and cook, turning once, until crusty on the outside, rare on the inside (about 6 minutes). Alternatively, you could sear the steaks in a heavy, cast-iron skillet that has been heated for 10 minutes over very high heat. When steaks are done, using a very sharp knife, cut each steak horizontally, leaving the steaks attached along one long side (this is like butterflying them). Stuff the steaks: Lay out 2 tablespoons of finely chopped parsley along one flap of each steak. Pit and halve the olives and lay out 4 olives over the parsley on each steak. Sprinkle with the dried oregano. Finally, divide the shredded lettuce among the four steaks, placing the shreds over the olives and parsley. Cover the stuffing with the upper flap of skirt steak. With a cheese cutter, cut the Monterey Jack into 24 thin strips, each one about 1 1/2\\ by 4. Overlap 6 slices of the cheese over each stuffed skirt steak, placing the long side of the cheese perpendicular to the long side of the steak. Place each steak on an oven-proof dinner plate and place the plates under a broiler for about 30 seconds, or until the cheese has melted. Finish the sauce: In a clean saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring, until the roux has begun to darken. Add 1 cup of the reserved bean stock, stirring well to blend. Bring to the boil and add 2 tablespoons of the reserved black beans (serve the rest of the beans as a side dish, or reserve for another use). Season well with salt and pepper. Divide the sauce among the four dinner plates; each plate should have sauce on two sides of the steak. Garnish the melted cheese and the sauce with a little finely chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 52396,&quot;My Cornbread 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 cups yellow cornmeal 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup sugar 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 2 cups buttermilk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Let it sit until it becomes foamy on top, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl or the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix together the flour, salt and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the oil and eggs. When the yeast is foamy, add it to the dry mixture immediately followed by the egg mixture and stir to combine. Knead, either by hand on a floured surface or with a dough hook, adding more flour as necessary (but resist any urge to add too much!), until you have a smooth and slightly sticky dough, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature until it has doubled in size, about 2 hours. For the filling: In a medium bowl, mix together the granulated sugar and butter with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until combined. Mix in the salt and egg white (reserve the egg yolk for the egg wash), and then add the vanilla extract. Stir in the pecan flour. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. When the dough has risen, turn it out onto a clean surface (dust with a little flour if it&#39;s too sticky) and divide into 14 balls. Fill each ball with a heaping tablespoon of filling and seal well to shut. Place the balls seam-side down on the lined baking sheets, spaced evenly apart. Let rise for 30 more minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl, beat the reserved egg yolk with a splash of water. Working with 3 rolls at a time, brush the egg wash onto the rolls, use scissors to make two 1/2-inch cuts for ears and use tweezers to stick on 2 black sesame seeds for eyes. (If you wait too long after brushing on the egg wash, it will dry and the sesame seeds won&#39;t stick; that&#39;s why you want to work with no more than 3 rolls at a time.) Bake until golden brown; begin checking for doneness at 20 minutes. For the glaze: In a small bowl, mix together the powdered sugar, almond extract and 5 teaspoons milk. If it&#39;s too thick to spread, add additional milk, a couple of drops at a time, until it&#39;s spreadable. Working one at a time, spread a circle of glaze onto the rolls and then top with overlapping rows of slivered almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52402,&quot;Turkey Burgers with Brie and Grilled Apples 2 pounds freshly ground turkey Four 1-inch cubes of Brie cheese, 1/2-inch thick 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper Salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 11 large granny smith apple, cored and sliced 1/2-inch thick crosswise<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil Four rolls Instructions: To prepare the burgers:<br> Shape the meat firmly into 4 round uniform patties about 1 1/2inches thick. Make a small indentation in the center of each patty and place 1 cube of the cheese in each. Knead the meat slightly to cover the hole. Brush both sides of the burgers lightly with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Cook the burgers to your liking. Brush the apples on both sides with the vegetable oil. Grill (in a grill pan) until golden on both sides. Place a burger on the bottom of each roll, top with 1 or 2 apple slices and a dollop of ketchup &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52403,&quot;Whole Red Snapper Baked in Salt 1 (4 pound) red snapper, scaled, gutted, and gills removed 4 or more egg whites 1/2 cup cold water 6 to 7 pounds coarse sea salt or kosher salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Rinse and dry the fish thoroughly. Whisk together the egg whites and water and combine with the salt in a large mixing bowl. Work the mixture with your hands to distribute the water and egg whites in the salt. The salt mixture should hold together when you press a mound of it together between the palms of your hands. If it doesn&#39;t, work in another egg white. Fill a baking dish that is 2 inches longer than the fish about 1/3 full of the salt mixture. Place the fish on top. Cover the fish with the rest of the salt mixture and smooth the salt over with a spatula. Place the fish in the oven for about 40 minutes. The only way to know whether the fish is done is by inserting an instant-read thermometer through the layer of salt and measuring the temperature of the fish. When it reaches 135 degrees F, take it out, and serve immediately. Bring the fish to the table on a baking sheet or on a large platter and crack it with a mallet or even a hammer. Pull back the salt layer, then peel off the skin with a fork. Serve on hot plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52404,&quot;Artichoke and Fennel Crudo 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice (1 large lemon)<br> 1 1/2 cups baby arugula<br> 5 baby artichokes, trimmed and thinly sliced<br> 1 bulb fennel, thinly sliced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup shaved Parmesan Instructions: Whisk together the olive oil and lemon juice in a small bowl.

Place the bowl on a pan of barely simmering water, making a double boiler. Whisk the mixture constantly until the mixture becomes foamy and then creamy, doubling in size, about 5 minutes. The mixture should be uncomfortably warm to the touch, but not burning. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a small mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes, and set aside. In a medium bowl, mix the Mock Mascarpone cheese with the egg mixture using medium speed until well blended. Fold in the whipped cream. Pour the coffee into a wide bowl; briefly dip 3 slices of the pound cake into the coffee, about 3 seconds each side. Transfer to a 6 to 8-ounce parfait glass to create the first layer. Top the slices of cake with a few spoonfuls of the cream filling mixture. Repeat the process with another 3 slices of cake and top with more filling mixture. Repeat the process for the remaining parfait glasses. Dust each dessert with the cocoa. Refrigerate for a couple of hours before serving. In a small bowl, cream together the cream cheese, yogurt and vanilla extract with a mixer until well blended. Refrigerate if a firmer texture is desired. Use in recipes as an inexpensive alternative to mascarpone. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 52408,&quot;Cognac Cream 3 cups milk 10 extra-large egg yolks, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 4 tablespoons sifted cornstarch 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon Cognac 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon heavy cream Instructions: Heat the milk in a medium stainless-steel saucepan over medium heat and bring almost to a boil. Remove from the heat. Beat the egg yolks and sugar on medium-high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, sprinkle on the cornstarch. Beat on medium-low speed until combined, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture back into the pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 7 minutes. (Pay attention because it will thicken and then quickly become scrambled eggs!) Immediately, pour the mixture through a fine sieve into a large bowl. Stir in the vanilla, Cognac, butter, and heavy cream. Place plastic wrap directly on the custard and refrigerate until cold. &quot;,&quot;[Champagne, Brut Ros, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 52409,&quot;Whole-Grain Caramel Apple Oven Pancake 3/4 cup whole milk 3 large eggs 3/4 cup whole-wheat pastry flour 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 medium sweet, crisp apples, such as Honeycrisp (about 1 pound), peeled, cored, quartered and cut into 1/2-inch chunks 3 tablespoons granulated sugar Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Blend the milk and eggs in a blender until thoroughly mixed. Add the flour, vanilla, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and lemon zest and blend again until combined, scraping down the sides if necessary, about 15 seconds. Cover the blender jar and refrigerate while cooking the apples. Melt the butter in a 10-inch nonstick oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the apples and sprinkle them with the granulated sugar. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the apples, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and softened, 20 to 25 minutes. Arrange the apples evenly in the skillet. Remix the batter to reincorporate the ingredients, then pour it over the apples. Bake the pancake until it is browned and set in the center and the sides have risen about 1 1/2 inches, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve directly from the skillet or use a large spatula to transfer the pancake to a plate. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52410,&quot;Milk Chocolate and Lemon Pot de Creme 2/3 cup sugar 3 lemons, zested 1 cup milk 3 cups cream 2 cups milk chocolate 10 egg yolks 1/3 cup lemon juice 4 lemons, zested Cold water, for blanching 1 cup water 2 cups sugar Milk chocolate, for garnish Instructions: To make the Pots de Creme: Preheat oven to 275 degrees F.

Make a small well in the center and then add 2 tablespoons oil and the water. Using the paddle attachment, mix on low until combined. Remove the dough to a flour-dusted work surface and knead for a few minutes until shiny and smooth. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Remove the dough from the bowl and gently punch it down. Coat a 10-inch cake pan with 3 tablespoons oil. Place the dough in the pan and poke it all over with your fingers. Cover again with plastic wrap and set aside in warm place until puffy, about 45 minutes. For the pizza: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spread the focaccia with the marinara sauce, then scatter with the meatballs. Tear the mozzarella slices and scatter them over the meatballs. Sprinkle with the Parmesan. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 5 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown and bubbling and the crust is golden. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 52430,&quot;Lemon Chiffon Cake with Strawberry Frosting 1 3/4 cups cake flour 1 1/3 cups superfine sugar<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil<br> 6 large eggs, separated, at room temperature 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 3/4 cup diced strawberries 2 7.5-ounce jars marshmallow cream 3 sticks unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the bottoms of three 8-inch round ungreased cake pans with parchment paper. Sift the flour, 1 cup superfine sugar, the baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Whisk the oil, 1/2 cup cold water, the egg yolks, lemon zest and 2 teaspoons lemon juice in a medium bowl until well combined. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the oil mixture; stir with a rubber spatula until smooth. Set aside. Beat the egg whites and the remaining 1 teaspoon lemon juice in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/3 cup superfine sugar; continue beating until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Fold about one-third of the beaten egg whites into the batter with a rubber spatula, then fold in the rest until just combined. Divide the batter among the prepared pans and smooth evenly. Bake until the centers spring back when gently pressed, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer the cakes to a rack and let cool completely in the pans. Meanwhile, make the frosting: Puree the strawberries in a food processor until smooth; strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids with a rubber spatula. Beat the marshmallow cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until smooth. Beat in the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated, then beat in the strawberry puree. Reduce the mixer speed to low; gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until combined. Assemble the cake: Run a knife around the edges of the cakes and invert onto the rack; remove the parchment. Put 1 cake layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread with about 1/3 cup frosting. Top with another cake layer; spread with another 1/3 cup frosting. Top with the remaining cake layer, then cover the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</li></ol><p>&quot; 52431,&quot;Halloumi Kabobs 1 pound halloumi cheese, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 green bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 large red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces 8 button mushrooms 8 grape tomatoes Nonstick cooking spray Chive oil, recipe follows 1 cup canola oil 2 ounces chopped fresh chives Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat grill to medium.<br> For each skewer, assemble alternating pieces of cheese, bell peppers and red onion, ending with a mushroom and grape tomato on the end.
