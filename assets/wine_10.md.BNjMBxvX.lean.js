Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom.

It's all primary fruit vs. oak now, with unintegrated blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors fighting it out with smoky caramelized wood and vanilla. Tannins lurk in the background, ready to embrace both sides.

A marvelous wine, dense, detailed and seductive.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Big and powerful, but nuanced despite its size. It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices.

Deep down inside is a molten core of ripe blackberries and black currants, with lots of new, smoky oak. Seems to be your classically ageable Napa red. Give it until at least 2013, and it could surprise and delight for many years beyond.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Profoundly rich, offering massive blackberry, currant, chocolate, bacon and spice flavors that are liberally oaked. A fine structure provides needed balance, with strong, finely ground tannins and brisk acidity cleansing the palate.

Nonetheless it's quite a good wine. Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A beautiful, fancy Sauvignon Blanc, crisp and dry and complex. If you're looking for a California white to drink with a perfect roast chicken, it's a fine choice. Shows ripe, lush citrus, tropical fruit, peach, mineral and white flower flavors, finished with dusty cinnamon spices.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is quite a nobly structured Pinot Noir. It's tempting to describe it as thin, because it trades opulence for dryness and a certain spicy minerality. But that would seriously underestimate its considerable appeal, not to mention the subtle hints of wild cherries and raspberries. The more you sip, the more you like it. At this price, a terrific value.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Jewell threads the needle where so many others fail with this dry, elegant Sauvignon Blanc.

Really a brilliant wine, among the best of its class.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This single-vineyard blend's flavors run through all the berries right into dense cassis. It gathers more strength as it rolls through the midpalate, layering in earth and black cherries, with char and toast more noticeable than in the other Tamarack reds.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a unique Pinot Noir, different from almost everything else out there. Sourced from a vineyard in the Petaluma Gap region (perhaps a future AVA), it's bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and tannic. It has lighter, leaner flavors than most Pinots, with the fruit accompanied by herbs, minerals, flowers and mushrooms. Fans of super-fruity Pinots will find it unrich, but Burgundy lovers may think of Pommard. It will be fascinating to track this wine's progress.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Super sweet, with vanilla honey, apricot preserves, tangerine tart and vanilla cream flavors. What's not to like? Best of all is crisp, tart acidity, like a squeeze of lemon, that brightens and heightens the richness and makes it finish clean.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Opulence, lushness and a silky, seductive texture are what you expect from Pinot Noir, and this one delivers them all.

Easy to drink from the get-go, and gets more interesting as it warms in the glass.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is only the third time the Chapter wine has been made since it debuted in 2002. It's a selection of the five or 10 best barrelsessentially the J. Bookwalter reserve.

It's drinking well right now but should hold for up to a decade.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a reserve-style wine crafted from lots sourced from some of the winery's Napa mountain properties. It's not showing all that well now, due to hard, jagged tannins. Yet there are promising signs. The oak already is marrying the fruit, resulting in a seamless, smoky sweetness, and the tannins are entirely ripe. Should develop well over the next 6C8 years, possibly longer.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Very ripe and extracted, almost jammy, with primary fruit flavors of blackberries, black cherries, red plums, currants, dark chocolate and spices. Delicious and noble, but kind of immature. Give it 4C6 years to soften and integrate, and it could develop even longer.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This 100% Cabernet, from the iconic Klipsun vineyard, has been sourced from the original 1989 planting since the first crop, making Seven Hills Klipsun's longest standing customer. This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Grown in the very cool central-southwestern part of the appellation, by Sebastopol, this Pinot features crisp, mouthwatering acidity.

Right from the first take it has an elevated sense of being. The nose is rich, warm and deeply fruited, with balsam wood and lemony notes.

Drink now through 2016.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.","province":"California"},{"country":"nz","description":"Plummy and dark, with accents of cedar, dark chocolate and hints of coffee.

Strikes you immediately as lush and important, with a fine structure framing ripe flavors of blackberries, black cherries, currants, anise, dark chocolate and sandalwood.

It's bone dry and rich in blackberry and cedar flavors, with overtones of mocha, anise and toast, and is very tannic.

This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off.

But the fruit is the main story, and it's full, ripe and substantialcherry and cassis, licorice and just a hint of leaf.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak. Acidity is quite high, and plays a role in the way it tingles and cleanses the mouth. There's a fresh, jammy quality that makes the wine taste younger than its almost three years. Should develop in the bottle through 2013.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The oak sticks out with vanilla custard, brown sugar and buttered toast notes that currently dominate the underlying pineapple, white peach and green apple fruit flavors. Acidity is crisp and fine. This Chardonnay could benefit from a few years in the cellar.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A very fine Chardonnay, not just because it's so ripe and fruity, but more importantly because the underlying structure is so fine.

Only the young, tough tannins need to be resolved. Best in 2011C13.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a young, vigorous Cabernet Sauvignon. It's tannic, in the way of Spring Mountain, and very tightly wound, with a central core of black currants and minerals.

Drink now-2025.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Impresses for the sheer power of ripeness, but also and especially for the structure. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa, herbs and sweetly smoked oak are beautiful and complex, yet the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. This single-vineyard wine is one of the finest Sonoma County Cabernets of the vintage. Should age effortlessly through 2014, growing purer and more elegant.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Beautiful from start to finish, but tannic, and not drinkable now, in the classic sense. The tannins are hard, and while they're very finely ground, they prevent the palate from full appreciation of the lush blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate and herbs. Give this 100% Cabernet at least five years to begin to mellow.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Here's an impressive new name in Barolo. Mauro Molino first bottled in 1985 and has shown consistent results that seem to have hit a high point this vintage. Fruit is harvested from the Vigna Conca cru, resulting in elegant and refined pulses of wild berries, cola and white almond. The wine is delicate and feminine, but delivers a blast of power and persistency on the close.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"US","description":"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it concentrated. It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice.

Drink from late 2010 thru 2014.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish.

Drink now and for a few years.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"The Sagrantino grape from Umbria makes a uniquely distinguished wine and Goretti's Le Mura Saracene is one of the best examples of this beautiful variety available in the U.S. The wine opens with a bright, saturated color and delivers gorgeous notes of spice, from Indian curry to nutmeg and clove, for deep penetration and personality. Red fruit at the core is left intact, but this is also a very modern rendition with layers of vanilla and roasted nut derived from long oak aging.","province":"Central it"},{"country":"US","description":"This is exceptionally concentrated, a dense collage of berry and cassis fruits, sap and spice, from excellent Lewis vineyard fruit. There's plenty of acid, giving it unusual focus; the wine is detailed and sharp, and it drills down through its flavors rather than spreading them out broadly. Some dill notes arrive in the finish; just a hint that adds some texture and detail.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure.

The York Mountain AVA is in a cooler, hilly part of western Paso Robles, wide open to Pacific influence, and you can taste the salty sea breeze in the crisp acidity and fine tannins, not to mention the white pepper flavors that give a piquant spiciness to the blackberries and mocha. Drink this fine young Syrah now, or hold for up to six years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This outstanding Walla Walla boutique has established a track record for consistent improvement, and the white wines are best of show. Once again this 2006 blend is smooth, round and richly endowed with mixed stone fruits.

Fine now, and should do interesting things for a decade.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This new, limited release red blend is what winery owners Myles Anderson and Gordy Venneri called their version of a super Tuscan. It's half old-vine Cabernet Sauvignon from the Sagemoor vineyard, and half Sangiovese. Somehow the two grapes soften each other, keeping the old vine detail and dried herbal character of the Cab, and mixing in plush and spicy red fruit with hints of mushroom and olive. Just 240 cases were made and the wine is sold exclusively at the winery.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Concentrated and textural, this puts bright fruit flavors of apple and pear up front, adding lush caramel from fermentation in Burgundy barrels.

The finish is like caramel-dipped apples.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"ar","description":"Cheval des Andes brings together Cheval Blanc from St.-Emilion with Terrazas de los Andes, and for the past few years it has been the leader in Bordeaux-style wines from ar.

The palate is structured, mildly tannic and layered with blackberry, cassis, raisin and licorice flavors. It's good now or will age nicely for another four to six years.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"fr","description":"The first vintage of this experimental, 7,000 vines per acre wine.

The wine has a strong mineral component.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"A classic Bordeaux blend.

It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is 100% Malbec, so inky it is black in color. The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins. A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced. It's the first varietal Malbec ever from Walla Walla Vintners, but certainly one hopes it is not the last.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Lots of folks will pop the cork on this Cab before its time, but that would be a shame.

Will really find its stride after 2012.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a big, extracted young Pinot Noir, superrich in the cherry, black raspberry, cola, pomegranate and licorice flavors that the vineyard so effortlessly produces.

It's a Cabernet-driven complement to the DeLille D2, replete with muscle and nerve. Dark and chewy, the wine has picked up a little Rh?ne-like savage-ness from the Mourvdre, especially in the aroma. The tannins are chewy and a bit leafy, and need some airing out, but there's plenty of meaty flavor here.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"A dramatically dark, ripe wine that's nowhere near ready to drink now, due to the tannins.

The mixed berries, red licorice, cherries, layers of butterscotch, toffee and caramel are beautifully integrated and linger seductively into the finish. It has some initial alcoholic heat, but the flavors compensate and go on and on. This is a wine that must be cellared another five or more years before it even begins to pull itself together.

It's also the most ageworthy. Fifty percent stem inclusion in the fermentation has given the wine a tannic, gritty earthiness and spiciness that throw a cloak over the underlying wine.

It embraces a bold, immediate style that is characterized by sweet cherry flavors.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"Tasted in May, this Grenache-based Rh?ne blend was still overwhelmingly vibrant and fresh in grapey, primary fruit raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors.

It shows the kind of elegance and grace one finds in Bordeaux, without intrusive barrel influences, and it's the kind of nose you want to bury your nose in. It wraps around you seductively, with an appealing shyness. The fruit and wood and earth flavors are seamless and interesting, as the wine leads you gently through a very long finish.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release. The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors.

Should evolve well beyond 2012.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Where Rusack's regular '06 Syrah is a delicious wine to drink now, this reserve-style bottling is considerably more tannic, as well as deeper-flavored.

The tannins are polished and firm and there's enough natural sweetness to make this a chewy and succulent wine, sip after sip.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around.

It does not require food to fill in what's missingnothing is missing!","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging.

Should negotiate the next 10 years with ease.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a nonvintage with bottle age, giving richness along with toast.

It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years.

Bollinger sees the unique heat of 2003 as a reason to make a special vintage for release early.

Drink now.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"Frazier breaks the triple-digit price barrier with this Cabernet. Like their regular '05, it's a very tannic wine, not suitable for drinking now or possibly anytime soon. But it's clearly powerful and concentrated in flavor, with a dense layering of cassis and freshly-crushed blackberries. Totally dry, but a little high in alcohol, it should reward cellaring over the next eight years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Perhaps because the winery's co-owner, Frank Ostini, is a restaurateur, he makes his wines in a forward, approachable style that doesn't require aging, although they're balanced enough for the cellar. The '06 Rio Vista is a fresh, silky wine whose smoky cherry and pepperspice flavors will soar with a grilled steak. Should hold nicely for six years.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"If this seems soft at first, that's the year.

However, there's a wealth of well-ripened cassis, bitter chocolate, cedar and anise flavors that are so powerful, the wine should easily ride out midterm aging. Give this Bordeaux blend a good 4 years in the cellar, and it should hold its own for years beyond that.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a really good Merlot from a producer that does a great job at it and has kept prices fair for years.

Try holding until 2010, and it should develop through 2015.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A very good Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend from Agustin Huneeus. While it would not be true to say it's a second wine of Quintessa, it does show the balance and integrity of that bottling, with a firm structure and dramatically layered black currant, mineral and cedar flavors. Will undoubtedly age. Best now through 2011, at least.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Less jammy and forward than the '04 Elevage, but more closed and tannic than the winery's regular 2005 Cabernet, this Bordeaux blend really needs time to show its stuff.

But for now, this is what a great ros should be.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"Winemaker Tim Stevens' dark, subtle, beautifully proportioned wines glide across the palate like Apollo Ono dancing with the stars.

Supple and sensuous, this is a wine to savor and, if possible, cellar for another decade.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is every bit the equal of, if not even a bit better than, the outstanding 2005 Novelty Hill Sauvignon Blanc.

It's an apritif style, its crispness giving a light character, the fruit floating over the acidity. There are lively green fruit flavors to finish.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"ar","description":"Kaiken Ultra has emerged as a consistent top-shelf Malbec. This vintage shows power, purity, mineral, ripe fruit and well-applied oak. It's a generous wine with kirsch and raspberry parfait flavors.

Unforced but a little forceful; good for those who like a ripe, meaty red wine.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"gr","description":"Oak treatment adds a caramel spice to the crisp, cirtic flavors of Roditis.

It will age for 20-plus years.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"au","description":"This stellar wine takes a little time in the glass to show its true class, but once it's properly aerated, the aromas go from rather vague and lifted to plummy and spice laden. In the mouth, it's rich, creamy-textured and lush, offering the flavors of plum pudding without the excessive weight that the words suggest, plus hints of grilled meat. Again, with airing, it gets even better, piling on more red fruit notes and turning more elegant. A great example of Shiraz, but how many people will be able to justify the $25/ounce expenditure?","province":"South au"},{"country":"es","description":"A great Priorat, plain and simple. And while we have always liked Les Eres from Joan Sim, this vintage is the best we've tried. The nose is beautiful: coffee, cola, schist, black fruit and herbs rise up.

Fragrant and complex, this offers pleasures for both nose and palate, with scents of leaf and spice and herb, leading into a surprisingly dense and textural blend of wild berry, rhubarb, melon and mixed tropical fruits. Fascinating and long, this is a fine example of Oregon Pinot at its most elegant and fascinating.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"fr","description":"A beautiful wine that floats its minerality, white flower aromas and white currant fruits over a foundation of toast.

Best after 2009.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a rare premier cru vineyard with its north-east exposure.

Cucumber and melon, apple and pear fruit is the base, which expands into wet stone and mineral, then butter cookie.

It shows a much more serious, austere side to Zweigelt, one which needs aging. The blueberry flavors and dark plum skins are one aspect, the other is the spice from wood aging. Keep for 2C3 years.","province":"Donauland"},{"country":"US","description":"Merlot is the star in this blend, named for Pomerol. Coffee and carob, tomato leaf and plum all mingle easily, washing the palate with lush, creamy tannins that finish soft. Drink nowC2010.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"The Goldberg is an 8-acre vineyard, which produces dense and concentrated fruit from old vines. The wine has ripe, juicy fruit, intense tannins and a strong mineral character from the terroir. Barrique aging has added spice and vanilla and some smokiness, but the wood does not dominate the powerful fruit flavors.","province":"Burgenland"},{"country":"it","description":"Tedeschi's base Amarone made with grapes from various vineyards is distinctive, unique and extremely succulent. The wine boasts chewy cherries, milky chocolate, natural rubber, raisin, pine, tar, maple syrup and black stone. In fact, there is no Amarone quite like it,  especially considering the immediate, incredibly intense rush of aromas that it offers.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"ar","description":"Cavas Weinert is an old-school Mendoza winery and it holds its wines longer than most, which is why this 2002 is just now a new release. Thank Weinert for the bottle age and give this wine plenty of air. What you'll get is earth, leather, complexity, depth and ample berry fruit and chocolate. Decant for best results.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"A dry, elegant Syrah. It starts with aromas of crushed black peppercorns, blackberries and oak, with a slightly animal, leathery note, then turns rich and soft in the mouth. Drink now, while the fruit is forward enough to balance the sticky tannins.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"A big, bold wine, now getting mature. Solidly full of ripe berry fruits, wood and soft tannins, it also has a complexity of other flavors: spice, thyme, smokiness. Impressive for its density and power.","province":"Thermenregion"},{"country":"it","description":"Although the wine lacks overall intensity, its measured, composed approach is very refreshing in this land of powerhouse wines. Dig deep and give it time to allow for sweet chocolate, black fruit, spice and cherry liquor. The wine is smooth, with chewy chocolate flavors, and excellent length.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"at","description":"This is the first vintage from vineyards the Pfaffl family bought in the northern suburbs of Vienna. Aged in wood, it is smooth, still young, with some good earthy characters along with round, red cherry flavors. There's a dollop of spice to help it along.","province":"Vienna"},{"country":"ar","description":"Chakana makes some good wines, and the pack is led by this prestige-level blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Bonarda. It's plenty racy and forward, with plum and berry flavors that ring the bell. Toward the end some oak-based vanilla enters the game to applause. A yummy, well-made wine.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"it","description":"Winemaker Romano Dal Forno fearlessly confronted the soggy 2002 vintage with high extraction techniques and barrique aging (36 months). This is an inky, dense wine (more syrupy than it is vinous) with black currant, peppermill, chocolate fudge and big firm wood tannins. It is so monolithic, a viable food match is virtually impossible. As always, Dal Forno straddles a fine line between brilliance and exaggeration.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"fr","description":"Damien Laureau is a new name in Savennires, taking over in 1999 from his uncle. As with all Savennires, this is dry, but the wood aging rounds out the fruit to give a superrich wine. Flavors of mango and pear jam go with the smooth vanilla of the wood. It feels sweet, but tastes dry. The acidity keeps the alcohol at bay.","province":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"at","description":"Since 1992, Hans and Kurt Feiler have produced what they call the 1000 Series, a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. This 2005 vintage follows the same theme, keeping close to a Bordeaux model, while adding extra sweetness and ripeness to the fruit. Wood aging helps soften the wine, but it is also a question of soft tannins and richness.","province":"Burgenland"},{"country":"at","description":"There's considerable richness in this broad, generous, velvet-  textured wine that brings out the red fruit and ripeness. The 18-months barrel aging have not dampened the fruit, but have certainly contributed to the power of this impressive wine.","province":"Thermenregion"},{"country":"fr","description":"The honey aromas from the dominant Chenin Blanc are enticing. The palate is fresh and soft, but rounded with melon and kiwi flavors. Delicious and full. Clos de la Briderie runs its vineyard biodynamically.","province":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"The blend in this Pauillac-inspired cuve is based on Cabernet Sauvignon, resulting in a wine that's slightly more structured than the others. Tobacco and cassis pick up hints of toffee and brown sugar on the finish. Drink nowC2015.","province":"California"},{"country":"at","description":"You can tell this is Gerald Malat's flagship red by the weight of the bottle. And, yes, it is a fine wine. The Cabernet structure and dry tannins are all here, as part of a firm, blackberry fruit-flavored wine, that shows some herbal character as well as wood. Age for 3 years.","province":"Kremstal"},{"country":"Canada","description":"A heady fragrance of strawberry, orange peel and red berries immediately entices, and the flavors that follow do not disappoint. The wine is elegant and flavorful, with a balanced amount of acidity and sweetness, and the mouthfeel is creamy as well as livelya tough balance to strike but one that is successfully achieved here.
