No mere fruit bomb, it's a meaty wine, in the sense of being chewy, but also in the aromas and flavors of both roasted and raw beef. That's not to mention the extraordinary blackberries and currants, dusted with a blast of freshly ground black pepper. First-class and unique.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This bottling is always quite good, but it excels in 2006.

Just erupts with the most intense cassis, chocolate and smoky new oak. Classic Howell Mountain structure, with dense, sweet young tannins and firm acidity.

Don't touch before 2011, and should provide enjoyment for many years after.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Bold and forward, this estate-grown Syrah fairly explodes with scents of game, cured meat and smoke.

Winemaker Enrique Tirado has crafted yet another pounding, saturated Cabernet. It's wonderfully meshed yet potent and fierce.

It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"The winery's reserve Chard has consistently been the best among their five Chards. The '05 is a dramatic wine, although oak-o-phobes might find it toothpicky. It is smoky and buttery and caramelly, but a year or so should knit that together with the ripe tropical fruits and make the wine seamlessly complex.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Morgan's Hat Trick Chardonnay, from his own vineyard, was a hit right out of the block. Now, so is his Pinot Noir. It's elaborately flavored, a fairly soft, full-bodied wine that's stuffed with pastry-filling cherries, blackberries, currants and raspberries, with exotic additions of kumquats, cola, red licorice and vanilla.

Basically a Bordeaux blend with a splash of Syrah, it's very dry and tannic. The creamy mouthfeel has flavors of blackberry marmalade, dark bitter chocolate, licorice and peppery spices. Complex and refined, it should hit its stride in a year or two. The longterm prospects are unpredictable but promising.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Rodney Strong's Symmetry is more tannic than their '05 Reserve Cab, and it also has more complex flavors from being a blend of all five Bordeaux varieties.

This 97% Sangiovese, with 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, is an impressive wine, and the best of Gargiulo's current releases.

It's tight, hard, compact with black fruits, smoke and chewy tannins. It's a wine that needs time to stretch its considerable muscles. The roughly 50/50 mix of new and once-used barrels adds baking chocolate, licorice and charred toast to the finish; well-integrated and buttressed with crisp acids. But the lingering flavor is of raspberry jam; so good you want to spread it directly on your tongue.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"US","description":"A very good wine from a new winery that specializes in the other Cabernet, Cab Franc.

Best now through 2010.","province":"California"},{"country":"de","description":"Almost tooth-achingly sweet, this nectar still retains an amazing level of fruit purity.

It excels in the mouth, thanks to its perfect balance of sugar and acidity.","province":"Sicily & Sardinia"},{"country":"US","description":"A captivating Chard that shows impeccable balance, and the price is very good for this level of quality. The fruit is brilliantly ripe in green apple, kiwi, Asian pear and lime flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak.

Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, but comprised of all 5 Bordeaux varieties.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Ripe and modern, with a bold color and no shortage of oak.

But such are the tannins and acids and overall balance, and the core of blackberries and cherries is so rich, that it should effortlessly negotiate the next decade.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This is obviously a beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows the pedigree and class you expect from a winery of Staglin's level, enormously rich in black currant, mocha and cedar flavors, with ripe, soft and complex tannins.

A beautiful, polished drink that should develop over the next eight years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A little brittle and tense now, with a young wine freshness.

Should gain in interest over the next six years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine seems to hark back to a time when Oregon really could lay claim to making Pinot Noirs that were truly Burgundian in style.

Consider this a run-scoring triple. It's totally dry, very acidic (officially, 7.13 g/L, for the statistically-minded) and austere, with a hard edge of minerals. What fruit there is suggests tart green apples and white nectarines. Believe me, you won't miss the oak.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"If you prefer your California Chards on the minerally side instead of the flamboyant, superripe style, try this one.

The nose is loaded with raspberry and cherry aromas, but there's also alcoholic heat reflective of its 14.8% alcohol.

Grown in a 5-acre Stags Leap District vineyard, it shows stunning levels of blackberry and chocolate fruit enhanced with waves of smoky oak.

From here, Philipponnat is able to produce powerful wines with toasty, ripe fruit, powered with yeast and flavors of hazelnuts and white fruits. While not as tense and without the aging potential of 1998, this is without doubt a great Champagne.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"Exceptionally fine. Effortlessly combines the impressive power and authority the vineyard is known for with sensual elegance. The flavors of currants, cherries, cola, balsam and clovespice are mouth-watering.

This is a wine that should continue to evolve nicely in bottle for up to a decade.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the winery's first (and only) wine to be given the 100% new oak treatment. Just 23 cases were made. The oak simply does not show; it might as well be stainless. The fruit is tight, citrusy, and slowly expands into a lovely, smooth expression of Syrah that seems to envelope the back palate with flavors of licorice, cotton candy, mint and bright berry. Intriguing and quite definitely cellar worthy.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"The talent at St. Supry is evident in this lush, balanced Merlot. It has the famously ripe, forward fruit of a great Napa red, but shows the balance, harmony and complexity you expect when you fork over forty bucks.

Just the right amount of chocolate fills in the back end.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Oh what a nice young Cabernet this is. With lots of new French oak, it shows a beautifully balanced, elegant opulence. The fruit is impeccably ripe, all blackberries and cassis, and the all-important tannins are softly ripe and sweet. You could open it now, but it should develop additional bottle complexity after 2007.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Grown on the Sonoma side of the appellation, in one of the coolest, windiest parts, this is quite simply a delicious Syrah. The grapes achieved perfect ripeness, yielding immense blackberry jam, cherry, chocolate, tangerine zest, coffee and gingersnap cookie flavors. Yet that coastal acidity is there, scrubbing and cleansing the palate.","province":"California"},{"country":"nz","description":"This wine was a big award winner back in nz, and it's easy to see why. It's full-bodied and rich but never heavy, with complex aromas and flavors that include cola and coffee, black cherries and plums, cinnamon and clove.

But I know people who would call this Chard toothpicky.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Trutina, Dunham's Bordeaux blend, has long been the value wine in the Walla Walla superstar's portfolio. The 2004 is no exception, a seamless, silk-on-steel compendium of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wild card in '04 is the addition of 3% Syrah. It opens the wine up a bit, adding some spice and mint to the sweet cherry Merlot fruit. There's also an interesting grace note reminiscent of caraway cutting through.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the winery's best Grenache ever.

For starters, it's not an easy wine, as it's based on Carmenre and has Cabernet Sauvignon, Franc, Carignan and Malbec in the mix.

About 45% comes from Boushey in the Yakima Valley, another 45% from Artz on Red Mountain, and the rest from Destiny Ridge in the Horse Heaven Hills. It is the most fruit-driven and forward of the three, and the well-matched vineyard blend puts the focus on the varietal character of the grape, using the different terroirs to create a complete wine.

The red fruit element is now only a small part of what is now a fully mature wine. But the steely edge and tannic structure show that it will age, probably 10 years or more.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"Exotically spicy, with a taste of raspberry and black cherry pastry filling, dates, cassis and clove spice.

The fruit and wood and earth flavors are seamless and interesting, as the wine leads you gently through a very long finish.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release. The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors.

The tannins are polished and firm and there's enough natural sweetness to make this a chewy and succulent wine, sip after sip.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around.

It does not require food to fill in what's missingnothing is missing!","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging.

It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years.

If California Riesling is making a comeback, it's because of wines like this.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"A complex Champagne, with its apricot, green plum and pink grapefruit flavors, mixed with a rich, creamy texture and soft acidity. The final tastes are of lychees, with some toastiness.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"fr","description":"This young vintage is outside the usual Grande Anne range of vintages. Bollinger sees the unique heat of 2003 as a reason to make a special vintage for release early.

Drink now.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"Frazier breaks the triple-digit price barrier with this Cabernet. Like their regular '05, it's a very tannic wine, not suitable for drinking now or possibly anytime soon. But it's clearly powerful and concentrated in flavor, with a dense layering of cassis and freshly-crushed blackberries. Totally dry, but a little high in alcohol, it should reward cellaring over the next eight years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Perhaps because the winery's co-owner, Frank Ostini, is a restaurateur, he makes his wines in a forward, approachable style that doesn't require aging, although they're balanced enough for the cellar. The '06 Rio Vista is a fresh, silky wine whose smoky cherry and pepperspice flavors will soar with a grilled steak. Should hold nicely for six years.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"If this seems soft at first, that's the year. Soon enough, the hallmark Gosset acidity and minerality show through, with the addition of spicy pear and some toast.

However, there's a wealth of well-ripened cassis, bitter chocolate, cedar and anise flavors that are so powerful, the wine should easily ride out midterm aging. Give this Bordeaux blend a good 4 years in the cellar, and it should hold its own for years beyond that.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a really good Merlot from a producer that does a great job at it and has kept prices fair for years.

This one has a vanilla, smoke and grapefruit nose. Medium-weight, it is crisp in the mouth, though somewhat leaner than the Bench Break.

A daring, not gently nuanced, wine.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This plush Chardonnay's bouquet shows an ultraripe botrytis note in its vanilla, peach, clove and caramel aromas.

Dense, ripe fruit, detailed spices, balanced oak and perfect tannins make this a textbook Washington Cabernet. Cellar Selection.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This ripe, lush Syrah boldly expresses itself with shiny, saturated colors and bright, spicy, assertive fruit.

Young and still grapey, it's delicious right now but can be cellared for some years.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Were this from a more prestigious winery it would command a considerably higher price, but evaluated on its own merits it is a stunning success. There is a vivid, broad middle palate of black cherry, cassis and plum; a fine acid structure, and hard, stiff tannins.

They speak to the extra care taken in the winemaking process so as not to obliterate the fragile taste of terroir with excess oak or overripe fruit.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"es","description":"Starts with a crusty, almost mineral top over oaky, chunky blackberry fruit.

Long and ripe on the finish.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is the same wine as the La Rocaille, but aged in barrel, which has given it a slightly lusher texture as well as hints of cedar, vanilla and chocolate. It's just a stylistic difference, not a qualitative one.","province":"Rh?ne Valley"},{"country":"it","description":"Although this is fresh and genuine in the mouth, it loses points for a nose that seems tired and redolent of mature fruit. As tradition dictates, the Chianti blend sees smaller percentages of Canaiolo and Colorino to back a Sangiovese base.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"it","description":"This Chianti sees six months of wood aging to render distinct oak-related aromas that come on the heels of, and almost overwhelm, the red fruit and cherry. The tannins are hard, just shy of astringent.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"A little on the harsh, rustic side, but there's enough cherry, vanilla and anise richness to satisfy. Great with a burger.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry and full-bodied, this is the kind of rustic Cab that, at this price, you can serve at your next big condo party or BBQ without breaking the bank.

What it needs is brighter acidity and more focused, concentrated fruit.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"A dry wine, relying on dark tannins to bolster the fruit.

This property, in the eastern Entre-deux-Mers used 55% Cabernet Sauvignon in its 2002 blend.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"es","description":"A little too much canned fruit cocktail and grapefruit juice on the nose, but overall it's generous with its sweetness.

Better if you don't mind some stickiness to your white wines.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"Will have its fans, but for this reviewer, too high in alcohol, with 15.9%, and too soft in acidity.

The mouth is tangy and lean, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Very un-Toro in its skinny, tight approach.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"es","description":"Spice and warm leather on the nose are worthy aromas, but there isn't much fruit and the palate runs gritty and acidic.

High acidity marks the red fruits and the open tannins of this bright wine.","province":"Beaujolais"},{"country":"pt","description":"Based on a core of dry tannins, this is a wine with some tough, stalky fruit along with black currant skin texture. It is firm, definitely for food, with those tannins that edge on bitter.","province":"Douro"},{"country":"es","description":"Uncomplicated and dominated by red fruit aromas and flavors. This is your everyday type of red wine that could probably be made from just about any grape or blend of grapes.

Fine if you're not looking for anything special.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"au","description":"Fresh gooseberry, lemon and apple skin dominate the nose here, carrying over to the medium-weight palate.

Narrow as well on the finish. Middle-of-the road and respectable but hardly a head-turner.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"es","description":"A little herbal and minty on the nose, but at this price one can't complain too mightily.

Roasted and herbal but not offensive, especially at $7 a bottle.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"es","description":"Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice.

Pretty good but needs better balance and structure.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"Dusty-scented cherry fruit, hints of barn and earth, and a blend that includes 11% Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose on this wine promises more than it delivers in the mouth, where it turns acidic and hard, with green tannins.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"A big, jammy, acidic, and slightly sweet wine for washing down barbecue.

It is fresh and vibrant, a light touch of caramel and powerful acidity.","province":"Vinho Verde"},{"country":"US","description":"It's a Cabernet-Merlot blend from this highland appellation, inland from Anderson Valley in Mendocino County. The big drawback is excessive acidity. It's harsh and cutting, and interferes with what seem like pleasant blackberry, cherry and currant flavors.","province":"California"},{"country":"es","description":"Rather barnyardy and gaseous at first, but air breathes more clarity into the nose. The palate is chunky, grabby and a little awkward, with herbal, medicinal black fruit and buttery flavors. Slight heat and burn hamper the finish.","province":"Central es"},{"country":"es","description":"Big and bold stuff from southern es with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems. Better on the palate, where it brings plum and berry flavors but also some heat and saline. Slightly stemmy and roasted on the finish, much like the bouquet.","province":"Levante"},{"country":"ar","description":"On one hand you'll find bacon, rubber and smoke aromas, but on the other there's stem and murky notes that bring it down. The palate has sharp acidity and flavors of roasted red berries and pepper. For a Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend, it seems lean, stemmy and wanting.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"ar","description":"A touch stemmy on the nose, but in the mouth it comes around.

Decent wine but decidedly herbal and stemmy.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"au","description":"Black ash, cedar and crushed raspberries are the aromas here, while an underlying note of wet earth keeps things grounded.

The Chardonnay in the blend gives some roundness, but there is too high a level of acidity to finish.","province":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"ar","description":"This blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is very woody, so much so that the nose offers mostly cinnamon and green lumber. The palate, however, is ultracreamy, with vanilla and milk chocolate running the show. Seems a bit sticky and oaky. Could use more uncut fruit. Imported by Epic Wines.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"A blend of cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc, this Red Mountain red suffers from an excess of high-toned, volatile aromas and rough, untamed tannins. The grapes sources are solid but there are too many raw, unpolished edges; it doesn't quite pull itself together.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"It's fresh in vibrant acidity, with grapy flavors of citrus and gooseberries. There's a creamy lushness to the texture that softens and attracts.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Very intense with floral notes in the center, and mineral ones at the seams. There's a slightly loose or disjointed quality to the nose, but the mouthfeel is intact with a touch of spice on the finish.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry, tart and fairly one-dimensional, this Cab has mixed flavors of blackberries, cherries and Kahla, with a peppery, minty streak. The tannins are a bit edgy. Might improve with a year or two of cellaring.","province":"California"},{"country":"Georgia","description":"This late-ripening Russian grape delivers plenty of fruit and enjoyable drinking in this deep red wine. Sweet holiday spice, vanilla and plum make for an enjoyable nose, while the fruity, round palate is backed by tobacco and more spice. The rich fruit should pair well with hamburgers.","province":"Napareuli"},{"country":"ar","description":"Lightweight in its approach, but still sturdy. The bouquet offers melon, tropical notes and white flowers, while the palate deals mostly cantaloupe and banana. A modestly oaked wine without a ton of stuffing. Good for basic sipping. Imported by Billington Imports.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"US","description":"Pleasant and light, with fruit that suggests barely ripened, young grapes. Hints of strawberry, melon and raspberry carry into flavors that seem dilute. The medium-deep color and chewy, green tannins suggest it was pushed a bit hard at fermentation.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"it","description":"A luminous Grigio, with fruit and nut characteristics layered over melon and citrus. Lean and fresh in the mouth albeit a little lightwith a zesty finish. Imported by Zonin USA.","province":"Northeastern it"},{"country":"it","description":"A successfully executed wine, redolent of pear, peach and a dab of something green. An excellent food wine and especially well-suited for pasta and white meats. Imported by Della Terra.","province":"Northeastern it"},{"country":"it","description":"The nose is awkward, with wet hay or white mushroom delivered over fresh garden greens and stone fruit, but this Grigio polishes and primes the palate with almond skin flavors and a touch of bitterness. Imported by Laird & Company.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"fr","description":"A 100% Chenin Blanc based wine which keeps all the freshness of the citrus fruit flavors, attractive acidity, a light touch of softness to finish. A great value for a summer party.","province":"fr Other"},{"country":"US","description":"This blend of red varieties is very rich, soft and forward in cherry, red currant, chocolate and coffee flavors. It's nicely dry, with a persistent finish.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Not as successful as the winery's other reds, this seems overloaded with vanilla scents and flavors. The oak overpowers the light fruit, and the tannins C again quite dry C are not set off against anything ripe and sweet to counterbalance their bitterness.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"ar","description":"Standard fare, but nice. The nose offers some burnt sugar in addition to black fruit, while the palate is full of plum, cherry and spice. Chocolate and vanilla are detectable on the medium-length finish, while the feel and balance are proper.","province":"Mendoza Province"},{"country":"fr","description":"An attractively fresh wine, with white flower aromas, packed with delicate acidity and white fruits. Crisp fruits hide a touch of softness that allows the wine to finish balanced and light.","province":"fr Other"},{"country":"it","description":"Offers loads of roses, acacia and honeysuckle fleshed out by peach and melon. Not very acidic in the mouth. Imported by Fairest Cape Beverage Co., Inc.","province":"Northeastern it"},{"country":"US","description":"Cakebread's workhorse Napa Cab is soft, dry and ripe in cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors, with rich, sweet tannins. It combines the upscale quality of fine Napa Cab with a rustic, jagged texture. Drink now.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"A first sniff, the nose is attractive with vanilla bean and a strong nutty component that borders on almond pastry. But later the wine doesn't seem to open up completely and fruity notes seem distant. Imported by Banville & Jones Wine Merchants.","province":"Northeastern it"},{"country":"nz","description":"A big, rich, structured wine, with cola and rosemary notes that give nuance to the strong black-cherry aromas and flavors. With its plentiful but ripe tannins, it could use a couple years' of cellaring before being ready for primetime.","province":"Central Otago"},{"country":"nz","description":"Intense and extracted, this wine has strong cola, chocolate, black-cherry, cinnamon and peppermint aromas that border on eccentric and over-the-top, yet somehow stay in balance. Good acidity provides a foil against which the rich flavors play, and persists well through the long, softly tannic finish. Drink now and over the next few years; there's no telling how it will age.","province":"Waipara"},{"country":"nz","description":"Toasty, with menthol overtones from French oak (50% new), but the new wood is well balanced by intensely musky pear fruit. The long finish shows off complex nuances of oatmeal, lees and hazelnuts.","province":"Hawke's Bay"},{"country":"nz","description":"Don't look for subtlety here. This is a lush, lusty offering that's loaded with coconut and toast from American oak upfront, but also oozes with oranges and mangoes. Drink this one young to enjoy its plump exuberance.","province":"Gisborne"},{"country":"nz","description":"Steer clear of this one if you like your Sauvignons done in stainless. This one is 100% barrel fermented, yielding some toasty, smoky aromas that blend well with the forceful tropical fruit flavors. There's guava and pineapple, smoke and menthol on the long finish.","province":"Hawke's Bay"},{"country":"nz","description":"This top-of-the-line offering from Te Awa Farm displays extraordinary richness and complexity. The aromas of dried spices (cinnamon and clove), cocoa, mocha and black cherries slide gracefully into a multilayered palate that caresses the mouth. Can be drunk now, but has the structure to age up to 10 years.","province":"Hawke's Bay"},{"country":"it","description":"Older vines from the named vineyard provide the fruit for this 100% Sangiovese, barrique-aged Super Tuscan. The cherry, tart-berry and chocolate aromas pick up vibrant licorice accents as they blossom into full flavors on the palate. The already svelte mouthfeel should only improve, as the still substantial, firm tannins on the cocoa-tinged finish resolve. Hold for three years; drink 2004C2010.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"US","description":"From a venerable Burgundian producer comes this earthy, spicy wine, with a body and texture that are unctuous and creamy. There's a whole fruit basket here, with everything from green apples to peaches to tropical fruit. What's harder to express is the wine's power to satisfy. Rich and lush, it swings for the bleachers and just misses, but it's a solid triple. Editors' Choice.","province":"California"},{"country":"nz","description":"Wow. Ripe pears, peaches and nectarines cascade over the palate. Despite the suggestion of sweet, luscious fruit, this wine is dry, with a long, lime and pineapple finish. This is world-class dry Riesling. Editors' Choice.","province":"Central Otago"},{"country":"US","description":"Ripe and racy, this single-vineyard wine has lots of sweet lime, white peach and kiwi aromas and flavors on top of a steely framework of crisp acidity. Oak adds buttery, creamy notes. A rich, complex combination.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Too bad some people have eyes only for Chardonnay, when a wonderful dry white wine like this is available. Made from the Musque clone and farmed by the family that owns Flora Springs, it veers toward citrus fruits and a pleasant splash of buttery, honeyed toast. Elegant and limpid in the mouth. Editors' Choice.","province":"California"},{"country":"nz","description":"From one of the older and more densely planted Pinot vineyards in the region, this is a wine of uncommon finesse and elegance. Black cherries and cola are touched with a hint of green tea and a kiss of toasty oak. Silky soft on the finish, making it great to drink now, but with this balance it should age at least a few years without a problem.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"US","description":"Yummy. Exotically rich, ripe fruit marks this expressive, polished wine. Apple, peach, pear, vanilla, and toast highlight the aroma, and it drinks extravagantly rich without being over the top. The finish is complex and harmonious.","province":"Texas"},{"country":"nz","description":"This comes from older vines than Selaks' regular bottling, and it shows in the wine's greater intensity. Peach and melon flavors caress the palate, and a bright zing of jalape?o keeps the finish lively and focused.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"nz","description":"Excellent integration of fruit and wood means it's hard to know where the flavors of one stop and the other start. It's toasty, nutty and peachy, rich and creamy, and ends with a flourish of crme br?le.","province":"Marlborough"},{"country":"nz","description":"Amply oaked, but with sufficient fruit to back it up, this wine starts with aromas of buttered toast, roasted nuts, crme br?le and pineapple. Then it turns richly earthy and custardy on the palate, while still retaining a sense of balance through a beam of citrus-like acidity that adds cut to the finish.","province":"Waipara"},{"country":"US","description":"Made with fully ripened grapes, this is a lush, complex, thoroughly enjoyable wine. It's fairly dry by California standards, but offers up masses of sweet fruit and oak extract. The balance is especially nice; all parts are in harmony. Editors' Choice.","province":"California"},{"country":"nz","description":"Complex aromas of cedar, smoke and cassis set the stage for what should be a long-lived wine. Structure is provided by juicy acidity and firm, yet ripe, tannins. Good now; better in four years.","province":"Hawke's Bay"},{"country":"nz","description":"A structured and intense Chardonnay that should improve over the next few years, it's tight at first but opens with air. Pear and guava are set off by toast and menthol, which turn into lightly toasted hazelnuts on the extended finish.","province":"Hawke's Bay"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},M={class:"card-container"};function j(o,i,t,d,u,a){const p=y("PoemCard");return n(),r(c,null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâWine Reviewsü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",M,[(n(!0),r(c,null,m(a.visiblePoems,(s,f)=>(n(),w(p,{key:f,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(n(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):g("",!0)])],64)}const W=h(P,[["render",j]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"wine/5.md","filePath":"wine/5.md"}'),z={name:"wine/5.md"},V=Object.assign(z,{setup(o){return(i,t)=>(n(),r("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{D as __pageData,V as default};
