The grapes come from the warm Pope Valley region, and the wine, made from free run juice, was aged in 55% new French oak. It has the feel and taste of Cabernets far more expensive.

Needs 5C6 years to show its stuff.","designation":"Monte Rosso Vineyard","title":"Arrowood 2007 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"An interesting wine that needs time to resolve its internal conflicts. At less than three years, it's jammy, almost candied in raspberry and cherry fruit, sprinkled with freshly ground pepper and with a trace of beef jerky.

The vineyard sourcing is all southern Napa, from cooler mountain and flatland areas in this cool vintage. The wine, which has some Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, is nowhere near ready.

It could be going through an awkward period of bottle blues, from which it could emerge after 4C6 additional years. After that, the score could rise considerably, but right now, it's somewhat candied and rustic.","designation":"Winston Hill","title":"Frank Family 2007 Winston Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)"},{"country":"US","description":"A little soft, but delicious and complex.

Not complicated but very satisfying; drink immediately for maximum freshness.","designation":"","title":"Gauchezco 2010 Torronts (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"The grapes come from the estate vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The wine shows intense raspberry, cherry, persimmon and cola flavors, heightened by crisp, stimulating acidity. It's immature, though, being direct and not very subtle.

Seductive and smoky, it grabs you from the get-go with aromas of sweet fruit and toasty barrel. It's full in front, smooth in the middle and soft in the finish. Just a hint of herb and leaf in the tannins, which may play out well with a few years of cellaring.","designation":"Bishop's Blend","title":"William Church 2008 Bishop's Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"It's a shame this young wine was released well before it's anywhere near ready to be consumed.

So tart, so minerally, so dry. A wine that demands time in the cellar.

A remarkable wine, cropped at well under 2 tons/acre and vinified with roughly 50% whole clusters. Complex and aromatic, with a fruit jelly character that mixes exotic berries and black currants.

It's certainly a big wine that floods the mouth with blackberry, black currant, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins and acids make it aloof, resistant, tough. It wants time in the cellar. Best after 2013.

It smells like a fine Bordeaux, still very young and tight, with well-defined layers of flavor.

Takes the blackberries and black currants of Cabernet Sauvignon, merges them with Syrah's bacon and pepper, flirts with Grenache's cherries, and then uplifts it all with Viognier's citrusy brightness and acidity.

In the wrong hands these low-yielding grapes might have been mishandled, but Dry Creek Vineyard knows Zinfandel. The result is superb, spectacular, the essence of old vine Sonoma.

Le Mal gets the nod this year as the most powerful of the group, with massive espresso and black olive elements tinged with meat and underlain by a bed of ripe blueberries. Long and mouthwatering on the finish, look for this wine to approach maturity by 2016; drink well through 2025 or longer.","designation":"Le Mal Ermitage","title":"M.

Much of the fruit comes from the Bien Nacido Vineyard, and the Syrah contains 4% Viognier. Firm tannins and fine acidity give this delicious wine structure, but it's mostly notable for the extraordinary depth and length of its blackberry, currant, teriaki beef, mushroom and cedar flavors.

It's a dramatic glass of red wine, bone dry and fairly tannic, with vast, intricate flavors of blackberries, black currants, teriaki beef, cherries, red licorice, cola, dark chocolate and toast.

Simply spectacular Cabernet Sauvignon, pure and focused and textural and terroirdriven.
