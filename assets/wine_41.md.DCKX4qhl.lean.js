Not complicated, but solid.","designation":"Bin 99"},{"country":"nz","description":"This new label's wines come off an extremely young vineyard and are made by winemaker Mike Just, formerly of Lawson's Dry Hills.

Berry and cherry flavors are bolder and more intense, touched by vanilla and coffee from barrel aging.","designation":"Hommage   L on Ponnier"},{"country":"fr","description":"A big, somewhat bulky wine dominated by  drying tannins and leathery notes. There's enough raspberry fruit to provide short-term balance, so drink it soon with meats that can tame the tannic clout.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"With its honeyed flavors of tangerines, peaches, wildflowers and vanilla, this is a pleasant sipper if you're looking for something off-dry to frankly sweet. Low alcohol makes it a nice summer beach or picnic wine.","designation":"Terra d'Oro"},{"country":"fr","description":"Has that sort of glue or paste-like note that Marsanne sometimes shows, but it's also fresh and light on the palate, with decent concentration and an attractive anise or fennel note on the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"This luxury cuv e is a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Mourv dre, aged partially in barriques for up to two years.

With the majority of the grapes from the hot Sacramento Delta and cool Monterey, it's balanced, with plenty of peach, pear, pineapple and creamy vanilla flavors.

Another good value from a winery that routinely produces.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Crisp and floral (the blend contains 18% Viognier) but also rather austere and minerally, with just hints of pineapple fruit.

Spicy and fresh on the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"For a meatier, heavier bargain red, head south to the sun-drenched Puglia region. Canaletto sources fruit to make a wine that delivers bold fruit, black cherry, roasted espresso bean and moist earth.

This is the kind of wine you want on a chilly winter evening at home in front of a roaring fire.","designation":"Winemaker's Collection"},{"country":"es","description":"A touch timid in how it doles out slight raspberry and light oak aromas.

Far from the most cushioned, lush wine going; it hits firmly and evenly, like a welterweight from a past era.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"es","description":"Once again this Viura ranks as one of the better values in white Rioja.

Imported by wine@34south.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"The year's biggest trend from it's Prosecco region is ros  sparkling wine. These wines embody the fresh buoyancy of traditional Prosecco with a fruitier, richer aromatic ensemble. Moletto's Rosa, made from Tocai Rosso grapes, is a perfect example: The nose is redolent of raspberry and cranberry but also has an interesting brambly edge for added dimension. The piquancy of the bubbles hits the palate first but is smoothed out by cr me de cassis-like flavors and pink grapefruit.","designation":"Rosa"},{"country":"US","description":"From a cool vineyard in the southeast part of the valley, this wine opens with a refined scent of blackberry pie sprinkled with pepper and cocoa. It's a beautiful scent, like a pastry.

This Sauvignon, light in color and aroma, has a nice perfume with vanilla, citrus and spritzy tropical fruit. The mouth is fairly round, but with supporting acids, and displays solid flavors of citrus and tropical fruit with a slatey edge. Crisp on the finish, this is meant to be enjoyed young.","designation":""},{"country":"nz","description":"Rather restrained for Marlborough Sauvignon, showing more stony, minerally notes than most. With coaxing, modest passion fruit and honey notes emerge, carried along by a plump mouthfeel. A solid effort, but one that doesn't match winemaker John Belsham's more consistent touch with Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.","designation":""},{"country":"nz","description":"This is a plump verging on corpulent Pinot Gris, but one that avoids heaviness through decent acidity and a hint of tannin.

The wine's strawberry flavors are somewhat austere, revealing a lack of flesh and ripeness. Lean, expanding only on the finish, where firm tannins prevent current enjoyment. A blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah. Try after 2010.","designation":"La Bernardine"},{"country":"US","description":"For immediate consumption, this wine has easy Cabernet flavors suggesting blackberries, cassis and green olives.

Too bad it doesn't have more concentration, because it's got all the elements of a fine Napa Cab except depth.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"A bit floral and herbal on the nose, but there are also peach and berry fruit flavors that end up carrying the day.

The wine has good acidity and treads a delicate line between cherries and more herbal notes. Light and food-friendly.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"Every other inhale, you'll smell either leather or sweet fruit. On the palate, taut plum and rhubarb flavors dominate. A closed, somewhat disjointed wine, but it has an interesting rocky texture and some complexity.","designation":""},{"country":"pt","description":"Starts with simple aromas of roasted berries, but soon reveals a more complex side, marrying slightly herbal-grassy notes with ripe fruit and picking up hints of cocoa and dark chocolate on the finish.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"nz","description":"A solid representative of the Marlborough style, the 2005 Tohu Sauvignon fairly exudes passion fruit aromas and flavors, but also manages to sneak in hints of peaches (on the ripe side) and cooked peas (on the vegetal side). Medium in body, with some refreshing citrus on the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"ar","description":"Bright but kind of light, with attractive red-fruit aromas. The mouth, however, is a touch stark and zesty, with juicy, jumpy cherry and plum flavors.

Imported by Winesellers Ltd.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry and crisp,  with mineral, ash and slate flavors relieved by a dash of grapefruit. A wine like this doesn't win competitions, but it has its place on the table with tapas or alone as an ap ritif.","designation":"Estate Bottled"},{"country":"US","description":"While everyone else is picking superripe, Eberle prefers a high- acid, lower-fruit wine.

But it's a clean wine with a brisk mouthfeel.","designation":"Cass Vineyards"},{"country":"fr","description":"Starts with some tarry, almost cola-like ntoes on the nose, then adds espresso and caramel flavors and a touch of red fruit. Smooth almost creamy in texture, but lacks the depth and complexity of the Domaine's Les Croix bottling.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Apparently the ++ indicates more oak. Ripe black cherry fruit is coated in cedary, vanilla-scented oak, but it wears it well, ending on a supple, creamy note, rather than a dried-out or astringent one.","designation":"++"},{"country":"fr","description":"Lifted and slightly volatile on the nose, but there's also plenty of baked black cherry and plum fruit. A high proportion of Mourv dre gives a tannic grip to this wine and a hint of tar as well.","designation":"Cuv e Les Muses"},{"country":"es","description":"Basic, fresh and fruity, with floral aromas that capture the essence of clean, tank-made Viura. Flavors of melon, banana and papaya are easy to like but not that serious, while the finish is soft and creamy, but not very intense.","designation":"Monopole"},{"country":"es","description":"A sniff delivers aromas of dried fruits along with a smack of toast and char.

A new release that seems more mature than it is. Drink right away, preferably with food.","designation":"Crianza"},{"country":"pt","description":"This pale amber Madeira is lightly sweet, with nutty, slightly oxidized aromas that stay fresh and briny.

Its sturdy, chalky mouthfeel is pretty nice, too.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Bracchetto, especially made in this sweet, almost syrupy style, is not for everyone.

Best to decant for a few hours if you open it now.","designation":"Savoy Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Oregon Pinot at the top of its game; firm and tannic, with a complex mix of berry-driven fruits and lively spices.

Dry, green-tea flavored tannins wrap it all into a tidy bundle.","designation":"Grace Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Like Colgin's great Herb Lamb Cabernet, this is 100% varietal, 100% new oak. It's a unique, different sort of Cab, opening with an iodine, Islay Scotch, sea-salt scent that turns surprisingly rich and fruity in the mouth, sweet in chocolate and extraordinarily ripe black currants.

This blend of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc and Merlot is wickedly good. There's a ton of oak, but it's just the perfect touch. Tastewise, it's black currants, cr me de cassis and sweet Asian spices. So soft and forward; drink now.","designation":"Legends"},{"country":"it","description":"This is a delightfully chewy, extracted and penetrating wine that oozes blackness: Black licorice, black fruit, resin, slate, charcoal and chalkboard grow in intensity with each swirl. A very intense, modern wine that sees 18 months of oak aging for taut tannins and a supple, velvety mouthfeel. Would pair well with aged cheeses or grilled meats.","designation":"Akronte"},{"country":"it","description":"Very tense and tight is the nose: It contains precise fruit, baking spice, toasted oak and mint.

The fruit is there, but the tannic structure makes it less accessible. Lush plum and prune flavors coat the palate, dusted with oaky notes of chocolate and smoke. Winemaker Rolando Herrera worked at Stag's Leap Wine Cellars as well as with Paul Hobbs, and he clearly knows his stuff.

The barnyard carries to the palate, where it's joined by leather and blackberry. Tannins start off smooth, but develop plenty of grip with time. Warm throughout, this is one that should be decanted a few hours before serving.","designation":"Vineyard Selection"},{"country":"za","description":"Burnished gold, even the nose is creamy, offering heavily oaked aromas of caramel, toast and vanilla that neatly encase citrus and peach pit. Oak leads the way in the mouth as well, although there are plenty of citrusy fruits along with peach mineral.

Round flavors of plum and raspberry are balanced and forward, while the finish is full and mouthfilling. A correct, tasty wine that would be hard not to like.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"US","description":"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris is all barrel-fermented the trick is that only 30% of the barrels are wood, the rest are stainless steel. The result is a complex, multifaceted Sauvignon that's meant to pay homage to white Graves. Subtle toasted nut and vanilla shadings frame melon and peach fruit, while the mouthfeel is creamy and rich, balanced by a bit of grapefruity tang on the finish.","designation":"Elevage Blanc"},{"country":"it","description":"Zesty and woody at first, but later balsamic notes blend with jammier aromas to create a solid but oak-influenced bouquet.

But very expensive or what you get.","designation":"Camartina"},{"country":"za","description":"A great value in Viognier, thanks to moderate use of oak, which also brightens the fruit in this wine. It has vibrant citrus in the mouth, with cantaloupe and a hint of vanilla from older oak. The aromas are similar, with some honeysuckle, while the body is full and creamy, despite racy acids.

Tasted blind after bottling, I've not yet found that same level of quality, but my ratings have climbed from low-mid 80s (back in the early part of this year) to high 80s now, as the wine seems to be regaining some of its rich, velvety texture to help balance its formidable acidity.

Just 2 barrels (48 cases) were made.","designation":"Sundown Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"A little bit flat on the bouquet, with prune, graham cracker and tobacco aromas.

Meaty nuances and chocolate-fudge richness are stopped abruptly by firm, astringent tannins on the finish.
