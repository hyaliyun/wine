Cover and let soak 1 hour. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, cloves and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until light, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the flour mixture until combined, then beat in the walnuts and dried fruit mixture (the dough will be sticky).

Allow coals to burn and whiten, producing an even heat with no flame. Place all rub ingredients in bowl and mix. With slightly moistened boar shoulder in pan, pat rub (with dry hands) on non-fatty side of boar shoulder. Be sure to coat all surfaces liberally, even fat and folds. Boar is lean and dries easily in heat. Rub will act as a seal, locking in moisture. Turn shoulder fat side down and lay bacon strips lengthwise across non-fatty side, pinning them to the shoulder with toothpicks at center and ends, ensuring even coverage of the meat surface. Any remaining bacon can be added to the ends. Place shoulder on empty side of grill, bacon side up, and close cover. Cook until internal temperature of pork reaches at least 160 degrees F, roughly 10 hours, depending on size of shoulder. A slow-cooked, well-sealed shoulder should pull apart with tongs. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 24994,&quot;Crispy-Skin Salmon Provencal with Charred Red Cabbage Salad 4 tablespoons Dijon mustard Four 4-ounce skin-on salmon fillets<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 teaspoons dried herbes de Provence<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> Charred Red Cabbage Salad, recipe follows 1/4 cup canned crispy fried onions<br> 1/4 head red cabbage, stem intact, cut into thick slices 1/2 yellow onion, peeled, root end intact, cut into wedges<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup your favorite olives, pitted and halved<br> 1 jarred roasted red pepper, julienned<br> 1 orange, supreme (peel cut away and segments cut free from the pith) along with collected juices<br> 1/2 lemon, juiced<br> Instructions: Brush 1 tablespoon Dijon all over the flesh side of each piece of salmon, then sprinkle each with salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence. Heat a large nonstick pan over medium heat and add the olive oil. Place the salmon in the pan skin-side down and let it sizzle until the skin is golden brown and crispy, 6 to 7 minutes. Gently flip with a fish spatula. Add 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and let the salmon cook until the flesh is golden brown and the internal temperature is 130 degrees F, 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and the lemon juice, then remove from the heat. Serve the salmon on top of the Charred Cabbage Salad. Spoon the lemon pan sauce over the salmon and garnish with the crispy onions. Preheat the grill or a grill pan for cooking at high heat. Drizzle the cabbage and onion liberally with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the cabbage and onion until the cabbage is slightly wilted and super charred and the onion is soft and charred, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and set aside to cool until cool enough to handle. Remove the stems of the cabbage and roughly chop the cabbage; transfer to a medium bowl. Roughly chop the onion and add to the bowl along with the olives, red pepper, orange segments and juice, lemon juice, olive oil and salt and pepper.

Lay out cherry vine tomatoes in a single layer on a roasting tray. Drizzle with orange chili oil and roast in the oven for 8 to10 minutes until tomatoes are slightly burst and have given off their juices. Set aside. Add tapenade ingredients to a food processor and process to a coarse puree. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and set aside. In a saucepan add a 2 count of extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and anchovies and sweat for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the beans followed by the warm chicken stock and cook until heated through. Transfer the mixture to a food processor or blender and puree with a splash of white vinegar, salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Thin with extra stock if the puree is too thick. Give it a final taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Set aside and keep warm until ready to serve. Now prepare the tuna. Heat a large cast iron griddle pan over high heat. Drizzle the tuna with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on the hot grill for about 45 seconds and then turn over and do the same.

Add 2 tablespoons oil and pulse a few more times. With the machine running, add 1 cup water through the feed tube. Continue to add water, a tablespoon at a time, until the mixture forms a ball. The dough should be a little rough and rather sticky. Put some olive oil in a bowl and transfer the dough ball to it, turning to coat well. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until about double in size, about 1 hour. Knead lightly, forcing out the air, for about 3 minutes. Reshape the dough into a ball, return it to the bowl, cover and let rise in the refrigerator for several hours or up to overnight. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease two baking sheets with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with semolina. Cut the dough into 3 pieces; keep the remaining 2 pieces covered while you work with the first. On a well-floured surface, roll a piece of dough out as thinly as possible into a large rectangle about 8 inches long. Use a sharp knife or pastry wheel to cut the dough into roughly 1/4-inch wide breadsticks (slightly smaller is better than slightly bigger). To roll thinly with a pasta machine, roll out the dough to a 1/4 inch thickness by hand. Put the dough through the machine with the rollers fixed on the largest setting, then cut the dough into breadsticks roughly 1/4 inch wide and 12 inches long. Repeat with the remaining dough. Once you&#39;ve cut each strip, twist it, as though you were wringing out a washcloth, to create twisted rods. Transfer to the baking sheets, spaced apart, and brush with olive oil. Bake until crisp and golden, 10 to 20 minutes. Cool completely and serve. Breadsticks will keep in an airtight container for up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 25041,&quot;Braised Pork Ribs and Italian Sausage 1/4 pound pancetta, diced 3 pounds pork spareribs, denuded, cut into individual ribs 2 pounds Italian sausage, cut into 1-inch pieces 2 cups red bell peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces 2 cups diced yellow onion 1/4 cup diced garlic 1/2 cup white wine 4 cups whole San Marzano tomatoes 3 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves 1 teaspoon red chili pepper flakes Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound radiatore pasta, cooked al dente 1 bunch sliced green onions 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Using the paddle of an electric mixer or a pastry cutter, cut in the butter and shortening until mixture resembles \\small peas.\\ Pour the vanilla extract over the dough. Pour ice water, a little at a time, over the dough, and mix lightly until the dough comes together. Separate dough into 2 pieces and flatten each piece like a pancake. Wrap each piece of dough separately in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. For Pie Filling: Combine rhubarb and strawberries in a big bowl. Combine sugar, flour and scraped vanilla bean seeds and mix in with fruit mixture. Let sit while rolling pie dough. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch glass pie plate. Roll 1/2 pie dough to approximately 1/8-inch thick and about 1 inch larger than the pie plate. Fit in into the pie pan leaving the overlap intact. Fill with fruit filling and dot top with 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. Brush beaten egg with pastry brush around the rim of the pie. Roll out the remaining dough and make a lattice top. Crimp the edges. Brush lattice with beaten egg. Do not brush the edge of the pie--this will cause the dough to become too dark while baking. Generously sprinkle with crystal sugar. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for an additional hour. Pie is done when golden brown and juices bubbling from pie appear thickened. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 25064,&quot;Salmon with Hops Bearnaise over Cauliflower Puree 1 head cauliflower, separated into florets 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup butter, cubed Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1/2 cup &#39;Oktoberfest Style&#39; wheat beer (recommended: Marzen) 1 shallot, minced 2 tablespoons dried hops, divided 1 tablespoon dried thyme leaves 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 3 egg yolks 1 cup clarified butter Pinch cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/8 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 8 (6-ounce) salmon fillets Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons minced fresh chervil Instructions: For the puree, boil cauliflower in salted water until very tender. Drain well, stir in heavy cream, and puree with an immersion blender. Add cubed butter and further blend to smooth out the puree. Season, to taste, with salt and white pepper and keep warm. For the sauce, simmer beer, shallot, 1 tablespoon of the hops (reserving the rest), thyme, and white pepper until the liquid is reduced by half. Strain and allow to cool to room temperature. Add the egg yolks to a double boiler fitted over a pan of barely simmering water. (In order to avoid making scrambled eggs, the water level should not touch the bottom of the double boiler bowl.) Begin beating the egg yolks with a whip and add 1 tablespoon of the beer reduction. Beat until the yolks are thick, about 5 minutes. Crumble the remaining hops into the reduction to intensify the flavor. Remove the entire double boiler assembly (pot and all) to a heatproof surface like a large cutting board. Lift the double boiler from the pot and place a clean damp kitchen towel over the pot, tuck the loose ends of the towel under the base of the pot, and return the double boiler bowl to its position so that it sits atop the damp towel. Pour some of the clarified butter into the bowl in a slow steady stream while whisking constantly. As the mixture thickens, alternate some of the beer reduction with the butter, until all of the butter and the reduction are emulsified. Add the cayenne pepper and lemon juice. Add salt, if needed. Adjust the thickness of the sauce by beating in additional warm water. Set aside in a warm area until ready to use. (Please note that this sauce cannot be made in advance, so try to time it as closely as possible to serving time.) Heat the grapeseed oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper and sear flesh-side down first, leaving undisturbed for the first few minutes to allow the caramelization process to begin and to prevent tearing of the flesh. To complement the taste of the beer reduction, it would be desirable to put a hard sear on the salmon, which means leaving it to sear until it is a dark (but not burnt) golden brown. Flip the fish and sear the other side the same way. Remove from heat to let rest and cover to carryover cook until it flakes. Spoon some cauliflower puree on plate. Top with a piece of salmon, some sauce, and a sprig of chervil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Gris, Gewrztraminer]</p><p>&quot; 25065,&quot;Passion Fruit Tarts 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted 3/4 cup sugar 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 1/2 cup passion fruit juice (see Note) 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup lard, cut into eight pieces 1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces 3 tablespoons ice water 1/2 cup coarsely chopped pistachio nuts, for garnish Instructions: For the filling: In the top of a double boiler, whisk together the butter, sugar, eggs, and passion fruit juice until the mixture is thick and will hold a line, about 12 minutes. Transfer the double-boiler insert to a larger bowl filled with ice and cold water, and stir occasionally until cool. The mixture will be quite thick. For the crust: In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of the flour, the salt, lard, and butter and rub together with the tips of your fingertips until the mixture resembles small peas. Add the remaining 1/4 cup flour and bring together into a rough mass. Add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time and press into the mixture with a fork or your fingertips just until the mixture adheres into a dough. You may not need all the ice water. Press the dough into a ball and refrigerate for 2 hours. To assemble the tarts: Roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thick and, using a small plate or a cardboard template, cut the dough into six 4 1/2-inch diameter rounds. Transfer the rounds to 2 baking sheets, prick all over with a fork, and freeze for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425. Bake the tart bases for 12 to 15 minutes, until slightly golden. Using a large heavy spatula, transfer them to a rack (they crumble easily) and, when cool, spread with a nice thick layer of the passionfruit curd almost out to the edges of the pastry. Scatter the pistachio nuts around the very edges of the tarts and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25066,&quot;Carrot and Zucchini Mini-Muffins 1 cup almond flour 1/4 cup brown rice flour 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/3 cup grapeseed oil 1/3 cup maple syrup 1 large egg, at room temperature 1/2 cup grated carrots (from1 medium peeled carrot) 1/2 cup grated zucchini (from 1 medium unpeeled zucchini) 1/2 cup raisins 1 cup whipped cream cheese, at room temperature (about 8 ounces) 1 1/2 tablespoons honey Instructions: For the muffins: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven.

In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon until nice and crispy. Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and crumble when cooled. Pat the chicken dry and season on all sides with salt and pepper. Sear the chicken on all sides in the pan with the rendered bacon fat, until the outside is brown and crispy. Remove the chicken to a plate and add the fennel to the pan. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and saute until caramelized and tender, about 10 minutes. Add a little water if the fennel starts to burn. Pour in the beer and bring it to a simmer. Nestle the chicken and all resting juices, breast side down, in the fennel and beer. Cover and transfer the pan to the oven. Roast for 35 to 45 minutes, flipping the chicken over after 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and put over low heat. Remove the chicken pieces to a warmed serving platter. Add the vinegar to the sauce and simmer to reduce to a thicker consistency, about 5 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chicken pieces, top with crumbled bacon and serve immediately. If you want a smoother sauce, just strain the sauce after it has reduced. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Garnacha]&quot; 25101,&quot;Minted Squash Orzo 1 cup dried orzo pasta 1/4 cup garlic flavored olive oil, divided 1 large yellow squash, about 8 ounces, quartered lengthwise and sliced Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped, plus more for garnish Instructions: Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over medium heat. Stir in the orzo and cook for 8 minutes; pasta will be slightly undercooked. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain the orzo in a colander in the sink. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the squash, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown and soften, about 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and add the cooked orzo and cooking water. Bring to a simmer and stir in 3/4 of the feta; season with salt and pepper. Cook until the water is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and mint. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle the remaining feta over the top and garnish with additional chopped mint. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 25102,&quot;Negimaki 1/3 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup mirin 1/4 cup sake 2 tablespoons sugar 1 pound flank steak, cut in half against the grain 8 scallions, about 1 inch trimmed from the root ends (see Cook\\u2019s Note) 1 tablespoon vegetable or canola oil Toasted sesame seeds, optional Instructions: Stir together the soy sauce, mirin, sake and sugar in a pie dish or similar shallow container until the sugar is almost dissolved. Set the marinade aside. Cut the beef with the grain into 24 slices, each about 1/2 inch thick. Working in batches, arrange a few slices cut-side up on a piece of plastic wrap, leaving a few inches between each slice. Cover with another piece of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until the slices are 1/8 inch thick or a little less. Lay 3 slices on a work surface parallel to you with the long sides slightly overlapping (by about 1/4 inch). Cut 3 pieces of scallion the same width as the beef and place them across the meat at the end closest to you. Tightly roll the meat around the scallions, starting at the end closest to you. Secure the roll with 2 toothpicks--1 placed horizontally along each of the 2 \\u201cseams.\\ Repeat with the remaining beef and scallions. You will end up with 8 rolls. Place the rolls in the marinade, turn to coat and marinate, turning once halfway through, for about 15 minutes. Transfer to a plate, letting any excess marinade drain off, and pat dry (reserve the marinade). Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the rolls and brown on 4 sides, 3 or 4 minutes total (the middle should still be rare). When you flip the rolls the last time, reduce the heat to medium, add the reserved marinade and simmer, turning the rolls a few times, until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. (The meat should still be pink in the middle at this point. If you prefer your meat more well done, simmer it a little longer; just be careful not to reduce the sauce too much. If that happens, thin it with a little water.) Transfer the rolls to a cutting board and, when cool enough to handle, remove the toothpicks. Using a very sharp knife, cut the rolls crosswise into pieces about 1 inch wide and serve upright on plates. Drizzle with the sauce and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 25103,&quot;Smothered Pork Chops 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons onion powder 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 teaspoon cayenne 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 pork chops, 3/4-inch thick, bone-in 1/4 cup olive oil 1 cup chicken broth 1/2 cup buttermilk Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish Instructions: Put the flour in a shallow platter and add the onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly. Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels to remove any moisture and then dredge them in the seasoned flour; shaking off the excess. Heat a large saute pan or cast iron skillet over medium heat and coat with the oil. When the oil is nice and hot, lay the pork chops in the pan in a single layer and fry for 3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove the pork chops from the pan and add a little sprinkle of seasoned flour to the pan drippings. Mix the flour into the fat to dissolve and then pour in the chicken broth in. Let the liquid cook down for 5 minutes to reduce and thicken slightly. Stir in the buttermilk to make a creamy gravy and return the pork chops to the pan, covering them with the sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes until the pork is cooked through. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 25104,&quot;Banana-Rum Souffle 1 teaspoon softened unsalted butter 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus additional for dusting 3 large ripe bananas, peeled and sliced 1/4 cup dark brown sugar Juice of 1/2 lemon 2 tablespoons dark rum 5 large egg whites Pinch fine salt Cocoa powder for dusting, optional Instructions: Lightly butter the insides of 4 (1-cup) ramekins, then dust with sugar. Space them evenly on a baking sheet and put in the freezer. Put the bananas, brown sugar, lemon juice, and rum in a medium saucepan. Cook uncovered, over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the bananas begin to soften, about 7 minutes. Mash the bananas with a potato masher or large fork until mostly smooth; continue cooking to make a thick puree, about 8 more minutes. Cool to room temperature. Position the oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Whip the egg whites and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until foamy. Increase the speed to high, gradually pour in the 2 tablespoons sugar, and whip until the whites hold soft peaks. Fold a quarter of the whites into the banana mixture and then fold in the remaining whites. (Don&#39;t dally here; timing is everything with souffles. Whip, fold, and get the souffle in the oven without missing a beat.) Evenly divide the batter among the prepared ramekins. Bake the souffles until well puffed and golden, about 15 minutes. Dust with a light sprinkling of cocoa powder, if desired. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25105,&quot;Lilva Kachori 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons grapeseed or safflower oil, plus more for greasing and frying Kosher salt 1/2 lime, juiced 3/4 cup cold water 1 cup frozen green peas, thawed 1 cup frozen tuvar lilva (shelled green pigeon peas), thawed 1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut, toasted (see Cook\\u2019s Note) 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger 2 fresh Thai bird chiles 2 tablespoons grapeseed or safflower oil 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon garam masala 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric Pinch ground cinnamon Kosher salt 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 2 tablespoons roasted cashews, chopped Pinch sugar 1/2 lime, juiced Instructions: For the dough: Put the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Add the 2 tablespoons oil and 1 teaspoon salt to the well. Rub together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the lime juice, then the cold water 2 tablespoons at a time and knead the dough until soft and pliant, 3 to 5 minutes. Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, for the filling: Add the green peas, tuvar lilva, coconut, ginger and chiles to a food processor. Pulse until the mixture becomes a coarse paste, 8 to 10 pulses. Set aside. Heat the oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Add the pea mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is almost dry and does not stick together, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the cumin, garam masala, cayenne, coriander, turmeric and cinnamon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until there is little to no moisture left in the pan and the peas are still bright green, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt, then stir in the cilantro, cashews, sugar and lime juice. Transfer to a large bowl. Set aside until cool to the touch, about 10 minutes. To assemble: Roll the rested dough into a ball. Rub 1 teaspoon oil on your hands and pat the dough until completely coated; this will keep it moist. Roll out 1 tablespoon of dough into a 3-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Place 1 heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center. Bring together the edges of the dough so the seam is on top of the filling. Tightly pinch the edges closed to seal the filling inside. Trim off any excess dough. Roll the parcel into a ball with your palms and place it on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling to make 15 to 20 parcels. Pour enough oil to fill a large pot or Dutch oven about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 300 degrees F. Working in batches of 5 or 6, gently lower the kachori into the hot oil using a spider and gently fry until the dough is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Transfer to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 25106,&quot;Jellied Eggs with Tarragon 1 to 1 1/2 cups/375 ml home-made beef consomme, recipe follows 1 tablespoon unflavored gelatine 1 tablespoon Cognac Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 eggs 8 fresh tarragon leaves 1 pound/500 g ground beef 1 celery stalk, diced 1 carrot, diced Green of 1 leek, diced, and rinsed 2 medium tomatoes, diced 3 egg whites Handful fresh parsley, leaves chopped 6 cups/1.5 liter fat-free homemade beef stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the stock in a saucepan and sprinkle over the gelatin. Let sit 5 minutes to soften. Gently heat, stirring to dissolve. Remove from the heat and stir in the Cognac. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Cool. Pour the thinnest layer in the bottom of each of 4 ramekins. Refrigerate until sticky, but not completely set. Keep the remaining consomme mixture out. While you wait for the ramekins to set, put the eggs in a pot and pour in cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, uncovered. Turn off the heat, cover and set aside 8 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water until cool. Peel and halve lengthwise.<br> When the stock in the ramekins is more or less set, decoratively lay the tarragon leaves on top with their best side facing down. Set an egg half, yolk-side against the tarragon, on top in each. Pour over the remaining stock. Refrigerate until fully set.<br> Turn the jelled eggs out onto plates and serve with a bit of rocket and buttered toast triangles. Stir together the beef, celery, carrot, leek, tomatoes, parsley, and egg whites in a large bowl. Pour the beef stock into a pot, season with salt and pepper, and whisk in the vegetable mixture. Heat, whisking slowly, until frothy, about 10 minutes. As soon as the stock reaches a simmer, stop stirring. In a few minutes, the white mixture will have formed a firm, nasty-looking \\raft\\ on the surface. Make a vent in the raft large enough to get a small ladle through, and continue simmering 30 minutes. Line a strainer with cheesecloth and set over a bowl. Leaving the raft behind, ladle in the clarified consomme through the hole in the raft and let it strain through. Serve piping hot, with or without garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25107,&quot;Pan di Spagna 4 large eggs, separated 3/4 cup sugar, divided 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Pinch salt 1/2 cup unbleached, all-purpose flour 1/2 cup cornstarch Instructions: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the yolks with the vanilla extract. Whisk in half the sugar and continue to beat until very light and frothy, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and cornstarch and sift once to aerate. In a clean, dry bowl beat the egg whites with the salt until they hold a very soft peak. Beating faster, add the remaining sugar in a very slow stream, beating until the egg whites hold a firm peak. Fold the yolks into the whites. Sift the flour and cornstarch over the eggs in 3 additions, folding them in gradually. Do not over-mix the batter. Pour the batter into a buttered and paper-lined 9 or 10-inch round pan, 2-inches deep and smooth the top. Bake the Pan di Spagna at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes, until it is well risen and feels firm when pressed gently with the palm of the hand. Immediately loosen the layer from the side of the pan with a small knife or spatula. Invert the layer and leave the paper stuck to it. Turn the layer right side up and cool it on a rack. The cake can be stored double-wrapped in plastic in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25108,&quot;Online Round 2 Recipe Web - Eggplant Dip 1 small head garlic 1 teaspoon canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Reserved eggplant from Moussaka recipe 1/4 cup fresh parsley, roughly chopped 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon lemon juice 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 teaspoon paprika 3 pita pockets, cut into quarters and toasted Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Arrange the pork chops on a platter and drizzle with the glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 25148,&quot;Chicken Consomme with Snipped Herbs 6 cups unsalted, homemade chicken stock or prepared chicken stock, cold 1 small leek, well washed, trimmed and minced 1 small carrot, grated 3 fresh parsley sprigs, minced 8 ounces ground chicken breast 2 egg whites Kosher salt Instructions: Put the stock in a large saucepan. Stir together the leek, carrot, and parsley in bowl of a food processor. Add the ground chicken, egg whites, and 2 tablespoons water. Pulse to mix well. Stir this mixture into the stock in a saucepot. Bring the stock very slowly to the boil, stirring constantly. The egg mixture will congeal and form a \\raft\\ on the top of the stock, collecting all the impurities from the stock. As soon as it begins to boil, stop stirring and turn the heat down to low. A hole will have formed on the top of the \\raft. Make it slightly larger with a spoon, and then simmer the stock very gently for 45 minutes. Remove the saucepot from the heat and let stand 5 minutes. Line a sieve with a double layer of cheesecloth. Using a skimmer, lift off as much egg white from the top of the consomme as you can, and discard. Ladle the consomme into the lined strainer and let it drip through in its own good time. Don&#39;t be tempted to press it or you&#39;ll make it cloudy. When it has all dripped through, season and taste the consomme. Season the consomme with salt, if needed. Serve hot or cold with the garnish of your choice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25149,&quot;Figs with Honey and Fresh Cheese 4 figs 2 scoops fresh cheese (fromage blanc from a farmer&#39;s market) Spoonful of light honey (acacia or wildflower) Instructions: The figs must be very ripe. Just put 2 figs on each plate, add a scoop of fresh cheese and dribble over the honey. &quot;,&quot;[Chenin Blanc, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 25150,&quot;Mi Goreng 1/2 pound linguine Salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 cup minced onions 2 teaspoons minced gingerroot, or 1 teaspoon ground ginger 2 cloves garlic, minced 3 cups broccoli florets 2 carrots, diced 2 celery stalks, diced 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder 1 teaspoon chili paste, or to taste 2 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste 1 to 2 tablespoons Oriental sesame oil 1 tablespoon mango chutney Instructions: In a large pot of boiling salted water cook the linguine until it is al dente and drain, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta cooking liquid. Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables: In a large nonstick skillet set over moderately high heat, warm the oil until hot, add the onions, gingerroot and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add the broccoli, carrots, celery and salt to taste and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes more. Add the five-spice powder, chili paste, soy sauce and 1/2 cup of pasta cooking liquid and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in the sesame oil and chutney. Add the drained pasta and stir to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25151,&quot;My Personal Favorite Pain au Levain 2 cups (18 ounces) levain, recipe follows 2 1/4 cups (18 fluid ounces) spring water 4 to 4 3/4 cups (20 to 24 ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour 1 tablespoon (3/4-ounce) fine sea salt 1 1/4 cups (6-ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour Instructions: Measure the ingredients and calculate the temperatures. Combine the levain and water in a 6-quart bowl. Break up the levain well with a wooden spoon or squeeze through your fingers until it is broken up. Continue stirring until the levain is partially dissolved and the mixture is slightly frothy. Add 1 cup (5 ounces) of the flour and stir until well combined. Add the salt and just enough of the remaining flour to make a thick mass that is difficult to stir. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding remaining flour when needed, until dough is firm and smooth, 15 to 17 minutes total. The dough is ready when a little dough pulled from the mass springs back quickly. Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest on a lightly floured surface while you scrape, clean, and lightly oil the large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn once to coat with oil. Take the dough&#39;s temperature, the ideal is 78 degrees. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees F) draft-free place until increased in volume about 1/4 to 1/2. This dough will not behave like an ordinary yeasted bread dough. It won&#39;t rise to a puffy state. Deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling up on the sides. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly. Shape into a tight ball and place on a lightly floured board. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degree) draft-free place for 30 minutes. Flatten the ball with the heel of your hand on a lightly floured work surface into a disk. Shape into an oblong loaf about 14 inches long. Place the loaf seam side up in a well-floured couche*. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees F) draft-free place until almost doubled in volume, or until a slight indentation remains when the dough is pressed with a fingertip. This dough gets softer, lighter, and very delicate as it proofs--more so than any other dough in this book. After 4 hours there will be a pronounced difference between the dough you set in the couche and the final light dough. Preheat the oven and baking stone to 450 degrees, 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking. The oven rack must be in the center of the oven. If it is in the lower 1/3 of the oven the bottom of the breads may burn, and if it is in the upper 1/3, the top crusts may burn. Using the couche as an aid, gently roll the loaf from the couche onto a lightly floured peel so that it sits seam side down. Using a very sharp, serrated knife or a single-edged razor blade, score the loaf by making quick shallow cuts 1/4 to 1/2-inch deep along the surface. Using the peel, slide the loaf onto the hearth. Quickly spray the inner walls and floor of the oven with cold water from a spritzer bottle. If there&#39;s an electric light bulb in the oven, avoid spraying it directly?it may burst. Spray for several seconds until steam has filled the oven. Quickly close the door to trap the steam and bake 3 minutes. Spray again in the same way, closing the door immediately so that steam doesn&#39;t escape. Bake until the loaf begins to color, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 400 degrees and continue baking until deep golden in color and the crust is firm, 20 to 25 minutes. To test the loaf for doneness, remove and hold the loaf upside down. Strike the bottom firmly with your finger. If the sound is hollow, the bread is done. If it doesn&#39;t sound hollow, bake 5 minutes longer. Cool completely on a wire rack. Add the flour directly into the container with the full batch of room-temperature, batterlike ripe chef. Stir vigorously to add fresh oxygen to the mixture. This will form a stiff consistency more like a stiff dough than a batter. This firm texture is important for ripening levain, because a dense rather than loose levain creates delicious sour bread without an overpowering tangy bite. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly, and let stand in a cool to moderate (about 70 degrees) draft-free place for 8 to 10 hours. The levain should have doubled in volume. The texture will be somewhat light, with many tiny bubbles throughout. Do not let the levain stand for longer than 10 hours, or the yeast will become exhausted and not raise the final dough. This recipe yields 18 ounces of levain. The Chef Day 1 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water Combine the flour and water in a tall 2 to 3-quart clear plastic container with a lid. Stir well to make a thick, soft dough. The exact consistency of the dough will vary with the brand of flour or water at this point to adjust the texture. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, cover tightly with lid and let stand in a moderate (about 70 degree) place for 24 hours. Day 2 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water The chef should have almost doubled in volume. You will see tiny bubbles on the surface, and you might notice a slight musty smell. Add the flour and water to the mixture and stir vigorously to distribute the fresh ingredients and add fresh oxygen to the chef. The texture will still be like a soft dough. You may add a little more flour or water to make this texture, if necessary. Scrape down the sides, cover, and place in a moderate (70 degree) draft-free place for 24 hours. Day 3 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4 ounces) 20 percent bran wheat flour 1/2 cup (4 fluid ounces) spring water It will have almost doubled in volume and be quite bubbly. Add the flour and water, and stir well to make a thick batter. (You may have to add a little more water if your flour&#39;s absorption level is high). With a marker pen, mark the level of the chef on the side of the container. Scrape down the sides, cover tightly, and let stand in a moderate (70 degree) draft-free place for 24 hours. It should now be loose in texture, like a pancake batter. It will have doubled in volume from the last addition of flour and water. The chef may rise and fall, but as long as it doubles at some point during this last period, it&#39;s fine. You now have a fully ripe chef ready to transform into a levain. If you don&#39;t want to make the levain immediately, the chef can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Note: If the dough temperature is higher than 78 degrees, put it in a cooler than (78 degree F) place like the refrigerator, until the dough cools to 78 degrees. If it is lower than 78 degrees, put in it a warmer than 78 degree place until the dough warms to 78 degrees. The point is to try to keep the dough at 78 degrees during its fermentation. If you do have to move the dough, be gentle and don&#39;t jostle it, or the dough may deflate. *Couche?French for \\couch\\ or \\resting place. This is a simple holding device you make yourself for proofing long loaves like logs, torpedo shapes, and baguettes. Using well-floured canvas or linen towels create folds to separate loaves while hold them securely next to each other during proofing. Use a length of fabric at least a yard long. Place 12 to 16-inch wooden blocks cut from 2 by 4&#39;s at either long end to contain the loaves. Or substitute large books to contain the loaves.

You don&#39;t even have to peel them, just remove their caps. If you don&#39;t find Thai eggplant, purple eggplant will do nicely! 12 small Thai eggplant or 1 purple eggplant, peeled, diced and slightly sauteed in olive oil F is for Fungi; that means mushrooms! Any mushrooms will work; White button or Shiitake or Oyster. 2 handfuls of mushrooms, chopped and sauteed with a little bit of olive oil G is for Ginger. A fabulous root spice, the best of which comes from our 50th state, Hawaii. 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon Ginger root, peeled and very finely chopped. H is for HOT. If you like your soups spicy hot, you can add Habanero peppers, which is the hottest pepper of all. Not everyone appreciates Habanero; in this soup they are optional and should be handled by grown ups only! 2 to 3 Habaneros, seeded and finely diced I is for Ingredients. This is what cooks call all of the things that go into a recipe. I have never found a vegetable that starts with the letter I. If you can think of one, please let me know!! J is for Jicama, a delicious root vegetable, which is quite popular in the tropical regions of the world, and looks very much like a potato. 1/4 cup jicama, peeled and diced K is for Kohlrabi, a great vegetable that comes in red, green and sometimes white. The leafy top and globe shaped bottom are all good to eat. A few diced kohlrabi leaves or 1/8 cup kohlrabi bottom, peeled and diced ; A is for vitamin A. We all know that Vitamin A is found in carrots, but it&#39;s also found in green vegetables like Asparagus and Artichokes . B is for Broccoli. Former President Bush was famous for not enjoying broccoli, but his wife Barbara loved it, and she was dedicated to the cause of reading, all across this country. I hope you&#39;ll join me in thanking Barbara Bush for all of her work with literacy. . C is for Carrots, yummy! I love carrots; they&#39;re sweet, crunchy and good for the eyes, teeth and bones. .

My question: Have we forgotten anything, like maybe a delicious green vegetable that belongs in our soup? I say Yes! Let&#39;s revisit \\C\\ and add some Celery! 1 small bunch of celery, diced Q is also for Quarter. We need a Quarter cup of liquid; you can add water or vegetable juice for broth, which should be combined with 1 teaspoon of butter for a smooth texture. R is for Rosemary, a herb which goes wonderfully in soup. 2 teaspoons fresh Rosemary S is for Salt, Sage and Savory Spices--all things that wake up the natural flavor of our vegetable soup. 1 teaspoon each of Sage and savory Herb de Provence Salt to taste T is for Tomato, one of my very favorite things to put into soup 4 red Tomatoes, diced T is also for Thyme, another great herb. 1/4 teaspoon Thyme Which sounds like \\Time, something our soup also needs. After our alphabet has been completed, bring the soup to a quick boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes. U is for \\You; make sure that you add something that You enjoy. My soup is always made from vegetables, but You may want to add fish or chicken or ground meat. Saute or grill it first, with a little bit of salt and pepper; L is for Lemongrass, which is used a lot in Asia. If you can&#39;t find it, you can substitute a little lemon juice, or a little of its peel. . M is for Maize, the Native American word for corn . N is for Nutmeg, a wonderful spice that smells good too! . O is for Onion. My favorites are the big white ones, the sweet yellow ones, and the Spring green ones . X is for no vegetable that I&#39;ve ever heard of. If you can think of one, I hope you&#39;ll let me know. In the meantime, did you know that some people write the letter \\X\\ as the symbol for a kiss? So when you have a steaming bowl of hot soup in front of you, you might want to blow a kiss into it; it&#39;s a lovely way to cool it off. Y is for Yams. Here in America, Yams are a variety of sweet potato. 2 medium Yams, peeled and diced Y is also for Yukon Gold, a yellow-fleshed potato which will help to make our soup nice and thick. 3 large Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced Z is for Zucchini, one of my favorites! 3 medium Zucchini, sliced into wheels Method: Bring to a boil and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes. Your broth will be slowly created in the process. Check your seasoning during the cooking process, and add spices to taste. You may want to add 3 to 4 tablespoons of olive oil to thicken the broth and to add richness.; V is for Vegetable; the Vegetable of your choice that isn&#39;t in the pot yet (maybe cabbage, squash, bell pepper, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, garlic cloves, anything you can think of!) . V is also for Victory. While I stir this soup, I thank God for my Victory over illiteracy. Not only can I read wonderful recipes, I can write them too, for you to read and to enjoy preparing! .

Stir in the sugar and set aside the mixture until it blooms with a slightly foamy top, 5 to 10 minutes. Sift together the all-purpose flour and white whole-wheat flour in the bowl of a stand mixer. Make a deep depression in the middle with a wooden spoon and add the olive oil. Slowly pour in the bloomed yeast mixture. Using the dough hook attachment, knead the dough on low speed until the mixture starts to come together. Slowly pour in 1 1/2 cups of warm water, adding up to an additional 1/4 cup if needed so the dough looks smooth and feels slightly sticky. Add the salt, increase the speed to medium and continue to knead until a soft and stretchy dough forms (it should not feel sticky), 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl and cover with a damp towel. Allow it to rise in a dark area until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. Transfer the risen dough to a lightly floured work surface and gently punch it down. Divide the dough into 18 even pieces, and form these pieces into smooth balls. Using a rolling pin, roll a piece of dough into circle that&#39;s about 5 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces. Cover the dough with the damp towel and let it rest for 20 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, place a nonstick baking sheet in the oven and preheat the oven to 525 degrees F. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully transfer 3 pieces of dough to it; lightly spritz them with water from a spray bottle. Bake the pitas until they\\u2019re puffed up and light brown with a few dark brown freckles in places, watching very closely because they burn quickly, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pitas from the baking sheet and allow them to cool on plates or a wire rack covered in paper napkins to maintain softness. Place the baking sheet back in the oven for 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining pitas. Serve the pitas immediately with Tahini Sauce, if desired. Store them in resealable bags at room temperature for up to 2 days or freeze them in resealable bags for up to 3 months. Combine the lemon juice, garlic, salt and cumin in a large bowl. Add the tahini to the garlic mixture, stirring with a whisk or fork to combine (the mixture will be very thick). Pour in 1/2 cup cold water, stirring until incorporated; feel free to add more until you reach the desired consistency. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 25170,&quot;Steel-Cut Oatmeal 1 cup steel-cut oatmeal 1 pinch salt 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 tablespoon butter 1/4 cup cream 1 peach, diced Instructions: Mix the oatmeal, 4 cups water and salt together in a saucepan and let it simmer on medium-low for 25 minutes.

Clean out the seeds and ribs, give them a rough chop, and put them into a small saucepan. Roughly chop the onion and garlic and add it to the pan. Pour in the vinegar and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. In the meantime, roughly chop the cilantro and put it into a blender along with the salt and lime juice. When the jalapeno mixture is cooked, add it to the blender. *Cover the blender, put a towel over the lid, and turn it on low. Once it is going, crank it up to the highest setting and puree for 3 minutes. Strain through a medium holed strainer and let cool. Pour into sterilized bottles and refrigerate. The hot sauce will keep for up to a month under refrigeration. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 25172,&quot;Rock Salt Shrimp 1 to 2 pounds rock salt (enough to fill your casserole by 1 inch) 5 to 6 clove garlic, minced Good olive oil, for drizzling 5 large shrimp, head and shells left on Instructions: Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. If either of the sausage meats is coarsely ground, place the meat in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, and pulse until the meat is finely ground. Heat 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large (12-inch) saute pan, add the onion, and cook for 4 to 6 minutes over medium heat, until tender but not browned. Add all the sausage meat and mash with a fork, breaking it up and browning it, for 5 to 7 minutes, until no longer pink. Meanwhile, prep the mushrooms. Without washing the mushrooms, wipe the caps with a slightly damp paper towel or sponge to remove any dirt. Trim the stems, then roughly chop the caps and stems. Add the mushrooms, fennel seeds, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper to the sausage and cook for 10 minutes, until the mushrooms give off their liquid and the liquid evaporates. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Stir in the mascarpone and the fresh bread crumbs and season to taste. The seasoning will depend on how highly seasoned the sausage meat is. Melt the remaining 12 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan. Unfold the phyllo dough and keep it covered with a slightly damp (not wet!) kitchen towel. Transfer one sheet of phyllo to a board, brush it lightly with melted butter, and sprinkle with a teaspoon of dry bread crumbs. Place a second sheet of phyllo directly on top, brush with butter, and sprinkle with dry bread crumbs; repeat until you have 5 sheets piled up. With the long edge of the stack of phyllo facing you, make a 1-inch strip of sausage filling (about 1/3 of the filling) near the bottom edge. Fold up the sides and roll the phyllo firmly up and over, rolling the log away from you. Transfer the log, seam side down, to the prepared sheet pan.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Heat the oil in large heavy-bottomed pot with a lid over medium heat. Add the popcorn kernels and place the lid slightly ajar on top of pot. Cook until most of the kernels pop, 7 to 10 minutes (the popping sounds slow down when it&#39;s almost done). This will make 10 to 12 cups of popcorn.<br> While the popcorn is popping, melt the butter, honey, vanilla and salt in a small saucepan over low heat until the mixture is uniform. Transfer the popcorn onto the prepared baking sheet. Discard any unpopped kernels that settle at the bottom of the pot. Pour the butter mixture evenly over the popcorn. Toss the popcorn with two spatulas until coated. Bake, stirring every 5 minutes, until the popcorn is a deep caramel color, 20 minutes.<br> Remove the baking sheet from the oven and cool for 5 minutes. Wearing clean plastic gloves, use your hands to press the popcorn into 2-inch balls. Towards the end you may need 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of extra honey to act as the \\glue\\ for the balls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25207,&quot;Apple Kuchen 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cold and cut into pieces 1 pound cream cheese, at room temperature 3/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 egg, at room temperature 2 tablespoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 3 Granny Smith apples, peeled, if desired, cored, and thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Lightly grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan. To make the crust: Place the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl or food processor fitted with a steel blade and mix to combine. Add the vanilla and butter, a little at a time, and mix until it resembles cornmeal. Press into the prepared baking pan and transfer to the oven. Bake until slightly golden but not brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool. Lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees. To make the filling: Place the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle and beat until creamy. Add the egg, mix to combine, an pour over the cooled crust.

When well combined, add the butter and pulse the machine until the butter is broken up into the flour mixture. Add the egg and water and process until the dough forms a dough. Transfer the dough into waxed paper; pat it (with floured hands if need be) into a flat round and refrigerate for 30 to 45 minutes or until it has relaxed and you can roll it out. Divide the dough into approximately 8 equal pieces. On a lightly floured board roll out the pieces until slightly thicker than 1/8th-inch thick. Rather than bother fitting them into tartlet shells and prebaking them, simply shape them into rough rounds (3 inches or 3 1/2 inches round) or cut them into hearts or rectangles. Transfer the free form shapes to a baking sheet and chill 20 minutes while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Scraps can be shaped into smaller cookies. Prick the dough with a fork (just as you would the bottom dough of a tartlet shell) so the dough doesn&#39;t puff up. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until edges are brown. Remove them from the oven to a rack and let them cool. When completely cool top with whatever you like. To make a topping that simulates a fruit tart gently warm the red currant jelly in a saucepan and brush over the free form tart shells. Arrange some sliced berries over the top and center a whole one in the middle if you wish. You can glaze with more warm currant glaze or pipe whipped cream on top or dust with confectioner&#39;s sugar. You could also brush bottoms with warm glaze and set other fruit over top or brush bottoms with some lemon curd and top with fruit. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 25209,&quot;Beef and Pork Tamale Pie 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 pound ground pork 1 1/2 pound ground sirloin 1 onion, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 tablespoons seeded chipotle in adobo sauce, finely chopped, plus couple spoonfuls sauce 1 tablespoon ground cumin (scant palmful) 1 tablespoon coriander (scant palmful) 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup tomato paste 1 (12-ounce) bottle Mexican beer (recommended: Negra Modelo) 1 cup beef stock 1 1/2 cups chicken stock or water 1 1/2 cups milk About 1 cup quick cooking polenta 2 tablespoons butter 1 generous tablespoon honey 1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar or smoked Cheddar cheese Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat, add pork and sirloin and brown. Add the onions, garlic, chipotle, adobo sauce, cumin, coriander, cocoa powder, cinnamon, salt, and pepper, cook 5 minutes to soften bits of onions. Stir in the tomato paste and cook 1 minute more. Add the beer and scrape up the drippings. Add 1 cup beef stock and heat through to combine the flavors then cool completely and store for make-ahead meal. The night you would like to serve tamale pie, reheat in a skillet over medium heat while you make the quick-cooking polenta. Preheat broiler. Heat chicken stock and milk to a boil, then whisk in the polenta and cook until thick, 3 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: Polenta needs to be very thick. Stir in butter and honey and season with salt and coarse black pepper. Spread the thick polenta in an even layer over the tamale filling. Top the polenta with cheese and brown under broiler. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 25210,&quot;Jalapeno Pepper Poppers 12 large jalapeno peppers 4 Cheddar cheese sticks 24 pieces center-cut bacon 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/4 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened 2 tablespoons honey Special equipment: 12 toothpicks, soaked in water for 30 minutes Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium heat. Cut about 1/2-inch off the top each jalapeno pepper. Take the top pieces that you just cut off, cut the sides off and reserve, discarding the middle stem pieces. These will be used to plug the open end of each pepper to help keep the cheese from melting out. Using a straight peeler, scrape out the seeds and ribs from the inside of each of the peppers. Slice each cheese stick into pieces that are just slightly shorter than the jalapenos. Stuff a pepper with a piece of cheese. Take the reserved side pieces and place them into the open end of the pepper, covering the cheese and plugging the hole. Take a piece of bacon and wrap the pepper from the bottom end to the top end, making sure to secure the \\plug\\ at the top end. Take a second piece of bacon and lay it down on a clean work surface. Roll up the pepper so that it is almost completely covered in bacon and secure with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining peppers, cheese, bacon and toothpicks. Sprinkle each with chili powder. Place on the grill, cover and cook over indirect heat until the bacon is crispy, 15 to 20 minutes, making sure to turn every 3 to 4 minutes. While the poppers are grilling, combine the sour cream, cream cheese and honey in a small bowl. Mix until well blended and serve with the poppers. Cook&#39;s Note: The poppers can also be made in the oven. Place the poppers onto a baking sheet fitted with a rack that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Bake in a 400 F degree oven until the bacon is brown and crispy, 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM]</p><p>&quot; 25211,&quot;Roasted Root Vegetables with Eggs 2 or 3 small beets, plus 3 cups (110 g) beet greens, washed and chopped 4 tablespoons (60 ml) extra virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1 apple, unpeeled, sliced into eighths 2 small turnips 2 cups sliced carrots, cut into 1/2-inch (12-mm) coins 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary 1 garlic clove 1 tablespoon capers in brine, drained and coarsely chopped 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 to 4 eggs Fleur de sel, for sprinkling Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 F (220 C).<br> Put the beets, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and 1/8 teaspoon salt on a sheet of aluminum foil and wrap thoroughly.

Heat a smoker to 350 degrees F with char-hickory pellets. Cut the neck or narrow end of the butternut squash off to separate it from the round, bulbous bottom end. Scoop the seeds out of the squash bottom and reserve to use as a dip bowl. Peel the narrow end and cut into about 1-inch dice. (You should have about 4 cups of diced squash.) Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the squash, chipotle cl and some salt and saute until the squash starts to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the shredded cheeses with the cornstarch in a bowl and set aside. Add 1 cup water to the squash, then simmer until very tender, about another 10 minutes. Add the milk, then blend using an immersion blender until silky and smooth. Add the cheese, then stir well to help melt the cheese. Season to taste with salt. Transfer the pan to the smoker and let the queso absorb that wonderful smoke until the color is darker and the flavor is smokier, about 30 minutes. Draw a face on your squash bottom if you wish, then add the dip directly to the squash. Carefully light the dried-out sage, then blow it out to create smoke and stick it straight up in your dip. Cover it with a dome or deep bowl (tall enough not to smush the sage bunch); this will infuse the flavor and keep the demons and ghouls away. Remove the dome right when guests are ready to eat. Serve with kale chips, tortilla chips, raw veggies or soft pretzels.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</li></ol><p>&quot; 25229,&quot;Asparagus Canneloni with Chanterelles and Wilted Spinach 1 tablespoon plus 1 cup extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons sliced shallots 1 tablespoon sliced garlic 1 cup blanched asparagus scraps 1/2 cup dry white vermouth 1 cup chicken stock 2 cups spinach leaves Salt and pepper 12 \\Jumbo\\ peeled asparagus-4 inches long 4 ounces blanched pasta sheets 4 tablespoons grated Parmigiano cheese 2 tablespoons butter 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 cup chanterelles 1 teaspoon garlic puree 2 cups spinach leaves 4 chervil Salt and pepper Instructions: Heat a heavy saucepan.

When it begins to shimmer, add sweet onion, ginger root and garlic and cook until the onion becomes translucent, being careful not to burn the garlic. Add the diced sweet potatoes and mango, stir to coat with the oil, and cook for about 5 minutes to allow the flavors to integrate. (Begin heating the grill for the marlin.) While stirring often with a wooden spoon, gradually add the coconut milk in increments, allowing the potatoes to absorb each addition of coconut milk before adding more. When the potato is cooked through but before it becomes mushy, remove from heat and let rest for 10 minutes. Microwave the lime in a small bowl to release the essential oils, and set aside until just cool enough to handle. Brush oil on the marlin and season with salt and pepper and grill over medium-high heat, leaving each side undisturbed for the first few minutes to allow the seasonings to integrate into the surface of the fish and to allow the caramelization process to begin which will prevent tearing. Cook each side for about 4 to 6 minutes, remove from heat, and cover. If it is not cooked enough to your liking, you can finish in a preheated 375 degree F oven. Squeeze lime juice over the risotto and stir in the scallions. (Note: If you keep the sliced side against your palm when you squeeze, the seeds are likely to stay in the rind.)

Switch to the paddle attachment. Add the blackberries. Turn the mixer to low for only about 5 seconds, just long enough for the berries to begin to mix in and break up, but not so long that it turns into a mess. Clean the mixer bowl and attachments and repeat with the remaining 2 sticks butter and the raspberries. With each batch, turn the berry butter out onto a long sheet of plastic wrap set over a long sheet of foil. First seal the plastic wrap around the cylinder, and then secure the foil around it. Twist the ends, gradually applying more pressure as you twist in order to make the cylinder taut. Once it&#39;s a nice, neat cylinder of foil, place into the freezer for 30 minutes in order to quickly solidify it. Then transfer to the fridge until you&#39;re ready to use. The butter should be very firm. For the French toast: Cut the bread into slices 1/2-inch thick. In a dish, whisk the egg yolks with the half-and-half, sugar, vanilla and lemon zest. Dip the bread slices in the egg mixture, coating both sides. Then remove from the dish and set aside. Repeat until all the bread is coated. Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Sizzle some butter in the skillet when hot. Cook the French toast on both sides until golden brown, being careful not to burn. Remove the berry butters from the fridge. Unwrap one end and cut some slices. Lay one slice onto each serving of French toast.

Add the flour and rosewater and mix to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit for at least 2 hours at room temperature and up to 4 hours in the refrigerator. For the saffron syrup: Meanwhile, sprinkle the saffron on the ice cubes and leave it at room temperature until the ice melts. This will be your bloomed saffron.<br> Put the sugar, lemon juice and 1 cup water in a saucepan over medium heat and bring it to a simmer. Lower the heat to medium low and simmer until the syrup starts to thicken a bit, about 10 minutes. If you see sugar crystals on the sides of the saucepan, dip a pastry brush in some water and brush down the sides.<br> Add the rosewater and 1 tablespoon of the bloomed saffron to the syrup (reserve any remaining bloomed saffron in the refrigerator for another use). Simmer until the syrup is the consistency of warm honey (thicker than maple syrup), about 5 more minutes. To check the consistency of the syrup, pour some of it on a small plate and wait for 2 minutes. Rotate the plate and if the syrup does not run easily, it\\u2019s ready. Cover to keep warm and set aside. For the bamieh: Put the butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the saffron syrup and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring to a simmer. Once the mixture starts simmering with small bubbles, add all the flour at once and start mixing using a rubber spatula. Turn the heat to low. Keep mixing, folding and spreading the dough in the saucepan over low heat until the dough is smooth, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a medium mixing bowl and let sit until it\\u2019s almost at room temperature, about 10 minutes.<br> Break the egg in a small bowl and whisk it with a fork. Add the egg to the dough and start mixing using an electric hand mixer until the egg is fully incorporated into the dough. The dough will be very sticky. Transfer the dough to a piping bag with a star tip (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> Pour 1/4 to 1/2 inch of oil into a large frying pan. Brush both blades of a pair of kitchen scissors with oil. Hold the piping bag over the room-temperature oil in the frying pan, squeeze out the dough into the oil and cut every 1 inch with the scissors. Don\\u2019t overcrowd the pan since the pastry will puff when fried. If necessary, work in batches. Place the pan over medium-low heat and wait for it to bubble around the dough.<br> Meanwhile, set a cooling rack over a baking sheet. Check the consistency of the saffron syrup and gently rewarm if necessary.<br> After about 8 minutes, the bamieh pieces will start to puff up and float on the oil. Turn them with a slotted spoon and cook until golden on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes more. Immediately transfer the bamieh to the saffron syrup with the slotted spoon, turning them to coat. Transfer the bamieh to the cooling rack to allow excess syrup to drip off.<br> For the zoolbia: Uncover the bowl with the zoolbia batter and add the baking soda and 1 tablespoon room-temperature water. Stir very well for 2 to 3 minutes. The batter will be a bit bubbly. Let the batter sit at room temperature for another 20 minutes to become smooth. Transfer the batter to a squeeze bottle.<br> Pour 1/2 inch of oil into a small frying pan and heat over medium heat until shimmering. To test if it&#39;s ready, drop a little bit of the batter into the oil--it should puff up and float right away. Turn the heat down a notch so it doesn\\u2019t become too hot.<br> Squeeze the batter into the oil in a circular pattern, crisscrossing occasionally to create a floret-like pattern 3 to 4 inches wide (it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect). Fry until golden on the bottom, 5 to 10 seconds, then flip using a chopstick or slotted spoon and fry until golden on the other side, another 10 seconds. Transfer the zoolbia to the warm saffron syrup and submerge for a few seconds, then transfer to the cooling rack to allow excess syrup to drip off.

Grill the pineapple and mango slices until grill-marked, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Set aside to cool, then slice into 1/4-inch cubes. In a large bowl, combine the fruit with the jalapeno, red cl, onion, olive oil, lemon juice and pickle relish. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Set aside in the fridge. For the hot dogs: Set a grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook the bacon for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, just to render some fat, not to cook through. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. With a sharp knife, make a small lengthwise slit down the center of each hot dog (do not cut all the way through). Cut the jalapeno slices so you can unroll them into long strips. Place 2 or 3 jalapeno strips into the slit of each hot dog. Wrap each dog with a strip of bacon and secure it in place with toothpicks. In the same grill pan used for the bacon, cook the hot dogs until the bacon is cooked through and crisp, rotating frequently, 5 to 6 minutes total. To serve, toast the buns for 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the toothpicks from the hot dogs and nestle the dogs in the buns.

Grease the sides and bottom of a 10-inch round cake pan with butter. For the filling: In a bowl, add the brown sugar, pecans, diced apple, lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom and a pinch of salt. Stir until combined. In a small pot, melt the 2 tablespoons butter with a pinch of salt. Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour. Flatten the puff pastry and roll with a rolling pin to even out and seal the perforations, if any. Brush the butter all over the puff pastry, leaving a 1-inch border at one of the shorter ends. Sprinkle the apple-cinnamon mixture evenly over the pastry sheet, being careful to leave that 1-inch border. Starting from the end furthest from the edge without any filling, begin to tightly roll the pastry. Tuck and press as you go, keeping the log as even as possible. When the edge is reached, roll the pastry onto itself and press firmly, even pinching, to seal. Using a serrated knife, trim the edges and gently cut 6 equal slices from each log. Repeat with the second puff pastry sheet to make 12 pieces total. Place the slices spiral side up in the prepared cake pan. Start around the edges and fill in the center. Bake until the pastry is cooked through and golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Meanwhile, for the glaze: In a small pot, add the butter and melt over low heat. Add the vanilla extract and lemon juice and begin whisking in the powdered sugar in 1/4 cup increments. Continue adding and whisking between additions until the glaze thickens. Season with a pinch of salt, then remove from the heat. Remove the buns from the oven and pour the glaze over the top. Let rest about 5 minutes before serving.

Chop onion into large chunks and saute in oil until lightly cooked, about 5 minutes. Add the beer and the clams. Cover and cook until all of the clams are opened, about 10 to 15 minutes depending on how many you have in the pan. Remove pan from heat, uncover and allow to cool to the touch before shucking. Push the clams to the side so that there is broth visible to rinse the clams in after shucking. Remove clams from shell 1 at a time and pull off membrane that covers the neck and discard. Rinse shucked clams in broth and set aside. When all clams are shucked, drain the broth out of them by giving them a slight squeeze over the pan of broth. Chop roughly and set aside. For the tartar sauce: Mix all ingredients in a small bowl to serve with clam cakes. Refrigerate until serving. For the clam cakes: In a deep-fryer or on the stove top in a deep skillet, preheat oil to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Fold in eggs, evaporated milk and clam broth until thoroughly mixed. Stir in clams and mix well. Dip a spoon into the heated oil, then take a 2 tablespoon sized scoop of the fritter mixture and carefully drop into oil. Turn the cake over when the first side is browned. Fritters should be cooked through and browned in 4 to 5 minutes. Remove with a skimmer and drain on brown paper bag. Reseason with additional salt, if desired. Serve with the tartar sauce and enjoy!

Add the chicken pieces and submerge them to coat. Allow to sit for at least 30 minutes but ideally as long as possible (up to 2 hours at room temperature or up to 8 hours refrigerated). Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F; set a rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Combine the flour, salt, baking soda and mustard powder in a bowl. Remove the chicken from the soak mixture and add to the flour mixture, turning to coat. Remove, dip again in the soak mixture and then again in the flour mixture. Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a very large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, shallow-fry the chicken, turning once, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part (avoid the bone) registers 165 degrees F, around 15 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to the prepared baking sheet and place in the oven to finish cooking through, if necessary. Serve fired chicken with plum cornbread and bacon green beans. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch cast-iron skillet or an 8- by 8-inch square baking pan. Combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Combine the milk, honey, vanilla and eggs in another mixing bowl and whisk to thoroughly combine. Just before combining the wet and dry ingredients, whisk in the melted butter into the wet mixture. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients into the well. Mix gently to combine. When the mixture has just come together, transfer it to the prepared skillet or baking pan. Sprinkle the plums in an even layer over the top of the batter. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool before cutting. Bring a stock pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Prepare a bowl of ice water and shock the beans to stop the cooking process. Add the oil and bacon to a saute pan over medium-high heat.

Slowly pour in the boiling water while stirring, until you have a coarse meal mixture. Stir in 1/2 cup cold water to form a dough. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let sit for 20 minutes. For the filling: In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, chicken broth, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, salt, scallions and a bunch of turns of pepper. To assemble the dumplings, divide the dough into 24 balls. Roll them out into 4-inch circles, flouring the surface as needed. Place 1 tablespoon filling in the center of each and fold in half to make a half-moon shape, pleating the edges to seal well. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Heat a thin layer of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Boil the dumplings in batches for 4 minutes. Remove them with a slotted spoon, allowing excess water to drip off, then transfer to the hot oil (be careful because this step can get spitty). Cook until the dumplings are browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel and let cool slightly. Alternatively, to steam the dumplings, line a bamboo steamer with blanched cabbage and steam over boiling water until the filling is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. For the dipping sauce: In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, scallion and red pepper. Serve the dumplings with the dipping sauce &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 25263,&quot;Wine Can Chicken 1 chicken (3 to 4 pounds) One 12-ounce can ros wine 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves, plus 1 sprig 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, plus 1 sprig 10 cloves garlic Kosher salt 2 teaspoons pink peppercorns 2 ounces garlic-herb cheese, such as Boursin Instructions: Take the chicken and wine out of the fridge and allow to come room temperature, 15 to 30 minutes. Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes turn off one of the middle burners (2 if you have a grill with 4 or more burners). For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. The grill should be around 400 degrees F so adjust the burners or air-flow vents as necessary to maintain that temperature. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer\\u2019s guide for the best results.) Combine the olive oil, oregano, rosemary leaves, thyme leaves, garlic and 2 teaspoons salt in a food processor and pure into a paste. Open the wine and pour off 1/3 cup for another use. Tuck the rosemary and thyme sprigs into the can. Rub the chicken all over, including the cavity, with the garlic-herb paste. Place the wine can on a baking sheet. Place the cavity of the chicken onto the wine can so the can is holding up the chicken and its legs act as a stabilizer. Carefully transfer the chicken and can onto the indirect side of the grill. Close the lid and grill until the chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken and can from the grill and gently pull the chicken off the can. Tent the chicken with aluminum foil. Pour the remaining wine (about 1 cup) into a small saucepan. Add the peppercorns and set on the direct heat side of the grill. Bring to a boil and reduce by half, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cheese until smooth. Serve the chicken with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 25264,&quot;Okra Pilau 3 slices bacon, chopped (about 4 ounces) 1/2 cup chopped picnic ham (about 2 ounces)<br> 1/2 cup chopped onion<br> 1 teaspoon granulated garlic<br> 2 cups sliced fresh okra (about 6 ounces)<br> 4 cups chicken stock<br> 2 cups raw converted rice<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper Instructions: Fry the bacon and ham in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes.

Then put the saucepan over a low heat until the sugar dissolves entirely. Halve the plums and remove the pits, then halve them again if they are big brutes. Once the sugar&#39;s dissolved into the red liquid, add the cinnamon stick, then turn the heat up, bring to the boil and let the pan bubble away for a couple of minutes until the mixture is on the way to becoming syrupy. Now turn the syrup down to a simmer and add the plum halves or quarters and cook them gently for about 10 minutes, although note that this is based on starting off with viciously unripe fruits so you might need less time. Once the plums are tender but not disintegrating, remove the pan from the heat, cover and leave to keep warm. You can make the plums in advance and either serve them at room temperature with the French toast or warm them up again. For the French toast: Whisk together the eggs, milk, ground cinnamon and sugar in a pie dish. Sit 2 pieces of bread in the eggy mixture, turning after each side has soaked up enough to color the bread yellow, so that it absorbs the liquid but doesn&#39;t fall to pieces. Melt half the butter in a frying pan and cook the 2 soaked pieces of bread for a couple of minutes each side. Transfer the yellow, eggy bread, scorched golden in parts, to warm waiting plates. Meanwhile, soak the next 2 slices. Melt the remaining butter to cook the last 2 slices in the same way. Serve alongside the beautiful scarlet plum compote. Make Ahead Note: The compote can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to bowl to cool, then cover and refrigerate. Warm the compote gently in saucepan before serving. Freeze Note: Cooled compote can be frozen in airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and reheat as above. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 25266,&quot;Maple French Toast and Bacon Cupcakes 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup cake flour 1 3.9-ounce box instant vanilla pudding mix 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 tablespoon potato starch 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 1/4 cup maple syrup 1/2 cup half-and-half, at room temperature 1/2 cup chopped cooked bacon (5 strips) 1 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 cups sifted confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup maple syrup 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 3 strips bacon, cooked and chopped (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Saute potatoes, shaking the pan frequently, until golden brown, about 5 -7 minutes. With slotted spoon transfer to a mixing bowl. In same skillet saute onions, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for another minute. Add tomatoes, oregano, and cook an additional minute. Remove from heat and stir in olives. Add mixture to mixing bowl. Add pepper. Stir well to combine and set aside. Heat the grill or preheat oven to 450 degrees. In another skillet, heat vegetable oil until hot, but not smoking. Using tongs, dip each tortilla in the oil, and cook for about 30 seconds each side. Drain on a paper towel. Season fish fillet with salt and pepper. On tin foil, arrange 3 tortillas so they overlap in the center to form a triangle. Place fish fillet in the center. Divide potato mixture into 6 parts and mound 1 portion evenly over the fillet. Fold over tortillas to enclose the stuffing, forming a triangle. Wrap the fish in tin foil. Repeat the wrapping and mounding process with the remaining fillets. To grill, cook 9 minutes on each side on a moderately hot spot on the grill. To bake, place the packets directly on the oven rack and cook for 20 - 25 minutes. To serve, unwrap and discard the foil and, with a spatula, transfer the fish to plates. Open the tortillas to resemble the leaves of a flower. Though they can be eaten, the real purpose of the tortillas is to add moisture and flavor. Serve with lime wedges as garnish. In large bowl combine all ingredients and stir until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Divide the dough into 24 golf ball size pieces for tacos and 23 large bowls for quesadillas. Place on a platter and cover with a damp towel. Toast or fry as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 25293,&quot;Holiday Mule 2 sprigs rosemary, plus more for garnish 4 cups white rum 1 cup sugar 1 3-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled Pure maple syrup and turbinado sugar, for rimming the cups 2 cups Cheerwine Holiday Punch (or other cherry soda) Lime slices and frozen cherries, for garnish Instructions: Make the rosemary-infused rum: Place a sprig of rosemary in each of two 16-ounce mason jars.

Return pan to stove, reduce heat to medium and add the remaining. Add crushed pepper, sliced mushrooms, and garlic. Season with salt (salt is a magnet for drawing out liquid). Cover and cook mushrooms 5 minutes or until mushrooms are dark, tender and have given off their juices. Add about 1/2 cup of beef broth to intensify the wild mushroom flavor, then stir in the tomatoes and parsley. Cut the chicken into bite-size chunks or slices and add to sauce. Simmer sauce 5 minutes to finish cooking chicken pieces and to allow the flavors to combine. Toss pasta with cacciatore and serve with crusty bread and grated cheese. Tidbits: Beef broth and stock is now available in resealable paper containers, which can be found on the soup aisle of your market. These paper containers make storage of remaining broth easier; keep some on hand in your refrigerator. Beef broth is used instead of chicken broth in this recipe because it pairs better with the beefy taste of portobello mushrooms. The broth will make your cacciatore taste as if it simmered all day because it accents the mushroom taste well. Depending on your brand, 1 large can of tomatoes can vary in weight from 28 to 32 ounces. Use your favorite, but check to make sure the product is sugar free. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 25393,&quot;Dutch Baby 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 large eggs 3/4 cup milk 3/4 cup flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon vanilla Butter 1 lemon Powdered sugar Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Put an oven rack in the lowest position with a 6-inch clearance above. Cut eight 6-inch squares of heavy-duty foil and eight 1-inch squares of heavy-duty foil. Using the larger foil squares, wrap each sugar cone, molding to the shape of the cone to cover completely and tucking in excess. Spray the outside of the foil generously with cooking spray and set aside. Add 1 teaspoon canola oil to a medium pan over medium-high heat, then add the onions. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are soft, about 4 minutes. Add the beef and garlic and cook, breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 2 minutes, then add the chili powder and 1 teaspoon salt and stir well to incorporate. Add the salsa and 1/3 cup of water and cook, breaking apart the meat and stirring, until the sauce is bubbly and the beef is browned, 4 minutes more. Remove from the heat and set aside. Brush both sides of each of the tortillas using the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Wrap a tortilla around a sugar cone and secure the seam with a toothpick. Trim the top of the tortilla with scissors to make an even edge. Put it on a large baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and cones. Bake for 5 minutes, then wrap the tip of each cone with the small foil squares to keep the tips from burning. Return to the oven until the cones are lightly browned and crisp and hold their shape, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove the foil tips, and carefully remove the foil cone inserts and the toothpicks. Unwrap and reserve the sugar cones for another use. If the tortilla cones are still soft, return them, empty, to the oven, to cook until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes more.<br> Meanwhile reheat the meat filling and set it out along with the cheese, avocado, cilantro, sour cream, jalapenos, tomatoes, salsa, hot sauce and lime wedges for a taco bar.

In a separate large saute pan heat half the oil (1/4 cup). Add the diced onion, garlic, and corn kernels. Use a wooden spoon to saute together until the onions appear translucent, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, toss the diced potatoes with the remaining (1/4 cup) oil and season them with salt and pepper. Add the potatoes to the saute pan with the onion, garlic and corn. Stir with a wooden spoon and allow surface of potatoes to toast lightly. Gradually add the heated chicken broth to the saute pan just enough to cover the potatoes and corn mixture. Over a medium to medium high heat, the potatoes will cook in the broth and by the end of cooking time; most of the liquid should evaporate. If the broth has boiled away before the potatoes are cooked, add more broth in an amount that is just enough to cover. Be careful to neither burn the potatoes nor allow them to turn too soft. When the potatoes are done, a fork can easily go through, remove from the heat, stir in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper, as needed. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Trim the salmon by removing a 1 1/2-inch strip from the belly side. Divide into 5 ounce portions, leaving the skin on. Season with salt and pepper. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large oven safe skillet over high heat. Sear fillets beginning with flesh side down first. Do not disturb the fillets for the first 2 to 3 minutes; do not even shake the pan. You will see the surface of the salmon beginning to caramelize. Flip the fillets so that the skin side is now down, and sear until skin is lightly crisped. Transfer fish to a baking dish in the oven to finish. Fish is done when flesh springs back when touched, internal temperature of 140 degrees F. Do not overcook, as fish will continue to cook for a few minutes even after it is removed from oven, known as carryover cooking. (Remember to use oven mitts for the handle when removing that pan from the oven.) Spoon potato/corn \\risotto\\ in center of serving plate.

Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse cornmeal mixed with pea-sized bits of cold butter. (If the butter gets too soft, refrigerate the mixture for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Use a fork to stir in the egg and water mixture until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is dry, add up to 1 tablespoon more cold water.) Divide the dough into two equal-sized disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. For the filling: Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges and place in a bowl with the lemon juice and cranberries, tossing to combine. Add the sugar and toss again to combine evenly. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apple mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low, cooking until the apples soften and release most of their juices and the cranberries have burst, about 7 minutes. Strain the apple mixture into a colander set over the bowl, shaking it to collect as much of the juice as possible. Pour the liquid back into the skillet, add the cinnamon and ginger, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes. Return the reduced juice and the apple mixture to the bowl and toss to recombine. Chill the filling until it cools completely, at least an hour and up to 2 days. To assemble the pie: On a lightly floured surface, roll each disk into an 11- to 12-inch circle. Lay each dough circle between two pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. Place a baking sheet on a rack positioned in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish with one of the dough discs and trim it to leave a 1/2-inch overhang on all sides. Stir the cornstarch into the filling and add it to the pan. Use a chef&#39;s knife, pizza cutter or fluted dough cutter to cut the second round into 1/2-inch thick strips. Lay strips of dough, evenly spaced, across the entire pie. Weave more strips of dough perpendicular through the previous strips to make a lattice or basket weave design across the entire pie. Trim the excess ends from the strips of dough. Pinch the bottom crust edge and lattice edge together, and flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Bake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes. If the edges begin to brown too fast, cover them with strips of aluminum foil. Let the pie cool 1 hour before serving. Once completely cooled, the pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25410,&quot;Peanut Butter Burger 5 pounds ground Angus beef (preferred lean/fat content 80/20) 1 tablespoon sea salt 1 tablespoon seasoning salt 1/2 tablespoon cracked peppercorn 3 cloves fresh garlic, minced 8 ounces applewood smoked bacon White burger buns Creamy peanut butter 20 slices American cheese Instructions: Combine the beef with the sea salt, seasoning salt, pepper and garlic.

Using clean hands, crush the tomatoes into small pieces. Add the brown sugar, salt, red pepper flakes and thyme sprigs and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have released almost all of their liquid and the mixture is very thick and has reduced down to 1 1/2 cups, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Remove the thyme sprigs, transfer the jam to a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour. For the rugelach dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the flour, Parmesan cheese, granulated sugar and salt. Add the butter, distributing it all over the top of the dry ingredients, then dollop in the cream cheese. Mix on low speed until the dough is mostly mealy and there are still some large clumps of butter and cream cheese intact. With the mixer still running, add the egg yolks and continue mixing until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half and shape into 2 small rectangles. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. Arrange an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Beat the remaining whole egg in a small bowl with a splash of water for an egg wash. Roll out one dough on a lightly floured surface, dusting with flour as needed to prevent it from sticking, until it is a wide rectangle, 18 by 9 inches. Use an offset spatula to spread half of the tomato jam over the dough in a thin even layer, leaving a 1-inch border along the long edge that is farthest from you. Brush the border with a thin layer of egg wash. Starting on the long end closest to you, roll the dough into a long, tight log. Repeat with the second dough, remaining tomato jam and more of the egg wash. Brush the logs with a thin layer of egg wash, then sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon of everything bagel seasoning. Cut the logs into 1 1/2-inch slices and transfer to the baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart with the seam side down. Bake each batch on the middle rack until golden brown on top; begin checking at 20 minutes. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Form the cookie dough into 12 equal-sized balls and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 16 to 18 minutes until lightly browned around the edges. Cool for 10 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes. In a small bowl, toss together the chocolate chips and oil. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes. Spread the melted chocolate on top of 6 of the cooled cookies. Place on a parchment or waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle the chocolate-toffee candy pieces on top of the melted chocolate. Place the remaining cookies, flat-side-up, on the same baking sheet. Arrange the banana slices in a single layer on the flat side of the remaining cookies. Freeze all the cookies for 45 to 60 minutes until the chocolate has set and the banana slices are frozen. Using an ice cream scoop, scoop about 1/3 cup softened ice cream on top of the frozen bananas. Place a chocolate covered cookie on top and gently press to form a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining ice cream and cookies.

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat and place a rack on top. Halve the butternut squash lengthwise. Remove the seeds and discard. Using a melon baller, cut a channel into the neck of the squash, leaving a 3/4-inch border of flesh on the sides and bottom. Save the removed squash for another use or discard. Season the flesh with salt and pepper.<br> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat in a small skillet. Add the celery and onions and cook just until softened, about 3 minutes. Combine the celery and onions, cornbread, rosemary, thyme, sage, cranberries and pecans in a bowl and toss to combine well. Add the vegetable stock and mix just until moistened and combined. Season with salt and pepper.<br> Line the bottom of each butternut squash half with a layer of green beans. Top with the cornbread filling. Lay the carrot down the middle of 1 of the squash halves. Spread about 1 teaspoon of the butter over the carrot (enough to generously coat) and dot the cornbread mixture evenly with the remaining butter. Sprinkle the carrot with the brown sugar.

(There is no need to refrigerate it.) Change the water and continue soaking for another hour. Drain again and rinse under cold running water. Put the tasajo in a large, heavy pot and add about 6 quarts of water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered for 1 hour. Add the pork, beef brisket, and bay leaf, and let the three meats cook together until tender. Remove the pot from the heat and skim as much fat as possible from the broth. (If you have time, the best way is to refrigerate the broth overnight until the fat solidifies and then remove it.) Make the Sofrito: Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat and saute the onions and green pepper until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes more. Add the pepper, cumin, and tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the sofrito to the broth and simmer, covered, while you prepare the vegetables. Complete the Dish: Peel the malanga, boniato, name, yucca, and calabaza and cube them. Cut the corn and green plaintains into 1 1/2-inch pieces. With a knife, split the skin of each piece of green plantain and open it away from the center as if you were taking off a coat. Sprinkle the plantain pieces with the lime juice. Slit the semi-ripe and ripe plantains lengthwise and slice them crosswise into 1 1/2-inch rounds. Do not remove their skins or they will disintegrate in the stew. Add the green plantains to the simmering stew. After about 15 minutes, add the semiripe plantains. After another 15 minutes, add the ripe plantains and let them simmer for about 10 minutes. Serve hot in soup plates or, cocido-style, with the meats, vegetables, and broth in separate dishes. (Each diner removes the skin from the semi-ripe plantains themselves). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 25464,&quot;Smoky Mac and Cheese Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound dry rigatoni 4 cups heavy cream 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 3 shakes of your favorite hot sauce, optional 8 ounces cream cheese 8 ounces Gouda, shredded 1 pound ham, diced 1 cup panko breadcrumbs 1/2 cup grated pecorino 1/2 cup sliced scallions, optional Instructions: Heat a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package directions for al dente, then drain and set aside. Set up your grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. Heat a deep 12-inch cast-iron skillet over direct heat. Combine the cream, paprika, cayenne and hot sauce if using in the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and simmer until the cream mixture is reduced by half and thickened, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the cream cheese and Gouda until fully melted. Stir in the ham and cooked pasta and continue to mix until fully combined. Stir together the panko, pecorino and scallions if using in a medium bowl. Sprinkle the panko mixture evenly over the mac and cheese. Move the skillet to indirect heat, cover the grill and cook until golden brown and bubbly, about 5 minutes. (Alternatively, you can make the mac and cheese in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet on a stovetop over medium-high heat, then top with the panko mixture and bake in a 400 degrees F oven for 10 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]</p><p>&quot; 25465,&quot;Hasselback Sweet Potatoes 6 medium sweet potatoes 6 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Fresh sage and rosemary sprigs, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place a potato between the handles of 2 wooden spoons or chopsticks. Slice the potato into thin slices, leaving 1/4 inch at the bottom unsliced; the spoons or chopsticks will prevent you slicing all the way through. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. Mix together the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon with a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl. Place the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet.

Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Spam and cook until browned around the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the chopped kimchi and cook until it releases most of its liquid and browns slightly around the edges, about 3 minutes. Add the rice to the skillet and break it up with a wooden spoon; stir to combine. Stir in the kimchi brine, butter, garlic, soy sauce and sesame oil; cook until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the skillet to ensure there is no burning rice. Season with salt. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Keep warm. In a separate large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over low heat until slightly shimmering, about 5 minutes. Crack the eggs into the skillet; cover and cook until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Season with salt. Divide the fried rice among plates or bowls and top each serving with a fried egg.

Add about one-third of the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like cornmeal. Add the remaining butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Add the vanilla seeds, bourbon and 2 to 3 tablespoons ice water; pulse until the dough just comes together. Turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap; shape into a disk and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Put a baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers or a fork. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine the heavy cream, bourbon and cinnamon stick in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; bring to a simmer. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let cool slightly. Whisk in the pumpkin, eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Set aside. Line the crust with foil, then fill with pie weights or dried beans. Transfer to the hot baking sheet in the oven and bake until lightly golden around the edge, about 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and continue baking until the crust is dry and golden all over, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely; leave the baking sheet in the oven. Reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F. Discard the cinnamon stick from the filling; pour into the cooled crust and return the pie to the hot baking sheet. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is set, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. (Tent the crust with foil if it browns too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]</p><p>&quot; 25468,&quot;Bolo&#39;s Duck Salad 1 (2 to 3 pound duck (skin pricked all over with a fork) 1 cup red wine 1 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons anise seed 3 whole cinnamon sticks 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 1 cup orange juice 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon honey 1 teaspoon ancho or cayenne pepper (optional) 1/2 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground pepper 4 cups mesclun 3 Red or Bosc pears, peeled, cored and cut into eighths 1 stick unsalted butter 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup lightly salted peanuts, skins removed Peanut brittle, chopped finely Chopped chives Instructions: Make the duck/marinade: 8 hours to 1 day before serving, prick the entire skin of the duck all over with a fork. In a large pot over high heat, bring 6 quarts of water to a rapid boil and blanch the duck for 7 to 8 minutes in hot water. Remove the duck from the water and place on a plate in the refrigerator. Allow the duck to sit 3 to 4 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and wipe the rendered fat from the skin of the duck. In a medium saucepan, combine the marinade ingredients and cook over low to medium heat until thickened. (Do not boil. This will give the marinade a burnt taste due to the amount of brown sugar). Allow the marinade to cool then brush the duck generously with the mixture. (Reserve some of the marinade to baste the duck with while roasting.) Refrigerate 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the duck in a roasting pan and roast for 15 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade every 5 minutes. Remove the duck from the oven and let rest 10 minutes. Remove the breasts from the bone and the thighs with the legs attached. Place the thigh/legs into a medium saucepan pan with 1-inch of water in it. Cover the pan and place in the 350 degree oven for approximately 40 minutes or until the meat falls off the bone. Remove from the oven and set aside. When cool enough to handle pick the meat from the bone and tear into bite sized-pieces. Just before serving, place the breasts in a oven-proof skillet skin-side-down and heat 6 to 8 minutes (depending on your preference of doneness, i.e. rare, medium rare). Slice the breasts very thinly on the bias (each breast should yield 3 servings). Keep the meat warm until service. Make the vinaigrette: In a saucepan over high heat, reduce the orange juice until it forms a syrup. Let cool. In a blender, combine the orange syrup, vinegar, honey and chili powder (if using). Blend for 30 seconds. With the blender running, slowly add the olive oil until the dressing emulsifies. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour into a plastic squeeze bottle. (May be prepared up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated.) Bring to room temperature before serving. Make the sauteed pears: In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter, sugar and cinnamon and cook to a light syrup. Add the sliced pears and cook until they are soft but still retain their shape. Set aside. Make the peanut brittle Make a caramel with the sugar, add the peanuts and pour onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Let harden and coarsely chop. Assemble the salad: In a large bowl dress mesclun greens lightly with some of the orange vinaigrette and arrange on the top halves of 6 plates. Arrange the breast in a fan shape beneath the greens and place the thigh meat on both sides of the greens. Scatter the pears over the duck and dress lightly with the remaining vinaigrette. Top with peanut brittle and chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 25469,&quot;Asian Pear Salad with Tamari Pecans and Maytag Blue Cheese 2 tablespoons pear vinegar 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon pear syrup (fresh pear juice reduced to a syrup) 2 teaspoons extra virgin lemon oil 6 cups assorted full-flavored greens (baby mustard, lovage, arugula, dandelion, mizzuna, etc.) 1/4 cup tamari pecans, recipe follows 1/4 cup dried currants or chopped raisins 1/4 cup cold Maytag blue cheese, crumbled 1 ripe Asian pear, cored and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon high quality tamari 2 teaspoons molasses Salt and cayenne pepper 1 cup shelled pecan halves Instructions: Place the pear vinegar and pear syrup in a small mixing bowl. Whisk in the lemon-o and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine the greens, tamari pecans, and currants. Sprinkle over with the blue cheese, then drizzle over with the dressing. Toss the salad gently and briefly, as you do not want the cheese crumbles to begin sticking together. Divide the salad onto the center of 2 chilled salad plates and garnish by fanning the pear slices around each salad. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the tamari and molasses. Season, to taste, with salt and cayenne pepper. Toss with the pecans until they are well coated. Transfer the pecans onto a kitchen towel and allow to briefly drain. Roast the pecans on an icing rack until the pecans are fairly dry and toasted. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. Chop the pecans into 1/4-inch pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 25470,&quot;Boston Trifle 1 cup sifted cake flour 7 tablespoons granulated sugar 7 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 7 large eggs, room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 1/3 cups half and half 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 4 egg yolks<br> 1/4 cup unsifted all purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br> 1 teaspoon dark rum<br> 1 cup (8 ounces) heavy cream 4 ounces semisweet chocolate 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate 3 ounces (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter Instructions: Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 300 degrees. Pour the flour and 7 tablespoons of sugar in that order into a triple sifter or sieve. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper, and set aside. (Sifting the two together disperses and separates the particles of flour so that when dry ingredients are added later to the batter, folding in the flour is easier and more efficient, requiring less folding to incorporate. Measure the additional 7 tablespoons and 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar; set aside.<br> Separate the eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a heavyduty mixer and yolks in a 1 1/2 quart bowl. (A deep bowl this size makes it more efficient for whipping the yolks thoroughly since it minimizes the surface area.) With an electric hand mixer, whip the yolks on high speed (#10) for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the vanilla, and continue whipping for 15 seconds to incorporate; the mixture should appear thicker, pale yellow, and increased in volume. Test the consistency by lifting some of the mixture with the beaters. If it flows back into the bowl in ribbons that slowly dissolve on the surface, proceed to whipping the whites. But if the ribbons sink into the surface immediately, continue whipping until the yolks have the desired consistency.<br> Attach the bowl of whites to the mixer, and with the whisk attachment, whip on mediumlow speed (#3) for 30 to 45 seconds to break them up. When small bubbles appear and the surface is frothy, stop the machine, and sprinkle the cream of tartar and the 1 tablespoon granulated sugar in the center. Resume whipping, increasing speed to medium (#5), for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the whites appear glossy and stiff but not dry or granular. Detach the whisk and bowl, tapping the whisk against the side of the bowl with enough force to free the excess. Pour the yolks onto the whites (notice they float on the surface). Using just a few strokes, fold the two together with a rubber spatula. Don&#39;t be concerned if some of the yolks remain visible. Sprinkle half of 7 tablespoons sugar over the surface, and fold to incorporate. Sprinkle with the remaining sugar, folding again to incorporate.<br> With the aid of a metal spatula, scoop a third of the flour, and sprinkle it over the egg mixture; with a rubber spatula, fold to incorporate. Repeat two more times, folding just until incorporated after each addition.<br> Gently pour batter into an ungreased 9-inch springform pan with the aid of a rubber spatula and smooth the surface level. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until the top is golden. (The batter hardly rises during the first 20 to 30 minutes of baking. The low oven temperature allows the batter to absorb heat slowly, so rising is gradual. Toward the end of baking the cake may mound high above the pan&#39;s rim. That&#39;s fine. As it cools, this dome will contract a bit.) When finished baking, the cake should feel spongy, springing back slightly upon being lightly touched. A toothpick, inserted in the center, comes out free of cake. The toothpick is the last test for this cake before you judge if it is finished baking and remove it from the oven. If in doubt, baking 5 to 7 more minutes will not harm the cake.<br> Remove spongecake from the oven, and immediately turn it upside down, positioning the edges of the pan on the inverted glasses. This position, defying gravity, allows the cake to maintain its spongy structure without deflating while cooling. Cool the cake for 2 hours; then turn the pan right side up, and place it on the counter. Though the cake is cool to the touch, let it sit for at least 1 more hour to cool the inside completely. (The cake&#39;s structure is less fragile when cool, making removal easier.) To release the spongecake and maintain its shape perfectly, remove it from the pan as follows: Carefully loosen the cake crust that is stuck to the top rim of the pan; insert a thin metal spatula down 1/8 inch, and loosen and free the crust all around the cake. Then tilt and rotate pan, tapping it gently on the counter to free the sponge from the metal sides. Tap more if it is not completely released. Finally, release the spring mechanism, and slowly remove the rim. (You&#39;ll notice the cake seemed to have had a slipcover because a thin, crusty layer of cake remains on the springform rim; it&#39;s delicious, too.) Now tilt the cake on its side, and gently tap the metal bottom on the counter. Rotate the cake as you tap until the removable bottom appears free. Additional tapping may be necessary before it comes off completely. Patience will ensure a perfectly shaped cake. For the filling: Pour the half and half into a 1 1/2 quart heavy bottomed saucepan, add the 1/2 cup sugar, and stir to combine. In a 1 quart bowl whisk the egg yolks and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar to combine. Add the flour, and whisk to combine. Bring the half and half mixture just to a boil over medium heat. Remove, and pour half of the hot liquid over the yolk mixture, whisking to combine. Pour the yolk mixture into saucepan, and over medium heat bring it to a boil again, stirring constantly. When it is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat, pour it into a 3 quart mixing bowl to cool, and cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a crust from forming on the cream. (This bowl size is to allow room for folding in the whipped cream later.) Pierce the plastic with the tip of a knife to let steam escape and cool faster. Refrigerate. For the glaze: Chop the chocolate into matchstick size pieces with a chef&#39;s knife on a dry cutting board. Place first the butter, then the chocolate pieces in the top portion of a 1 1/2 quart double boiler (or a 1 quart mixing bowl that fits snugly over a saucepan or another mixing bowl). Fill the bottom vessel half full with hot tap water (120130 degrees) and place the chocolate/butter bowl on top to melt. You may put the double boiler on the stove over a very low flame just to maintain the water&#39;s temperature while melting the mixture if you wish. Stir occasionally to blend until the mixture is smooth, shiny and liquid. Remove from the water, and set aside. Yield: One scant cup. Assembling the Trifle: Split the spongecake evenly into three layers, each about 7/8-inch thick, using a 12inch serrated knife in a sawing motion. Lift the top two layers, one at a time, and set aside (this is easy because each layer is spongy and thick). Stir the vanilla and rum into the cold custard. Whip the heavy cream in a 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl to the Chantilly stage, and fold into the custard mixture. Place the bottom cake layer of cake in a 2 1/2 to 3 quart glass bowl, and cover it with half of the filling, spreading evenly with a rubber spatula. Center the middle layer on top, and cover it with the remaining filling. Center the last layer on top. Cover the dessert with plastic wrap and refrigerate.<br> Spoon 1 cup of the Chocolate Butter Glaze into a 1 quart bowl over a bowl of hot tap water (120 to 130 degrees). Stir until liquid and smooth. Spread the glaze over the top of the dessert evenly with a metal or rubber spatula. With a 2inch paring knife, scrape the tip of the blade firmly but gently down a bar of chocolate. If the chocolate&#39;s surface area is cool, you will get fine flakes; if it&#39;s slightly warm, the shapes will be very small corkscrews. Sprinkle Chocolate Flakes around the rim of the dessert.

Butter three 8-inch cake pans and line the bottoms and sides with parchment. Set aside. Mix together the milk and half-and-half, set aside. Sift together both flours and baking powder; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter. Sprinkle in the sugar and salt and beat on medium speed until light in color and fluffy in texture. Add the vanilla bean paste and mix until just combined. Gradually add the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl frequently. Add the dry ingredients in thirds, alternating with the wet ingredients, starting and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; don&#39;t overbeat. Transfer the batter to the cake pans and bake until an inserted toothpick comes out clean or with a few crumbs, about 30 minutes. Let cool at 10 minutes before turning out of the pans onto a rack to cool completely. For the lemon curd: In a heat-safe mixing bowl, mix together the sugar, lemon zest, eggs and salt. Place the bowl over (not in) a saucepan of simmering water and stir in the lemon juice. Gradually add the cubed butter and stir until everything is incorporated. Continue to stir over low heat until the curd thickens and becomes lighter in color and a bit fluffy, about 10 minutes. The curd will thicken at about 170 degrees F.<br> Remove from the heat and pour into a bowl. Put plastic wrap directly on the surface of the lemon curd to avoid a skin from forming and refrigerate. For the Italian meringue buttercream: Combine 3/4 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and cook until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the heat to medium-high, attach a candy thermometer to the saucepan and cook until the mixture reaches reach 248 degrees F. While the sugar syrup is heating, combine the egg whites and pinch of cream of tartar in a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment and whip, slowly sprinkling in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, until you reach medium peaks. When the sugar syrup reaches temperature, pour it very carefully down the side of the bowl of egg whites and continue to whip until you have a white, glossy meringue. Replace the whip with a paddle attachment, add the butter in chunks and beat until the buttercream comes together. Beat in the vanilla bean paste. Set aside. For the strawberry filling: Grind or crush the strawberries into a fine consistency, set aside.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the cream cheese. Add 1 pound of the Italian meringue buttercream and mix just until combined. Add the strawberries and mix just until combined. To assemble the cake: Put a layer of cake in the center of a platter. Add a thin layer of lemon curd, then a layer of the strawberry buttercream filling. Add the second layer of cake. Spread with a thin layer of lemon curd, and then a layer of the vanilla Italian meringue buttercream.

Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant and slightly softened, about 2 more minutes. Add the achiote paste and mix well to incorporate. Add the orange and pineapple juices and bring to a boil. Once it boils, turn the heat off and carefully transfer to a blender. Cool. Process the mixture until smooth, about 2 minutes. Set aside. Sprinkle the pork butt heavily with salt and pepper on all sides. Arrange the orange skins on the bottom of a slow cooker, skin-side up (this adds more flavor to the pork and ensures the meat will not dry out). Place the pork butt on top of the oranges. Pour the achiote puree inside the slow cooker. Cover the slow cooker and turn on to high heat. Let it cook until the pork is tender and ready to shred, about 5 hours. Turn the slow cooker off and remove the oranges from the pot and discard. Let the pork cool slightly before shredding. Using two forks or with clean hands, shred the pork. Return the shredded meat to the slow cooker filled with sauce and keep warm until ready to serve. For the pickled habaneros: Mix the habanero chiles, lime juice, olive oil, oregano and salt into a small bowl. Mix well to incorporate. Let stand at least 20 minutes. They can be made 1 day ahead.

Grease and lay parchment paper over the bottom of a jelly roll size baking pan (17 1/2 by 11 1/2 by 1-inch deep). With an electric beater, beat together the egg yolks, just 1/4 cup of the sugar (reserving the rest), and vanilla until the mixture becomes a pale yellow and thickens. Sift cake flour over the egg yolk mixture and set aside briefly. Wash and dry the beaters. In a separate metal bowl, beat the egg whites, gradually beating in the balance of the sugar until stiff peaks form. To the egg yolk/flour bowl, fold in one-third of the beaten egg whites until just barely combined. Repeat two more times with each of the remaining two thirds of the beaten egg whites. Spread into baking pan and bake in oven for about 15 minutes or until the surface is golden brown and springs back when touched. Let cake cool in pan.<br> While the cake is cooling, it would be a good idea to make room in the freezer for the sheet cake.<br> When the cake is completely cool, peel off the browned surface of the cake. (You can do this simply by loosening it and rolling it off.)<br> Then prepare the ice cream by cutting each 1/2 gallon crosswise into 7 even-sized bricks, a total of 14 bricks. The typical rectangular carton of ice cream measures 63/4 inches long by 5 inches wide by 3 inches tall. You will arrange these bricks 4 across and 3 lengthwise on top of the sheet cake, cutting the leftover bricks to size to fit in any areas of the cake that are not covered by the ice cream. You will need to work quickly to keep the ice cream from melting. (If the ice cream is allowed to melt, its texture will not be optimal when the cake is frozen.) Cut the ice cream covered cake into rectangles which are approximately 3 inches square (a count of 4 across the width of the sheet cake and 6 along the length of the cake). This will yield 24 rectangles for 12 servings of 2 petit fours each. As you cut, you will need to remove 1 row and 1 length of the cake squares to another platter. Then use the knife to gently separate all the ice cream covered the squares, allowing enough space between them so that you will be able to thoroughly coat each piece with chocolate.<br> Put all the ice cream covered cake into the space you have reserved in the freezer. Let freeze for about an hour.<br> The chocolate to coat the cake and ice cream will be tempered, a term used to describe the successive melting and cooling of the chocolate within a certain temperature range. This process allows the molecules of the chocolate to align so that it will retain a silky appearance without a chalky finish. To temper the chocolate, place half of the semisweet chocolate pieces in each of 2 stainless steel bowls which will fit over a saucepan double-boiler fashion. Bring an inch or so of water to a boil in the saucepan and fit 1 of the bowls of chocolate pieces over it and heat until just melted (no more than 120 degrees F on the candy thermometer). Then pour this just-melted chocolate into the other bowl with the un-melted chocolate, melt and stir to combine until chocolate reaches between 86 and 90 degrees F. Remove the tray of ice cream covered cake from the freezer and work quickly to spoon the chocolate over the ice cream and cake before the chocolate hardens. Completely coat each piece with chocolate and return to freezer. Return to freezer and remove from tray with a thin bladed spatula to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 25495,&quot;Little Gem Cookies 3 cups unsifted flour 1 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter 2 egg yolks 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Raspberry preserves Pecan halves Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

On a lightly floured surface, toss and shape the dough so that one side has a thick crust and the other thin and it looks like the crumbling Roman Coliseum. Transfer onto a pizza paddle that has been well-dusted with semolina flour. Coat the center of the dough with marinara sauce. Cover with a layer of salami and then the cheese. Place the peppers and avocado in a spoke pattern around the pizza. Scatter over the sausages, pine nuts, and parmesan. Bake until the crust turns golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Spray a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper. Whisk together the flour, almond meal, poppy seeds, baking powder, salt, baking soda and zest in a medium bowl. Whisk together the yogurt and lemon juice in a separate small bowl until very smooth. Whisk together the granulated sugar and olive oil in a large bowl until combined. Add the eggs to the olive oil mixture, one at a time, whisking very well after each, then stir in the almond extract. Add the dry ingredients and yogurt mixture to the olive oil mixture in three alternating additions, whisking after each until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> For the cranberry glaze: Combine the cranberries with 1 tablespoon water in a small saucepan and heat over low heat until the cranberries start to break down and release their juices (you can help this process along by smashing them with a rubber spatula), 5 to 10 minutes. Pour the cranberries and their juices into a fine-mesh sieve placed over a bowl. Press the mixture through the sieve with a spatula, making sure to scrape off the bottom of the sieve and adding that to the bowl as well. Add the powdered sugar and salt to the bowl and mix until it comes together into a spreadable glaze. (It will seem like a lot of sugar at first but it will eventually incorporate.) If the glaze is too thick, add a couple drops of water until it&#39;s thin enough to spread. If it&#39;s too thin, add more powdered sugar. To decorate: Spread the glaze over the top of the cake, then sprinkle with sliced almonds, rose petals, fresh thyme leaves, sliced cranberries and sprinkles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 25499,&quot;Honeycomb Cupcakes Centerpiece 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted 16 whole almonds 36 sliced almonds 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla bean paste or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 pound yellow fondant (you will have left over) 1 cup clear sanding sugar 1 cup yellow sanding sugar<br> 24 Go-To Vanilla Mini Cupcakes, recipe follows, baked in bright yellow wrappers 2 cups Honey Swiss Buttercream, recipe follows 24 Frangipane Filled Cupcakes, recipe follows, baked in bright yellow wrappers 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 1 1/2 sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk 3/4 cup sugar 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice Pinch fine salt 4 large egg whites 3 sticks (12 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks, at room temperature Flavoring suggestions (see below) Instructions: For the almond bees: Fill a piping bag with a very small round tip with the chocolate. Pipe 2 eyes side by side on the rounder end of each almond, followed by 3 crosswise stripes starting in the middle of the almond down to the narrower end. Attach 2 sliced almonds (like wings) to the top chocolate stripe (the one closest to the eyes). Repeat to make 18 almond bees total. Allow to dry. For the sugar cookies: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and both sugars in another medium bowl with a handheld electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs and vanilla, mixing until fully incorporated. Slowly add the flour mixture and continue beating just until the dough comes together, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Divide the dough in half, pat into discs, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Generously flour a clean work surface. Gently roll out the chilled dough to about 3/8-inch thick. Cut 24 cookies using a 2 1/4-inch hexagon cookie cutter, working quickly so that the dough stays chilled. (If the dough has become too soft, transfer to the refrigerator on a parchment-lined baking sheet and chill again for 30 minutes.) Place the cookies on ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between them. Lightly dust off any excess flour with a dry pastry brush. Refrigerate the formed cookies for at least 30 minutes. (Excess dough can be gathered together, pressed into a disc, chilled and rerolled.) Bake the cookies until the bottoms are golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. If not using right away, cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. For the decorative cookie border: To create the honeycomb shapes on your sugar cookies, roll the yellow fondant out and cut out 24 hexagon shapes with a 2 1/4-inch hexagon cutter. Place a 1 1/4-inch hexagon cutter in the center of your existing fondant hexagon shape and press. Remove the center piece. Thinly frost the cookies with some buttercream. Place a cut-out hexagon fondant border on each cookie. Mix the clear and yellow sanding sugars together, and then fill the inner space of the cookies with the mixed sugar. Flip the cookies over to shake out any excess sanding sugar. Reserve the remaining sugar mixture for the cupcakes. To assemble the cupcakes: Frost the vanilla mini cupcakes with some buttercream using a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Sprinkle with some of the sanding sugar mixture. Garnish 12 of the mini cupcakes with 1 almond bee. Reserve the additional 6 bees to garnish the honeycomb cookie cupcakes. Frost the standard-size frangipane cupcakes with some buttercream using a mini offset spatula. Dip the outside edges of the frosted cupcakes into the mixed sanding sugar and place the hexagon sugar cookies on top. To build the honeycomb structure: Place 14 of the standard-size cupcakes in a hexagonal honeycomb pattern. Stack 7 more cupcakes, making a second tier in the honeycomb pattern, saving 3 cupcakes to put on the top tier. Scatter 20 mini cupcakes (including 8 with the almond bees) around the base of the honeycomb structure. Garnish the structure with the remaining 4 mini cupcakes with almond bees. Then arrange the remaining 6 bees on the tops of the hexagon cookies. Preheat the oven to 350 F and position a rack in the middle of the oven. Line one 12-cup standard muffin tin or two 24-cup mini-muffin tins with cupcake liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until light and foamy, about 2 minutes. While beating, gradually pour in the butter and then the vanilla. While mixing slowly, add half the dry ingredients. Then add all the milk and follow with the rest of the dry ingredients. Take care not to overmix the batter. Divide the batter evenly in the prepared tin. Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, rotating the tin about halfway through, 18 to 20 minutes (10 to 12 minutes for minis). Cool the cupcakes on a rack in the tin for 10 minutes, and then remove from the tin. Cool on the rack completely. Decorate as desired. Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a heatproof stand mixer&#39;s bowl above the water. Add the sugar, lemon juice, salt and egg whites to the mixing bowl, and whisk together by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar completely dissolves. Transfer to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until cool and the whites hold stiff peaks, 10 to 15 minutes. Toss in a couple of chunks of butter at a time, making sure the pieces are incorporated before adding more. After all the butter is added, continue whisking on medium-high speed. The mixture will deflate and appear curdled. Continue whisking until the buttercream comes back together to form a smooth and spreadable consistency. Slowly drizzle in the optional flavoring while beating until smooth and light. (If the frosting is very soft or begins to break, refrigerate until set but still spreadable and then beat until light before using.) Chocolate: Remove the buttercream from the stand mixer into a large bowl and, in three batches, fold in 6 ounces melted and cooled bittersweet chocolate. Citrus: Stir in the zest of half a lemon or orange. Boozy: Stir in 2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur and 1 tablespoon vodka. Pulse 4 tablespoons soft unsalted butter, 1 large egg, 3 tablespoons each almond paste, sugar and cake flour, and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract in a food processor until very smooth. Scrape out into a small baking dish and spread into an even layer. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Scoop 12 slightly heaping tablespoonfuls and roll into balls. Return to the freezer until firm again, about 30 minutes. Make batter for Go-To Vanilla Cupcakes (recipe above) and fill the bottom of each liner with a heaping tablespoonful of batter. Place 1 ball of frangipane in the center of each and divide the remaining batter among the liners to top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]</p><p>&quot; 25500,&quot;Mango and Black Bean Salad 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro leaves Kosher or fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (15.5-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed 1/2 mango, peeled, flesh removed from the pit and cut into 1/2-inch dice (1 generous cup) 1/2 small jicama (about 1/2 pound), peeled, and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 2 cup; see Note) 1/2 small red onion, cut in 1/2, then into thin slivers (about 1/4 cup) Instructions: This is a delicious way for me to sneak more fruit and vegetables into our family dinners.

Combine the sugar, corn syrup, salt and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Raise the heat to high and cook until the syrup reaches 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Remove from the heat. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the sugar syrup into the dissolved gelatin. Turn the mixer to high and whip the mixture for about 15 minutes, until very thick. Add the vanilla and mix thoroughly. With a sieve, generously dust an 8-by-12-inch nonmetal baking dish with confectioners&#39; sugar. Sprinkle half the coconut evenly in the pan, pour the marshmallow mixture into the pan, smooth the top and sprinkle the remaining coconut on top. Allow to stand uncovered at room temperature overnight, until it dries out. Turn the marshmallows onto a board and cut them in squares. Roll the sides in confectioners&#39; sugar and store at room temperature.

Some people put the peeled, sliced eggplant in a colander with a heavy object on top, so it can drain somewhat. It&#39;s been known to be less tart, then. I don&#39;t do this any longer, because I found little or no difference in tartness.<br> Dip the sliced eggplant pieces into the egg mixture and then into the bread crumbs, so that they&#39;re nicely coated. Fry each piece in olive oil until very brown on both sides. This is important. If the eggplants are not thinly cut or if they&#39;re not browned enough, the taste of the entire dish is not right. Both hands have to be working to get a good system going for this, and I use a medium to high flame. At certain intervals, I stop and dump the oil, wash the pan, and begin with a clean pan. This makes a big difference.<br> As the eggplant pieces are done, you can drain them on a paper towel and then place them in a baking pan. When you have enough for one layer, coat the layer generously with tomato sauce. (Reserve meats to eat seperately.) On top of that, sprinkle grated mozzarella generously. Keep repeating layers. Make sure the sides of your pan get some sauce, too. Now, I freeze this before baking. When I defrost it, I bake it as usual, and it&#39;s great. But if you want to eat it now, bake it in a preheated 350 degree F until the cheese melts and the sauce is bubbly Prepare the meats: In a large skillet, brown all the meats in the olive oil. There is no need to cook the meats all the way through. Remember to pierce the sausage before cooking to allow fats and water to be released. Set meats aside. Prepare meatballs: Combine all ingredients except the olive oil in a large bowl. Form the meatballs with your hands (there should be about 12). Fry in the olive oil over medium heat until browned, but not cooked all the way through. Set aside. For the gravy: Saute garlic in the olive oil in the same skillet used to saute the meats. Add tomato paste and cook for a few minutes. In a large saucepot, combine the remaining ingredients except the meats and the tomato paste-garlic mixture and simmer. When the mixture begins to bubble, add all the meats and the meatballs. Stir about every 15 minutes, being sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to prevent burning and sticking. If the gravy seems too thick, add a little water at a time. Simmer for about 3 hours, keeping the lid of the pot slightly askew to prevent condensation of the gravy.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 25506,&quot;Small Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 6 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips (about 1 cup) Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

When all the truffle centers are dipped and the chocolate has started to set, gently but thoroughly shake the sheet pan to roll the truffles around in the cocoa until coated. Carefully remove to another sheet pan and refrigerate, uncovered, 30 minutes. You can sift the unused cocoa and use it for another purpose. Transfer to an airtight container and keep chilled until almost ready to serve.

Heat a large pot over high heat until very hot. Add the olive oil. When the oil is almost smoking, add the garlic and cook for a few seconds until it is light brown. Add a couple of handfuls of greens and toss with tongs, incorporating the garlic so it doesn&#39;t burn on the bottom of the pan. Add the remaining greens all at once, or in batches if your pot isn&#39;t large enough to hold it all at once. Toss constantly so the greens wilt evenly. When wilted, season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking over high heat, tossing often, until the excess liquid evaporates. Turn greens out into a bowl and let it cool to room temperature, then season with vinegar. Serve at room temperature, or refrigerate for up to 2 days and eat cold. Michael&#39;s Notes: The wine vinegar will cause the greens to lose their beautiful green color. You can omit it, but I think it improves their taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gruner Veltliner]&quot; 25516,&quot;Pork Spareribs One 3 1/2-pound rack St. Louis pork spareribs Sawdust Rub, recipe follows Apple juice in a spray bottle, for spritzing meat Original BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 1 cup kosher salt 3/4 cup coarse black pepper 2/3 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup paprika 1/4 cup chili powder 1/4 cup granulated garlic 1/4 cup granulated onion 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper 6 cups ketchup 1 cup apple cider vinegar 1 cup Worcestershire sauce 3/4 cup molasses<br> 1/2 cup brown sugar<br> 2 tablespoons hot sauce, such as Louisiana 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/2 cup chili powder 2 tablespoons granulated garlic<br> 2 tablespoons onion powder<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons black pepper 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper Instructions: Prepare a smoker for cooking between 250 and 275 degrees F. Trim the excess fat from the spareribs and cut out any sharp or cracked bones. Remove or score any silver skin. Liberally rub the ribs with Sawdust Rub, shaking off the excess. Place the ribs in the smoker and cook, spritzing with apple juice every 30 minutes, until the fat starts to render from the surface of the ribs, about 3 hours. Spritz a piece of heavy-duty foil with some apple juice and drizzle with about 3 tablespoons Original BBQ Sauce. Arrange the ribs on the foil, meaty-side down, and fold the foil on the ribs so that steam can escape but the juices are trapped inside. (If you multiply this recipe to do multiple racks, make sure each rack gets its own foil packet.) Put back in the smoker meaty-side down. Smoke until the meat pulls back from the bones by about 3/8 inch, another 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Let rest for 30 minutes, then slice into ribs. Mix together the salt, pepper, brown sugar, paprika, chili powder, granulated garlic, granulated onion and cayenne in a bowl and break up any clumps by hand. Combine the ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire, molasses, brown sugar, hot sauce and lemon juice together in a large pot and whisk until blended. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer, then add the chili powder, granulated garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper and cayenne. Continue to simmer 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep from burning. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 25517,&quot;Peach Custard Tarts 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2/3 cup blanched almonds<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br> 10 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus more for the pans<br> 3 tablespoons ice water<br> 2 1/4 cups sugar 1/4 cup cornstarch<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br> 2 1/4 cups peach nectar<br> 9 large egg yolks 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> Nonstick cooking spray 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/4 cup water<br> 3 large egg whites<br> 1 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> Pinch fine salt<br> 6 to 12 basil leaves, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the crust: Pulse the flour, almonds, sugar and salt in a food processor until the nuts are finely ground. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add the ice water and pulse until the dough starts coming together. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap, pat into a disk and wrap in the plastic. Refrigerate until cold but still malleable, about 15 minutes. In the meantime, make your curd filling: Combine the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan and whisk to combine. Stir in the peach nectar, egg yolks and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until the filling thickens and coats the back of a spoon; this will take 5 to 7 minutes after it comes to a simmer. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, a tablespoon at a time. Strain the filling into a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish. Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming and chill completely, about 1 hour. While your filling is chilling, lightly spray four 5-inch tart pans with removable bottoms with nonstick cooking spray. Divide your chilled tart dough into 4 pieces, then press into the bottom and up the sides of each prepared pan. Freeze until firm, about 10 minutes. Use a paring knife to trim any excess dough. Place the tart shells on a baking sheet, line each shell with parchment and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until golden around the edges, about 20 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights and continue baking until the crusts are golden brown all over, 5 to 10 more minutes. Let cool completely. Divide the chilled curd/custard among the tart shells. Put back into the refrigerator while you make the meringue. In the meantime, make your meringue: Add the sugar and water to a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then once at a boil, cook for 4 minutes. While your sugar is cooking, put your egg whites, cream of tartar and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat on low speed. When the sugar mixture on the stovetop comes to a boil, turn the mixer to high speed. When the sugar syrup is ready, turn the mixer to medium-low speed. Pour the syrup in a steady stream in between the side of the bowl and the whisk attachment while the mixer is running. Turn the mixer to high and beat for 2 full minutes. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with desired tip. Pipe decorative designs with the meringue on the tarts. Use a pastry torch to brown. Garnish with basil leaves and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 25518,&quot;Turkey Dumpling Stew 1 leftover roasted turkey carcass, plus 3 to 4 cups shredded turkey meat 1 onion, quartered 2 stalks celery, quartered crosswise (save the leaves for the Dumplings) 1 pound carrots (3 quartered crosswise; the rest thinly sliced) 1 bay leaf 3 sprigs parsley 3 sprigs thyme Dumpling Dough, recipe follows 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 shallots, minced 1/4 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pound parsnips, peeled and thinly sliced Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces Chopped fresh chives, for topping 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 cup minced mixed fresh herbs and celery leaves 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt Freshly ground pepper 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 1/2 cups cold buttermilk Instructions: Make the stock: Pull the turkey carcass apart into smaller pieces; set the meat aside.

Tie the parsley and thyme together with twine and add to the pot, then cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Uncover, reduce the heat to medium low and cook 3 to 4 hours. Remove the bones and vegetables with a skimmer and discard, then strain the stock though a fine-mesh strainer. Return the stock to the pot and simmer over medium-high heat until reduced by half, 30 to 40 minutes (you&#39;ll have about 8 cups stock). About 45 minutes before serving, prepare the Dumplings. Keep covered with plastic wrap while you make the stew. Make the stew: Melt the butter in a large, wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Gradually add the stock, stirring, and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Add the sliced carrots and parsnips, cover and cook 5 minutes.

Select a heavy stockpot, preferably 1 with a spigot at the bottom. Combine the chicken, onion, celery, carrots, egg whites, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, cloves, and peppercorns in the soup pot and mix very well. Mix the meat mixture with small amount of chicken stock to cover. Allow the mixture to set for 20 to 30 minutes. This process will allow the soup to break down valuable proteins that provide body for the consomme. Gradually add the remaining stock and mix well with the meat mixture. Set the pot over a low flame and bring to a slow simmer. On occasion, stir the contents so that the meat mixture can coagulate evenly, producing a good raft. As the temperature rises to the simmering point, no longer stir the contents for the risk of breaking the raft is too high. Move to a lower heat so that the contents maintain a simmer. Do not cover or allow to boil. Allow it to simmer for at least 1 1/2 hours. Strain the consomme through a china cap lined with several layers of cheesecloth or coffee filters. Do not force the liquid for you will push particles through. Remove all traces of the fat from the surface. Adjust seasonings, to taste. Your soup should be perfectly clear.

Use a spoon or apple corer to carve out the center core of each ring. Spray a large grill pan with cooking spray and heat over a medium flame. Grill the pineapple, in 2 or 3 batches, for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until it is nicely brown and grill marks have appeared. (You can also grill this on an outdoor grill sprayed with cooking spray before being heated.) While the last batch of pineapple cooks, heat the butter, sugar and rum in a small saucepan over a low heat, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved and the sauce has thickened slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat. Place a pineapple ring on each plate, scoop 1/4 cup of ice cream into the center of the ring, and drizzle about 2 teaspoons of sauce on top. &quot;,&quot;[Moscato, Riesling, Vinho Verde, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 25537,&quot;Grilled Side of Salmon Stuffed with Creamy Corn and Bacon 8 ounces bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 large shallot, finely chopped 3 cups corn kernels (from about 3 ears of corn) 8 ounces cream cheese, cubed, at room temperature Kosher salt 1/2 cup firmly packed fresh parsley, cilantro or basil leaves (or a mixture) Zest of 1 lemon, plus lemon wedges, for serving 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature One 3- to 4-pound side of salmon, skin on, pin bones removed Nonstick cooking spray, for the foil Instructions: Add the bacon to a medium skillet and cook over medium-high heat until crispy, about 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a plate with a slotted spoon; reserve. Discard all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet and reduce the heat to medium. Add half the shallots and cook, stirring often, until translucent and softened, about 5 minutes. Add the corn and continue to cook, stirring often, until heated through and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream cheese and 1 teaspoon salt until combined. Let cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, add the herbs, lemon zest and remaining shallots to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add the butter and 2 teaspoons salt and pulse until well combined; set aside. Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Set the salmon on a cutting board. Use a knife to score the salmon down the middle lengthwise, halfway through its thickness. Working from the center line out toward the edges, cut thin flaps from the score to the edge, like a gatefold, then open them up. Spread half the herb butter on the salmon and spoon the corn mixture down the middle. Sprinkle the bacon on top, then fold the sides of the salmon up to cover the filling. Tie the salmon together in 6 places with butcher&#39;s twine. Spread the remaining herb butter on top and sprinkle generously with salt. Stack 3 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil that are 6 inches longer than the salmon and spray the top layer generously with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer the salmon to the middle of the foil and crimp the sides so they form a rim. Transfer the salmon on the foil to the indirect-heat side of the grill and cook, covered, until the salmon is cooked through and the stuffing is hot, about 25 minutes (depending on your grill). Move the salmon to the direct-heat side for 5 minutes to crisp the skin. Using heatproof gloves, carefully transfer the foil with the salmon to a platter for serving. Serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 25538,&quot;Spinach and Artichoke Chicken Casseroles 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 large onion, finely chopped<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups whole milk<br> Enough chicken soup bouillon for 2 cups broth<br> 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thigh or breast, chopped into 1/2- to 3/4-inch pieces<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> One 14-ounce can artichokes, drained and chopped<br> One 10-ounce block frozen spinach, thawed and drained<br> 8 ounces light cream cheese<br> 1/2 bunch fresh parsley<br> Pinch crushed red pepper<br> One 16-ounce can refrigerated biscuit dough<br> 1 large egg, lightly beaten with a splash of water<br> Flaky salt, such as Maldon<br> Instructions: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter.

Using both hands, mix and squeeze the beef and seasonings together. To make the ravioli, lay a few wonton wrappers, flour side up, on a work surface and set a glass of water next to it. Scoop a spoonful of the beef filling (about 2 tablespoons) into the center of each wrapper. Wet your finger and lightly trace the border of each wonton. Fold the wrapper in half, pressing out any air, and seal the edges with your fingers. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Cover the ravioli with a towel while you prepare the sauce. To make the sauce, in a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, tomato sauce, onions, and vodka. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Reduce the heat, stir in the heavy cream and cheese, bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes more. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm while you cook the ravioli. To cook the ravioli, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches, gently drop the ravioli, one at a time, into the water. Cook until the ravioli float. (If using fresh ground chuck, cook for about 6 minutes until the meat is cooked through, testing one ravioli by cutting in half.) Transfer the hot ravioli to a serving platter and top with warm vodka sauce, or gently place them directly in the sauce, toss to coat, and divide among serving plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 25560,&quot;Applesauce 2 1/2 pounds tart red-skinned apples, such as McIntosh 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Instructions: Remove the stems from the apples, but do not core or peel. Coarsely chop the apples. Combine the apples, sugar, lemon juice, and 3 tablespoons of water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook until the apples are completely soft, about 20 minutes. Uncover, and continue to cook, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and pass the mixture through the fine-holed disc of a food mill. Discard the peels and seeds. Refrigerate if not using immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25561,&quot;Creamy Green Bean Salad 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 pound cremini mushrooms, sliced<br> 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves<br> 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 ribs celery, thinly sliced<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> Kosher salt 1 pound green beans, trimmed<br> 1 large head romaine lettuce, roughly chopped<br> 1/2 cup sliced almonds, toasted<br> 1/2 cup crispy fried onions (more if desired!)<br> 1/2 cup low-fat yogurt 1/3 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> Instructions: For the salad: Melt the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms to the melted butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are golden brown and have released their moisture, about 6 minutes. Stir in the thyme, Worcestershire, celery, garlic and salt to taste. Cook until the garlic and thyme are aromatic and the celery is starting to brown on the edges, about 2 minutes. The celery should still be lightly crisp. Add more salt if desired. Take off the heat and spread on a sheet tray to cool. Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Set up a large bowl of ice water and line a sheet tray with a paper towel or kitchen towel. Generously season the boiling water with salt. Add the green beans and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a spider or drain in a colander and transfer to the ice bath. Once cooled, transfer the green beans to the lined sheet tray and thoroughly pat dry. For the creamy Parmesan dressing: Whisk together the yogurt, Parmesan, mayonnaise, sherry vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Refrigerate if not using immediately. To assemble: To the bowl of dressing, add the green beans, mushroom mixture and romaine. Toss to combine and everything is fully coated.

Put both halves cut-side up in front of you. On one of the halves, use a small sharp knife to cut into and around the perimeter of the fruit about 1/4 inch in from the peel. Locate the core in the center: cut it out on an angle on either side (it will look like a long V) and discard. Cut the remaining pineapple into a grid of small squares. Use a spoon to scoop the pieces out, leaving the pineapple empty. Chop any large pieces a little smaller and set aside in a bowl. Repeat with the other pineapple half, but reserve the pieces of fruit for another use. Whisk together the eggs and a small pinch of salt in a small bowl. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Pour the eggs into the skillet and let them run freely until they cover most of the bottom. Cook, undisturbed, until the top is set and no longer runny, 4 to 5 minutes. Roll up into a cylinder and transfer to a cutting board.

Using tongs, place the peppers directly over an open flame on the stove top. Char all over, about 2 minutes per side, and then place in a bowl covered tightly with plastic wrap so they sweat. Leave to sit for 5 minutes, and then use a paper towel to remove the charred outer layer. Discard the stem and seeds, and then dice the peppers. Set a large Dutch oven over high heat and add the butter and olive oil. Add the turkey, onions and garlic and cook, breaking up into small pieces, until lightly browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the flour and season with the cumin, onion powder, paprika and some salt and pepper. The flour will form a roux with the fat in the pan. Cook for 2 minutes while stirring, and then add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add the heavy cream and bring back to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and fold in diced cl peppers and corn. Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling, salted water until al dente, about 12 minutes. Fold the pasta into the turkey sauce and season with salt and pepper, stirring until thoroughly combined.

Bake until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and the tops are golden, 18 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly in tin, and turn out of tin when cool enough to handle. Cool cupcakes completely on a rack before frosting. Put the sugar in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on the lowest speed, slowly add the water, the corn syrup and vanilla extract. When the sugar is sufficiently moistened (it won&#39;t fly out of the mixer), raise the speed to high, and beat for 2 minutes until completely smooth and glossy. Divide and color, as desired. Store at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the icing, to prevent forming a skin. For cupcakes: Dip the surface of the cupcake into the icing, allowing excess to drip into bowl. Clean any excess from the sides. Alternately, use a knife or a spreader to apply. Whisk as needed to keep icing glossy and smooth while using. For Light Blue Icing: Combine 2 to 3 drops of blue food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing. For Deep Yellow Icing: Combine 4 to 5 drops of yellow food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing. For Purple Icing: Combine 4 drops of red and 5 drops of blue food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a mesh rack on top, if available. Put coconut in a shallow bowl. While tossing with a large spoon, add food coloring drop by drop until the desired color is reached. A little more green than yellow makes a pretty grass color. Add a few tablespoons water to moisten the mixture and help disperse the color evenly. If the color is too dark, add additional water, as needed, to dilute to the desired color. Drain the coconut in a sieve or strainer. Spread the coconut in an even layer on the rack, or directly on the lined baking sheet. Place in the oven until dry, about 10 to 15 minutes. Use immediately, or store in covered container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 25575,&quot;Healthy Peach Betty 4 ripe peaches, halved, pitted and cut into 4 wedges each 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted 4 tablespoons pure maple syrup 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 4 slices walnut-raisin bread Pinch kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Bake, uncovered, until the lasagna is hot and bubbly, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let lasagna stand for 10 minutes before serving. Put the olive oil and garlic in a saucepan and cook until fragrant, 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and salt. Break up the tomatoes into small chunks with a wooden spoon and bring to a boil over high heat, lower heat to a brisk simmer, and cook until thickened, about 30 to 40 minutes. While sauce cooks, tear basil leaves into small pieces. Remove the sauce from the heat, stir in the basil, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 25594,&quot;Whole30 Hot Apple Cereal 6 Honeycrisp apples (about 1 1/2 pounds) 1 cup canned coconut milk 2/3 cup roasted cashews, plus more for serving, optional 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, plus more for serving 1/2 cup raisins, plus more for serving, optional Instructions: Cut off the sides/cheeks from 1 apple and slice; reserve.

Place the butter in a small saute pan and place over medium heat. Completely melt the butter, then cook until the butter is brown and smells nutty, an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Take off the heat and allow to cool. Place the granulated sugar and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Pour in the cooled butter and beat on low to medium speed until smooth and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and eggs and continue to beat on low until the mixture is combined. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl and slowly incorporate into the batter a little at a time. Beat until smooth. Fold in the butterscotch chips and pecans. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Using a 1-ounce scoop or a tablespoon measure, portion out the cookie dough, leaving 2 inches between each cookie. Sprinkle the cookies with salt and bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 25598,&quot;Seared Duck Breast One 4-ounce Pekin duck breast (see Cook&#39;s Note) Salt and freshly ground black pepper Grapeseed or vegetable oil, for frying<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 2 cloves garlic Instructions: With a sharp knife, score the fat of the duck breast in a crisscross pattern, being careful to not cut into the meat. Season the duck with salt and pepper. Warm a cast-iron or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-low heat and add enough oil to just coat the bottom of the pan. Place the duck breast fat-side down in the skillet to render off the fat, about 8 minutes. Once the fat has rendered out and the skin is golden brown and crisp, turn the duck breast over and add the butter, thyme and garlic. Turn up the heat to medium-high and, once the butter is foamy, begin basting the duck breast using a spoon. Continue basting until the duck breast reaches medium rare and measures 135 to 140 degrees F. on an instant-read thermometer, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the pan and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 25599,&quot;Pot Roast 3 pounds beef chuck roast Kosher salt and black pepper 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 2 large yellow onions, diced<br> 2 carrots, peeled and diced<br> 2 stalks celery, diced<br> 1/4 cup tomato paste<br> 1 cup Merlot or other dry red wine 8 cups veal broth<br> 3 ounces unsalted butter 3 ounces flour<br> 3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 8 pieces 1 cup sour cream<br> 1 stick unsalted butter Kosher salt White pepper 1 1/2 pounds green beans, ends snipped 24 pieces carrot, batonnet cut<br> 1/4 cup grapeseed oil<br> Kosher salt and black pepper Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish, optional Instructions: For the pot roast: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sprinkle the chuck roast with 3 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Heat the vegetable oil over high heat in a rondeau or large Dutch oven until it begins to shimmer. Sear the beef on all sides to a deep brown, about 3 minutes per side; remove to a plate. Add the onions to the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until caramelized, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the carrots and celery, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste; cook 1 to 2 minutes more. Deglaze the pan with the red wine and cook until reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes. Put the roast and any accumulated juices back in the pan. Add veal broth to cover by two-thirds. Bring to a simmer, then cover with a lid. Transfer to the oven and cook until the roast registers an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Baste every 20 minutes during cooking, and turn the beef over in the broth periodically. Remove the roast to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, skim the broth of fat and bring to a simmer on the stovetop. Melt the butter in a saute pan and stir in the flour to make a roux. Whisk the roux into the simmering broth; cook for 15 minutes. Slice the beef against the grain. Put the slices in the sauce, and hold. For the mashed potatoes: Place the potatoes in a tall pot; add cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Strain the potatoes and allow them to sit for 2 to 3 minutes to dry out a bit. Wipe the pot dry. Run the potatoes through a ricer into the pot. Add the sour cream and butter, and mix well. Season with salt and white pepper. For the green beans and carrots: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Bring 1 gallon water to a boil and season with 2 ounces kosher salt. Set up an ice bath for shocking the green beans. Add one-third of the green beans to the boiling water; cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to the ice bath to stop cooking. Dry the beans well on paper towels. Repeat two more times, until all the green beans are blanched. In a bowl, toss the carrots with 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil, and season with salt and pepper. Spread the carrots on a baking sheet, transfer to the oven, and cook until tender and browned, about 15 minutes. In a large skillet heat the remaining 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil over medium heat. Add the blanched green beans and roasted carrots, and saute for 11 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. To plate: Divide the mashed potatoes between 6 large pasta bowls. Arrange the green beans on top of the potatoes, then arrange the beef slices on top of the beans. Ladle some of the sauce over the beef. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Barolo]&quot; 25600,&quot;Pumpkin Roll Cake Butter, for greasing pan 2/3 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring pan 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1/2 cup pumpkin puree<br> 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Two 3-ounce packages cream cheese, softened<br> 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a jelly-roll pan with parchment paper. Lightly grease and flour the paper. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, ginger, nutmeg and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the granulated sugar and eggs until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Mix in the pumpkin until combined. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture. Pour the batter out onto the prepared jelly-roll pan. Drop the pan twice on the counter to even out the batter and release any bubbles. Bake for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, dust a dishtowel with the confectioners&#39; sugar. Immediately transfer the cake to the powdered dishtowel and gently roll from one short end to the other. Refrigerate on a pan or plate until completely cool, about 2 hours. For the filling: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, cream cheese, butter and vanilla. Beat until light and fluffy. Unroll the cake and spread with the filling. Re-roll the cake and wrap with plastic wrap for 1 to 2 hours. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 25601,&quot;The Ultimate Roast Chicken 1 (5 1/2 pound) free-range chicken 1/2 bunch each fresh oregano, thyme, and parsley 1/4 pound unsalted butter, softened Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 orange, halved 1/2 head garlic 1 medium white onion, halved, plus 1 onion 6 strips smoked bacon 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups chicken broth 1/4 cup dry sherry Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Rinse the chicken with cool water, inside and out. Pat it dry with paper towels. Divide the herbs, keeping 1/2 of them whole. Finely chop the other half. In a small bowl, mash the softened butter with the chopped herbs, until combined. Rub the herbed butter under the skin, as well as all over the outside of the chicken. Season the bird all over with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with the orange, garlic, 1 onion, and the remaining herbs. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine to help hold its shape. Place the chicken, breast-side up, in a roasting pan. Put the remaining onion into the pan, which will help color and flavor the sauce. Lay the strips of bacon across the breast of the chicken and roast for 25 minutes. Remove the bacon and baste the chicken with the drippings and cook for another 25 minutes to brown the skin. The chicken is done when an instant-read thermometer reads 165 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (the legs of the chicken should wiggle easily from the sockets too.) Remove the chicken to a platter and let stand for 10 minutes, so the juices settle back into the meat before carving. Meanwhile, remove the softened onion from the roasting pan. Tilt the pan so the drippings collect in 1 corner, skimming off as much fat as possible, and leaving the drippings. Place the roasting pan on top of the stove over medium heat and take a wooden spoon to scrape up the flavor from the bottom of the pan. Stir the flour into the drippings to make a roux-like paste. Pour in the chicken broth in stages; continue to stir to dissolve the flour evenly to prevent lumps. Stir in the sherry and season with salt and pepper. To serve, carve the chicken tableside and squeeze the oranges from the cavity over the meat.

It&#39;s funny; we like ours thin and lightly browned, whereas the classic American version is fluffy and pale yellow. This almost reminds me of a Spanish frittata; you can eat a quarter of it with a small salad and it makes a satisfying light lunch. My mum usually makes this for lunch when she&#39;s got a heavy dinner planned. It&#39;s one of my dad&#39;s favorites! This is also apparently one of those things that you can get at the train stations in India: jump onto the platform, grab a hot \\railway omelet\\ and speed walk to work where you can nosh away in peace. Bliss! Grab a bowl. Crack the eggs into the bowl and beat until lathery, about 1 minute. Whisk in the onion, cl, cilantro, turmeric, and paprika until well combined. Sprinkle with a big pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Grab a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Add the oil and warm over medium-high heat until mildly shimmering but not smoking. Have a spatula/spoonula at the ready. Pour egg mixture into the pan. Grab the spatula/spoonula and, in small circular motions, distribute the onions, cl, and cilantro evenly around the pan. This also helps move some of the uncooked egg down to the surface of the hot pan. Cover and cook for 2 1/2 minutes. Grab a plate that&#39;s as big as your pan. Pull off the lid and look at your omelet. It might still look a little runny, but it shouldn&#39;t be super runny. If it is, then cover and cook 1 more minute. Slide the omelet, cooked side down, onto your plate. Then, holding the plate from underneath, put your pan over your plate, and flip so that the uncooked side lands on the pan. Cook, uncovered, another minute. Slide onto serving plate, cut into 4, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 25607,&quot;Shrimp Sheet Pan Pita 4 pita breads, halved 8 ounces asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces<br> 4 ounces cremini mushrooms, quartered<br> 1 medium yellow squash, halved lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces<br> 1 small red onion, sliced<br> 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning blend<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 1/2 pounds colossal shrimp (U15), peeled and deveined<br> 2 lemons, zested and halved<br> 1 cup Greek yogurt<br> 2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish<br> 2 Roma tomatoes, sliced<br> 1 head green leaf or Bibb lettuce, leaves torn<br> 1 cup sliced mixed olives<br> 4 ounces feta, crumbled<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
