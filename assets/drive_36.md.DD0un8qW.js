Perhaps drink it as an ap√©ritif, easy and fragrant.","designation":"P√°tria Tawny"},{"country":"us","description":"An atypically oaky wine for Siduri, with a rich veneer of French oak overlying black cherries, cola and spice.

Drink right away.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"Young and unintegrated, this Cab is nowhere near ready to drink.

This Verdejo is woody but has freshness and a refined texture.","designation":"Fermentado en Barrica"},{"country":"us","description":"Full-flavored and textured, probably from the use of a Sauvignon Musque Clone for half of the wine, this is nonetheless a light wine, subtle in stone fruit, kiwi and lemon-lime.

It's the right wine for fresh-shucked oysters.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"es","description":"Peach, melon and apple aromas are more or less what's left on the nose, and the palate also indicates a fine wine in decline.

As it's aged solely in large vats, there's no oak influence and the wine needs a bit of bottle age to come around.

It perfectly captures and combines the raspberry intensity of the Grenache, the brambleberry fruit of the Mourv√®dre and the peppery smoke and spice of the Syrah.

Hopefully, the wine will fill out.","designation":"Lagoalva"},{"country":"pt","description":"Rich and opulent, this is a big fruity, toasty white wine.

Aromas of blackberry jam and maple syrup are followed by equally rich, deep and expressive flavors. The remarkable concentration of ripe berry flavors layered densely with fine tannins is at least partly due to blending in Petite Sirah.

Better after 2012.","designation":"The Puzzle"},{"country":"us","description":"Young, elegant, spicy and still quite tight, this is showing lovely fragrances of rose and cherry.

Will repay 5+ years of cellaring.","designation":"Bricco Rocche Prap√≥"},{"country":"pt","description":"This single-vineyard wine is richly structured and seriously impressive, coming from a parcel planted with Syrah and Touriga Franca.

Made from Grenache and Counoise grapes, it's just the thing for an alfresco lunch or to pour with appetizers before dinner.","designation":"Dry"},{"country":"fr","description":"The beauty of Krug's ros√© is the sense of bottle age, of that extra richness. That means the wine is not just the sum of its delicious red berry fruits. It's also the way the wine is rounded out, filled with secondary flavors, toast and almonds and a taut minerality. The aftertaste is taut, dry, seamless, complex.","designation":"Brut Ros√©"},{"country":"us","description":"Enticing aromas like baking spices and a vivid mix of fruit and spice flavors are carried along beautifully by lively acidity matched with luxurious body.

These flavors combine into the most charming, easy-drinking but textured white wine. This strikes a wonderful balance between an aromatic, almost plump richness of aroma and a sprightly, fresh but concentrated palate. The edges show appetizing white pepper and orange zest.

This Counting Crows ode delivers aromas of raspberry-laced black tea, clove and cardamom. It's soft and inviting on the palate, with anise, mocha and blackberry flavors that finish with a wash of tobacco. It was still quite tight after hours of being opened, perhaps due to the 35% whole cluster maceration. Drink 2017‚Äì2023.","designation":"Mr. Jones"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine has muscle and grip; it's a densely layered Cabernet, based upon cassis and loam, with firm, muscular tannins. At the moment it does not extend its power into the finish, but rather it seems to stop short. Try giving it extra breathing time.","designation":"The Estates"},{"country":"it","description":"This Sangiovese-Canaiolo blend has loads of sweet spice on the nose.

It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years.

If California Riesling is making a comeback, it's because of wines like this.","designation":"The Shell Mound"},{"country":"au","description":"Tempranillo could be an interesting variety in South au going forward.

Made from S√©millon grapes left to ripen and shrivel through midwinter, it's deeply concentrated with dried mango and orange-peel flavors. Fermentation via natural yeast on its skins lends a deeply phenolic astringency to the palate. It's dusty and mineral with a sherried aldehydic character attributable to deliberate oxidation in barrels, yet somehow, it maintains a luminous core of fresh fruit. A curious and thought-provoking wine for the adventurous wine lover.","designation":"Giallo"},{"country":"cl","description":"Dry, lean and sawdusted on the nose, with vanilla aromas blending with simple plum and berry notes.

Black cherry and blackberry flavors are set in charred wood tannins, but everything is in proportion and nicely developed.","designation":"Red Hill Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Textbook Napa Petite Sirah‚Äîrich, smooth and insanely delicious. Chocolate blackberry jam, spiced plum pudding and toasty oak flavors, are wrapped into thick, velvety tannins. What a great summer barbecue wine, or with mid-winter short ribs of beef. Terrific now, and will age for a decade or more.","designation":"S&J Vineyard Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"An unusually dark color, even for this notoriously black varietal, makes this powerful wine stand out from the first glance.

Flavors of cherry, plum and mixed berries are propelled by acidity, and that's also how this ends.","designation":"High Mountain Vines"},{"country":"us","description":"A blend of roughly equal parts Mourv√®dre and Syrah, this does not offer much in the way of fruit; there's an emptiness to the midpalate. It's a difficult wine to get a handle on, even after breathing time. Perhaps more bottle age will open it up.","designation":"Virga Red"},{"country":"us","description":"Each year, this wine is intended to be an experiment. This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley.

The flavors are evenly placed between lemon yogurt and salted apples, mixing a bit of tang and ripe fruit with a savory sea salt.","designation":"Rosella's Vineyard"},{"country":"ar","description":"Cab Franc is an emerging variety in Mendoza and this jammy fleshy version won't hurt the cause.

Not many Chards in the price range will fare better.","designation":"Xplorador"},{"country":"ar","description":"Chunky, oxidized aromas announce a wine that's past its prime.

Winemaker Jenne Lee Bonaccorsi succeeds wildly with this wine.

Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon provide the blackberry jam and chocolate richness, while Viognier brings a bright floral note, and even Roussanne has something to say by way of orange tartness. New oak is evident, but perfectly in balance with the wine's volume.

The bouquet is initially seductive and oaky, but it subsides with time to integrate with the ripe melon, mango and yellow peach scents. Developed and slightly honeyed, the palate is lush and round. Almond, honeysuckle and soft sweet spice flavors stay through the long close. Tasty now, but should age nicely through 2015.","designation":"Honeybunch Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"Sourced from an experimental vineyard planted in the early 1970s, this blends eight different varieties, all picked on the same day and co-fermented.
