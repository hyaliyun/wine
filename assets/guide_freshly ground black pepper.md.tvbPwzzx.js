Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels and put on a cutting board. Using a small paring knife, cut a 2-inch opening horizontal to the cutting board, halfway up the meat in each chop. Move the knife back and forth in a fan motion to open the interior of the pocket without significantly widening the opening. (You don&#39;t want to pierce through the meat but simply create a pocket for the stuffing.) Brush the exterior of the chops with oil, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, and set aside until the stuffing is ready. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large ovenproof frying pan over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the shallots and cook until softened. Add the mushrooms, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, stirring rarely, until browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley and remove to a plate to cool slightly. Wipe out the frying pan and return it to the stove over medium-high heat. Taste the stuffing and adjust the seasoning, as necessary. Stuff half of the mushroom mixture into the pocket of each chop. If the filling is falling out, secure the chops closed with toothpicks. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, arrange the stuffed chops in the pan and cook until browned, about 4 minutes. Flip the chops to the other side and transfer the pan to the oven. Bake until the pork is cooked and an instant-read thermometer, inserted into the center of the chops, registers 160 degrees F, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and set the pork aside on serving plates to rest. Return the pan to the stove over medium heat and add the vermouth. Cook, scraping the bits from the bottom of the pan with a spatula, until the alcohol smell is cooked off and is slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat, add the butter, and let it melt. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. Drizzle the sauce over the chops and serve with a gratin, mashed potatoes, or polenta, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Riesling]&quot; 52434,&quot;Banana Splitsville 2 cups sugar 1 cup water 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 batch caramel 2 cups heavy cream 4 bananas Sugar for coating Ice cream of your choice Instructions: Combine the sugar, water, and corn syrup in a small, heavy saucepan and place over high heat. As soon as the sugar has dissolved, heat your thermometer under warm tap water (to prevent thermal shock) and attach to side of pan, making sure that the bulb is completely submerged. Do not stir the mixture or agitate the pan at this stage.<br> When the mixture reaches 230 degrees, reduce the heat to medium and allow the sugar to color gradually. As the temperature approaches 300 degrees the color will start to turn to amber. At this point, it&#39;s safe to swirl the pan gently to help distribute the heat evenly. As the caramel heads towards 340 degrees, it will reach a deep amber color.<br> Remove the pan from the heat and slowly stir with a metal spoon, allowing it to cool until the caramel falls from the spoon in a solid stream, like a string. When it does, it&#39;s doodad time.<br> Form doodads by holding the spoon 12 to 16 inches over the caramel and drizzling the patterns on the parchment. (Hint: allow the spoon to unload into the pan for a few seconds before attempting doodad. This will allow a narrower stream.) Quick back and forth motions or side to side movements are best. It&#39;s all in the wrist. Allow doodads to cool for 15 minutes then peel the paper off (not the other way around). Stack in an airtight container with wax paper between each piece.<br> After making 15 to 20 doodads, you should have sufficient caramel remaining to move on to the sauce phase. So, return the remaining caramel to medium high heat and continue cooking until you see the first sign of smoke. Immediately remove from the heat, and add the cream, all at once, at arms length. (It will boil furiously.) Once the mixture calms down, return to medium heat and boil 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool to room temperature, move to squirt bottle and refrigerate for up to a week.<br> To make the bananas brulee, quarter the bananas (peel on) and rub into sugar to coat thoroughly. Remove peel and place on cooling rack over several layers of foil. (Don&#39;t try this on your dining room table.) Don your safety goggles and fire up your torch. Hold the torch so that the very tip of the flame barely touches the banana, and move quickly back and forth until the sugar melts, turns brown, and bubbles. As soon as it looks like caramel, move on. You know you&#39;ve got it down when a solid, glasslike sheet of gold (no graininess) has formed on the banana.<br> To do the split (so to speak), squirt a pattern of caramel sauce on a chilled plate, top with 4 banana pieces (Lincoln log style), top with the ice cream of your choice (we like our peachy vanilla from Churn Baby Churn), and finally, a doodad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52435,&quot;Horseradish-Crusted Steak Roulade 2 red bell peppers, stemmed, halved lengthwise and seeded 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 leek, white and light-green parts only, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup chopped fresh parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 2 1/4-to-2 1/2-pound flank steak, trimmed 1/2 pound sliced provolone cheese (about 8 slices) 3/4 cup breadcrumbs 3 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 3 tablespoons drained horseradish 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Prepare the stuffing for the steak: Preheat the broiler and place the peppers cut-side down on a foil-lined broiler pan. Broil until the skin is charred, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a plate and set aside until cool enough to handle. Peel the peppers with your fingers or a paring knife. If necessary, lightly rinse to remove any remaining skin and pat dry. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the leek and garlic and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Let cool. Gently pound the steak with the flat side of a mallet or heavy skillet until 1/4 inch thick. Lay out on a cutting board with the long side facing you and season with salt and pepper. Place the roasted peppers evenly over the meat, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Top with the cheese slices, then the leek mixture. Roll the meat away from you into a tight cylinder, tucking in the filling as you roll. Make the crust: Mix the breadcrumbs, rosemary, parsley, horseradish, olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste in a medium bowl until moistened. Brush the steak roll with a bit of olive oil and press the breadcrumb mixture over the top and sides. Tie the roll with twine in three or four places, making sure it&#39;s not too tight (you want the crust to stay intact). Place the steak roll on a rack in a roasting pan and roast until the crust is golden and a thermometer inserted into the center registers 130 degrees for medium-rare, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes. Carefully cut off the twine, then slice the roll crosswise into 1-inch pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Pinot Noir]&quot; 52436,&quot;The Best Fruitcake 1 1/2 cups golden raisins 1/2 cup dried currants 1 cup dried apricots, halved 1 cup dried figs, halved 1/2 cup pitted prunes 1/2 cup whole pitted Medjool dates, halved 2 cups walnut halves 1 cup pecan halves Finely grated zest of 2 small oranges Finely grated zest of 2 small lemons 2 tablespoons chopped candied ginger 3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice Pinch ground cloves 1 cup brandy, plus 2 tablespoons for brushing 1/4 cup orange liqueur 1/2 cup unsulfured molasses Nonstick cooking spray 2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups lightly packed dark brown sugar 4 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Instructions: Combine the raisins, currants, apricots, figs, prunes, dates, walnuts, pecans, orange zest, lemon zest, candied ginger, pumpkin pie spice and cloves in a large bowl and toss to combine. Add 1 cup of the brandy, orange liqueur and molasses and stir to coat. Cover and set aside to macerate overnight. (Alternatively, cover the bowl and microwave 2 minutes, or until very hot. Leave covered and let sit until almost all the liquid has been absorbed into the fruit and nuts, about 2 hours.) Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Spray two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray and line each with 2 pieces of parchment, one lengthwise and one crosswise, leaving a 2-inch overhang on each side. Spray the parchment with cooking spray. Sprinkle 1/2 cup flour over the soaked fruit mixture and toss to coat. Whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Cream the butter and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the eggs, one at a time, making sure each is fully incorporated before adding the next and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to medium-low and beat in the flour mixture until the batter is blended and smooth. Pour the batter over the fruit mixture and fold with a rubber spatula until all the fruit is coated in batter. Divide the mixture evenly between the two prepared pans, filling each about 3/4 full. Bake until the cakes begin to pull away from the sides of the pans, the tops spring back slightly when pressed and a cake tester comes out clean, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer to a wire rack and brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons brandy. Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 15 minutes. Carefully remove each cake from its pan using the parchment overhang and place on the rack to cool completely. To store, wrap each loaf tightly in plastic and then foil. The wrapped fruitcakes can be stored in a cool, dry place for up to 3 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 52437,&quot;Tlacoyos De Frijol Y Requeson (Bean And Cheese Tlacoyos) 1 teaspoon lard 1/4 small onion, the rest chopped for garnish 1 medium garlic clove, peeled 16 ounces cooked beans (any kind will do), with at least 1/2 cup broth reserved, or 1 (15.5-ounce) can beans, liquid drained and reserved salt 1 pound fresh tortilla masa, or 1 1/2 cups masa harina 1 to 1 1/2 cups warm water 1 cup ricotta or homemade requeson 1 (15-ounce) jar pickled cactus strips, or 4 large cactus paddles, diced and blanched in boiling salted water for 3 to 5 minutes, until just tender Chopped fresh cilantro Crumbled queso fresco Salsa of choice Instructions: 1 Heat the lard in a skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the onion wedge and garlic. Fry, turning occasionally, until blistered and deep golden brown.<br> 2 Add the beans and mash roughly, using the bottom of a heatproof cup. You don&#39;t want them too pasty and smooth. In Spanish, they call the desired texture martajada. Add a little bean broth if they look too dry. Cook until the flavors combine, adding more broth as needed, about 5 minutes. Season with salt. Transfer to a bowl nearby.<br> 3 If you&#39;re using masa harina, place in a deep bowl and pour 1 cup of the warm water on top. Knead together for about 5 minutes to form a thick, pliable dough. To check whether the dough is sufficiently moist, break off a small ball and flatten it. If the edges crack, you need more water-up to 1/2 cup. (The masa should be moister than the average tortilla masa, as it will cook longer than a tortilla and shouldn&#39;t dry out.) If using fresh tortilla masa, sprinkle with a few drops of water and knead firmly, adding the water a teaspoon at a time until the masa is very soft and creamy, about 5 minutes. (For fresh masa you will only need perhaps 1/4 cup water total.) Grab a piece of masa and cover the rest with a damp dish cloth to keep it hydrated.<br> 4 Roll the masa into a ball just larger than a golf ball, and using your palm, flatten into a disk about 1/4 inch thick. (You can also place the ball on a tortilla press, but be careful not to press it too thin.) Fresh masa will be much easier to work with than masa harina, but if you&#39;re using the latter, keep working and patting, pressing firmly on the masa ball to form a circular shape.<br> 5 Holding the disk in your palm, add 1 to 2 tablespoons beans or requeson to the center, spreading the filling into a longish rectangle, without hitting the top or bottom edges. The filling amount really depends on how big your disk is-if the filling spills out when you try to close the tlacoyo, you have too much.<br> 6 Fold both sides of the tlacoyo toward the center to enclose the filling. Press the seams together, pinching them closed with your thumbs. Pinch the seams closed with your thumbs. Set aside on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining masa and filling.<br> 7 Warm a comal or nonstick skillet on medium heat. Place the tlacoyo in the pan, without oil, and let cook. Once the sides start to dry slightly, turn it over. If you don&#39;t start to see golden brown freckles, turn up the heat; if you see burned spots, lower the heat. Keep turning at intervals until both sides are freckled and crisp, and the edges have puffed a bit, 10 to 12 minutes in all.<br> 8 Garnish with cactus, cilantro, cheese, salsa and onion. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Tempranillo]&quot; 52438,&quot;Stuffed Artichoke Cake Nonstick cooking spray 1 16- to 18-ounce box yellow cake mix (plus required ingredients) 1 16-ounce container marshmallow cream 3 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Green and red food coloring 1 12-ounce bag green candy melts 12 red candy melts 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening 3 tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat the inside of a 1-quart ovenproof bowl and a 2-cup ovenproof measuring cup with cooking spray. Prepare the cake mix as the label directs. Pour 2 cups batter into the measuring cup and the rest into the bowl. Bake the cakes until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes in the bowl and cup, then invert onto a rack to cool completely. Make the frosting: Beat the marshmallow cream, butter and confectioners&#39; sugar with a mixer until fluffy, 3 minutes. Tint dark green with green food coloring and a few drops of red. (If the frosting is too thick, beat in 1 tablespoon hot water.) Flip the cakes right-side up. Trim the top of the bowl cake to make it level. Cut off a 1 1/2-inch piece from the bottom of the cup-shaped cake, then trim the top to make it level. Reserve all the cake trimmings. Put the bowl cake on a baking sheet, trimmed-side up. Spread the top with a layer of frosting, then place the cup-shaped cake on top, wide-end down. Freeze about 20 minutes. Melt the green and red candy melts with the shortening in the microwave. Dip the back of 10 plastic spoons in the candy to coat (do not let the candy go over the edge). Place on a separate baking sheet lined with wax paper. Freeze until set, no more than 5 minutes. Remove from the freezer. Carefully bend the bowl of the spoon and the handle to release the candy shell. (Don&#39;t worry if some break-you can remelt them.) Repeat to make about 80 leaves, remelting the candy as needed. Use a paring knife to trim 1 inch from the narrow end of each candy leaf. Save the small trimmed pieces for the top of the cake. (You can make the leaves a day ahead; store in an airtight container at room temperature.) Transfer the cake to a serving plate; arrange strips of wax paper around the bottom edge of the cake to keep the plate clean. Cover the cake with a generous layer of frosting to make an artichoke shape. Starting at the top center of the cake, arrange the small trimmed candy pieces in concentric circles, cut-edge up; cover the entire top. Place rows of the large candy leaves around the side of the cake to cover completely. Chill to set the frosting. Crumble the reserved cake trimmings on a baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F, stirring, until toasted; cool. Place the coconut in a resealable bag with 2 drops green food coloring; massage until green. Empty into a bowl and crumble in the cake crumbs. Sprinkle the crumb mixture on top of the cake and into the leaves. Refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52439,&quot;Black Bean Mussels with Chinese Beer 2 tablespoons peanut oil 3 cloves garlic, crushed and finely chopped 1 tablespoon peeled and grated fresh ginger 1 Fresno cl, seeded (if desired) and chopped 2 heaping tablespoons fermented, salted black beans, washed and crushed Splash Shaohsing rice wine or dry sherry, optional 2 pounds mussels, washed and de-bearded 2 cups Chinese beer 3 tablespoons light soy sauce 3 spring onions, chopped, whites separated and greens reserved for garnish Handful fresh cilantro stems and leaves, roughly chopped, for garnish Instructions: Heat the wok over high heat and add the peanut oil.

Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season the beef well with salt; then sear it on all sides, about 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes with their juices, wine, vinegar, fennel seeds, garlic, carrots, celery, bay leaves and onion. Season the liquid with 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a simmer, cover and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is almost tender, about 2 hours. Uncover and cook until the meat is tender all the way through and falling off the bone, 30 to 45 minutes more. Cool the meat in the braising liquid. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Place the meat on a cutting board and pull it into large bite-size chunks with 2 forks. Remove any fat from the surface of the sauce and discard; return the meat to the sauce. (The dish can be prepared to this point up to 2 days ahead, the cooled, covered and refrigerated.) For the pasta: Mix the semolina flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the eggs, yolks, lemon zest and juice and pepper; mix slowly to make a rough dough. Switch to the dough hook attachment and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Form the dough into a ball by hand; cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and cover with a towel. Roll the dough with a pasta machine into sheets to setting number 6. Dust with semolina and lay on baking sheets; dry for 15 minutes. Then cut into fettuccini with the appropriate attachment. Dust with semolina and set aside on baking sheets; dry for at least 1 hour. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and salt it generously. Add the fettuccini and cook, stirring frequently, until al dente, about 4 minutes. Drain and toss with the grated pecorino. Transfer to serving plates. Spoon the meat sauce over the pasta and sprinkle with the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Brunello di Montalcino, Tempranillo]&quot; 52441,&quot;Irish Cream Dream 20 gingersnap cookies 3 tablespoons butter, melted 1 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 1/2 cup Irish cream (recommended: Baileys Irish Cream) Instructions: Line the ramekins with plastic wrap creating a shell and leaving long flaps to cover the ramekins later.

Return a list of the wine types only. recipe: Baked Ziti with Meat Sauce 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 pound ground beef&quot; 52448,&quot;Wild Mushroom Salad 1 cup shiitake mushrooms 1 cup crimini mushrooms 1 cup button mushrooms 1 cup morel mushrooms 1 cup portobello mushrooms 2 bay leaves 1 teaspoon white peppercorns 1 teaspoon salt 4 cups water 3 tablespoons clarified butter 2 shallots, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons yellow curry powder 2 tablespoons fresh basil, thyme, rosemary and parsley, chopped 1/4 cup red bell pepper, diced 1/4 cup Spanish olive oil 1/4 cup white truffle oil (or Hazelnut oil) 3/4 cup rice vinegar 1 pinch salt and pepper Instructions: The stems and caps of the mushrooms are used for different parts of the recipe, so separating them is the first step. Take a knife and cut the stems from the caps of all the different mushroom varieties, put the caps in one bowl, and the stems in another. Next we make a stock by placing all the mushroom stems into a pot, along with the bay leaves, white peppercorns, teaspoon of salt and water. Bring that to a heavy boil, and let reduce. All of this needs to reduce to 1/4 of a cup of finished stock, so patience is needed. After about 15 to 20 minutes on high heat, take the stock and pour through a fine strainer, if 1/4 cup of liquid is left, discard the pulp and save the liquid off to one side. Take the mushroom caps, and slice them. Add the sliced mushroom caps and saute in butter until tender. Then add in the shallots and garlic, and only saute for about another minute, or until the shallots and garlic are translucent. Pull the saute pan off the stove, and add the curry powder, fresh herbs, red bell peppers, oils, rice vinegar, pinch of salt and pepper, and mushroom stock. Pour this mixture into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap, and let sit in a warm place for 1 hour, to allow all the flavors and aromas of the stock to infuse into the mushrooms. Strain this salad, and serve the mushrooms on one plate, and save the stock as a dressing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 52449,&quot;Tarragon Scented Chanterelles and Shallots 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 pounds fresh chanterelle mushrooms, torn apart into uniform pieces 1/2 cup sliced shallot rings (about 6 or 8 large shallots) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon leaves 1 tablespoon butter Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil in a large pan over high heat.

Combine the egg yolks, sugar and 1/2 cup of the heavy cream in a medium saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil, constantly stirring so the yolks do not cook. Remove from the heat, add the gelatin and stir until dissolved. Let cool to room temperature. Add the remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whip to soft peaks. Gently mix into the cooled yolk mixture and chill overnight. For the pate a choux: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Bring the butter, sugar, salt and 1 cup of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat. Quickly stir in the flour with a wooden spoon. Return to medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture pulls away from the sides and a film forms on the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until slightly cooled, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and add the 4 whole eggs, 1 at a time, until a soft peak forms when the batter is touched with your finger. If a peak does not form after the 4 eggs, lightly beat the remaining egg white and mix it into the batter a little at a time until it does. Transfer the pate a choux to a pastry bag fitted with a 5/8-inch plain tip. Pipe the dough into 2-inch rounds about 1 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Gently smooth the pointed peaks with a moistened finger, rounding the tops to ensure even rising. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 25 minutes. The profiteroles should feel light and airy. Transfer them to wire racks to cool completely. For the apple jam: Bring the sugar and 3 tablespoons of water to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Continue to cook, swirling the pan occasionally and brushing down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush, until the mixture turns a deep amber color, about 4 minutes. Add the apples, vanilla bean and scraped seeds, if using, and stir to coat. Some of the caramel will seize, but that?s okay because it?s just going to melt down again. Reduce the heat to medium and stir occasionally to help the apples cook evenly and dissolve any pieces of caramel. Continue to cook until the apples are translucent and softened (some apples will hold their shape, but should still be softened), and most of the liquid has evaporated, 20 to 25 minutes. Add the lemon juice and stir to combine. If desired, break up any remaining larger pieces of apple with a wooden spoon for a smoother consistency. Discard the vanilla bean and store the apple jam in a glass jar or container in the refrigerator for up to one month. To serve: Transfer the pastry cream and apple jam to 2 separate pastry bags. Snip off the ends and pipe equal parts pastry cream and apple jam into each profiterole. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52467,&quot;Prime Aged Cote de Boeuf with Roasted Baby Carrots, Shallots and Aligot 4 pieces, aged beef rib-eye steaks Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil, for searing 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 2 shallots minced 8 ounces haricots verts, blanched, sliced on a bias 2 teaspoons picked chervil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 bunches baby carrots, peeled Olive oil, for coating 10 small shallots 2 sprigs thyme 1 cup beef reduction 1/4 cup red wine reduction, to taste 1/4 cup port reduction, to taste 3 carrots, juiced 1 bunch baby carrots, peeled and greens removed 1 -ounce butter Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 1/2 pounds Idaho potatoes 1 teaspoon unsalted butter 1 pound Cantal or Laguiole cheese, grated 1 ounce milk Unsalted butter, for adjusting consistency Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.

Let sit overnight night in refrigerator. Get up next morning make Bloodymary, take ribs out of refrigerator, go out in backyard and start smoker. Add about 4 to 5 hickory chunks soaked in water. When smoker is ready place ribs in rib rack and place on smoker. Temperature should stay around 200 to 250 degrees F. Smoke for about 3 hours, turning once about 1/2 way through the cooking time. After 3 hours mop ribs with BearBQ sauce and wrap in foil, seal tightly and put back on smoker for about 1 hour. Unwrap ribs mop again with sauce and put back on smoker for another 1/2 hour to 1 hour. When ribs are done the bone should be able to be pulled away from the meat easily. Tender as my heart.

Brown the sausages all over, in batches if necessary, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove to a plate as they brown. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the sauerkraut and toss to combine with the onions. Add the thyme, coriander and allspice and stir to combine. Season with pepper. Pour in the cider and reduce by half. Add the stock and brown sugar and return to a simmer. Tuck the sausages back into the pot and simmer, uncovered, until the kraut is very tender and the sauce is flavorful and slightly reduced, 25 to 30 minutes. Season with salt, if needed. Bring the sauce to a boil, add the butter and swirl to melt and combine. Serve topped with the parsley. Remove any loose leaves from the cabbage head and reserve. Quarter the cabbage and thinly slice, on a mandoline if you have one. (The shreds should be about the thickness of a quarter.) Toss the cabbage in a large bowl with the pickling salt. Work the cabbage through your hands and massage for a minute or two, until the cabbage begins to \\u201csweat\\u201d and release some water. Thinly slice, then julienne the green apple, leaving the peel on. (Again, use a mandoline if you have one.) Slice the ginger into coins and press with the side of your knife to bruise them slightly and release their oils. Add the apples, ginger and allspice berries to the cabbage and toss well. Let sit for an hour or two, until the cabbage has released quite a bit of water. Pack the cabbage mixture into a large, wide-mouthed crock and press down very firmly until the liquid the cabbage has released covers it. (Depending on the age of your cabbage, it may release less water; a fresher cabbage will release a lot of water, while a cabbage that has been stored all winter will release less.) If the cabbage is not covered, mix together 1 quart cold water and 4 1/2 teaspoons pickling salt until dissolved and pour over enough to cover the cabbage. Use a couple of the reserved whole cabbage leaves to cover the surface of the cabbage. Cover with a plate (or the weight provided, if you have a fermenting crock) and set something heavy on top to weight it. (You can use cans. Many people like to use a resealable plastic bag filled with the same salted water solution used above because it weights evenly and if it leaks, it doesn\\u2019t ruin the fermentation process.) Store the crock in a cool, dry place. Check the kraut after 2 days. There should be a few bubbles around the sides. Skim any scum that has risen to the surface. Check the kraut every few days and repeat skimming, if needed. Depending on the temperature of your room, the kraut should be ready after about a week. (Some people ferment for a couple of weeks or more, depending on how funky they want their kraut to be.) Divide the kraut and pack into jars. Store in the refrigerator. Drain and rinse the kraut well (discarding any ginger pieces) before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 52500,&quot;Coconut Margarita 2 1/2 cups coconut water, chilled 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon lime juice 1/4 cup finely shredded coconut shavings Ice, for serving 1/2 cup coconut rum 1/4 cup white chocolate liqueur 1/4 cup tequila Instructions: In a small pot over medium heat, combine 1/2 cup coconut water with the sugar.

Line 2 muffin pans with cupcake liners.<br> In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.<br> Place the chopped chocolate in a small heat-safe bowl and pour the boiling water over it. Whisk until the chocolate is melted, and then let it cool for 15 minutes.<br> In a small bowl or large measuring cup, combine the buttermilk and vanilla extract. Set aside.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on high speed until foamy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour in the oil, whisking until it is combined, about 30 seconds. Next, slowly pour in the cooled, melted chocolate. Add the buttermilk mixture, and then pour in the granulated sugar and whisk the batter until it is smooth and liquid, about 2 minutes. Stop the mixer, remove the bowl and add the sifted dry ingredients. Mix by hand just until the dry ingredients are incorporated, lifting and folding in from the bottom center. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix again just briefly; the batter will look very lumpy, but stop mixing. Pour the batter through a medium-mesh sieve into a large bowl to remove any lumps. Press against the batter in the sieve with the spatula to push through as much batter as possible. Fill the cupcake liners half full with batter and bake until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the pans to wire racks to cool completely before filling and frosting. To assemble: Core the center of each cooled cupcake using an apple corer. Place the cooled, thickened Dark Chocolate Ganache in a pastry bag. Cut a small bit off the bottom of the bag and fill each cupcake by inserting the tip of the pastry bag into the cored cupcake. Generously frost the top of each cupcake with the Chocolate Mascarpone Frosting. Place the chocolate chips in a heat-safe bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream until you see tiny bubbles around the edges. Pour the heavy cream over the chocolate and leave it alone for 5 to 10 minutes. Add the butter and vanilla extract to the melted chocolate and whisk everything together until it has a smooth consistency. Let the ganache cool to room temperature; the ganache will thicken upon standing.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, combine the mascarpone cheese, cocoa powder, butter and vanilla extract. Beat on medium speed until smooth. Gradually add 2 cups of the powdered sugar, beating well. Beat in the milk. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and then gradually beat in the remaining powdered sugar. If necessary, beat in additional milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, to reach desired consistency. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 52504,&quot;Low Country Stuffed Quail with Oyster-Leek Ragout and Hominy Grits Cake 1/2 cup small dice smoked bacon 1/4 cup onion, brunoise 1/4 cup celery, brunoise 1 cup crumbled cornbread 1 cup toasted pecans 1/4 cup melted butter 1 cup chicken stock 12 quail Salt and pepper Hominy Grits Cake, recipe follows Oyster-Leek-Ragout, recipe follows 2 cups water 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 3/4 cup stone-ground white grits 1/2 cup milk (optional) 1/4 cup grated Asiago cheese 1 cup hominy, fresh or canned 2 cups flour Salt and pepper 3 eggs 2 tablespoons water 2 cups panko bread crumbs 2 tablespoons minced shallot 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 1/2 cups 1/4-inch diced leeks 1 tablespoon butter 1 cup oyster liquor 2 cups heavy cream Salt and pepper 24 select oysters (4 oysters per serving) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, corn syrup and heavy cream until smooth, then stir into the white chocolate until combined. Turn the heat off and leave the chocolate over the double boiler, whisking occasionally to keep smooth. If the glaze is too thick, add more cream and whisk until smooth. Divide the glaze between two bowls. With food coloring, dye each bowl a separate color (whichever you choose). Add the second bowl of colored glaze back to the first, pouring only along the edge. Use a skewer to swirl only slightly (when you dip your donuts you will swirl the glaze more). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 52515,&quot;Chocolate Roulage with Bourbon Cream Softened unsalted butter, for greasing baking sheet 5 egg yolks 1 cup granulated sugar 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 3 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 tablespoon espresso or strong black coffee 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 5 egg whites 2 cups heavy cream 2 teaspoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup bourbon Seeds from 1/2 vanilla bean 1 cup cocoa powder, plus more for dusting Fresh berries, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Butter a rimmed jelly roll/baking sheet and line with parchment paper. Butter the top of the paper as well, especially the corners. In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks and granulated sugar on medium speed until fluffy and the sugar is not gritty, 10 to12 minutes. While the eggs are beating, put the chocolate in a bowl and melt over a double boiler. When the chocolate is melted, remove from the heat and let it cool a bit. Sit the bowl in some cool water for a few minutes if necessary. Incorporate the egg mixture into the chocolate by adding a little at a time to temper the mixture, so you don&#39;t cook the eggs. Add the espresso and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. In a clean bowl, with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Incorporate one-quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture; make sure no white streaks remain. Carefully fold in the remaining whites into the chocolate, taking care not to deflate the whites but making sure not to have any white streaks in the batter. Spread the batter in the prepared pan and bake, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and spread a dampened tea towel or several dampened paper towels over the top of the cake and let it sit for 30 minutes. In a clean bowl, with the whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar, bourbon, vanilla bean and the remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla extract on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Carefully turn the cake out onto clean parchment paper, making sure to have 4 to 5 inches of excess paper at the end to help you roll the cake. Using a fine sieve or sifter, sprinkle 1/2 cup cocoa powder over the top of the cake. Spread the whipped cream mixture over the top, leaving 1/4-inch on each side. Using the edge of the parchment paper, carefully roll the cake creating a jellyroll effect, tuck and roll as you go, peeling back the paper along the way. Put the rolled cake seam-side down and dust the whole cake with the remaining 1/2 cup cocoa powder. Chill 2 hours before serving. You might even put the cake in the freezer for an hour before serving so that it is easy to slice. To serve, slice cake with a serrated knife and place on chilled plates. Garnish with a light dusting of cocoa powder and fresh berries. This recipe was created by a contestant during a cooking competition.

Adjust the seasonings. Set aside. Make the salad: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt until the water tastes slightly of salted broth. Prepare an ice bath. Blanch the English peas and snap peas separately, for about 10 seconds each. Shock in the ice water and drain on paper towels. Cut the snap peas into thirds. In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over low heat. Tear the Jamon Serrano slices into bite-sized pieces and add to the oil in the skillet. Cook until crispy on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes total. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Assemble the salad: Toss the English peas, snap peas, pea shoots and snow peas with the vinaigrette to taste.

Stir a few times, then let stand until the yeast has dissolved and the mixture begins to bubble, 1 to 2 minutes. Sift 1 1/2 cups of the flour into the bowl, and stir until mostly smooth. Cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place for about 30 minutes. The mixture will expand, loosen in texture and have large bubbles on the surface. Meanwhile, place the dried fruit, pecans, brandy and 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar in a microwave-safe bowl, stir until the sugar is dissolved, then microwave until hot and bubbling, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir, then set aside to cool. In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour, cinnamon, cardamom and salt. Generously butter a 12-cup Bundt pan; set aside. When the flour-yeast mixture has risen, beat the butter with the granulated sugar and remaining 3/4 cup brown sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, until combined (the mixture may look slightly curdled at this stage), then add 1 teaspoon of the vanilla. Beat in the flour-yeast mixture. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low, then gradually beat in the flour-spice mixture. Raise the mixer speed to medium, add the fruit-nut mixture with any remaining liquid and beat until the fruit is well blended. The dough should be soft, loose and elastic, almost like brioche dough or an extremely thick batter. Transfer the dough to the prepared Bundt pan, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until the dough fills the pan a little more than 3/4 of the way, about 1 hour. When the cake is almost done rising, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap from the cake. Bake the cake until golden brown and a cake tester comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes in the pan on a wire rack. Loosen the sides with a small metal spatula, and turn the cake out, flat-side down, onto the wire rack to cool completely. Before serving, stir together the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 tablespoon of the milk and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in a small bowl. Gradually add as much of the second tablespoon of milk as needed to make a thick glaze that will just gently run. Spoon the glaze over the top of the cake, allowing it to run down the outside and inside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 52518,&quot;Grilled Watermelon with Whipped Feta Dip Neutral oil, for the grates if grilling outdoors 1 small seedless watermelon (3 to 4 pounds)<br> 2 cloves garlic, peeled<br> One 7-ounce block good-quality feta, packed in brine, brine reserved (see Cook\\u2019s Note)<br> 1/4 cup nonfat Greek yogurt (see Cook\\u2019s Note)<br> 2 teaspoons packed fresh herbs, such as dill, mint or thyme leaves, plus more for serving<br> Honey, for serving<br> Freshly cracked black pepper<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat.

Heat the cream, half-and-half, and vanilla bean in a medium saucepan over medium heat just to a boil. Immediately turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar in a large bowl just until combined. Whisking constantly, gradually pour in the hot cream mixture. Strain the mixture into the baking pan to smooth it and to remove the vanilla bean.<br> Place the pan in a hot water bath. Bake in the center of the oven until set but not too firm (it will cook a little more as it cools), 40 to 50 minutes. Remove from the water bath and let cool 15 minutes. Tightly cover with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic does not touch the surface of the custard. (The recipe can be made up to this point and kept refrigerated up to 3 days in advance.) Up to 4 hours before serving, fill your spoons with the chilled cooked custard by scooping each spoon into the pan of custard. Round the tops with a small spatula, or a butter knife. Keep cold. Right before serving, thinly slice the banana (about 1/8-inch thick). Top each spoonful of custard with a slice of banana, lightly pressing it onto the custard. Sprinkle the entire surface with a layer of coarse sugar and place on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining spoons. Torch the sugar until it is melted and well browned.

Line a sheet tray with a wire rack. Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife, separate the chicken wings into the drummettes and wings, discarding the wing tip joint. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, cream, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt and black pepper. In a paper bag, shake together flour, cornstarch and 1 tablespoon salt. Place chicken in egg mixture and toss well to coat. Place chicken in batches in the bag of flour mixture. Shake well to coat. Set on wire rack to let coating set, 20 minutes. Meanwhile make the Honey BBQ Sauce and the Spicy Butter Sauce. In a small saucepan, bring the ingredients for the Honey BBQ Sauce to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and cook until sauce has reduced by half, about 12 minutes, stirring frequently. In another saucepan, bring the ingredients for the Spicy Butter Sauce to a simmer. Remove from heat and let basil infuse in butter for at least 15 minutes. Remove basil. When oil is at the right temperature, add chicken, working in batches, and fry until cooked through and crispy, about 13 minutes. Season chicken with salt then immediately toss, taking turns with batches, in the Honey BBQ sauce, or the Spicy Butter Sauce or sprinkle with the lemon and lime zest. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52538,&quot;Eggplant Sandwich 1 whole eggplant 1 teaspoon olive oil, plus more for brushing Salt 1 baguette 2 green bell peppers 2 red bell peppers 2 tomatoes 1 red onion 1/4 cup feta cheese 1/4 cup goat cheese 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves Pepper 1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Slice the eggplant into 15 pieces, brush with olive oil, place on cookie sheet, and sprinkle with salt. Bake for 25 minutes and let cool. Cut the baguette into 1/3&#39;s and slice in 1/2 for sandwiches. Slice green and red peppers, discarding stems and seeds. Slice the tomatoes and red onion and set aside.

Lastly, sprinkle with oregano, salt, and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 52539,&quot;Pumpkin Cut-Out Pie 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, diced 3 large eggs One 15-ounce can pure pumpkin puree (about 2 cups) 3 large eggs, lightly beaten 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 1/4 cups half-and-half 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg Instructions: For the dough: Whisk together the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-sized bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Lightly beat 2 eggs in a small bowl. Stir them into the dough with a fork or by hand. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon cold water over the mixture. Alternatively, make the dough in a food processor. In a machine fitted with the metal blade, pulse the flour, sugar and salt until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-sized bits of butter, about 10 times. Lightly beat 2 eggs in a small bowl, add them to the machine and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry, add up to a tablespoon cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand. Form the dough into a ball, then cut in half. Form each half into a disk, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 disk into a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie dish and trim the edges, leaving about 1 extra inch hanging over the edge. Tuck the overhanging dough underneath itself to form a thick edge that is even with the rim. Flute the edge as desired. Freeze the pie shell for 30 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment. On a lightly floured surface, roll the remaining disk into a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes. Position 2 oven racks in the center and lower third of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Put a piece of parchment or foil over the pie shell and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake on a baking sheet on the center rack until the dough is set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and lift the sides of the parchment paper to remove the beans. Continue baking until the pie shell is lightly golden brown, about 10 more minutes. Cool on a rack. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, make the pumpkin cut-out. Lightly beat the remaining egg in a small bowl. Remove the rolled dough from the freezer and, working on the baking sheet, cut out a solid 9-inch circle. Using a pattern or working free-handed, cut out two circles for the eyes, a triangle for the nose, and a toothy grin to resemble a jack-o&#39;-lantern&#39;s face. Mimicking the ribbed indentations of a pumpkin, cut out indentation markings along the top, bottom, and sides of the face (these will act as vents for the filling as well). Using a scrap of dough, cut out a \\stem\\ and attach it to the top of the face using the beaten egg wash as glue. Return the face to the freezer for 20 minutes. For the filling: Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, brown sugar, half-and-half, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, salt and nutmeg until smooth. Return the pie shell to the baking sheet and pour in the filling.<br> Brush the frozen pumpkin face with the beaten egg, then lift it off the baking sheet. Place the face gently over the filling.<br> Bake on the lower oven rack until the top crust is golden brown and the filling is set but the center is still slightly loose, 50 to 60 minutes. (If the edges get very dark, cover them with aluminum foil.) Cool on a rack. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52540,&quot;Beer-Simmered Bratwurst with Onions and Red Cabbage Sauerkraut 3 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, smashed 3 pounds precooked bratwurst, pricked with a fork 6 bottles dark beer 2 cups water 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon caraway seeds 1 teaspoon mustard seeds 1 (1-inch) piece of fresh ginger, peeled and chopped Hot dog buns, brown bread, or hoagie buns Sweet and hot German mustard, optional, for garnish Spicy brown mustard, optional, for garnish Red Cabbage Sauerkraut, recipe follows Pickles, optional, for garnish Pickled beets, optional, for garnish Pickled eggs, optional, for garnish 1/4 cup olive oil 2 cups red wine vinegar 1 cup water 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon whole mustard seeds 2 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced 1 large head red cabbage, thinly shredded Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat the grill to high. Arrange the onion slices and garlic along the bottom of a medium stockpot. Place the bratwurst on top and then add the beer, water, coriander, caraway, mustard seeds, and ginger. Bring to a simmer over the grill grates or on a burner. Simmer the sausages in the mixture for about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the bratwurst sit in the liquid for 10 minutes. Remove the sausages with a pair of tongs onto a platter. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl. Grill the sausages until the casings are crisp and golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve the bratwurst on the buns with the onions, mustard and sauerkraut, if desired. Garnish with pickles, pickled beets, and pickled eggs, if desired. Preheat grill to high. In a medium saucepan, combine the oil, vinegar, water, and sugar over medium heat, and cook until the sugar has melted. Add the mustard seeds, garlic, and cabbage, and cook until the cabbage is soft, about 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gewrztraminer]</p><p>&quot; 52541,&quot;Nonna&#39;s Artichokes 2 large or 3 medium 10-ounce artichokes, trimmed, thorns removed, halved lengthwise and chokes removed 1 large lemon, halved Butter, for greasing the baking dish 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic, peeled 3 tablespoons anchovy paste 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup medium black olives, pitted and coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 3/4 cup plain breadcrumbs Instructions: Butter a 9-by-13-inch flameproof baking dish. Set aside. Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Rub the cut sides of the artichokes with the lemon halves. Squeeze the juice from the lemon halves into the water and add the lemon shells. Add the artichoke halves, cover and cook until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in a colander, stem sides facing upwards, to allow any excess water to drain out from the leaves. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the garlic and discard. Remove the pan from the heat and let the oil cool slightly. Whisk in the anchovy paste until smooth. Return the pan to the heat and place the artichokes, cut-side down, in the pan. Cook for 6 minutes. Turn the artichokes over and cook until tender, 6 minutes longer. Remove the artichokes and reserve the pan juices. Preheat a broiler. Arrange the artichokes, cut-side up, in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the salt, pepper, olives and capers.

Place the pork loin bone-side down on a work surface. Insert the blade of a very sharp knife along the rib bones and slice down but not all the way through (stop about an inch from the bottom). This will release the loin from the ribs. Open the meat up a bit, turn your knife sideways and continue to slice through the meat, opening it up as it goes until you have a flat piece of pork (which will be rolled up back to the bones once stuffed with filling). Gently pound until even. Season all sides with salt and pepper. In a food processor, add the parsley, dates, olive oil and garlic and pulse until a rough paste forms. Spread the paste on the inside of the loin, then add a layer of crumbled sausage followed by an even layer of baby spinach. Tightly roll into a pinwheel and secure tightly with butcher twine in between each bone. Transfer the loin to a v-shaped rack in a large roasting pan and add 2 cups of water to the bottom of the pan to catch drippings. Roast for 20 minutes to create a nice crust. Then reduce the heat to 325 degrees F and roast until the pork registers 140 degrees F on a meat thermometer, about 30 minutes more. Place on a cutting board and lightly tent with foil for 20 minutes while you make the pan sauce. To make the pan sauce, pour the pork drippings into a measuring cup. Skim off 2 tablespoons of the fat and add to the roasting pan (discard the rest of the accumulated fat from the measuring cup). Heat over medium-low heat over 2 burners. Add the flour and whisk until golden, scraping up any bits accumulated on the bottom of the pan. Add the white wine and deglaze for 2 minutes. Add the mustard and pan drippings and simmer until thick, whisking the whole time, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Slice the pork along the bone and plate with a nice ladleful of the mustard gravy.

Add the shallots, garlic, sage and 2 teaspoons salt and season with pepper. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, add the squash and remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until butter begins to brown and squash is tender, about 12 minutes. Add cider and 2 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Remove the sage sprigs and set aside to cool slightly. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium high heat. Add the sage leaves, in two batches, and cook until bright green, 20 to 30 seconds. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt. Set aside. Puree the soup in a blender, (work in batches if needed) or with an immersion blender. Return soup to pot and reheat over medium heat. Stir in vinegar and transfer soup to warmed soup bowls. Serve in warmed soup bowls as is or garnished with creme fraeche or sage leaves. Serve with breadsticks. When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52550,&quot;Flavored Vinegar 1 cup raspberries Peel of 1 lemon rind- sliced 1/8 cup sugar 2 cups white vinegar Instructions: Put raspberries into a sealable bottle, size may vary as recipe is flexible, but 1/2 liter is best.

When cool enough to handle, rub from the outside to remove all the pepper skin, split, and seed.<br> Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a casserole dish, or tagine. Chop the pepper and tomatoes and place in the dish, add the chopped onion and some garlic. Heat over a flame to cook slowly.<br> Then start making the marinade for the fish: Crush the fresh cilantro and flat leaf parsley with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar. Place into a flat mixing bowl with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add turmeric, ground ginger, and black pepper.<br> Prepare the fish by chopping the heads and tails off, slice diagonally across its body to allow the flavors to penetrate the fish. Add sea bass, red mullet, and squid to marinade. Leave for 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Add the fish to the flavor base, big pieces first. Leave the squid for last minutes, as this does not take long to cook. Cook over the heat for 10 minutes. Then add the squid and shrimps and any leftover juices. Cook for a further 5 minutes.<br> Serve with couscous and salad. &quot;,&quot;[Ros, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52556,&quot;Perfect Roast Chicken 3 carrots, peeled and cut into thirds 3 ribs celery, peeled and cut into thirds 3 onions, peeled and cut into quarters 1 (3 1/2 to 4 pound) chicken, rinsed and patted dry 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons cracked white pepper 1 lemon, halved 2 fresh bay leaves 6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 4 sprigs rosemary, roughly chopped, plus 1 tablespoon for gravy 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup chicken stock 2 tablespoons roasted garlic 1 cup dry white wine Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.

Cover and let sit at room temperature until bubbly and increased in volume by about 20 percent, about 8 hours. For the dough: Add the all-purpose flour, water and whole-wheat flour to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Weigh out 7 ounces of the levain (about 1 cup) and add to the mixer (discard any remaining levain). Mix on low until a shaggy dough forms. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br> Add the salt to the dough and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes; the dough should feel a bit sticky and wet but look smooth and very stretchy. Scrape the dough into a plastic or glass container about twice its size. Cover and let sit at room temperature until puffed, about 45 minutes.<br> Put the dough on a floured work surface, flatten it gently, then fold in thirds like a business letter. Transfer it back to the container. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.<br> Repeat the folding process one more time, transfer back to the container, cover and let sit at room temperature for another 45 minutes. After the third 45-minute rest, the dough should feel soft and pillowy; when pressed with a finger, it should leave an indentation that begins to spring back.<br> Gently scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide in half using a bench scraper. Shape each piece loosely into a round by gently tucking the edges under. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.<br> Drape 2 kitchen towels into 2 medium (8-inch) bowls and dust very generously with flour. Dust the top of the dough rounds very lightly with flour and flip over using a bench scraper. Flatten one piece of dough into a circle, then fold the left and right sides of the dough over the center. Keeping tension in the dough, begin folding down from the top edge in 3 segments, sealing the bottom edge with the last fold. Loosely cup the dough and, using your hands and the tension between the board and the dough, pull the bread very slowly towards yourself while creating a taut ball. Gently flip the dough ball over and into one of the prepared bowls. Cover loosely with another kitchen towel. Repeat the process with the second piece of dough. Place both in a warm place to rise until about 1 1/2 times their size, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.<br> About 20 minutes before baking, position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven, put a 4-quart Dutch oven and lid on the rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. When preheated, carefully transfer the hot Dutch oven to a heatsafe surface with oven mitts (leave the lid in the oven). Flip one round of dough over into the Dutch oven. Using a sharp knife, scissors or bread lame, score the top of the bread in a cross or desired pattern. Return to the oven, immediately cover with the lid and bake for 20 minutes. Lower the temperature to 425 degrees F, uncover and bake until dark brown, about 10 minutes more. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack to cool completely. Return the empty Dutch oven to the oven, raise the temperature to 500 degrees F and let heat for 10 minutes before repeating the baking process with the second dough round. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52564,&quot;Maple Orange Bourbon Glazed Ham One 7- to 8-pound bone-in spiral cut ham 1 cup orange marmalade<br> 1/2 cup bourbon<br> 1/2 cup maple syrup<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> Pinch ground cinnamon<br> Pinch ground cloves Nonstick cooking spray, for the foil<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the ham on a roasting rack in a roasting pan with the fat-side up. Use a small knife to lightly score the fat in a crosshatch pattern, taking care not to cut into the meat. Add about 1 cup of water to the bottom of the pan. Bake the ham for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze. Combine the marmalade, bourbon, maple syrup, butter, cinnamon and cloves in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring often, until the glaze is thick and syrupy, 20 to 25 minutes. Brush the ham with about half of the glaze and return to the oven. Roast, glazing the ham every 15 to 20 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches about 130 degrees F, 45 minutes to 1 hour more. (The ham will get very brown, but if the glaze starts to burn, tent with a piece of foil greased with cooking spray.

Season the beef cubes with salt and pepper and, when the pan is hot enough, add the beef. Be careful to cook the beef in batches if there isn&#39;t enough space. (Overcrowding will cause steaming, not searing.) Sear the cubes on each, and side then remove to a plate with a slotted spoon. In the fat left from the searing, add the carrots, parsnip, celery, onions, thyme, paprika, a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of pepper. Saute until tender, about 8 minutes. Raise the heat and pour in the wine. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any bits on the bottom of the pan. Raise the heat to a simmer, and then add the beef cubes back to the pot along with the bay leaves and beef broth. Cover with the prepared parchment paper and cook in the oven for 2 hours. At the 2 hour mark, remove the parchment, taste, and season with salt, if needed. Add the barley, and stir in 1 cup of water if the stew looks too dry.

Line a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin with jumbo liners and generously grease with cooking spray. Cook the eggs: Put 6 cold eggs in a medium saucepan. Add enough water to cover by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil, cover, remove from the heat and let sit for 4 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water. Gently crack the eggs so that they fracture all over and let them sit in the water for at least 20 minutes. Gently peel the eggs under cold running water. (Older eggs are easier to peel.) Make the muffin batter: Melt the 2 tablespoons of soft butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter starts to foam and cook, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add the ham and 1/4 teaspoon salt and continue to stir until browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the thyme. Cool in the skillet. Combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Whisk together the milk, sour cream, 4 tablespoons of the melted butter and the 3 remaining eggs in a separate medium bowl. Fold the egg mixture, onion mixture, Cheddar and Parmesan into the dry ingredients until just combined (don&#39;t fret if there are lumps; it means your batter isn&#39;t over-mixed). Divide half of the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Stand one egg in each cup, nestling it slightly in the batter. Spoon the remaining batter on top of the eggs, using the back of your spoon to spread the batter to make sure each egg is completely covered. Lightly brush the top of the batter in the cups with the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Bake until the muffin tops are golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the muffins rest in the hot muffin tin for at least 10 minutes. Remove, cut each muffin in half and serve warm, or transfer to a rack to cool to room temperature, cut and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 52573,&quot;Hamburger Macaroons 2 1/4 cups powdered sugar 2 cups almond flour 5 egg whites, at room temperature 2 tablespoons superfine sugar Sesame seeds, for decoration Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Combine the powdered sugar and almond flour in a bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites in a clean dry bowl. Slowly add the superfine sugar and beat until the mixture holds stiff peaks, about 7 minutes. Fold the egg whites into the almond flour and powdered sugar mixture carefully. This will add air into the mixture and make it light and fluffy. Spoon the mixture into a resealable bag with a corner cut off. It&#39;s easiest to fill your bag if you stand it up in a tall glass and fold the top down before spooning in the batter. Pipe one-inch-sized mounds of batter onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake the macaroon for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and raise the temperature to 375 degrees F. Once the oven is up to temperature, put the pans back in the oven and bake for an additional 7 to 8 minutes, or until macaroons are lightly colored. Cool on a rack. Spread butter cream frosting (recipe below) in between two macaroons to make a burger. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 52574,&quot;Sweet Potato Creme Brulee 2 sweet potatoes or 1 yam, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks 1 tablespoon molasses 1 tablespoon honey 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 teaspoons brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 quart heavy cream 2 vanilla beans, split and seeds scraped 1 cup sugar (1/2 cup and 1/2 cup measured separately) 6 egg yolks 1 tablespoon butter Instructions: Boil sweet potatoes until tender and drain. Add molasses, honey, vanilla, brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Mash by hand then beat until smooth with an electric beater. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Pour the cream into a saucepan and add the vanilla bean seeds, and the pods. Over medium low heat slowly bring to a boil, then remove from heat, cover pan and set aside for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and gradually add 1/2 cup of the sugar whipping until you see a change in color. After 15 minutes remove the vanilla pods from the cream mixture. Then slowly incorporate the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture a little at a time, whisking constantly as you go. Lightly grease 6 to 8 (4 or 6-ounce) ramekins. Add even amounts of the sweet potato mixture to the ramekins. Then fill the ramekins each 3/4 full with the custard mixture. Place the filled ramekins in a roasting pan and prepare a bain marie by adding hot water to the pan so that the water level is halfway up the side of the ramekins. Be careful to avoid splashing any water into the ramekins. Bake in the oven for 40 to 45 minutes, allow to cool and then refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. (You can do this way in advance if you wish.) Just before serving remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm up a little. Then divide the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar among the ramekins sprinkling some on the surface of each cup. Using a blow torch, melt the sugar to form a crispy sugar \\crust\\ on the top of each. This custard could be served with fruits of the season. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 52575,&quot;Three Cheese Crostini with Honey 1 French baguette, sliced on an angle Olive oil, for drizzling 4 ounces goat cheese 4 ounces mascarpone 4 ounces ricotta 1 teaspoon lemon zest Kosher salt and cracked black pepper Acacia honey, for drizzling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add in the cold lard and butter and pulse until the mix resembles cornmeal-like texture, 5 to 6 (20-second) pulses. Add the warm water and pulse until a dough ball forms. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead until the dough is elastic and smooth and no longer sticky, 3 to 4 minutes. Form into a small loaf shape, about 6 by 4-inches. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. Working with one at a time, roll into a ball, about the size of a golf ball and dust lightly with flour. Repeat. Place the balls, one at a time, into a well-floured tortilla press, press down and remove. You should have a 6-inch disc at this point. Place the disc on a floured board and roll out to 8 to 9-inch in diameter and almost paper thin, lightly dusting with flour and turning as needed. You can stack them, separated by waxed paper. Heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add the raw tortillas, one at time, cook for 30 to 45 seconds per side, or just until the bubbles puff up, then turn and repeat. Keep the cooked tortillas in a towel, covered, to keep warm and pliable. Special equipment: tortilla press. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 52617,&quot;Macaroni Salad with Grilled Shrimp 1/4 cup olive oil Juice from 1/2 lemon<br> 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/4 cup sweet relish<br> 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard<br> 1 pound elbow pasta, cooked according to box directions<br> 1 stalk celery, diced<br> 1 sweet onion, diced<br> 1/2 green bell pepper, diced<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley<br> Paprika, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill pan or grill to medium-high heat. Whisk together the olive oil and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Add the shrimp to the bowl and toss to coat, sprinkling generously with salt and pepper. Place the shrimp on the grill pan (or in a grill basket on the grill) and cook, flipping once halfway through, until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Set aside. Stir together the mayonnaise, relish, vinegar and Dijon mustard in a large serving bowl. Add the cooked pasta, celery, onion and bell pepper and toss to combine and coat with dressing.

Lay out a piece of heavy-duty foil 12 inches by 18 inches. Fold the four sides up to create walls and spread the shrimp in the center of the foil. Toss the shrimp with the garlic, chipotle sauce, cumin, oregano, coriander and salt. Pour in the beer. Dot the butter pieces on top. Cover with another large piece of foil and crimp and fold the edges together to seal tightly. Transfer the foil pack to the grill, close the lid and cook until the shrimp are pink and cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for a few minutes. Carefully tear the packet open, being careful not to let the escaping steam burn you. Squeeze lime juice over the shrimp and sprinkle with cilantro. Serve the shrimp with the rice and pass extra chipotle hot sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Ros]&quot; 52619,&quot;Glazed Lavender Sugar Cookies 4 cups (512 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 teaspoons dried culinary lavender, finely chopped or crushed in a mortar and pestle<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 3/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1 cup (227 grams) unsalted butter, softened<br> 2/3 cup (135 grams) granulated sugar<br> 2/3 cup (80 grams) powdered sugar<br> Zest from half of a lemon<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 3 cups (360 grams) powdered sugar 1 cup (227 grams) unsalted butter, softened<br> Food coloring 2 cups (240 grams) powdered sugar 2 tablespoons (40 grams) corn syrup<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons whole milk<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> Food coloring, optional Instructions: For the cookies: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, lavender, baking powder and salt and set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or in a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together the butter and both sugars until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the lemon zest. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each, and then beat in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing on low until blended. Turn the dough out onto the counter and divide into 2 large discs. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour up to 2 days. When ready to bake preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment or a silicone mat. Working with 1 dough disc at a time, roll it out on a lightly floured surface to 1/2-inch-thick. Use a 3-inch round cookie cutter to cut out circles. Transfer to the prepared baking sheets spacing 1-inch apart. Gather and re-roll the scraps and cut out more circles. Bake until the cookies are just thinking about starting to turn brown, start checking at around 12 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, for the buttercream: In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or in a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat together the powdered sugar and butter until smooth. Divide the buttercream amongst individual bowls (I suggest 5 or 6) and stir food coloring into each. Transfer to pastry bags fitted with tiny round or star tips.<br> For the glaze: Whisk together the powdered sugar, corn syrup, milk, vanilla, salt and a few drops of food coloring, if using, until very smooth. You&#39;re going for the consistency of a thick glue. If it&#39;s too thick-- add a couple more drops of milk and if it&#39;s too thin-- add a few spoonfuls of powdered sugar.<br> Assemble the cookies: Dip the tops of each cooled cookie into the glaze, letting any excess drip off, and then place on a wire rack to dry. After a few minutes, once they&#39;re mostly dry to the touch (completely dry isn&#39;t necessary) you can go ahead and pipe on buttercream decorations. Go the freehand route or use cookie cutters to press indentations into the glaze which can serve as an outline for your decorations. Let dry and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 52620,&quot;Nicoise Noodle Cake 2 3-ounce packages instant ramen noodles, seasoning packets discarded 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1 bunch Swiss chard, leaves only, thinly sliced 1/2 cup fresh parsley, coarsely chopped 5 large eggs 1/4 cup coarsely grated Parmesan cheese Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Cover the noodles with hot tap water in a large bowl and soak, flipping once, for 7 minutes; they should pull apart without breaking. Drain in a strainer and shake to dry; pat with towels if needed. Return to the bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt. Add the chard and parsley to the bowl; toss, pulling apart the noodles. In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the parmesan cheese and salt and pepper to taste; add to the noodles and toss to coat.

Stir until the chips are melted. (Alternately, put the chips in a microwave safe bowl and microwave on medium for 30 seconds. Stir and microwave in 30 second intervals until the chocolate has melted. It should take 2 to 3 minutes.) Add 3 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and stir well. To form the base, dip two pretzel sticks in the chocolate and lay them side by side on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Repeat until you have 24 bases made. Put the baking sheet into the refrigerator to harden the chocolate. Pour the remaining chocolate into a squeeze bottle. Meanwhile, add the hazelnuts, sugar, and vanilla to the bowl of a food processor. With the machine running, pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Continue processing until the nuts form a smooth spread. Scoop the spread into a plastic bag and snip off a corner to make a piping bag. Remove the bases from the refrigerator and pipe a strip of hazelnut spread between each pair of chocolate covered pretzels. Squeeze chocolate over the top of each one to cover and return the baking sheet to the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Trim off any excess chocolate with a knife and wrap each bar individually.

Set the mushrooms aside to cool. Combine the thyme and rosemary and rub the mixture over the boned (skinless) side of the chicken. Season the skin side with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons fat in a large ovenproof skillet, over medium-high heat. Working in batches if necessary, brown the chicken, skin-side down until the skin is crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Lay a slice of foie gras (if using) over the thigh of each chicken. Fold the breasts over the thighs so that the breasts sit on the thigh and leg meat and the skin is on the outside. Fit a metal ring over each chicken-half to hold the meat in a compact shape. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast, basting the chicken several times with pan juices. Cook until the thighs reach and internal temperature of at least 140 degrees F. and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside to rest for 10 minutes in a warm place. Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons the fat from the skillet.

You can use the seeds from your jack o&#39; lantern!) Geoff&#39;s piping gel (Duff doesn&#39;t suggest a substitute ingredient if you don&#39;t have access to piping gel. It looks like vaseline.) A few dashes olive oil Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the spaghetti and cook for 12 minutes. Drain the pasta, and put it in a large bowl. Add the salsa and toss to coat the spaghetti. Let come to room temperature and then refrigerate until cold. Cook&#39;s Note: Duff points out it doesn&#39;t look too bad, but when it&#39;s cold, it&#39;s going to feel like \\blood and guts and snot and spit everywhere!<br> Peel the grapes and put them in a bowl. Pour in enough olive oil to coat the grapes and toss. Yuck! Cook&#39;s Note: Tips for peeling a grape: Grapes have a \\natural hole.\\ Start at the hole and peel off 1 side. Go all the way around and try to remove the peel in 4 pieces. If you&#39;re lucky, you can get it in 3 pieces. The reason to peel the grapes is to make the texture smooth and blemishless. This will make them feel more gross when they&#39;re covered in oil. With the skin off, grapes feel just like the surface of your eyeball. Drain the water from the tofu and put it into a bowl. Squeeze the tofu between your fingers to get it all mushy. Pour a little olive oil on top \\for that extra ick effect.\\ Crack 2 eggs on top of the icky tofu mess. Squeeze your fingers through it to mix the eggs and tofu together. Now it should totally gross people out! Cut the pumpkin seeds in half (Duff doesn&#39;t say which way, but he does say this is dangerous). MAKE SURE MOM OR DAD CUTS THE PUMPKIN SEEDS! THIS IS NOT A STEP FOR KIDS. Make a small slit at 1 end of each of the Vienna sausages. Stick a pumpkin seed into each slit so that it will feel like a fingernail. Arrange the severed fingers in a bowl. Spoon some slimy, gooey piping gel over the fingers. Pour on a healthy dash of olive oil. Very gently, use your fingers to coat the sausages in the oil and the gel so it feels like they&#39;re floating in \\gooey, congealed blood.<br> This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant.

In a small bowl, combine eggs, egg yolks, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and water, and pour into flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until the flour clumps together and forms a dry, firm ball. Knead 5 to 7 minutes, until smooth. Dough should be quite stiff. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside to rest 15 minutes. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Set 3 pieces aside, under cloth, and begin rolling fourth. First flatten by hand. Then, with pasta machine at widest setting, roll 3 times, folding in half lengthwise between turns. It should be smooth and wide as the rollers. Reduce setting, rolling dough through once at each, until you reach the next to the thinnest setting. Trim dough into 12-inch lengths, dust with flour, and cut with fettucine blade. Fluff strands to separate and set aside on floured trays. Repeat procedure with remaining 3 portions. To cook fresh noodles, bring about 3 gallons water to a rapid boil with 1 tablespoon salt. Cook pasta until al dente, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and serve.

Place the sugar and 1/4 cup of water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Using a pastry brush, stir the sugar occasionally, being careful not to get any grains stuck against the sides of the saucepan, until it has all dissolved. Swirl the saucepan every minute until the sugar becomes a golden reddish-brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. Shock the bottom of the saucepan by placing the bottom in the ice water to stop the cooking, and then equally divide the caramel into 10 to 12 (3 1/2-inch) ramekins and set aside. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. Using an electric mixer, beat the softened cream cheese with the eggs on low speed to combine. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until completely incorporated. Add the condensed milk, evaporated milk, whole milk and vanilla extract and continue to beat together until everything is well incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, about 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle the custard over the caramel into the ramekins filling them up to 1/2-inch from the rim. Place a kitchen towel in a deep baking dish or roasting pan and place the ramekins in 2 rows on top of the towel. Place the baking dish in the oven and using a pitcher, pour enough hot water into the baking dish to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins, taking care not to get water in the ramekins. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the flan is just set, about 30 minutes. When you tap the edge of the ramekin the flan should still wobble in the center. Carefully remove the baking dish from the oven, remove the foil and let the ramekins cool slightly. Using tongs remove the ramekins from the water and set on a towel to cool for at least 2 hours before serving. Once cooled completely, the flan can be refrigerated for up to 3 days before un-molding and serving. To serve, run a thin knife around the inside edge of the ramekin to loosen the flan, and then invert onto a plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 52646,&quot;Maple-Glazed Chicken 2 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts, cut into large chunks Kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 apples (1 red, 1 green), cored and cut into wedges 8 medium shallots, quartered lengthwise 1/4 cup fresh sage leaves, torn 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1/4 cup pure maple syrup 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar Instructions: Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt.

Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat. Reserve 1/2 cup caramels for serving. Put 6 of the remaining caramels on the prepared baking sheet and bake until bubbly and slightly dark around the edges, about 5 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheet, then crush into a fine powder in a food processor; set aside.<br> For the filling: Combine the remaining caramels with the milk, salt and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar in a medium saucepan. Bring to just below a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth, 3 to 4 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, whisk the cornstarch, egg yolks and remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl until smooth. While continually whisking, slowly pour in about half of the milk mixture until combined. Transfer the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until thickened like pudding, 2 to 4 minutes.<br> Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly on the surface, and refrigerate until chilled, 2 hours to overnight.<br> For the crepes: Puree the milk, flour, granulated sugar, butter, vanilla, salt, cinnamon and eggs in a blender on high speed until well mixed.

Wipe 1/2 teaspoon butter on a medium crepe pan or 8-inch nonstick skillet in a very thin layer with a paper towel. Heat the pan over medium until hot.<br> Ladle 3 tablespoons batter into the pan. Working quickly off the heat, swirl and shake the pan to evenly coat the bottom. Return to the heat and cook the crepe, reducing the heat if it&#39;s browning too quickly, until the edges are light golden, about 2 minutes. Carefully loosen the crepe from the pan and flip it with a spatula. Cook until a few brown spots appear, 15 to 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter, wiping the pan with butter each time. Stack the crepes on the plate as you go (you should have about 20). Let them cool for 10 minutes before filling.<br> Finish the filling: Beat the heavy cream and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Stir one-quarter of the cream mixture into the caramel filling, then gently fold in the rest.<br> Put 1 crepe on a platter and top with a 1/4 cup filling, spreading it to the edge. Repeat, stacking the remaining crepes and filling, and ending with a crepe. Refrigerate overnight.<br> Microwave the reserved 1/2 cup caramels, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted, about 1 minute.

Add a healthy pinch of salt and set aside at room temperature until ready to cook the enchiladas. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. To prepare the enchiladas: Place the shredded chicken in a large bowl. Add half of the grated cheese, sour cream, and onion; season with salt and pepper. Mix well to combine. Place the tortillas on your work surface. Spoon about 1 cup of the chicken mixture across the center of each tortilla. Roll them up to close and place, seam side down, in the prepared baking dish. Pour the salsa over the tortillas. Cover with aluminum foil and bake until heated through, about 40 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle the enchiladas with the remaining 1 cup of grated cheese. Return the baking dish to the oven until the cheese is melted and edges of the tortillas are just beginning to get crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 52680,&quot;4 Cheese Pepperoni Pizzadilla 1 tablespoon salted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> Two 10-inch flour tortillas<br> One 14-ounce jar pizza sauce 3/4 cup shredded provolone 3/4 cup shredded fontina cheese 1 1/4 cups shredded mozzarella 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1/4 red bell pepper, seeded, halved crosswise and cut into very thin strips<br> 1/4 small red onion, sliced into very thin half-moons<br> 15 pepperoni slices<br> 2 tablespoons Kalamata olives, pitted and halved<br> 1/8 cup torn fresh basil leaves Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Heat the butter and oil in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Place one flour tortilla in the skillet. Spread a few tablespoons pizza sauce on the tortilla, leaving a little room around the edges. Sprinkle half of the provolone and half of the fontina over the sauce. Sprinkle a third of the mozzarella next, followed by 1 tablespoon Parmesan and 1/2 teaspoon oregano. Top with the second tortilla and press it down gently. Once the underside is perfectly toasted, carefully flip the quesadilla to the other side. Spread a few more tablespoons pizza sauce on the toasted side of the tortilla, being sure to leave a little bit of the edges exposed so it looks like a pizza. Sprinkle with another third of the mozzarella and the remaining provolone, fontina, Parmesan and oregano. Arrange the red bell pepper and red onion on top of the cheeses like you would on a pizza. Do the same with the pepperoni slices and the olives. Top with the remaining mozzarella. Transfer the pan to the broiler and let cook to melt the cheese on top, about 2 minutes. Carefully transfer the pizzadilla to a cutting board using a large spatula or two smaller spatulas. Warm up the remaining pizza sauce and serve in a bowl for dipping.

Pulse until blended. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal. With the machine running, gradually add the water until moist clumps form. Turn the mixture out onto a work surface and form into a ball. Flatten the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill the dough for 1 hour. In a clean food processor bowl, combine remaining sugar, almond paste, mascarpone cheese, vanilla extract, and honey. Blend until smooth. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a large sheet of parchment paper, roll out the dough into an 11-inch circle. Transfer the dough to a large, heavy baking sheet. Spread the almond filling over the dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Arrange the figs on top of the almond filling. Spoon the jam over the figs. Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round, pleating the crust loosely and pinching to seal any cracks in the dough. Bake the tart until the crust is golden, about 40 minutes. Place the baking sheet on a rack to cool for 10 minutes, then slide a metal spatula under the crust to free the tart from the parchment. Transfer the tart to a platter and serve. Cook&#39;s Note: To reconstitute dried figs, simmer in water for 5 minutes. Let the mixture cool completely. Strain before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Cava]</li></ul><p>&quot; 52684,&quot;Pizza with Buzz Two 1/4-ounce packets active dry yeast 2 cups flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil One 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 sprigs fresh basil, leaves torn, plus 5 whole leaves<br> 2 cups shredded mozzarella Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves removed<br> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> Coarse sea salt<br> Instructions: For the dough: dissolve the yeast in 1 cup of warm water; after 5 minutes, it should look creamy and have bubbles forming on the surface. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast-water mixture and mix until well combined. Continue mixing for another 3 minutes. (The dough will be very soft and loose.) Pour the dough onto a heavily floured board and begin to knead, adding flour as necessary. The dough should take an additional 1/4 cup flour and the kneading should take about 5 minutes. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a bowl with the olive oil brushed on the inside. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it aside in a warm dry place for 1 hour. Gently punch down the dough and fold it over on itself three or four times. It will again be soft and a little sticky; coat your hands with flour if they stick. Divide the dough into two balls and return to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise again for an additional 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Place one of the dough balls on a well-floured work surface (The dough should still be quite soft and sticky, so sprinkle some flour on the top of the dough to make it easier to work with.) Gently roll out the dough into a 10-inch circle and transfer it to a round, perforated pizza pan. Repeat with the other dough ball. For the tomato sauce: Using a potato masher, mash the tomatoes in a medium bowl until smooth. Add the salt and the torn basil leaves. Spoon the sauce evenly over one of the rolled out pizza crusts. Sprinkle the mozzarella over the sauce, arrange the whole basil leaves on top, and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. For the bianca: Drizzle the second rolled out crust with olive oil. Sprinkle the rosemary, red pepper flakes and some salt over the top. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 52685,&quot;Lotus Rice With Chinese Sausage 3 cups sushi rice 1 large dried lotus leaf 8 dried shiitake mushrooms 3 tablespoons peanut oil 3 links dried Chinese sausage, diced 1 cup chopped scallions 3 tablespoons grated peeled ginger Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup diced jicama (about 1/2 medium jicama) 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil Instructions: Cook the rice as the label directs. Spread out on a rimmed baking sheet and let cool. Soak the lotus leaf in a roasting pan with warm water until pliable, about 1 hour. Soak the mushrooms in a bowl with 2 cups warm water until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain the mushrooms, reserving the liquid, and dice; discard the stems. Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over high heat. Stir-fry the sausage until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the scallions and ginger and stir-fry 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper. Add the jicama and mushrooms and cook until just soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the mushroom soaking liquid, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce; simmer, stirring, until the liquid is reduced, about 4 minutes.

With a fish scaler or large, strong knife, scrape off the scales. This is best done by holding the fish by the tail in a sink and scraping downward. It is essential to do this thoroughly. Clean the fish by running a sharp knife up from the base of the belly to the head. Remove the innards and rinse the fish well. To cut into fillets, lie the fish on its side and, using a sharp filleting knife, carefully slice along the backbone, from tail to head, keeping close to the bones with the blade so as not to waste any flesh. Then cut downward around the head, which will enable you to remove the fillet. Repeat this on the other side of the fish. Place the fillets skin side down and run your hand over them to check for any bones. Pull out any that remain using tweezers. Cut each fillet into 3 equal portions. Lightly brush the pieces of fish with oil, season well with salt and pepper, and grill for 3 minutes on each side, or until cooked.

Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, your yeast is old; discard it and try again with new yeast.) Combine the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl and make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture and oil to the well and incorporate with a wooden spoon until a sticky dough forms. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula to reincorporate any dough stuck to the sides. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and keep in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Knead the dough on a floured surface just until smooth, a few seconds. Divide the dough into 2 balls, cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let rest on the counter for 30 minutes. For the sauce: Put the tomatoes in a small bowl and rinse the can with about 2/3 cup of water into the bowl. Add the oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt and crushed red pepper to a large skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until the garlic just starts to turn golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. For the pesto: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spread the pistachios on a baking sheet and toast, tossing once, until slightly browned and aromatic, about 8 minutes. Let cool, then pulse in a food processor until the texture of coarse sand. Add the arugula, parsley and 1/4 teaspoon salt and pulse until the mixture is evenly chopped. Drizzle the oil through the feed tube with the machine running until well incorporated. When you are ready to bake the pizza, place a pizza stone in the bottom of the oven and heat it to 450 degrees F. If you do not have a pizza stone, preheat a baking sheet that has been flipped over bottom-side up. Cut two 12-inch squares of parchment and dust with flour. On a floured surface, stretch one ball of dough to a 12-inch round, leaving a thick 3/4-inch border on the edge. Slide the dough onto one of the parchment squares, then slide the square onto the back of a baking sheet. Brush the entire round with 1/2 tablespoon oil. Spread the dough up to the border with half the tomato sauce. Dollop the pizza with half the pesto using a teaspoon. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup of the mozzarella and a pinch crushed red pepper. (Don&#39;t worry if it looks like too little cheese. It will melt and spread.) Slide the pizza and parchment from the baking sheet onto the hot pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the edges turn golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes, rotating halfway through cooking. Let cool for 2 minutes before slicing.

Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. If the sauce gets too thick as it simmers, add up to 1 cup water to adjust the consistency. Toast the rolls and set aside. Meanwhile, prepare the onion straws: In a medium sauce pot, heat the oil to 350 degrees. Whisk the egg and milk in a medium bowl. Mix the flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper in another medium bowl. Cut the onion in half, then slice into 1-inch-thick half rings; separate into short straw-like pieces. Add to the milk mixture to soak. Once the oil is hot enough, remove the onions from the milk mixture, shake off excess and dredge in the flour mixture, 4 or 5 pieces at a time. Add to the pot and fry until golden brown; transfer to paper towels to drain. Serve the sloppy joes on the toasted rolls and top with onion straws. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 52724,&quot;Mussels, Clams and Shrimp in Spicy Broth 1/4 cup olive oil 5 garlic cloves, minced 1 bay leaf 1 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper 1 cup dry white wine 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes 24 small Littleneck clams (about 2 1/2 pounds total), scrubbed 24 mussels (about 1 1/2 pounds total), debearded 20 large shrimp (about 1 pound), peeled, deveined, butterflied 1/2 cup torn fresh basil leaves Warm crusty bread Instructions: Heat the oil in a heavy large pot over medium heat.

Slowly pour water into the flour, moving your other hand through the flour in circular motions, until it starts to come together. Then, either in the bowl or on your counter (which you might want to lightly flour to prevent sticking), knead the dough for about 10 minutes. The dough should be soft and pliant. Return the ball of dough to the bowl and rub the surface of the dough with a little oil to keep it from drying out. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and allow to rest about 30 minutes. When you&#39;re ready to make chapatis, assemble your tools: a small, flat bowl of whole wheat flour, a small bowl of olive oil or melted butter with a small spoon in it, and a paper towel-lined plate or container for the finished breads. Heat a flat griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, on a lightly-floured surface, work the ball of dough into a long log. Cut into 12 equal pieces by cutting it in half, and then half again. Cut each of the quarters into 3 equal pieces. Return to the bowl and cover with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out. To roll the chapatis: Roll a piece of dough between your palms to form a ball, and then flatten with your palm. Dunk this puck in the bowl of flour, and then roll until it&#39;s a 4-inch circle. Spoon about 1/4 teaspoon of oil in the center of the circle, and spread it out almost to the perimeter of the circle using the back of the spoon. Fold the circle in half, then in half again, so it forms a triangle. Seal the edges, and dunk in flour again if it&#39;s sticky. Start rolling, turning the triangle a quarter turn after each roll, until it&#39;s about 6-inches wide, with an even thickness. After some practice you&#39;ll be able to roll the chapati and rotate it without picking it up; I do this by weighing down a little on my right hand and pushing the chapati around that way. Test the griddle by sprinkling a little flour on it; if it turns brown immediately, it&#39;s ready. Flapping the chapati between your hands to remove any excess flour, slap the chapati onto the griddle. It should start darkening almost immediately. When small bubbles start to form, spread a little oil over the surface of the chapati, then flip. It should start to puff up. Spoon a little oil over this side too, and when it&#39;s puffed up a little more, flip. Press down on the edges of the chapati with your spatula or (if you&#39;re brave!) with a dry rag. This will seal the edges and encourage the entire chapati to puff up. If you spot any holes, press down on those too so the air doesn&#39;t escape. Allowing the air to stay inside the whole chapati makes it flaky and light. But don&#39;t fret if your first few don&#39;t puff up; it takes practice! It will still taste delicious. Remove to your container. Repeat with the remaining dough, and serve the chapatis hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 52733,&quot;Caramelized Onion and Goat Cheese Filo Square 1 pound center-cut bacon, diced 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 large red onion, sliced 4 tablespoons butter, plus 1 1/2 sticks, melted 1/4 cup fig jam 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 package filo dough sheets 1 container goat cheese, crumbled 1/4 cup bourbon 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Put the bacon in a small skillet and cook until crisp; drain. Put the brown sugar, red onions and 4 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until the onions are tender, 6 to 8 minutes, then add the fig jam and 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar. Continue cooking until the onions are caramelized, another 15 minutes. Remove from the stove and set aside. Put 2 sheets of the filo dough on the prepared baking sheet; brush with melted butter. Add 2 more sheets; brush again with butter. Repeat until you have done this 4 times. Then sprinkle with the goat cheese, spread with the caramelized onions and sprinkle the bacon on top. Repeat with filo as for the bottom layers (4 layers of filo, 2 sheets per layer). Cut into squares and bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the remaining 3/4 cup balsamic vinegar and the bourbon into a saucepan over medium-high heat; reduce by half, 8 to 10 minutes. Whisk in the cayenne.

To make the crust: Place the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter and cinnamon in a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse until combined. Pour into a 9-inch springform pan. With your hands, press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan. Bake for 12 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, chop the bittersweet chocolate and place it in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Add the espresso and stir until just melted. Set aside until cooled to room temperature. To make the filling: Cream the cream cheese, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla and almond extracts and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Reduce the speed of the mixer to medium and add the eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well. Scrape down the bowl and beater, as necessary. With the mixer on low, add the sour cream, and the cooled chocolate mixture. Mix thoroughly and pour into the cooled crust. Bake for 1 hour. Turn the oven off and allow the cake to sit in the oven with the door opened wide for 1 1/2 hours. Take the cake out of the oven and allow it to sit at room temperature, until completely cooled. For the ganache: Finely chop the semisweet chocolate and place it in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Add the cream and stir until just melted. Set aside until cooled to room temperature. Remove the cake from the springform pan by carefully running a hot knife around the outside of the cake. Leave the cake on the bottom of the springform pan for serving.

Stir in the molasses. Sift together the flour, spices, baking soda and salt, and blend into the sugar mixture. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for 3-4 hours. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. This is a tender dough, so work quickly to roll the dough 1/4-inch thick on a lightly floured surface and cut out pumpkin shapes using a pumpkin cookie cutter, or freehand using a small knife. If you&#39;re cutting your pumpkins freehand, don&#39;t make the stem too thin or it will break off after baking. Use a spatula to lift the pumpkins onto lightly greased baking sheets and bake for about 10 minutes. Don&#39;t overbake. Cool completely on wire racks before decorating. To decorate the pumpkins, set aside 1/3 cup of the royal icing and color it green. Color the remaining icing orange by blending in red and yellow food coloring. (Start with 5 drops of red and 6 drops of yellow and add more coloring as desired to make the color more intense.) Spread orange frosting over the pumpkin, avoiding the stem. Allow to set, then use a toothpick to dab green frosting on the stem. You can press on candy corn or chocolate chips to make a face on each pumpkin, or you can pipe a face on with melted chocolate using the following method. Melt 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in the microwave in a heatproof bowl for 1 minutes. The chips may look unmelted, but stir them with a spoon to see if they have actually softened before putting them in for another minute, if necessary. Spoon the melted chocolate into a zipper-lock bag. Seal the bag, pressing out any air. Use a toothpick to make a very tiny hole in one corner of the bag to release a thin stream of chocolate. Pipe eyes and noses and jagged grins as desired. Allow the chocolate to set before stacking the cookies. With beaters or a standing mixer, whip the egg white and lemon juice until frothy. At medium speed, beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar, a little at a time, until the mixture is thick but still liquid enough to beat. Then beat on high until the mixture is thick and glossy, about 3 minutes. Cover the surface with plastic wrap while waiting to use it. Royal icing will set to a firm, glossy finish when applied to a cookie. The icing can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52736,&quot;Strawberry-Rhubarb Greek Yogurt Fool 2 stalks rhubarb, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 cup sliced strawberries<br> 1/2 cup sugar<br> One 3-inch strip orange peel, plus 1 teaspoon grated zest<br> 2 cups nonfat or 2-percent Greek yogurt<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1/2 cup chopped pistachios<br> Instructions: Combine the rhubarb, strawberries, sugar and orange peel in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Unroll the filo dough on a flat surface and keep it covered with waxed paper and a damp towel so it doesn&#39;t dry out and become brittle. Using a sharp knife, cut the filo into 3 by 11 inch strips, and recover with the towel. Use a pastry brush to brush a strip of filo with melted butter. Place a small spoonful of spinach filling 1 inch from the end of the pastry. Fold the end over the filling to form a triangle, then continue to fold up the strip in triangles, like folding up a flag. Continue with remaining strips of dough, placing filled triangles on the baking sheet and keeping them covered with a towel until all are ready to bake. Brush the triangles lightly with butter, then bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Serve hot. (These may be frozen before baking, layering waxed paper between layers of triangles to keep them from sticking. Bake frozen triangles an extra 10 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52745,&quot;Go Get &#39;Em Smoothie 1 peeled banana, cut into 4, from the freezer 2/3 cup milk 1 tablespoon honey 4 teaspoons malted chocolate drink powder (recommended: Ovaltine) 1 teaspoon strong coffee or 1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder Instructions: Put all ingredients into a blender and whiz to mix.

Beat the whites on medium until frothy, about 1 minute. Turn the mixer to medium-high speed, then slowly add the sugar, beating until the sugar is fully incorporated and stiff peaks form, another 3 to 5 minutes. The mixture should be thick and glossy. Transfer to a pastry bag with a medium round tip (or use a ziptop bag and snip 1/2 inch from the corner with scissors to create a pastry bag) and set aside. For the milkshake: Put the ice cream, milk, rum, if using, marshmallows and cookies in a blender and mix on high speed until fully combined. Pour into glasses and top each milkshake with a swirl of meringue. Using a kitchen blowtorch, carefully torch the meringue to toast until golden brown. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52747,&quot;Yum Yum Brownie Muffins 1 (18 1/4-ounce) box devil&#39;s food cake mix 1 (15-ounce) can 100-percent pure pumpkin Fresh berries, for serving, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pour cake mix into a large bowl and whisk to remove any lumps. Add pumpkin and stir until completely smooth and uniform. Cook&#39;s Note: Do not add any other ingredients that may be mentioned on the cake mix box, like eggs, oil, or water. The mixture will be very thick, so you might be tempted to add in other things to make the batter smoother. Do not do this! Place batter into a 12-cup muffin pan lined with foil baking cups and/or sprayed with nonstick spray. Place pan in the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool slightly and then serve. Garnish with fresh berries, if using.

Line the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with parchment. Whisk together the mochiko, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the milk, vanilla, eggs and coconut milk until smooth in a separate large bowl. (If you have trouble incorporating the coconut milk solids, you can use an electric mixer on medium speed for this step, and the following ones, if you like.) Whisk the milk mixture into the dry ingredients just until combined. Whisk in the melted butter until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and tap the pan on the counter a few times to get rid of any air bubbles. Bake until the butter mochi is set and the top is golden brown, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack, about 1 hour. Carefully lift the parchment paper out of the pan from both short ends and set the butter mochi on a cutting board. Cut into about twenty 2-by-3-inch rectangles and serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52749,&quot;Garlic Halibut with Tomato-Caper Bruschetta 1 1/2 pounds halibut fillet, cut in 6-ounce pieces 2 tablespoons garlic, chopped 3 tablespoons white wine, Sauvignon Blanc, divided 1 tablespoons freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3/4 cup chicken stock 2 tablespoons butter Salt and freshly ground black pepper Freshly chopped green onions, for garnish Tomato-Caper Bruschetta, for serving, recipe follows 1 baguette, sliced on bias, 4 pieces, no ends 2 garlic cloves, to rub on bread, plus 1 tablespoon garlic, diced 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons diced white onion 1 tablespoon nonpareil capers 3 tablespoons white wine 1 1/2 cups diced Roma tomatoes 1 teaspoon sugar Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan Instructions: Combine all ingredients, (except butter, 2 tablespoons white wine and 1/2 cup chicken stock) and let fish marinate for 1 hour.

Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Whisk the flour, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a separate bowl, then add to the yeast mixture along with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium low and mix until the dough starts to look smooth, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is smooth and elastic, 4 to 6 more minutes (it should stretch 3 inches without breaking). Transfer to an oiled bowl and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in the refrigerator overnight. Lightly press down on the dough, then divide into 6 balls. Put on a baking sheet, cover and refrigerate until ready to grill. Meanwhile, make the toppings: Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook 3 to 5 minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pot with your hands; add the juices. Rinse the can with 1 cup water and add to the pot. Add a handful of basil and season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium and simmer until thickened, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly. Preheat one side of a grill to high and the other to medium. Brush 2 baking sheets with olive oil; stretch each dough ball into a thin oval (about 8 by 11 inches) on the sheets. Brush the tops of the dough with more oil. Working in batches, grill the dough over high heat until bubbly on top and marked on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the dough onto the cooler side of the grill. Quickly top each crust with tomato sauce and mozzarella and cover until the cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pizzas to a cutting board; sprinkle with the Parmesan and remaining basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 52753,&quot;White Wine California Citrus Sangria 3 bottles pinot grigio 1 1/2 cups brandy 3/4 cup orange liqueur 1/2 cup sugar 1 orange, thinly sliced 1 blood orange, thinly sliced 3 kumquats, sliced 1 lime, thinly sliced Instructions: In a large pitcher, combine the wine, brandy, and orange liqueur.

Bring to a simmer, lower the heat and simmer until the liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Set aside and let cool. For the caramelized onion mayo: Heat the oil over medium-low heat in a pan, add the onions and cook down, stirring frequently, until the onions are amber in color and sticky, 20 to 30 minutes. Let cool, and then combine with the mayonnaise. Set aside. For the porker: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the sausage, sage, bacon salt, pepper, apples and onions in a large bowl and mix well. Lay a piece of aluminum foil on the counter, place the sausage mixture on the foil and roll it into a large sausage. Roll the foil around the sausage, being careful not to squash the mix. Place on a baking sheet and cook until the temperature of the meat reaches 160 degrees F, 30 to 40 minutes. Let sit until the meat is cool enough to handle, and then slice into approximately 3/4-inch slices. For the plate: Heat a grill pan and cook the bacon to the desired doneness. Set the bacon aside but keep the bacon fat in the pan. Sear the porker slices in the bacon fat until crisp and warmed through. Lay the flatbreads open and smear a good dollop of the onion mayo to one side on each, followed by some cheese and apple chutney.

Add the guanciale and saute over low heat. Cook until it is brown and crispy and has rendered a lot of fat. Remove and reserve 1/3 of the guanciale for garnish. Bring the pan to a medium heat and add the onions and crushed red pepper. Season generously with salt, to taste. Cook the onions until they are translucent, starting to turn golden and are very aromatic. Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the sauce for about 1 hour, tasting periodically. Adjust the salt, as needed. Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook for 1 minute less than the instructions on the package. Remove 3 or 4 ladlefuls of the sauce from the pot to a bowl, as an insurance policy. You can always add it back in but it&#39;s harder to take out once the pasta is in the pan. You&#39;re looking for the perfect ratio between pasta and sauce. Drain the pasta from the water and add to the pot of sauce. Stir to coat with the sauce. This is how you always finish pasta; you cook it in the sauce to perform the marriage of the pasta and the sauce. Add more sauce, if necessary. Add in the cheese and drizzle with olive oil to really bring the marriage together. Toss to coat and serve in shallow bowls garnished with cheese and the reserved guanciale.

Heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until it&#39;s browned and has a nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the brown sugar and rum. Pour the butter-sugar mixture into the prepared sheet pan. Using a rubber spatula, spread the mixture out to cover the bottom. Set aside to cool while you prepare the fruit.<br> Cut the pineapple rings into half-moons. Cut the maraschino cherries in half. Slice off both ends of the navel oranges, then cut each into 1/4-inch-thick wheels, 4 to 5 pieces total per orange. Trim the wheels into even squares, about 1 1/2 inches in size (removing the rinds in the process). Repeat with the blood oranges. Cut the plums in half and remove the pits. Cut each half into 6 wedges, for a total of 24 wedges. With the long sides of the prepared sheet pan positioned horizontally in front of you, visualize the pan divided into 4 even sections: 2 sections in the top row and 2 sections in the bottom row. In the upper left quadrant, arrange the pineapple half-moons in rows 3 across and 5 down. Put a maraschino cherry half into each of the half-moon centers with the cut side up. You will have 1 piece each of pineapple and cherry left over, which you can save for another use or eat as a snack. Arrange the raspberries on the upper right quadrant of the sheet pan with the holes facing down. Starting right below the raspberries in the lower right quadrant, arrange the plum wedges in rows 4 across and 6 down. Arrange the citrus pieces side by side in the lower left quadrant of the sheet pan, alternating citrus types. You might have leftover citrus pieces, which you can save for another use or eat as a snack. For the cake: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside. Beat the granulated sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer on high until smooth and fluffy, about 8 minutes. Add the eggs and blend until combined, then mix in the vanilla. The mixture might look curdled, but that is okay. Reduce the mixer speed to medium. Add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the buttermilk and beginning and ending with the flour; mix until just incorporated.<br> Spoon large mounds of the cake batter on top of the fruit in the sheet pan. Use a large offset spatula to gently smooth out the batter.

Peel the potatoes and cut the flesh into large pieces. Pass the potato flesh through a potato ricer (see Cook&#39;s Note) into a mound on a clean work surface and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Let the potatoes cool completely.<br> Sprinkle the flour over the mound of potatoes. Drizzle the egg over the flour and begin to combine with a fork. Once everything has started to clump together, use your hands to gently knead and fully combine the ingredients, about 2 minutes; do not overwork the dough. Gather the dough into a ball.<br> Line a baking sheet with parchment. Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Working with one piece at a time on a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick log. Use a bench scraper or knife to cut the log into 1-inch pieces. Roll each piece on a gnocchi paddle or the back of the tines of a fork to form grooves. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough.<br> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and cook until they begin to float, 1 to 2 minutes, then cook 1 minute longer. Strain and toss with sauce as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52766,&quot;Scrapple 1 pork heart 1 pound meaty pork ribs or bones 2 pounds pork liver 4 cups roasted cornmeal 2 1/2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Trim the fat from around the top of the heart and remove the sinews. Cut the heart into 4 pieces and put it in a heavy stewing kettle with the meaty bones and liver. Add 3 quarts of water, cover and simmer gently for 3 hours until the meat falls from the bones. Strain the broth into a clean pot. Discard the bones and put the meat through a coarse grinder. Grind the heart and liver as fine as possible and combine the 2 meat mixtures. Bring the broth to a simmer. Combine the cornmeal and the seasonings and gradually add to the boiling broth, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium and add the meat mixture. Stir until everything is well mixed. Cook slowly for 30 minutes, stirring almost constantly so it does not stick to the bottom, as it will be quite thick. After 30 minutes it is ready to pour. Rinse 9 small breadpans with cold water or grease them and pour the scrapple to the top of the pans. Set the pans to cool and when cool refrigerate until the next day. When ready to eat, unmold the scrapple onto a cutting board and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices. Melt fat in a skillet and fry the slices until brown and crusty on both sides. Serve immediately with or without maple syrup. The loaves can be unmolded and frozen but will keep refrigerated for about 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 52767,&quot;Peppered Beef Tenderloin 3 Tbsp. coarsely ground pepper 2 Tbsp. olive oil 1 Tbsp. grated lemon peel 1 tsp. salt 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 beef tenderloin roast (3 to 4 lbs.)

Use a pineapple corer to remove the flesh and core of the pineapple, making sure to go all the way to the bottom without piercing any holes; discard the core and save the flesh. Pat dry the inside of the hollowed-out pineapple with a couple of paper towels (this will ensure that the ice cream adheres), then place in the freezer to chill while you make the ice cream. Transfer half of the pineapple flesh (about 9 ounces) to a blender; save the other half for another use. Add the sweetened condensed coconut milk, vanilla and salt to the blender, then blend on high, scraping down the sides of the carafe with a rubber spatula as needed, until the mixture is very smooth, about 1 minute. Beat the heavy cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until it\\u2019s fluffy and holds stiff peaks, 1 to 2 minutes. Gently fold half of the pineapple mixture into the whipped cream with a rubber spatula until combined. Fold in the remaining pineapple mixture until all is combined and no streaks remain. Spoon the pineapple mixture into the chilled, hollowed out pineapple. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and freeze until solid, at least 6 hours and up to overnight. If frozen overnight, let the pineapple thaw in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before serving. To serve, use a sharp long chef\\u2019s knife to cut the pineapple lengthwise into quarters. Trim off the bottom, then slice each quarter crosswise into 1-inch-thick wedges (about 20 slices total). Serve immediately as is. Alternatively, dip the edges of each pineapple slice in the toasted coconut, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 52775,&quot;Mole Verde: Green Mole 6 ounces unhulled raw pumpkin seeds, about 2 cups 2 cups chicken or beef broth 6 ounces tomates verdes (tomatillos), husks removed, rinsed, and coarsely chopped 6 large leaves lengua de vaca or sorrel, rinsed, stems removed, and coarsely chopped 4 leaves hoja santa, stems and veins removed, coarsely chopped 8 large sprigs epazote, 5 coarsely chopped, 3 left whole 4 jalapeno or 6 serrano chiles, coarsely chopped, or to taste Approximately 1/4 cup pork lard or vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Toast the pumpkin seeds in an ungreased pan, turning them over and shaking the pan from time to time to prevent them from burning.

Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover and simmer until the lentils are fully softened and the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl with the remaining 1 tablespoon broth and mash well with a potato masher. Set aside. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add the spinach, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper and cumin and stir until the spinach is wilted, about 3 minutes. Add the spinach mixture, breadcrumbs, walnuts and 3/4 teaspoon salt to the lentils and mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. Preheat the grill to medium-high. Form the mixture into six 4-inch patties and spray with cooking spray on each side. Grill until nice grill marks form, about 3 minutes per side. Place the patties in the buns with the sliced onion and other toppings, as desired, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 52788,&quot;Salmon Coulibiac 2 sheets frozen pastry dough, thawed 1 egg yolk, beaten with 1 tablespoon milk, for egg wash 3 cups spinach, sauteed and squeezed dry 1/2 pound freshly sliced mushrooms sauteed and patted dry 1 (3 to 4-pound) side of salmon Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped 1 onion, sliced 1 tablespoon fresh dill leaves 1 teaspoon freshly chopped thyme leaves Instructions: Roll out 2 pastry sheets to 1/2-inch thickness and set aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to rest prior to assembly. (This will make it easier to handle). At this time preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When ready to assemble, lay 1 of the pastry sheets on a flat floured surface. Brush with egg wash and evenly spread the spinach on top. Then cover the spinach with the sauteed mushrooms. Lay the whole side of salmon on top of the spinach and mushrooms, making sure you have at least 1/2-inch of pastry left all around the salmon. Preheat oven at 350 degrees F. Season the salmon with salt and pepper and top with the chopped eggs and sliced raw onion. Sprinkle with chopped dill and thyme and brush the egg wash liberally around the edges of the bottom pastry. Place the other pastry sheet on top of the salmon and press the 2 sheets together so they seal tightly (the whole thing should look like a parcel). Egg wash the top and sprinkle with little salt. Transfer the salmon to a sheet pan and place in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes check internal temperature by placing an instant-read thermometer into the center of the salmon. When it reads 125 degrees F remove from the oven and allow to rest for a further 10 minutes. It will continue to cook for a further 20 minutes or so. Transfer salmon to a cutting board and using a serrated knife, slice into 2-inch pieces. Place on a serving platter and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52789,&quot;Spinach Artichoke Calzones 2 cups part skim ricotta 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, freshly grated or a few pinches ground A few grinds black pepper 1/2 cup (a couple of handfuls) grated Parmigiano, plus extra, for sprinkling 1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and squeezed dry 1 (15-ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, drained and coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 (10-ounce) tubes refrigerated pizza dough 2 cups shredded mozzarella Garlic oil (1 or 2 cloves chopped and heated in 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil) 2 cups tomato sauce, marinara or pizza sauce, for dipping or Five Minute Spicy Marinara, recipe follows 2 tablespoons (two turns around the pan) extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic crushed 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 (32 ounce) can chunky style crushed tomatoes Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon Italian dried seasoning 1 handful Italian parsley leaves, chopped Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine first 7 ingredients in a bowl. Roll each pizza dough out on a cookie sheet, and halve each cross-wise. Spread 1/2 cup mozzarella and up to 1/4 of filling on each rectangle. Work on just half of the surface of each rectangle of dough, then fold dough over top of filling and pinch edges firmly to seal. For a half-moon \\pizza parlor\\ look to your calzones, mound filling into a half-moon shape, fold dough over top trim edges of dough to follow the rounded shape, then seal edges. Tie strips of dough scraps in knots, brush with garlic oil and sprinkle with grated cheese. Bake knots with calzones. If your dough tears, remove a little of the filling and repair. Repeat the process, spacing the calzones evenly on baking sheet. Bake the calzones for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown all over. Serve calzones with warm tomato or pizza sauce for dunking. Cook&#39;s Note: Freeze any remaining filling in a small plastic container and use it to stuff a chicken breast on another day. Add olive oil to medium saucepan over moderate heat. Add garlic and crushed pepper to the heated olive oil; when pepper snaps and garlic sizzles, stir in crushed tomatoes. Season sauce with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Cook for five minutes and stir in parsley. Serve.

Add the onions, season with salt and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until softened and beginning to brown. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the cumin, cayenne, oregano, orange, beans with their juices and the water. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, for the salsa: Add the tomatoes, onions, jalape?o, cilantro, garlic, lime juice and oil into the bowl of a food processor. Season with salt and pulse until finely chopped and saucy. Season to taste and set aside. (If your tomatoes weren\\u2019t the sweetest, feel free to pour the salsa into a skillet or saucepan and cook over medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes to reduce slightly and sweeten up.) For the garnish: If using a gas stove or if you have access to a grill, turn on the heat and quickly heat the corn tortillas directly over the flame until lightly charred and set aside. You can also heat the tortillas in a pan over medium heat. Heat some oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the eggs and fry until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Season with salt. To serve, place the tortillas onto plates and top each with black beans and a fried egg.

Pluck the chicken pieces out and set them aside until they are cool enough to handle. When the chicken is cool, pull off the skin and discard, then shred the meat coarsely, getting rid of any fat, gristle, etc. as you go. Set the chicken meat aside. The broth may be made and the chicken shredded up to 2 days before preparing the soup. Heat a large pot of salted water to a boil. Bring the strained broth, celery, and carrots to a boil in a large pot on medium heat. Taste the broth and add salt and pepper, if necessary. Adjust the heat so the broth is simmering and cook until the vegetables are tender but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the fideos into the boiling water, crushing each handful to break the noodles up as you go. Cook until tender but with a little bit of a bite, about 4 minutes. Drain the noodles and put them in a bowl. Add the olive oil and toss well. When the vegetables are tender, stir the shredded chicken, avocado, cilantro and lime juice into the soup. Bring the pot of soup to the table, along with the noodles and lime wedges. Spoon some of the noodles into each bowl and ladle some of the soup over them. (Stir the soup with a ladle so you&#39;re sure to get some of each ingredient into each bowl.) Pass the lime wedges separately. Homemade Chicken Broth: Put the chicken, onions, and red pepper in a large stockpot. (Mine is 16 quarts.) Rinse the garlic heads in cold water, then peel off the papery skin. Break the garlic head into individual cloves. Rinse and cut the roots off the cilantro. Cut a piece of cheesecloth the size of a kitchen towel. Put the garlic cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves, achiote seeds and cilantro on the cheesecloth, bring the ends together to make a little pouch, and tie the loosely with kitchen twine. Give the pouch a couple of good whacks with your kitchen mallet, and add it to the pot. Add enough cold water to cover the chicken by at least 2 to 3 inches. Drop in the ham hock, if using. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, skimming foam off of the top as it forms. When the water comes to a boil, adjust the heat so the broth cooks at a steady, but not rolling boil. Cook for 30 minutes. Check to make sure the breasts are cooked through, then remove them from the pan. Cook 15 minutes more, then remove the legs and thighs. Set the chicken aside to make another chicken dish. (If you&#39;re using backs, necks, wings, etc., you don&#39;t have to remove anything.) Leave the backs, necks and wings in to further flavor the broth. Cook for 1 hour. Set a strainer over a large bowl and line the strainer with a couple of layers of cheesecloth. Carefully strain the broth through the cheesecloth. (Ladling it is the easiest and safest way.) Add salt, to taste, and let cool before refrigerating.

Put the beans in a large pot and cover with at least 2 inches of water. Bring the beans to a boil over medium heat. Turn the heat off and let the pot sit until the water cools down, then proceed as if you had soaked the beans overnight. Strain the beans from the soaking water. Put the beans in a large pot and cover generously with water. Add the onions, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, bay and slab bacon Bring the pot to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer until all the beans are soft, about 1 hour. Add more water if it reduces too much. Test the beans for doneness by doing the 5 bean test. Bite into 5 beans, if they are all soft then they are done. Beans do not all cook at the same rate so the 5 bean test is important. When the beans pass the 5 bean test, remove the pot from the heat. Season the water generously with salt and let sit for 15 minutes. If using the beans right away, go ahead. If not using the beans right away, store them covered, in the refrigerator in their liquid.

Saute for 3 minutes. Add the water and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until peppers are very soft and almost all of the liquid has evaporated. (Note: this should be done in a very well-ventilated area!) Remove from the heat and allow to steep until mixture comes to room temperature. In a food processor, puree the mixture for 15 seconds, or until smooth. With the food processor running, add the vinegar through the feed tube in a steady stream. Taste and season with more salt, if necessary. Strain and serve. For the filling: Heat the oil over medium heat in a large saute pan. Once the oil is shimmery, add the red onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring until the onion is soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Season with the salt, pepper and curry powder and cook, about 1 minute more. Add the mango and cook to just soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Add the brown sugar and cook, 2 minutes more. Deglaze the pan with the lime juice and cider vinegar. Cook until the liquid is almost completely gone, 3 to 5 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat, transfer the mango mixture to a bowl over an ice bath and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Once the mango mixture has cooled, fold in the jumbo lump crab meat and cilantro. For the pastry: Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse for a few seconds, then pour into a large mixing bowl. Add the shortening and knead it into the flour with your hands until it is crumbly. Add the milk all at once and mix with a spatula until the dough begins to come together. Lightly flour your hands and the countertop and turn the dough out onto the countertop. Knead the dough ball, folding it over 10 to 20 times. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon of water and set the egg wash aside. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. Take one piece to roll, keeping the other dough balls covered with plastic wrap while you work. Lightly dust the countertop and dough with flour and roll the dough very thin into a 6 1/2-inch round. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the filling in the center of the pastry. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg wash and fold the dough in half over the filling. Use the tines of a fork to press and seal the edges. Then dock the top of the pocket 4 to 5 times. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Fill a large Dutch oven with 3 inches of oil. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with paper towels and an inverted cooling rack on top. Fry the pocket pies 2 or 3 at a time, keeping an eye on the oil temperature, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove the pocket pies with a spider or slotted spoon and drain on your paper towel-lined baking sheet.

Pulse 25 to 30 times or until the chocolate is the consistency of coarse breadcrumbs. Turn the food processor on and run for 1 minute until the chocolate becomes a mass. Stop the food processor and use a clean spatula to break up the mass, scraping the bottom and sides of the food processor. Leave the chocolate in the food processor for 1 minute without running or pulsing. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the processor after the 1-minute rest. Complete all the steps in the previous paragraph, 3 to 4 times or until the chocolate is smooth, fluid and reaches 90 to 91 degrees F. Do not let the chocolate go above 94 degrees F. If the chocolate is close to but not at 90 degrees, briefly heat with a 10-second blast of warm heat from a hair dryer until it reaches the correct temperature. Remove the food processor bowl from the base and the blade from the bowl. Continue scraping and stirring for 1 minute. Test the temper of the chocolate by spreading a small amount of chocolate in an even layer on a metal surface set over an ice pack. It should set within 3 minutes and be shiny and streak-free. If the temper test has some streaks, continue scraping and stirring for another minute and test again. The chocolate should maintain a temperature between 88 and 91 degrees F. As the chocolate begins to cool it will set on the sides of the food processor; as needed scrape down the sides of the bowl again and briefly heat with a 10-second blast of warm heat from a hair dryer until it is once again 91 degrees F. Stir two-thirds of the almonds and marshmallow creme into the chocolate just to combine and pour onto a sheet of parchment or a silicone mat set on a half sheet pan inverted over cold packs. Top with the remaining third of the almonds and marshmallow creme. Cool until set, approximately 30 minutes. Break into large pieces to serve.

Put the onions in a medium bowl and cover with ice water. Let the onions soak 10 minutes while you prep the patties and pimento sauce. Combine the beef with 2 tablespoons of the Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl. Form the meat mixture into eight 3-ounce patties. A quick and easy way to do this is to divide the mixture into 8 piles. Place a pile on top of a deli container lid. Place the top of a second deli container lid against the pile, press down evenly and firmly and watch as a perfect patty forms. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture. Make a slight indentation in the middle of each patty with your thumb to keep the patty from shrinking as it cooks. Set aside. Add the cream cheese, pimentos, mayonnaise, cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1 teaspoon Worcestershire to a medium bowl and stir until well combined. Drain the onions and pat dry. Lightly brush the grill grates with oil. Grill the patties, indentation-side up, until marked on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip and grill until marked on the second side and slightly firm, about 2 minutes more for medium rare. Top each patty with 1 slice cheese, cover the grill and cook until melted, about 1 minute.

Fill a 6-quart pot halfway with water and bring to boil. Add 2 tablespoons salt and the rice and boil until al dente (when you press a grain of rice between your thumb and index finger, it should break in half, but still be firm), about 8 minutes. Drain the rice using a colander and reserve the pot. Add the parsley, chives, dill, cilantro and cumin to the rice in the colander and gently stir using a large spoon, being careful not to break the grains.<br> Place the pot back on the stove over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup of the oil and arrange the romaine leaves over the bottom of the pot. Gently top with the rice mixture, keeping it loose and fluffy. Break up the heads of garlic into cloves, leaving the cloves unpeeled. Place the garlic cloves on the rice mixture, then poke 5 holes in the rice with the end of a wooden spoon so steam can escape (the holes should be about 1/2 inch above the lettuce). Wrap the pot lid in a clean kitchen towel and cover the pot.<br> Raise the heat to medium-high. When steam starts to escape from the pot in about 5 to 10 minutes, drizzle the remaining 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/3 cup water over the rice mixture. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, covered, until the rice is completely cooked and fluffy, 25 to 35 minutes.<br> Transfer the pot to a trivet on the counter and let sit for 10 minutes.<br> Take the garlic cloves out of the pot and set them aside. Invert a platter larger than the circumference of the pot over the top of the vessel. Holding the platter firmly against the pot, carefully and decisively flip the pot over and set the platter on the counter. Carefully lift the pot; the rice should now be on the platter with the lettuce facing up. You can also simply scoop out the rice from the pot onto a platter, then place the lettuce tahdig on the rice or on a separate platter. Each person can squeeze the flesh of the garlic cloves onto the rice on their plate, mix and enjoy.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 52832,&quot;Brussels Sprout, Walnut and Gorgonzola Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons unsweetened cranberry juice 3 tablespoons olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces shredded Brussels sprouts 1 bunch Tuscan kale, stems removed and leaves thinly sliced crosswise (save stems for another use) 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped and toasted<br> 1/4 cup dried cranberries, chopped 1/4 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese Instructions: In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar and cranberry juice.

Place the squash in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain and let dry over heat. It is very important to drain well, or the batter will be too liquidy. Mash squash with a potato masher and drain again, if necessary. Sift flour, baking powder, and ginger into a large bowl. Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Stir in the sugar and then the mashed squash. Stir in milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you have a soft dough. With a wooden spoon, combine the dough thoroughly yet gently. Turn dough onto a floured board and press down lightly until dough is about 1-inch thick. Using a scone cutter, cut out the scones and place on a lightly greased baking tray. It helps to flour the cutter each time. Using a flour shaker, dust each scone with flour. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until well-risen and golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 52834,&quot;Avocado, Artichoke Hearts and Heart of Palm Salad served in Lettuce Wraps 1 (14-ounce) can small artichoke hearts in water, drained 1 (14-ounce) can hearts of palm, cut into medium chunks, drained 1/2 English cucumber, thinly sliced 1/2 small red onion, finely chopped 1 poblano pepper, seeded, ribbed, and finely chopped 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, leaves coarsely chopped (about 1/4 cup) 2 avocados, cut in large chunks 3 tablespoons white vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 head butter lettuce, leaves whole, rinsed and dried Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, cucumber, onion, poblano, and cilantro.

Add the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook until the onions are soft and browned, 8 minutes, stirring often with a wooden spoon. Add the chicken stock, plantains, cilantro, bay leaves and cumin, and bring to a boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cook at a bare simmer, uncovered, until the plantains are very tender, 45 minutes. Transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. *When blending hot liquids, fill the blender less than halfway full, place the lid askew and pulse the liquid at first to release some heat, otherwise, your blender top could pop! Stir the pureed soup back into the pot with the remaining chunky soup and mix well. If the soup is too thick for your taste add more chicken stock. Season with salt and pepper and serve. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 52840,&quot;No-Bake Chocolate-Peanut Butter Cookies 1 cup peanut butter 60 buttery crackers, such as Ritz (2 sleeves) 2 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips Red or green sprinkles, for decorating Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment.

Roughly chop 6 of the bacon slices, and add to the grill pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon just barely begins to turn crispy, about for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cooked bacon to a food processor and process for 4 to 5 seconds. Set aside for later use, (in the patties). Honey Molasses-Glazed Bacon: In a small mixing bowl combine the honey, molasses, vinegar, and cayenne and mix until well combined. Brush the remaining 12 bacon slices on both sides with the honey mixture. Heat a large fireproof nonstick skillet on the grill. Add 1/2 the bacon and cook over medium-high heat until crispy, about 5 minutes, flipping once. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining bacon. To make Grilled Lettuce: Soak the radicchio leaves, for about 10 minutes, in an ice bath to lessen the amount of bitterness. Remove the leaves from the ice bath and pat dry with paper towels. Brush the leaves with 1 tablespoon oil. Put on the grill and cook briefly on each side. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into 1-inch wide strips. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil, the sherry vinegar, and Dijon mustard. Add the radicchio and toss to coat. Smoky Tomato Mayo: Put the tomato on the grill and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, turning occasionally, until most of the skin has blackened. Transfer to a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap. After 10 minutes, squeeze the tomato into a strainer to remove the seeds and most of the skin (you can leave a little bit of the burnt skin). Discard the seeds and skin. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tomato, smoked paprika, garlic, and mayonnaise and puree. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Patties: Combine the beef, reserved bacon (that has been chopped in the food processor), tarragon, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well, handling the meat as little as possible to avoid compacting. Divide the mixture into 6 equal portions and form into patties to fit the size of the buns. Brush the grill pan with vegetable oil. Arrange the patties in the pan and cook, turning once, just until done, about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. During the last few minutes of cooking, top with equal amounts of cheese and put the buns, cut side down, on the outer edges of the grill to toast lightly. To assemble the burgers, spread a generous amount of the Smoky Tomato Mayo on the cut side of the buns. Top the bun bottoms with 2 slices of Honey Molasses-Glazed Bacon, a cheese-topped patty, and equal amounts of Grilled Lettuce. Cover with the bun tops and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 52847,&quot;Lobster Pot Pie 3 tablespoons chopped garlic 3 tablespoons chopped sweet onions<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 cup sherry<br> 6 cups heavy cream<br> 4 cups lobster stock (store-bought) 10 ounces frozen green peas<br> 6 ounces carrots, 1/4-inch dice 12 ounces Maine lobster claw and tail meat, chopped<br> Four 6-inch circles fresh or frozen pie dough<br> Instructions: Sweat garlic and onions in oil in a 4-quart saucepan until translucent, then add flour and cook, stirring, until incorporated and no longer smelling of raw flour.

Transfer to a mixing bowl, add the remaining salsa ingredients, and mix well. Let sit, refrigerated, for at least 30 minutes for the flavors to marry. In a mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the chipotle puree with the water. Add the shrimp and toss to thoroughly coat. Marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour in the refrigerator. In a small mixing bowl, stir together the 1 cup of softened butter with the remaining 4 1/2 tablespoons of chipotle puree; use more or less chipotle, to taste. Set aside at room temperature. To prepare the Corn Cakes, thoroughly combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl. In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk the buttermilk and melted butter together, then whisk in the egg. Gradually add the combined dry ingredients, stirring continuously until thoroughly incorporated. In a food processor, puree 1/2 cup of the corn kernels and fold into the batter. Then add the whole corn kernels and scallions, and mix together. Add a little more buttermilk if the batter is too thick. Set aside. To cook the shrimp, heat the 3 tablespoons of butter on a griddle or in a skillet. Saute the shrimp for 3 to 5 minutes over medium heat, turning once. Be careful not to overcook. Keep warm. To cook the Corn Cakes, heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and ladle enough Corn Cake batter to make 3-inch cakes. Cook until golden brown, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Repeat for the remaining cakes (there should be enough for 18 cakes). Place 3 warm Corn Cakes on each serving plate. Place 5 shrimp on top of the cakes and spread the warm soft chipotle butter liberally over the shrimp. Spoon the Pico de Gallo next to the Corn Cakes and garnish with the scallions.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 52853,&quot;Bouillabaisse or Fulton Market Fish Chowder 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup finely chopped garlic 1/2 cup canned plum tomatoes, drained, seeded and diced 1 teaspoon saffron threads 10 to 12 large fresh basil leaves, shredded 2 pounds assorted fish such as, snapper, halibut, sea bass, monkfish (skinned and boned), cut into large chunks 1 pound fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined 12 littleneck clams, washed well, in the shell 24 mussels, well washed in the shell 2 small lobsters, raw in the shell, cut into pieces 3 quarts bouillabaisse fish broth (recipe follows) 1 teaspoon each salt and freshly ground pepper French baguette, slices 1/4-inch thick slices 1/4 cup olive oil 1 to 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper 2 fresh cayenne peppers or red jalapenos 3 large garlic cloves 1 russet potato, peeled, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices 1/2 cup hot bouillabaisse broth 1/2 cup olive oil Instructions: Combine the olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, saffron and basil in a large dish or bowl.

Prepare the duck legs by trimming any excess fat. Prick the skin of each duck leg all over (6 to 8 times) with a sharp knife. Massage 1 tablespoon of salt all over the duck legs. Place them skin-side up on a roasting rack in a roasting pan and cook in the middle of the oven, rotating the pan halfway through, until the skin has just started to crisp and some duck fat has rendered, about 30 minutes. Transfer the duck legs to a large plate and set aside. Reserve any rendered duck fat for future use (for example, roast potatoes).<br> Meanwhile, make the sauerkraut base. Heat a large saut pan over medium-high heat, then add the sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the moisture has evaporated, and the sauerkraut is starting to crisp and turn a light golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer the sauerkraut to a large rectangular deep-sided baking dish (9 x 14 inches) and spread it out evenly. Next, heat the oil in a separate, medium saut pan on medium heat. Add the leek and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the leek is soft and jammy but not browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Add the rice and cook until warmed through and well coated in the sauteed leek, around 2 minutes. Add the paprika and cook for a further minute or so, taking care not to burn the paprika. Add 1 cup of the chicken stock and a generous grind of black pepper. Using a wooden spoon, stir to combine for no more than a minute, scraping along the bottom of the saut pan to loosen the leek mixture. Remove the saut pan from the heat and set aside.<br> Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Put the leek mixture into the baking dish with the sauerkraut. Stir everything well to distribute the leek mixture evenly through the sauerkraut, then add the rest of the chicken stock. Place a bay leaf in each corner of the baking dish nestled in the sauerkraut mixture. Arrange the duck legs skin-side up on top of the sauerkraut mixture. Add 2 cups of water around the duck legs and over the sauerkraut mixture, or as much as needed to ensure the sauerkraut is well covered in liquid but the duck legs are only half submerged, with no liquid covering the duck skin. Sprinkle a pinch of salt all over the duck legs and sauerkraut, and top everything with a good grind of black pepper.<br> Bake, uncovered, rotating the baking dish halfway through cooking and adding another 1/4 cup of water if the sauerkraut base is becoming too dry, until the duck legs are cooked through with the skin crispy and deep golden brown, and the sauerkraut has a nice golden red crust but is still moist underneath, around 70 to 75 minutes. Rest for 10 minutes before serving. Serve either in the baking dish or transfer to a large serving platter and sprinkle with a generous pinch of Aleppo cl flakes if desired.<br> For the Macedonian salad: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.<br> Spread the peppers out on a large parchment-lined baking tray and roast, turning them over once or twice during cooking, until they are soft and lightly charred on all sides, around 30 minutes. Place them in a lidded food container. Once they are cool enough to handle, peel the peppers and remove and discard the stems and seeds. Cut the pepper flesh into 2-inch pieces and set aside.<br> Meanwhile, make the dressing by whisking together the oil, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper in a large bowl. Add the tomatoes, shallots and parsley and gently toss with the dressing. Transfer the tomato mixture onto a salad serving platter and arrange the roasted peppers over the top. Spoon any dressing left in the bowl over the peppers. Sprinkle with the cheese and parsley leaves.

Next, line a rimmed cookie sheet with parchment paper. You can also use a jellyroll pan.<br> In a medium heavy bottom saucepan melt the butter over high heat being careful not to brown the butter. To the melted butter, add the sugar, light corn syrup, and salt and stir to combine. Add the cashews and cook for 3 minutes stirring constantly.<br> Pour the sugar coated cashews onto the lined baking sheet. With a heat resistant spatula spread the nuts in an even layer. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown. Use the heat resistant spatula to stir the nuts half way through the baking to help the nuts develop an beautiful even golden color.<br> Remove pan from the oven and allow nuts to cool completely. Once cool, break into small clusters.<br> For the Pastry Cream: Because the pastry cream needs to be removed from the saucepan immediately, prepare ahead and place a bowl, a fine mesh strainer or a food mill, and a heat resistant rubber spatula near the stove.<br> In a second bowl, whisk together the flour with 1 cup of the sugar. Next, whisk in the eggs until smooth. The mixture will be very thick.<br> Combine the milk, the remaining cup of sugar, the vanilla bean, and the salt in a medium saucepan. Over medium heat cook the milk mixture being sure to occasionally stir to prevent scorching and a skin from forming. Remove the pan from the heat when it just begins to simmer. While whisking constantly, slowly pour, in a thing stream, about half of the milk into the sugar, flour, egg mixture. Using the same method of pouring slowly and whisking, return the mixture in the bowl to the saucepan with the remaining milk. Return the pan to the stove and cook over medium to medium-low heat while whisking constantly but not vigorously to avoid incorporating air into the pastry cream. Cook the mixture until it thickens. Immediately remove the pan from the stove as soon as the first bubble breaks the surface of the pastry cream.<br> As soon as the pastry cream is removed from the heat pour the hot pastry cream into the strainer or food mill. Use the spatula to scrape the pan and to push the pastry cream through the sieve, if using.<br> Place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate at least several hours, or overnight.<br> Slice the cake in half horizontaly, brush with simple syrup or a good quality liqueur.<br> Spread your favorite jam between the layers of cake and cut in squares. Make a mixture of half pastry cream and half whipped cream.<br> For assembly, place layers of cake on the bottom of a trifle dish.

(If using a charcoal grill, make sure that the coals are several inches below the grate.) Combine the popcorn, vegetable oil, sugar and fine salt in an 8- to 9-inch round disposable aluminum cake pan and stir to coat. Tear off two 18-inch-long sheets of heavy-duty foil. Crimp the end of one sheet around the rim of the pan on one side, then crimp the other end of the foil on the opposite side of the pan, leaving 5 to 6 inches of room above the kernels so they have room to pop. Rotate the pan 90 degrees and repeat to crimp the second sheet of foil onto the pan, perpendicular to the first, making sure that the entire edge is well sealed. The foil should create a dome over the top of the pan.<br> Once the grill registers 350? F to 375? F, put the pan on the grill. Wait until you hear sizzling, about 2 minutes, then, using tongs, start shaking the pan frequently until the popcorn starts to pop, 3 to 5 minutes (it\\u2019s important to keep the pan moving so the sugar doesn\\u2019t burn before the kernels start to pop). Continue to cook, shaking almost constantly, until the popping subsides, 3 to 5 more minutes.<br> Remove the pan from the heat and let stand a few minutes. Carefully cut an X into the top of the foil and peel back the layers to expose the popcorn. Sprinkle with smoked sea salt.

Add the chopped onions and 1 teaspoon of the pepper. Cook the onion down a little, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chopped cabbage, sauerkraut, remaining 1 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Let the mixture cook, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how done you like the cabbage. Strain and let cool. For the dough: Put the yeast and sugar in a 4-cup measuring cup and add warm water to the 1-cup mark. Stir together and let sit until the yeast rises to twice its original size. Put the powdered milk in another 4-cup measuring cup and add water to the 2-cup mark. Stir together. In a large mixing bowl, add the flour, salt and shortening.

Pinch and let rise another 15 minutes. To assemble the Lauer-Kraut burgers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> Lightly flour a work surface and put the dough on the flour. Begin to roll the dough as close to a rectangle as you can, roughly 24-by-30 inches. Once the dough is rolled out, cut the dough into squares, roughly 6-by-6 inches. Take a square of dough and roll it out a little bigger, roughly 8-by-8 inches. Turn the re-rolled square over and add a full cup of filling mixture into the middle of the dough. Bring the opposite corners of the square together, and then bring the other 2 opposite corners together. You should have all 4 corners drawn together. Pinch down the 4 seams of the dough. Once you pinch all the seams, push down slightly on the kraut burger. This will release extra air and help you find any place you missed sealing the kraut burger. Turn the sealed pocket over and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Spread the poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion flakes and garlic flakes on a pie plate, and toast in the oven until fragrant and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooled \\everything\\ mixture, whisk the rest in with the flour mixture, and set aside. Blend the sugar and butter on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add the egg yolks and sour cream, and continue blending, stopping to scrape down the bowl if necessary, until smooth and combined, 30 seconds more. Reduce the speed to low, and add the flour mixture by generous 1/4 cups, combining each addition before adding the next. Continue on low after the last addition until the dough forms a shaggy ball, about 30 seconds. Lay a piece of plastic wrap on a work surface, and lightly coat with cooking spray. Transfer the dough to the plastic wrap, and flatten it a bit into a narrow rectangle. Cover completely with the plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. Line a baking sheet with parchment, lightly coat with cooking spray. Unwrap the dough, and place it lengthwise on a lightly floured work surface. Dust a rolling pin and the top of the dough with flour. Roll the dough into a rectangle that is 1/2 inch thick and about 6 1/2 by 9 1/2 inches. Cut out 6 rounds with a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter (since the dough doesn&#39;t reroll well, cut the doughnuts as closely as possible). Cut out a hole in the center of each with a 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Carefully transfer the doughnuts and holes to the prepared baking sheet. Without rerolling the remaining dough, cut a few more rounds with the 1 1/2-inch cutter, and transfer them to the baking sheet. Refrigerate the cut dough for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 275 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat 2 1/2 inches of oil (about 8 cups) to 375 degrees F in a heavy-bottomed pot or a Dutch oven. Carefully fry 2 doughnuts and about 4 holes at a time. They will sink, then slowly rise to the top. Once they float to the top, cook them until nicely browned, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more. Remove them from the oil, let drain on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with some salt. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts and holes, keeping them warm in the oven until ready to serve. Transfer the doughnuts to a serving plate, drizzle with the honey and sprinkle with the reserved everything mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 52903,&quot;Veal Stew with 40 Cloves of Garlic 3 to 4 pounds boneless veal shoulder, cubed (1 1/2 inch cubes) 1/2 cup vegetable oil 4 leeks, washed and sliced 2 carrots, sliced 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 cups veal stock or chicken broth Bouquet garni: in a cheesecloth tie a bay leaf, whole peppercorns and sprigs of fresh dill 4 whole heads of garlic, crushed and peeled Salt and freshly ground black pepper Fresh dill, chopped for garnish Instructions: In a heavy casserole (which can go in the oven) brown batches of the veal in the oil until golden on all sides.

When the chiles are totally charred, throw them into a plastic bag. Seal and allow them to steam and cool. Next, pour the white vinegar over the sliced red onion and let them sit awhile. This&#39;ll take away a little of the crazy onion flavor and leave them with a nice sweetness. Finally, make the special sauce: equal amounts of mayonnaise and Dijon. It&#39;s the simple things in life! When you&#39;re ready to make the sandwiches, scrape the blackened skin off the chiles. Scrape out the seeds, too, so you&#39;ll wind up with big pieces of roasted green chiles. For each sandwich, generously spread 2 pieces of rye bread with the special sauce. Lay on 2 slices of provolone, 2 slices of tomato, 2 slices of Cheddar... a nice layer of roasted green chiles... a few red onion slices... and one more slice of provolone just to hold it all together.

Add the mirepoix (finely chopped vegetables) and cook for 3 minutes. Add this to the flour mixture and saute them all together. Pour in 2 cups of chicken stock and whisk together briskly. Add red wine to deepen the color and the flavor of the soup. Bring it to a boil and add another 2 cups of chicken stock. Boil and continue to add the stock as it thickens. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours stirring often. Add salt and pepper to taste. A grating of nutmeg also improves the flavor. \\THE BUTTEROSTI\\ Parboil the potatoes in salted water for 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly and cool. Grate them lengthwise onto a plate making the \\strands\\ as long as possible. Melt the butter in an omelet pan over high heat. Add the potatoes and season generously with salt and pepper. With a spoon, disturb the potatoes by chopping them so that they get evenly cooked. When the underside is cooked, flip over like an omelet and keep tossing (the more the better!) Constantly add more butter to prevent the potatoes from drying out. This should now look like a beautifully browned omelet pancake. Carefully slide it from the pan to a serving platter and serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 52985,&quot;Asian Chicken Thighs with Broccolini 8 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 6 ounces each) 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil 1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup hoisin sauce 1 tablespoon packed light or dark brown sugar 3 cloves garlic 2 small bunches broccolini 1 bunch baby carrots, greens trimmed 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds 1 scallion, thinly sliced Instructions: Position a rack in the upper third of the oven; preheat to 450 degrees F.

To cook the crepes, drain the mung beans and combine in a blender with coconut milk, water, rice flour, sugar, salt, and turmeric. Puree until smooth, and then strain into a small pitcher. Heat a crepe pan with a small amount of oil, and pour a thin layer of batter into the hot pan. When the crepe is cooked though and the down side is crisp, add the filling (bean sprouts, cilantro and scallions), fold the crepe in half and transfer to a serving plate. Serve crepes with table salad and dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 53009,&quot;Loin of Beef with Watercress Puree 1 1/4-pound piece beef top loin 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon butter 7 ounces wild mushrooms (try chanterelles, cepes, oyster mushrooms, or cremini) 2 fat cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 10 ounces watercress leaves (about 3 cups) 4 ounces spinach leaves (about 1 cup) 1/4-1 cup heavy cream Instructions: First, make the sauce. Put a pan of salted water on to boil. Push in all the watercress and boil for 5 minutes. Add the spinach and cook for another minute or so until wilted. Drain in a colander. Press with the back of a ladle to extract as much moisture as possible. Put the leaves in a food processor and blend to a fine puree, scraping down the sides occasionally. Pour 1/4 cup of the cream through the processor funnel and keep the blades whirling for what seems like an eternity. You will eventually get a sauce with a texture like silk. It will be so smooth, you will not need to pass it through a sieve. If you want a pouring sauce, add the remaining cream. Check the seasoning, and pour into a small saucepan for reheating. Cut the beef loin into 4 even steaks and rub each side using 1 tablespoon oil. Heat a heavy, non-stick frying pan until you can feel a good heat rising. Lay in your steaks-they should give a good hiss as they hit the hot pan. Season the tops and cook for about 3 minutes, then flip over and cook the other side for 2 minutes. Slip the butter into the pan at this stage and season the second side. Remove the steaks from the pan and leave to rest while you cook the mushrooms. Saute the mushrooms with the garlic in the remaining oil. Season and mix with the parsley. Reheat the watercress puree. Place the steaks on warmed plates (sliced first if you like), trickle any pan juices over, and spoon on the mushrooms. If your watercress puree is firm, shape it into quenelles. If it is a sauce, spoon some over the steaks and pass the rest separately. Serve whatever accompaniment you like to eat steak with. Fries are great, or why not try slices of really fresh baguette? &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 53010,&quot;Devil&#39;s Food Cake 4 cups cake flour 2 teaspoons baking soda 3/4 teaspoon sea salt 1 cup cocoa, European style 1 cup warm water 1 cup buttermilk 1 cup cool water 3 teaspoons vanilla 2 sticks unsalted butter, softened 2 cups white sugar 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar 4 whole eggs, room temperature 1/2 cup bittersweet Scharffen Berger chocolate, finely grated Chocolate Cream Filling, recipe follows Thick and Rich Chocolate Glaze, recipe follows 6 cups heavy cream, cold 20 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped coarsely 2 sticks unsalted butter 4 cups heavy cream 4 sticks unsalted butter 35 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit inside a 16-inch round cake pan and place inside. Grease the bottom and sides of the pan with butter. Dust with flour and tap out any excess. Set aside. Sift the flour, baking soda and salt into a bowl. Set aside. Combine the cocoa and the warm water in a medium sized bowl, whisk until smooth. In another medium sized bowl whisk the buttermilk, water and vanilla, set aside. Add the softened butter to the bowl of a standard mixer. Add the white sugar and the light brown sugar, beat with the paddle until very light in color and texture, about 3 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Break 4 eggs into a small bowl. On low speed, add 1 egg at a time to the bowl. Add the additional eggs only after each is well combined. Scrape the bowl with a spatula. Raise the speed to medium, beat 1-minute until light and fluffy. Add the cocoa mixture, beat on low speed until just combined. Add the flour mixture and the buttermilk mixture alternately: 3 additions of flour, 2 of the buttermilk. I do this visually, a little more than 1 cup of flour, then about 1 cup of the buttermilk mixture, then repeating. Remember to scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula after each addition. The batter will be smooth. Gently fold in the grated chocolate. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the center of the oven until done, about 45 minutes. Do not over bake, the cake will fall firm in the center. Cool. Turn the cake over onto your work surface. Peel off the parchment paper. Cut the cake in half horizontally with a serrated knife. Fill the cake with Chocolate Cream Filling. Top the cake with Thick and Rich Chocolate Glaze. Warm the heavy cream in a heavy stainless pot. Add the chopped chocolate and butter. Stir over low heat until the chocolate is almost melted. Take off the heat, and stir until smooth. Cool, then refrigerate until cold. Whip until light and fluffy. Place the bottom layer of the devil&#39;s food cake on a cardboard cake circle. Top with the cream filling. Place the other cake layer on top. Press down gently with your hands. Finish the cake with the Thick and Rich Chocolate Glaze. Warm with heavy cream, in a heavy stainless pot until warm. Add the chopped chocolate and the butter. Stir over low heat until the chocolate is almost melted. Take off the heat and stir until smooth. Cool slightly. Whisk and pour over the filled cake when it has slightly thickened. Smooth with a spatula. For a perfect finish, refrigerate the cake with one coat of glaze on top. When cold and set, add another portion of glaze and smooth nicely with a spatula. Make sure that the second coat of glaze has not hardened. If so, reheat only for a few seconds to the desired consistency. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 53011,&quot;I.C. Halibut with Almond Brown Butter Sauce 10 tablespoons (141 grams) unsalted butter 2 to 3 lemons, halved<br> 4 (5- to 6-ounce) skin-on halibut fillets, 1- to 1 1/2-inches thick, thawed if frozen (see Chef\\u2019s Note)<br> 2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup (88 grams) raw almonds, finely chopped<br> 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola<br> 2 tablespoons (7 grams) finely chopped fresh parsley<br> Instructions: Assemble your immersion circulator, setting the water to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). If you like a slightly softer, less steak-y texture for your fish, try going with 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Melt the butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-low heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until the butter solids turn light brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Measure out 2 tablespoons of the browned butter, place in a small bowl, and cool to room temperature. Leave the remaining butter in the saucepan until you\\u2019re ready to make the sauce. Thinly slice one of the lemon halves into 8 slices. Juice three more lemon halves, which should produce 1/4 cup juice. If you\\u2019re shy on juice, juice another half. Strain the juice and set aside for the sauce. Pat the fish dry with paper towels and season with 2 teaspoons of the salt. Divide between two gallon-size vacuum-seal or high-quality freezer zip-top bags. Place 2 lemon slices on the skin side of each fillet and add 1 tablespoon of the browned butter to each bag, being careful to work butter between the fillets to prevent sticking. Seal the bags using a vacuum sealer set to \\u201cgentle\\u201d or \\u201cmoist.\\u201d Transfer to the water bath. If using zip-top bags, let the bags sink into the water so that the air will be squeezed out via displacement. When the mouth of the bag is almost at the water line, carefully seal the bags. Cook the halibut in the water bath for 20 minutes. (If one of the bags floats, carefully reopen and try the sink-and-seal method again.) Return the remaining butter to medium-low heat and add the almonds. Cook until the butter foams and the foam turns brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and gradually stir in the lemon juice; the butter will bubble dramatically. Stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, cover, and set the butter sauce aside for serving. When the halibut is finished, remove it from the water bath. Cut the bags open with scissors, then very carefully remove the fish to a paper towel-lined sheet pan and pat dry with additional paper towels. (The dryer the better.) Brush the skin side lightly with some of the oil. Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat for 3 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons of the oil and swirl the pan to coat. When the oil starts to smoke, add two of the halibut fillets, skin-side down, and brush the flesh side lightly with additional oil. Cook until the skin is browned and crisp, about 1 minute. Carefully flip with a narrow metal spatula or \\u201cfish turner\\u201d and cook on the second side until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Carefully transfer to a serving platter and repeat with the remaining oil and fillets. Drizzle the almond and butter sauce over the top of the fish. Garnish with the parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53012,&quot;Tasty Chicken Nuggets for Kids 1/3 cup of a seasoning or flavoring your kids love; ketchup barbecue sauce, soy or steak sauce Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 pound skinless boneless, chicken breasts or chicken \\tenders,cut into 1/2 inch cubes or very thin strips 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup dried bread crumbs Instructions: Transfer the seasoning or flavoring of choice in a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper.

Make a brine by combining the water, sugar, salt, thyme sprigs, clove and all-spice berries in a re-sealable bag. Add the pork chops, seal up the bag and put in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Drain the pork chops and pat dry. Using a paring knife, make a horizontal cut into the center of each chop to make a pocket. Stuff a slice of fontina and prosciutto inside each pocket and secure with a toothpick. Set 2 large cast iron skillets over medium-high heat and add a 2-count of extra-virgin olive oil to each skillet. Add 2 chops to each of the skillets and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. Turn chops, push to 1 side and set grape clusters in pan. Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper before putting the pans in the oven. Roast chops for 5 to 7 minutes until cooked through and cheese has melted. Remove from oven when done and set chops and clusters of roasted grapes aside on a plate - keep warm. Consolidate juices into 1 pan and set over medium heat. Add a splash of chicken stock to the pan, scraping the bottom to extract all the flavors. Fold in cold butter while whisking to thicken sauce. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, set 1 pork chop on each plate on top of a Grilled Polenta Square, garnish with a cluster of roasted grapes and drizzle with pan sauce. Set a stack of hydroponic watercress to 1 side and serve. Bring water and salt to a boil in a large saucepan. Gradually whisk in the cornmeal in a slow steady stream.

Increase the speed of the mixer and slowly start adding the sugar until all the sugar is incorporated. Once all the sugar is in, increase the speed of the mixer even more and whip until the mixture is shiny and stiff. You now have a meringue. You know when your meringue is done when you pull out the whip, hold it horizontally, and if you have what looks a \\sparrow&#39;s beak\\ on the end of the whip. Replace the whip, turn the mixer on medium and start adding the butter a bit at a time. Once all the butter is incorporated, turn the mixer on high and let mix; depending on the weather, the buttercream could take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes to form. You will know when it has formed when you hear the motor of the mixer start to slow down and whine a little bit; also, when you first add the butter, your meringue will break down and look weird and this is what you want. When the buttercream is done, the mixture will be homogeneous, consistent, and tasty. Remove the buttercream from the bowl and transfer to an airtight container. Buttercream can be kept at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for a 1 to 2 weeks, but always use warm buttercream when icing a cake. To warm up the buttercream, put it back in the mixer using the whip or the paddle, and apply direct heat with a propane torch you can find at any hardware store. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 53024,&quot;White Bean Salad 1 red bell pepper 1 (15-ounce) jar stewed cannellini beans, drained 2 large heads Belgian endive (red or green or a combination), trimmed and thinly sliced 1 lemon, zested and juiced 2 tablespoons garlic-flavored olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Roast the bell pepper until charred (either over a gas flame, grill or broiler).

Process until a paste forms and is almost smooth. Add the chickpeas and eggs and pulse until the chickpeas are mostly ground but still a little chunky. Remove to a medium bowl and stir in the panko and Parmesan to make a smooth mixture that holds together. Form into 4 patties, each about 1/2 inch thick, and put on a plate. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the oil. Add the patties and cook until the bottoms are crisp and golden, 3 to 4 minutes, then flip and crisp the second side, another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and season lightly with salt. For the assembly: Assemble the burgers while the patties are still hot. Mash the avocado in a small bowl with the lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Spread on the bottom buns. Put a cabbage leaf (cut to fit if needed) curved up towards the back of each bun and fit a few kale leaves in the curve.
