Roll and stretch out the risen dough on a floured work surface into a rope about 31 inches long. Press a rolling pin into the dough to create a trench and roll it to a rectangle about 3 inches wide. Keeping a 1/2-inch border on each long side of the dough, smear the remaining dough with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Spread the surface with a nice thin layer of the Arrabbiata Sauce, then sprinkle with the Parmesan, mozzarella and pepperoni. Arrange the string cheese pieces on top in a double line. Fold the long sides of the dough up over the center (over the string cheese) and pinch the edges together well so there&#39;s no leakage. Bring the ends together to form a circle. Drizzle a baking sheet with olive oil. Carefully transfer the dough circle to the prepared baking sheet, flipping it over before putting it on the sheet so the seam side is down. Brush the egg wash over the surface of the dough. Bake until the edges of the crust are golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a board to rest for 10 minutes before cutting. Arrange the tomato slices and basil leaves in concentric circles in the middle of the pizza crust ring and serve with a dish of the remaining Arrabbiata Sauce on the side for dipping. Heat a pan over medium-high heat until hot and add the olive oil. Throw in the red pepper flakes and onions, give them a stir and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over high heat (the water should be very salty--even more than the sea). Carefully remove as much of the cauliflower stem as you can without cutting any of the stalk or the florets away. Remove all of the leaves including any small inner ones.<br> Boil the cauliflower head until it just tender, 6 to 8 minutes. (Take care not to overcook or it will break apart as you stuff it.) Carefully remove the head from the water and allow to drain and cool.<br> Meanwhile, brush 2 pieces of bread with 1 tablespoon butter each. Cut into 1/4-inch cubes (it&#39;s important that the cubes be this small or it will not pipe out of the bag) and transfer to a medium bowl. Finely chop the remaining piece of unbuttered bread and pulse in a food processor until fine crumbs. Add 2 tablespoons butter and the Parmesan and pulse until combined. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Wipe out the bowl of the food processor.<br> Pulse the parsley, thyme, sage, celery, egg, bouillon cube, 2 tablespoons water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in the food processor until very finely chopped and wet. Fold the vegetable mixture into the bread cubes and stir until smooth and pipeable. Transfer to a large pastry bag (or a 1-gallon freezer bag) and cut a 3/4-inch opening at the tip.<br> Turn the cauliflower over, stem-side up, and start piping the filling in between the stalks of the florets until you&#39;ve used about half of the filling. Use your fingers to push the filling down into the holes of the cauliflower. Fill the rest of the cauliflower with the remaining filling. (Use all the filling, even if it looks like the cauliflower is going to explode. It won&#39;t.) Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, stem-side down.<br> Brush the outside of the cauliflower with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Press the Parmesan-breadcrumb mixture evenly over the cauliflower. Bake until the cauliflower is soft and easily pierced with a fork and the breadcrumbs are a deep golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then cut the cauliflower into wedges and sprinkle with salt to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 59993,&quot;Sweet and Sour Meatballs 1 (20-ounce) can tomato sauce 1 cup peach preserves 1 cup chili sauce 1/4 cup light brown sugar 1/2 orange, zested and juiced 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon Neely Dry Rub 1 1/2 pounds ground turkey 1 shallot, minced 1 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) 1 cup grated Parmesan 1 large egg, beaten 1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley Pinch of red pepper flakes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Pull the pork loin out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. In a small bowl, mix together the cocoa powder, coffee, salt, paprika and cinnamon. Season the pork well with the mixture, rubbing it in on all sides. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oil and heat an additional 30 seconds. Add the pork and sear on all sides until deep golden brown, about 6 minutes. Remove the pork to a rimmed baking sheet, transfer to the oven and cook until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 40 minutes. Allow to rest for 15 minutes. For the benedict: Meanwhile, add the bacon to the skillet that the pork was cooked in and cook over medium heat until the bacon is crispy and the fat is rendered, about 4 minutes. Whisk in the flour until smooth and cook for a minute. Slowly add the coffee and chicken broth, whisking constantly so that no lumps form. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Whisk in the salt and 2 tablespoons of the butter to emulsify. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter and swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet. Break 2 eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are just set, about 4 minutes. To assist in setting the whites, spoon some of the melted butter over the whites, avoiding the yolk so it stays runny. Remove to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and continue with the remaining butter and eggs. To assemble, place 1/4 cup arugula on each English muffin half. Thinly slice the pork and place 1 to 2 pieces on each muffin half. Spoon some of the gravy over the pork and top each muffin half with a fried egg. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 60020,&quot;Pesto 3 large cloves of garlic 1 1/2 cups fresh basil leaves 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1/2 to 2/3 cups extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper to taste Serving suggestion: Classic Minestrone Soup, recipe follows 1/3 cup olive oil 1 cup chopped onion 1 cup diced carrots 1 cup diced celery 1/2 cup great northern beans, soaked 1 bay leaf Sprig of thyme 4 cups beef stock Rind of a piece of Parmesan cheese-optional 2 cups Italian canned tomatoes and their juice Salt and pepper to taste 2 cups diced potatoes 2 cups zucchini, diced 2 cups shredded savoy cabbage 1 cup small pasta shells Instructions: In a food processor or blender combine garlic, basil leaves, grated Parmesan.

To make White Gazpacho Mayonnaise, in the bowl of a food processor combine almonds, grapes, garlic, sherry vinegar, and olive oil; puree. Add mayonnaise and pulse until well combined. Refrigerate until serving. To make the Madeira mushrooms, heat olive oil in a large fireproof nonstick skillet on the grill over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms to the skillet and cook for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add Madeira wine and continue to cook until most of the wine has evaporated. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Set aside. To make the patties, combine the beef, linguica sausage, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Handling the meat as little as possible to avoid compacting it, mix well. Divide the mixture into 6 equal portions and form into patties to fit the rolls. Brush the grill rack with vegetable oil. Place the patties on the rack, cover, and cook, turning once, just until done, about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. During the last few minutes of cooking, top each burger with equal amounts of cheese and place the rolls, cut side down, on the outer edges of the rack to toast lightly. To assemble the burgers, spread a generous amount of White Gazpacho Mayonnaise on the cut side of the rolls.

Remove from the heat and let cool. For the marinade: In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, red pepper flakes and sage and whisk until blended. Set aside while you prepare the pork loin. For the pork loin: Slice the pork along the bone about 2 1/2 inches down into the loin from end to end, creating a long flap that opens like a book. Season the inside with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Place the cooled sauteed onions inside the pocket along the length of the loin. Tie the loin closed using butcher&#39;s twine: Start at one end and tie it securely. Then work on the other end to tie it shut. Work your way toward the center, tying the loin between each rib. Place the pork loin in a large baking dish or bowl. Pour the marinade over it and use a brush to coat all sides. Cover the dish securely with plastic wrap, swish it all around to ensure the loin is covered with the marinade and let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or as long as overnight. Place the chipotle pepper in a small bowl. Pour 1/2 cup of hot water into the bowl and let it sit to rehydrate for 15 minutes. Once it is rehydrated, give it a rough chop. Reserve the liquid. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Remove the pork loin from the marinade, making sure to save the remaining marinade. Sear the loin until nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place the seared loin in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or roasting pan. Turn down the heat on the skillet to medium, add the chopped onion and saute for 2 minutes. Add the chipotle and season with salt, pepper and the oregano. Add the white wine, chicken broth, garlic and the reserved chipotle soaking liquid and marinade. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up all the brown bits from the skillet and let the liquid come to a simmer. Pour everything from the skillet over the pork loin. Transfer it to the oven and roast until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F, about 1 hour 30 minutes, making sure to baste the loin every 20 minutes or so. Let the pork loin rest for 10 minutes. Remove the butcher&#39;s twine before slicing.

Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 60041,&quot;Stuffed Artichokes Cold water, as needed 3 to 4 lemons, juiced, divided 6 medium artichokes, stems trimmed 1/4 to 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1/2 cup coarse bread crumbs, lightly toasted 1/2 bunch curly parsley, stemmed, washed, dried and chopped 1 small or 1/2 medium bulb fennel, tough outer layer removed, halved lengthwise, cut into thin slices and very roughly chopped 1/2 to 3/4 cup fontina cheese, cut into small cubes 1/2 cup grated Parmesan Kosher salt Instructions: Prepare a bowl of cold water large enough to hold the 6 artichoke hearts. Add the juice of 2 lemons to the water. Use a paring knife to trim the dark green skin from the stem and the base of each artichoke. Also slice about 2 to 3 inches off the top. In a circular motion, using a paring knife or peeler or your hands, peel the outer, dark green bitter layer of the heart until the fleshly, light green part is exposed. Trim and leave about 2 to 3 inches of the stem. Use a tablespoon to scoop out the \\hay\\ or \\choke\\ from the center of each artichoke. Squeeze some of the remaining lemon juice over the artichoke, if desired, rubbing the lemon directly on them to prevent them from discoloring, then submerge them in the lemon water. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine 1/4 to 1/2 cup olive oil, the bread crumbs, parsley and fennel with the fontina and Parmesan. Stir to blend. Season with salt, to taste. Remove the artichokes from the water, pat dry and transfer them to a bowl. Reseason with salt and drizzle them with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Stuff each artichoke with the bread crumb mixture and arrange them in a flameproof baking dish. Don&#39;t be afraid to pack the stuffing into each artichoke. Arrange them close together in the dish so they steam a little and create moisture as they cook. Top the artichokes with any remaining stuffing. Add a little water to the bottom of the baking dish to prevent the artichokes from drying out or scorching on the bottom as they cook. Cover the dish with a tight layer of aluminum foil and put the baking dish in the center of the oven. After 45 minutes, remove the dish from the oven. Test the most tender part of the artichoke, where the stem and the heart meet, with the tip of a knife. The knife should pierce and remove without resistance. Remove the foil and put the dish under a broiler for 5 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes before serving. Cut each artichoke in half to reveal the stuffing, arrange on serving plates and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 60042,&quot;Pap\\u2019s Pork and Sauerkraut 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 yellow onion, diced 1 head green cabbage, diced Kosher salt 1 quart apple cider<br> 1 12-ounce can or bottle IPA<br> 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes<br> 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 cup sauerkraut, pureed 1 ham hock<br> 1/2 rack bone-in smoked pork loin (about 3 1/2 pounds) 2 pounds garlic sausage or kielbasa 1 bunch parsley leaves, roughly chopped or torn 1/4 cup hot mustard Freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

Stir until well combined. Gently stir in half of the parsley, reserving the remaining parsley for garnish. Cut the zested lemon into wedges and reserve. Prepare a grill or grill pan or for high heat. Lightly oil the grill grates. Thread the tomatoes on the skewers, about 7 tomatoes per skewer. (If using wooden skewers, leave just 1/2 inch of the skewer sticking out on each end so you do not have to soak them). Brush 1 tablespoon of the oil on the tomatoes and sprinkle them liberally with salt and pepper. Brush both sides of the polenta rounds with 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Arrange the skewered tomatoes on the hot grill and cook, turning occasionally, until they are lightly charred in spots and have started to burst, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, arrange the polenta on the grill and cook until lightly charred with distinct grill marks, about 5 minutes per side, flipping once using a flat metal spatula. (Be careful not to flip the polenta too early because it will stick to the grill if it is not ready.) Remove from the heat and reserve. Toss the shrimp with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Grill until lightly charred in spots on both sides and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes total. Remove from the heat and reserve. By this time, the grape tomatoes should be ready to take off the grill as well. Carefully remove the tomatoes from the skewers and place directly into a small bowl. Use the back of a pair of tongs or a spoon to lightly smash the tomatoes so that they release their juices. Place 3 pieces of polenta on each plate. In the center of the polenta, spoon a quarter of the tomatoes along with their juices, one quarter of the shrimp and a large dollop of the reserved butter mixture (if it doesn&#39;t melt, touch the business end of a pair of tongs to the grill, and then to the butter to finish melting).

Take each piece of eggplant and dip in the egg wash, then in bread crumbs and make sure to completely cover each piece with bread crumbs, and then fry in hot oil. Brown each slice of eggplant. Occasionally change the oil; you don&#39;t want to continue cooking eggplant slices with burnt loose bread crumbs. Place fried eggplant on paper towel to absorb some of the oil. Slice the fresh mozzarella. Line the bottom of an 11 by 9 inch glass pan with a layer of sauce. Place a layer of eggplant, followed by slice of mozzarella, a heaping layer of sauce, then sprinkle with a layer of Pecorino Romano cheese. Repeat, and stack about 3 to 4 eggplants high. Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes. You know it&#39;s ready when the sauce bubbles and the cheese is melted. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a saucepan over medium heat until it becomes fragrant. Mix the garlic with 1 teaspoon water and carefully add this to the warm oil. Saute the garlic and cook without browning it. Add the tomatoes, bring it to a boil, and then reduce the heat. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add the basil, salt and sugar, and simmer 5 more minutes. Just before serving, blend in the last tablespoon of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 60064,&quot;Grilled Dough 6 ounces Master Pizza Dough Infused Basil (Herbed) extra virgin olive oil Instructions: Flatten dough to desired thickness and brush with olive oil.

Spray an 8-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray; set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together the cornbread mix, egg and half of the seafood stock until smooth. Spread mixture into prepared pan and bake for 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool for 15 minutes. Once cooled, remove from the pans and break into large pieces with fingers. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Meanwhile, make the citrus butter sauce by whisking together orange juice, lemon juice, lime juice, orange zest, lemon zest, lime zest, and cornstarch in a medium saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer and add butter, continuing to simmer for 5 minutes. Remove sauce from heat, pour into heatproof dish and stir in the cilantro leaves; set aside. Spray a 12-inch skillet with nonstick cooking spray and saute the celery leaves, red bell pepper and onions for 2 minutes then add in the shrimp, scallops and crawfish. Continue to saute for another 3 minutes. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, white pepper, cilantro and the cornbread. Add remaining seafood stock, a little at a time, mixing well. Spray another large skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Stuff the inside of each trout with the cornbread mix and place into skillet. Place any remaining cornbread mixture around fish in skillet. Sprinkle remaining seafood seasoning on fish; drizzle with a little citrus butter and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.

Place the pork on a large plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for a few hours. Place a medium heavy pan that will hold the roast somewhat snugly over medium heat and add the butter and oil. When the butter begins to foam, add the pork and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly golden on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. (Keep your eyes on the butter so it doesn&#39;t burn and reduce the heat a bit if needed.) Add 1 cup of the milk and stir to loosen the browned bits attached to the bottom of the pan. As soon as the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, partially cover the pan, and simmer until almost all the milk has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Add 1 more cup milk and continue cooking, basting and turning the meat a few times, until most of the milk has evaporated. Cook the pork in this manner, adding the milk 1/2 to 1 cup at a time, until it reads 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 2 hours. (The pork can be cooked up to this point 1 hour or so ahead. In that case, cook only until it reaches 155 degrees F, because it will keep on cooking as it sits in the hot pan juices.) Remove the lid and raise the heat to high. If no more milk is left in the pan, add 1/2 cup or so more. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to release the browned bits and turning the pork once or twice, until most of the milk has evaporated and the meat has a rich, golden brown color. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and let it rest for about 10 minutes while you finish the sauce. Spoon off some of the fat from the pan. Add 1/3 cup water and stir quickly, over medium heat, scraping the bottom of the pan until only the brown glazed clusters of milk particles remain. Cut the meat into 1/2-inch thick slices and serve topped with a bit of the pan juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 60069,&quot;Coca-Cola Barbeque Sauce 1 cup Coca-Cola 1 cup ketchup 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon liquid smoke 1/4 cup A-1 steak sauce 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon black pepper Instructions: Combine the ingredients in a heavy saucepan and gradually bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat slightly to obtain a gentle simmer. Simmer the sauce until reduced by 1/4, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the sauce to clean jars and let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until serving. The sauce will keep for several months, refrigerated. Use as you would any sauce, noting the strong affinity this sauce has for chicken, ribs, and pork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Zinfandel, Malbec]&quot; 60070,&quot;Roasted cl Salsa 6 28-ounce can whole tomatoes with juice 18 roast poblano chiles 1 1/2 cups fresh cilantro leaves (or more to taste!) 3/4 cup chopped onion 3 clove garlic, minced 3 whole jalapeno, quartered and sliced thin, with seeds and membrane 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin 3/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 whole limes, juiced Instructions: Roast the poblano chiles one-by-one over the flame of your stovetop, using metal tongs to hold them, until the skin is totally charred. (If you don&#39;t have a gas stove, you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your oven&#39;s broiler.) When the skin is totally blackened, place the chiles in a large resealable plastic bag and seal the bag to allow the chiles to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Remove the chiles and use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Slice the chiles in half lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds and membranes. Divide the ingredients into 3 batches so they will fit into a 12-cup processor Combine whole tomatoes, roast chiles, cilantro, onions, garlic, jalapeno, cumin, salt, sugar and lime juice in a blender or food processor. Pulse until you get the salsa to the consistency you&#39;d like. I do about 10 to 15 pulses. Test seasonings with a tortilla chip and adjust as needed. Refrigerate the salsa for at least an hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 60071,&quot;Kombucha Talkin\\u2019 About? 5 fresh mint leaves plus 1 large sprig, for garnish 1 ounce pineapple juice<br> 2 ounces vodka<br> 1/2 ounce agave<br> 1 lemon wheel<br> 2 ounces lemon kombucha<br> Instructions: In a shaker, muddle the mint leaves with the pineapple juice.

In the mixer bowl, combine the cake flour, sugar, baking powder and yeast and whisk to incorporate. Place the mixer bowl on the mixer and set to low. Add 1/2 cup water and allow the liquid to absorb into the dry ingredients, then increase the speed to medium. Knead the dough, scraping down the sides every minute or two, until a dough ball pulls together, is smooth to the touch and feels soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the lard to the dough and knead for another 3 to 5 minutes until incorporated. The dough ball should hold together but be soft to the touch. Place in a large, oiled bowl, cover tightly and allow to double in size at room temperature, about 90 minutes. For the filling: Place the Char Siu Cantonese Red Roasted Pork in a medium bowl and reserve. Place a large skillet over high heat. Swirl in the oil to coat the bottom. Add the onion, red and green bell peppers and scallions and stir-fry to brown, about 3 minutes. Swirl in the sugar, oyster sauce, thin and dark soy sauce and 1 1/4 cups water and bring to a boil. Stir to dissolve the sugar and boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove all the vegetables and discard. The idea is to break them down to release their essential oils and flavor into the sauce. Stir the potato starch, cornstarch and 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl to make a slurry. Stir the slurry into the sauce in the skillet and let simmer. Cook it down, stirring with a rubber spatula, until it becomes a thick paste, about 3 minutes. Spoon the paste into the reserved bowl of pork and fold in until well combined. Reserve until ready to fill.\\u202f\\u202f Remove the dough from the bowl and punch down to a ball on a lightly floured surface. Gently pull the edges out until you form a loose rectangle. Roll out the rectangle until it\\u2019s 1/2 inch thick. Taking the edges from the long side, roll the dough into a log like a cinnamon roll log. Cut the roll into 2-inch-wide pieces. Flatten each piece of dough with the palm of your hand and roll with rolling pin into a 3-inch round. Place 2 tablespoons of filling in the center of each round. Gather the dough up around the filling by pleating along the edges. Bring the pleats up and twist securely and firmly. Place each bao on a parchment square. To cook, set up a bamboo steamer and bring the water to a boil. Steam, covered, for 8 minutes; do not remove the lid. Serve warm. For the marinade: Put the soy sauce, hoisin sauce, ketchup, oyster sauce, sugar, honey, sherry, ginger, red yeast rice powder, Chinese five-spice powder and garlic in a blender and blend on low for about 30 seconds until well combined and smooth. Reserve 1/4 cup for the glaze and pour the remainder into a large bowl or baking dish to marinate the pork. Cut the pork butt into 2-inch-wide by 8-inch strips. Put the pork strips in the marinade, massage well, cover and let marinate in the refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. For the glaze: In a small bowl, mix together the reserved 1/4 cup marinade and honey until combined. Thin it out to a thick syrup with some water if necessary. This glaze is for brushing on the pork after roasting to lock in the juiciness and add sweetness and shine. To cook the pork: Set a 6-quart air fryer to full fan 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove the pork from the marinade and pat off any excess. Roast the pork until a beautiful red and brown with some nice char on some of the edges and a probe thermometer inserted in the center registers 165 degrees F, about 15 minutes. Baste the pork with the glaze on all sides, then cook about 5 minutes more.

Put the Canadian bacon on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and brush with 1 tablespoon maple syrup. Bake until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes per side; let cool slightly. Cut into strips and transfer to a bowl; toss with 1 tablespoon syrup and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F. Make the pancakes: Pulse the oats and flaxseed in a blender or food processor until finely ground; transfer to a large bowl. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and whisk until combined. Whisk the 2 egg yolks and milk in a separate bowl; add to the dry ingredients along with the melted butter and whisk until just smooth. Beat the 2 egg whites and sugar in another bowl with a mixer until soft peaks form; fold into the batter until just combined. Lightly butter a nonstick skillet and place over medium heat. Working in batches, add about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake; cook until bubbly on top, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 3 minutes per side. (Add more butter to the skillet between batches, if needed.) Transfer the pancakes to a baking sheet, cover loosely with aluminum foil and keep warm in the oven until ready to serve. Reserve the skillet for the eggs. Put 1/2 cup maple syrup and the jam in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave 1 minute, then stir to combine; keep warm. Make the eggs: Whisk the eggs, 2 tablespoons water and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a bowl. Butter the skillet and return to medium heat. Add the egg mixture and cook, stirring with a rubber spatula, until set, about 4 minutes, adding the cheese halfway through. Divide the pancakes among plates; top with the flavored syrup, eggs and bacon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 60075,&quot;Caramelized Onion, Gorgonzola, and Rosemary Pizza 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 4 yellow onions, thinly sliced 1-tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves 1/4 cup softened butter Basic Pizza Dough, recipe follows 10 ounces Gorgonzola, crumbled Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup warm tap water (100 to 115 degrees) 1 package active dry yeast 3 to 3 1/2 cups all purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt Instructions: In a large saute pan over high heat, warm the oil. Add the onions and rosemary, and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add butter and lower heat and continue to caramelize for about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Spread the pizza dough with the onion mixture and scatter Gorgonzola over top. Bake in a pizza oven or a preheated 400 degree oven until lightly golden and the crust is browned, about 20 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve. Pour the water onto a medium--sized mixing bowl and add the yeast, stirring with a fork until dissolved. The water should turn a light beige color. Add 1 cup of flour and the salt. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Add the second cup of flour and repeat. The dough should start coming away from the sides of the bowl, forming a soft, sticky mass. Take the last cup of flour and sprinkle over a clean, dry work surface and flour your hands well.Take the dough from the bowl and begin to work in the additional flour a little at a time. Use the heel of your hand to knead the dough and push across the work surface, clenching the dough with your fist and twisting it over. Use a dough scraper to help gather any wet dough that sticks to the surface while you are kneading. Also only add as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds. If the dough comes up clean, it&#39;s ready. If it sticks you will have to knead it a bit more. Lightly oil a 2 quart bowl with vegetable oil, and roll the ball of dough around the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil, then tightly seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Keep in a warm place, and let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes. When dough doubles in size, remove from bowl and punch it down with your fist to deflate, then knead it again for about a minute. Dough is now ready to stretch into a round, or press into a pizza pan. Note: If you have a food processor with a dough hook attachment, you can make the dough much faster. Start by adding the yeast and water first and mixing well. Then add all the flour and salt and mix into a ball. Then rise the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 60076,&quot;Orecchiette with Almond Pesto Kosher salt 1 bunch broccoli rabe, cut into 1-inch pieces 1/2 cup roasted unsalted almonds<br> 2 cups packed fresh basil leaves<br> 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/3-inch dice<br> 1 pound orecchiette pasta<br> Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Season well with salt. Add the broccoli rabe to the water and simmer until the stem is just tender when pierced with a knife, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a rimmed baking sheet to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, squeeze out any extra water with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Add the almonds to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, 5 or 6 times.

Slowly add oil, whisking constantly to emulsify. Set aside. To prepare the salad: To blanch the asparagus, bring a large pot of water to a boil, then drop the asparagus spears in for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on their size. Remove from the water and \\shock\\ them briefly in a bath of ice water to stop the cooking and preserve the green color. Drain thoroughly. Repeat the same process with blanching the green beans, cooing a little longer, about 5 to 7 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine the carrots, black beans, and green beans. Toss together until well mixed. Drizzle with half the Oregano Vinaigrette and mix thoroughly. Place a small pile of salad mix in the center of 6 small plates. Build a campfire stack by arranging 4 or 5 asparagus spears leaning against each other over the salad. Drizzle a little vinaigrette on each stack and serve.

When hot, add half of the olive oil. Add half of the pork along with half of the salt, chili powder, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Saute until the meat is very crisp and brown, about 10 minutes. Set the meat aside on a plate. Add the remaining olive oil, meat, salt, chili powder, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder and cook until the meat is crisp and brown, another 10 minutes. Add the first half of the meat back to the pressure cooker. Add the garlic and onions and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on manual for 40 minutes. After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for natural release. After 15 minutes, release the rest of the steam using quick release. Remove the lid from the pressure cooker. Remove the pork and onions to a baking sheet. Shred the pork with 2 forks, pour over the barbecue sauce and toss to coat. Serve with the buns and Pickled Jalapenos and Onions. If not serving right away, transfer to a 9-by-13-inch disposable aluminum pan, cover with foil and keep warm in the oven at 300 degrees F until ready to serve. Put the jalapenos and red onions in a 16-ounce wide-mouth mason jar. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar, salt and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Pour the hot liquid over the veggies in the jar, screw on the lid and set aside. When it has cooled to room temperature, transfer the jar to the fridge to chill for a minimum of an hour, which will allow the vegetables to pickle. The pickles will last in the fridge for 3 days. Serve them on pulled pork sandwiches. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 60085,&quot;Artichoke and Spinach Swirls 1 package (17.3 ounces) Pepperidge Farm?

Set aside while you prepare the breading setup. Put the flour on a dish large enough to dredge the veal on. Combine the eggs, milk, 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper in a large bowl or dish with sides high enough to hold the liquid and veal chops. Next, combine the bread crumbs, parsley and Parmesan cheese in a large flat casserole so that the process of breading may be kept neat and tidy. Make the tomato vinaigrette by combining the diced tomato with the shredded basil leaves in a bowl. Stir in the lemon juice, whisk in the oil and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Heat the 1/3 cup olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Cook the veal cutlets one at a time, or if they are small enough and your pan is large enough, two at a time. As you saute the veal, brown one side and keep the veal warm in a 250 degree oven while the rest are cooked.

Use as many pots as you need to accommodate the roast. Cook the meat until fork tender and comes apart with no resistance. This usually takes about 2 hours. Reserve pork broth. Pull meat apart into chunks and refrigerate until ready to use. While the meat is cooking, clean dried chilies by removing the tops and discarding the seeds. Place pods into a bath of water and soak for a few minutes. While pods are soaking, fill a large pot halfway with water. Place your clean chili pods in the water and push them down until the water covers all. Bring to a boil and then simmer 34 to 45 minutes. When done, remove from heat. Transfer small bunches of the tender chili pods to a blender and blend on high until the pods turn to a liquid mixture. (The seed and skins will make the mixture seem a little chunky but that will be removed in a food mill.) Pour the chili sauce into a food mill which should be attached to a bowl or saucepan. Run the sauce through the mill until no more liquid is left in the top of the mill. Discard the leftover seeds and skin. Repeat this process for the remaining chili sauce until all of it has been run through the food mill. Next, add the ground cumin to the chili sauce. This sauce uses quite a bit of salt; add small amounts at a time, to taste. Once chili sauce is properly seasoned, add pork to the chili sauce. Stir until thoroughly mixed. No need to heat, just put the mixture in the refrigerator until ready to use. Open packages of cornhusks and remove the silk from each husk. Place cornhusks into a sink filled with warm water. Let the husks soak for about 3 minutes. Remove the husks from the water and place on a cookie sheet and cover with damp towel to keep moist. Prepare masa according to the directions on the package, or buy pre-made masa, available at specialty ethnic food stores. Also try calling a Mexican restaurant, they may make it for you. To soften up the masa before you work with it, add approximately 2 cups of the reserved pork broth. Once softened, divide masa into deep bowls amongst the people helping. Press masa flat, down into the bowl, creating a flat surface. Take 1 cornhusk and lay it flat, add a large dollop of the masa onto the husk. Spread the masa out onto the leaf with the back of a spoon to create a thin paste like coverage, being sure to leave no holes. Place 2 tablespoons of the chili sauce/pork mixture onto the masa. (It?s best to keep a bowl of the sauce next to you at all times.) Fold the tamale bringing two sides together so that they slightly overlap, then fold the bottom up over the folded sides. Press down slightly on top of tamale while holding everything in place and the masa will act as a glue to seal the filling. Place tamales standing upright into a large double steamer. Steam for 2 hours. Remove tamales from steamer and let stand about 5 minutes. Pull off husk and eat. If desired, tamales may be frozen in plastic storage bags. To steam frozen tamales, just add 1 hour to the cooking time. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 60097,&quot;Tuscan Wood-Grilled Oysters with Crispy Pancetta-Tomato-Basil Mignonette 1/2-inch-thick piece pancetta, finely diced 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons finely diced shallots 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black peppercorns 8 fresh basil leaves, finely chopped 2 plum tomatoes, seeded and finely diced Kosher salt 24 assorted oysters (East and West Coast), soaked in water and scrubbed well Fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, for garnish Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Special equipment: 2 cups pecan wood chips, soaked in water for at least 2 hours Instructions: Put the pancetta in a cast-iron skillet and cook over medium-high heat until crisp and the fat is rendered. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. While the pancetta cooks, combine the vinegar, shallots, peppercorns, basil, tomatoes and season with salt. Prepare the charcoal grill using a chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes. When the coals are red hot and begin to turn grey, add the soaked wood chips evenly over the top of the coals. Grip each oyster, flat-side up, in a folded kitchen towel. Find the small opening between the shells near the hinge and pry it open with an oyster knife. Try not to spill the delicious juices, known as the oyster liqueur, in the bottom shell. Cut the oyster meat loose from the top shell, and then loosen the oyster from the bottom shell by running the oyster knife carefully underneath the body. Discard the top, flatter shell, keeping the oyster and juices in the bottom, deeper shell. Brush the cooking grates clean. Grill the oysters over direct high heat until the juices start to bubble and the edges of the oyster curl, 2 to 4 minutes. Spread 1 1/2 cups kosher salt evenly over the bottom of a large platter. Carefully nestle the cooked oysters in the salt and top each oyster with some of the mignonette, a few cubes of pancetta and some parsley leaves. Drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 60098,&quot;Smoked Chicken Cannelloni One 2 1/4- to 2 1/2-pound whole chicken, patted dry and set out for 15 minutes<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 2 teaspoons granulated garlic<br> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1/4 cup chopped yellow onion<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced 12 ounces chopped roasted red pepper, drained<br> 4 ounces chopped fire-roasted tomatoes, drained<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 3/4 cup heavy cream Juice of 1/2 a lemon<br> One 8-ounce box cannelloni shells (12 shells), soaked in warm water for 2 minutes<br> 1 pound whole milk ricotta cheese<br> 4 ounces whipped cream cheese<br> 1 1/3 cups grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish<br> 1 large egg<br> 3 grounds fresh nutmeg<br> 1 1/2 ounces chopped spinach leaves (about 2 cups)<br> 1/2 cup chopped fire-roasted tomatoes, drained<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1/4 cup coarsely ground panko breadcrumbs<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the chicken: Using kitchen shears, remove the backbone of the chicken and set aside in the refrigerator for another use (such as Smoked Chicken Minestrone). Cut the chicken in half, straight through the breastbone. By separating the chicken into two pieces it will ensure that the chicken gets smoked more thoroughly. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, the granulated garlic and smoked paprika. Place 1 deep aluminum roasting pan over the stove top. Line with aluminum foil. Add the soaked wood chips to a large piece of foil, and then fold in the sides to make a pouch. Punch holes in the top of the pouch, set it directly over a gas burner and turn on high. Leave for 2 to 3 minutes, watching carefully. Once it begins to smoke, using tongs, transfer the pouch to the bottom of the lined roasting pan. Set a wire rack over the chips in the lined roasting pan and position it so the wood chips are directly over the burner and continue to smoke. Place the chicken pieces bone-side down on the rack. Cover tightly with aluminum foil to seal in the smoke. Put the roasting pan into the oven and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove and cool. Shred the smoked chicken breast and set aside 1 1/2 cups for the cannelloni (reserve the rest for another use). Increase the oven to 375 degrees F. While the chicken is smoking, make the creamy roasted red pepper sauce: Bring the oil to medium heat in a large saucepot. Sweat the onions until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat until fragrant, about a minute. Stir in the peppers and tomatoes. Simmer for 5 minutes. Working in 2 cup batches, process the sauce on high in a blender until smooth. Return the sauce to the pot, reduce the heat to low and whisk in the cream. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. If making ahead, cool before refrigerating for up to a week. For the cannelloni: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, cream cheese, 1 cup of the Parmesan, the egg and nutmeg with a wooden spoon. Fold in the reserved shredded chicken, spinach, tomatoes and some salt and pepper. Spoon the filling into a medium pastry bag fitted with a large open tip. Spread 1/2 cup of the creamy roasted red pepper sauce evenly on the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch gratin dish. Pipe about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the filling into the cannelloni shells and place them into the gratin dish. Spoon the remaining sauce over the cannelloni. Sprinkle with the panko and remaining Parmesan. Cover and bake until the filling is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Bake uncovered until the top is golden and bubbling, an additional 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and cool on a resting rack.

Combine the butter, oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar and corn syrup in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for 3 minutes. Add eggs and vanilla and mix until combined. On low speed, add one-third of the flour mixture, followed by half of the milk, mixing until combined. Repeat. Add the final third of the flour mixture and mix for 30 seconds. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake until set in the center and an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack. Let cool completely. For the buttercream: Combine the granulated sugar and water in small pot fitted with a candy thermometer. Boil to the soft ball stage. Meanwhile, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form. When the sugar syrup reaches 225 degrees F, add it slowly to the whipped egg whites while beating on medium speed. Continue beating until cool. With the mixer running, add the butter a few pieces at a time. Mix in the vanilla extract and fold in the marshmallow creme. Spread the marshmallows out on a foil-lined baking sheet. Toast with a kitchen blowtorch, moving the marshmallows around to make sure both sides are toasted. Add half of the toasted marshmallows to buttercream. Set aside the other half. (Makes 4 cups.) For the ganache: Place the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring the cream just to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let stand for 10 minutes. Stir until shiny and smooth. Add the butter and stir until completely melted. Let cool at room temperature until set, about 1 hour. (Makes 1 1/2 cups.) To assemble: Level the tops of the cakes, then slice each in half horizontally (to make four layers). Starting with the bottom layer, spread the top with about a 1/4-inch of ganache. Place the next cake layer on top, spread with a 1/4-inch of buttercream and sprinkle with the reserved toasted marshmallows. Add the third cake layer and another layer of ganache. Place the final cake layer on top. With an offset spatula, remove any excess filling from the outside of the cake. Refrigerate for 15 minutes to set. Once the cake has chilled, ice the entire cake with the remaining buttercream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 60102,&quot;Grilled Peppered New York Strip with Shallot-Pommery Sauce Spinach-Shiitake-Potato Gratin Dauphinoise 4 (8-ounce) prime sirloin strips (also called NY strips) 5-peppercorn mix (3: black, 2: white, 1: green, 1: pink, 1/2: Szechwan) coarsely cracked Salt to taste 2 tablespoons dry mustard powder 1 teaspoon turmeric 1 teaspoon salt Water, to make a paste 2 cups canola oil 5 sliced shallots 1/2 cup red wine 2 tablespoons pommery whole grain mustard 1/2 cup heavy cream 4 ounces hard butter Salt and black pepper to taste 6 large, peeled russet potatoes sliced 1/4-inch thick 3 tablespoons minced garlic 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 pound spinach leaves, de-stemmed 2 cups sliced shiitake mushrooms (Sauteed in oil) 1 quart heavy cream Salt and black pepper to taste Instructions: Season the steaks liberally with salt and 5-peppercorn mix. On a hot grill, mark the steaks and cook each side about 4 to 5 minutes. I prefer medium rare, which takes about 8 minutes total. Make sure to let the steaks rest after grilling for about 3 minutes to let the meat relax.<br> For the mustard oil: In a bowl, whisk mustard, turmeric and salt with water to form a paste. Whisk in oil and let stand overnight. Mixture will separate, don&#39;t re-mix before using, you want to use the clear flavored oil off the top. For the shallot sauce: In a 1 quart stainless steel saucepan, add 1 tablespoon of butter and caramelize the shallots. Season. Add the red wine and reduce until almost dry. Add the mustard and saute for 2 minutes then add the cream. Heat the cream until hot, but not boiling. Pour into a blender and blend at high speed. Add the remaining butter and check for seasoning. Keep warm in a water bath. For the gratin: Pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees. In a large bowl, mix everything together. Taste the cream for proper seasoning. Dump contents in a baking dish with at least a 2-inch lip. Make sure the cream covers the mixture. Bake in oven for 30 minutes, then stir well. Bake another 45 minutes until cream is thickened and potatoes are soft. Cut the gratin with a ring mold and place in the center of a plate. Spoon shallot-pommery sauce around the gratin. Slice the steak and encircle the gratin.

Meanwhile, add the flour and salt to the bowl of a food processor and pulse 5 times to mix. Add the pumpkin puree, olive oil and honey to the yeast mixture and whisk to combine. With the food processor running, slowly add the liquid in a thin stream until a ball forms (you won&#39;t necessarily add it all before this happens). Once the ball forms, process for 30 seconds to knead. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead a couple times to form into a tight ball. Place in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Set aside at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. For the white sauce: Combine the ricotta, mozzarella, milk and oregano in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper, and mix until well blended. For the toppings: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice the butternut squash crosswise into 1/2-inch slices. Place in a bowl, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Transfer the squash to a baking sheet and roast until slightly browned and softened, 30 to 35 minutes. Slice into triangles. Raise the oven temperature to 500 degrees F and set a pizza stone on the top rack. Divide the dough into 2 portions and roll into balls. On a floured work surface, roll out 1 of the dough balls into a 12- to 14-inch circle and place on a well-floured pizza peel. Working quickly, spread with half of the white sauce in a circular pattern, sprinkle with 1 cup of the shredded mozzarella, and arrange some pepperoni if using around the perimeter of the pizza near the crust. Transfer to the pizza stone and bake until the crust is browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough, white sauce and mozzarella. When the pizzas come out of the oven, arrange the roasted butternut squash on top to look like a jack-o-lantern: Use 2 triangles for eyes and 2 black olives as eyeballs, then use 1 triangle for the nose and more triangles for teeth.

Lightly butter one 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Whisk together the flour, pecans, granulated sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl. Whisk together the eggs, melted butter, buttermilk, brown sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl; stir in the mashed bananas. Fold the banana mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (it&#39;s OK if there are some lumps). Pour the batter into the buttered pan and lightly tap the pan on the counter to evenly distribute the batter. Bake until browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out completely clean, about 1 hour. Let the bread cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 60123,&quot;Chocolate Cake Cake: Unsalted butter, for greasing pan 3 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped 1 cup flat cola 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder (not Dutch processed) 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon fine salt 2 cups sugar 3 large eggs 1 cup buttermilk 3/4 cup vegetable oil 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Icing: 1 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch fine salt 4 large egg whites 10 ounces (2 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into small pieces Instructions: For the cake: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Butter and line the bottom of 9- by 13-inch cake pan with parchment paper, overlapping on two sides to create flaps. Put the chopped chocolate in a bowl. Heat the cola just to a simmer over low heat and pour over the chocolate. Let stand for 5 minutes; stir until smooth. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the sugar and eggs in a separate bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until slightly thickened and pale, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the buttermilk, oil, vanilla and melted chocolate to the eggs. Beat on low until combined, but not aerated. Add the flour mixture and continue to beat until just combined. Stir lightly with a rubber spatula to remove any pockets of flour. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the cake springs back lightly when touched and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool the cake completely in the pan on a rack. Run a knife around edge of the pan and invert the cake onto the rack. Carefully remove the parchment paper and cool completely. (The cake may be made in advance, tightly wrapped and kept at room temperature for up to 2 days.) For the icing: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a standing mixer&#39;s bowl above the water. Whisk together the sugar, lemon juice, salt and egg whites in the bowl by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and continue whisking until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the bowl to a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat the whites at medium-high speed until they almost hold a stiff peak and are fully cooled, about 10 minutes. Beat in the butter, a little at a time, until the icing is smooth and spreadable. (If the icing separates, just keep beating and it will come back together.) Frost the cake. Serve or set aside at room temperature for up to 2 hours before serving, refrigerating if needed. (If cake is refrigerated, bring to room temperature 1 hour before serving.) &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 60124,&quot;Fiber One Waffles 2 cups Fiber One Complete pancake mix (from 28.3-oz box) 1 1/4 cups cold water 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Instructions: Heat waffle maker.

Meanwhile, make the pesto: Process the tomatoes, basil, mint, almonds, garlic, orange zest and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor until combined. With the motor running, gradually add 1/3 cup olive oil in a steady stream and blend to make a coarse pesto, scraping down the sides of the processor as needed. Transfer the pesto to a large bowl; do not wash out the processor. Add the bucatini to the boiling water and cook as the label directs. Meanwhile, heat about 1/4 inch of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Put the flour in a shallow dish. Season the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon salt, then dredge in the flour. Fry the shrimp in 2 batches until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Remove the pasta with tongs (reserve the cooking water) and transfer to the bowl with the pesto; toss to coat. If the pasta seems dry, rinse the food processor with 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking water and add to the pasta, a little at a time. Season with salt. Add the cheese and toss. Drizzle the pasta with olive oil and divide among bowls; top with the shrimp. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 60128,&quot;Chocolate Babka 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar 3 ounces cake yeast 2 cups warm milk 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon salt 10 egg yolks 2 eggs 4 to 5 cups all-purpose flour, as needed 1/2 cup butter, clarified 14 ounces almond paste 5 egg whites 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped Instructions: Make the sponge: Combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and warm milk; then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature 1 hour. Make the dough: In bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a whisk, mix together the sugar, vanilla, salt, egg yolks and eggs until well blended.

Once butter is completely melted or oil is hot, working in batches, dunk Pumpkin Bread in French Toast Egg Custard, completely submerging the bread. Place bread a few pieces at a time in the skillet and cook until the bottom is golden brown, about 5 minutes. With a spatula, flip the bread and cook the other side. The bread is done when both sides are browned and the egg custard is cooked completely through. Repeat until all bread is cooked, adding more butter to skillet as needed. Put toast on a plate. Spread Sweet Cream Cheese on the top side of bread. Stack 2 pieces with cream cheese on top of each other, making sure to balance, making 6 servings. Sprinkle powdered sugar over the toast and serving plates or platter. Drizzle Allspice Dulce De Leche over the top of the toast. Top each stack with a candy pumpkin. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a bowl, combine all the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the wet ingredients (eggs, pumpkin, oil and water). Turn mixer on low and mix wet ingredients. While mixer is on, slowly add dry ingredients until incorporated. Mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. Turn off mixer. Grease a half sheet pan (18-x-13 inches) and top with greased side extenders. Pour in the pumpkin batter, making sure to spread evenly across pan. Lift the pan up and down, tapping it on the counter to remove air pockets and level the mixture. Bake for about 20 minutes with a low fan (convection). The bread is finished when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, or the bread springs back when lightly pressed. Cool bread. Remove sheet pan side extenders. Cut bread into 4-inch squares with a large knife or square cookie cutter. Combine eggs, cream, vanilla and cinnamon in a medium bowl and mix with a whisk. Refrigerate if not using right away. In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, mix cream cheese and butter on low speed. While still on low speed, add powdered sugar until completely combined. Add vanilla extract. Turn off mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl, making sure all ingredients are in the center of the bowl. Turn on mixer again and mix until all ingredients are incorporated. Refrigerate until needed. Combine cream, sugar, baking soda and allspice in a medium saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring continuously, until the mixture is thick enough that you can see the bottom of the pan when stirred, about 1 hour. If the mixture boils over, turn down the heat and continue to mix. Remove from the heat and let cool. The sauce should be thick enough when cool to hold its shape. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 60137,&quot;Boneless Chicken Breast in Cranberry, Walnut, and Pipian Sauce 6 to 8 boneless chicken breasts 2 onions, sliced 5 garlic cloves, smashed 2 bay leaves Salt Cranberry, Walnut, and Pipian Sauce, recipe follows 4 ounces olive oil 10 garlic cloves 5 shallots, chopped 1 large onion, chopped 1 large tomato, chopped 8 ounces cranberries 7 ounces chopped walnuts 4 dried ancho chiles 4 dried pasilla chiles 6 ounces pumpkin seeds 5 dried chiles de arbol 6 ounces sesame seeds, roasted 1 1/2 Mexican chocolate tablets Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the chicken breasts in a large, deep saute pan with onion, garlic, bay leaves, and salt.

In a large, heavy Dutch oven over high heat fry the bacon until crisp and all of the fat is rendered. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the crisp bacon bits to paper towels to drain. Set aside and reserve. Season the chicken pieces with the salt and pepper. Brown the chicken pieces in the hot bacon fat, working in batches, if necessary, until golden on all sides. Transfer the chicken pieces to a large plate or bowl and set aside. Remove all but about 4 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the Dutch oven. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the chopped onion, pearl onions, shallots and garlic cloves to the Dutch oven and cook until soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for 7 minutes longer, or until they&#39;ve released most of their liquid and have begun to brown. Add the flour and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Slowly add the wine and stock, stirring constantly. Add the thyme, bay leaves reserved bacon and chicken. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, and cook the sauce at a gentle simmer for 15 minutes, until liquid is slightly thickened. Bring the sauce to a boil and cover the pot. Place in the oven and cook for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is very tender. Transfer the chicken pieces to a serving dish and cover loosely to keep warm. Return pot to medium-low heat. Skim any fat from the surface of the cooking liquid and increase the heat to medium-high. Add the heavy cream and cook until the sauce has thickened slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 15 to 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Return the chicken to the Dutch oven and cook for a few minutes to heat through, then serve. Serve with egg noodles and Braised Leeks. Garnish with chopped parsley. Using a sharp knife, trim most of the roots off the ends of the leeks, leaving enough so that the leek remains attached at the bottom. Cut each leek lengthwise into halves or quarters, as desired. Run leeks under cold running water, using fingers to loosen and remove any dirt or sand from between the leaves. In a heavy skillet or saute pan that has a tight fitting lid, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the leeks to the skillet with any water that is clinging to the leaves from washing them. Cook the leeks, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the stock and thyme and lower the heat to medium-low. Braise the leeks, covered, for about 10 minutes, or until the leeks are very tender.

Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or your hands for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth, until a somewhat elastic dough has formed. The starter will be thick and stretchy. Scrape the starter into a clear container with high sides and cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise. At this point you have two options. If you plan to make the dough later the same day, let the sponge rise at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it just begins to indent on top. This may take 6 to 8 hours. It will triple in volume and very small dents and folds will begin to appear in the top of the surface as it reaches its peak and begins to deflate. Make sure to use it before it sinks too much. If you are not planning to make the dough until the next day, let the sponge rise for 1 hour after mixing, then place it in the refrigerator and let it rise for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use. Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by using warm water in the dough, or let it sit out, covered, until it reaches room temperature. To make the dough, place the yeast and water in a large bowl. Stir the yeast so it dissolves, and allow to stand for 1 minute. Add the sponge to the yeast mixture, and mix with your hands for 1 minute to break up the sponge. The mixture should be foamy. Add the flour and mix it in with your hands, lifting the wet mixture over the flour to incorporate it. Once the dough becomes a shaggy mass, knead in the bowl for 1 minute. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes. Add the salt to the dough and knead briefly to incorporate. Gradually add the oil and milk, and knead gently until all the liquid has been incorporated. Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until it begins to become smooth, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. The dough will be sticky, so keep the work surface lightly floured. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn the dough to coat it, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until almost double in size, approximately 2 hours. To make the olive bread, place the dough on a lightly floured surface, spread the dough out gently, and then spread the chopped olives all over the surface. Roll the dough up, and let it rest for 1 hour. Line 2 (8-inch square) pans with parchment brushed with olive oil. When the dough has risen, loosen it from the bowl with lightly floured hands, and pour it onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Shape each piece into log shapes, pressing the olives into the dough, and sealing the seams. Place on a floured cloth to rise for 1 to 2 1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place the loaves onto a peel coated with cornmeal and slide onto a preheated baking stone, or place the loaves onto a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, and place it in the oven. Mist the loaves with water from a spray bottle, and shut the oven door. Mist again 1 minute later. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F, and bake for 15 to 25 minutes longer, or until golden brown and crusty. Remove the olive bread from the oven immediately and let cool on a cooling rack. This recipe was provided by professional chefs and has been scaled down from a bulk recipe provided by a restaurant.

Use some kitchen scissors to cut the turkey package open. Add some extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a nice, slow stream. Have the GH add the ground turkey to the pan, in case it spatters. Break the turkey up with a big wooden spoon as it starts to cook. If anyone touches the raw turkey, they should go wash their hands. If you are a really good chopper, using a small, sharp knife chop up some red onion. Remember when you are chopping to keep the fingers that are not holding the knife all tucked in and curled under. Have a GH help you. You need half a red onion chopped up small. Pull the seeds and white membrane and the top out of a half red bell pepper and chop that up small too. Add the veggies to the cooking meat and stir it all together. Next, mix in a small bowl: grill seasoning blend, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce and the tomato sauce. This will make your special sauce. When all the ingredients are combined, pour the sauce evenly over the meat and stir everything together really well. Turn the heat down to simmer and cook the sloppy mixture for 10 minutes. Blow on a spoonful until cool and taste it to see if you need to adjust the seasoning. Have the GH help you serve. Place a bun bottom on a plate. Use a big ice cream scoop to get a pile of sloppy meat onto the bun. Put bun top in place and serve with vegetable sticks on the side and Cheese Fries. 1 sack frozen French fries, any brand or shape - crinkle cut, thin cut, steak cut, waffle fries - prepared to package directions 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups whole milk 2 1/2 cups, (10-ounce) sack shredded yellow Cheddar 3 squirts ketchup, about 1/4 cup Have your GH (Grown Helper) put fries in oven on a cookie sheet. While fries are baking in the oven, have a GH place a sauce pot on the stove and heat it over medium heat. Add butter and melt it. Add the flour and stir. Cook butter and flour together for 1 minute or so. This is called \\roux\\ (like Tiger and Roo with Pooh Bear) and it helps to thicken up sauces. Use a whisk to stir as the milk goes into the pot. Keep stirring until the milk gets thicker. Use a wooden spoon or heat-safe spatula to stir in the cheese. When all of the cheese melts, take the sauce off the heat and stir in 3 squirts of ketchup. This is your SECRET ingredient. When everyone asks what you put in your cheese sauce that makes it taste so good, just say milk and cheese, you can NEVER tell what secret ingredients you add! Tell your GH to keep the secret, too or they can never help you again! Pour the sauce over the fries or serve the sauce on the side if you like to dipping better.

Set aside. Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. With a chicken breast flat on a cutting board, using a sharp knife, about 1/3 of the way down the thick side, cut a deep pocket horizontally into the center of the meat about 3/4 of the way down, being careful not to cut through to the other side. (The pocket will be about 2 1/2 inches long and 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep.) Repeat with the remaining breasts. Wash hands well. In a small bowl, mash together the goat cheese, butter, chives, parsley, thyme, lemon juice and garlic. Season with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Divide into 4 equal pieces and form plugs to fit inside the chicken breasts. Insert 1 into each breast and press the edges of chicken meat to seal. Lightly season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. In a large shallow bowl, combine the flour and the Essence. In another bowl, beat the egg with the water. One at a time, lightly dust the chicken on both sides with the flour, then dip in the egg, shaking to remove any excess. Place again in the flour and turn to completely coat, shaking to remove any excess. Set aside. In a large, oven-proof skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and sear until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Place the pan in the oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven. Arrange the risotto in the center of 4 plates and place the chicken to the side. Arrange the carrots along the bottom of the plates, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately. In a medium saucepan, bring the stock to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to very low to keep hot. In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil and melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring until fragrant and soft, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until wilted and their liquid is evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly, until the grains are opaque, about 1 minute. Stir in the thyme. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until nearly all evaporated. Add 3/4 cup of the stock, the salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until the stock is nearly all evaporated. Continue adding more stock 1/2 cup at a time as the previous addition is nearly absorbed, until the rice is tender and the risotto is creamy, 18 to 20 minutes. Stir in cream, 1/2 cup of the cheese, and the parsley and mix well. Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste. If desired, stir in truffle oil to taste. Serve immediately, topping each portion with a sprinkling of the remaining cheese and ham. In a large stockpot, combine all the ingredients and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours, skimming the surface occasionally to remove any foam that forms on the surface. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container. (If necessary, strain again.) Remove the meat from the bones and reserve for another use. Discard the bones and vegetables. Let the stock cool completely, and refrigerate overnight. Skim any fat that forms on the surface. Keep refrigerated in airtight containers until ready to use, up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. On a cutting board, using a sharp, heavy knife, cut the carrots in half crosswise, then in half lengthwise. With the flat edge down, cut into thin slices. Place the slices in a stack and slice into even matchstick pieces. (If a fine dice is required, these pieces in turn are chopped into equal small cubes.) Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the carrots and blanch until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and shock in the prepared ice bath to stop cooking and preserve color. When ready to serve the carrots, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. When foamy, add the carrots and cook, stirring, until warmed through and glossy, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, sprinkle with the parsley and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 60209,&quot;Super Thick Hot Chocolate 3 cups milk 1 cup evaporated milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup cocoa powder 1/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch Pinch ground cinnamon Instructions: In a saucepan, combine the milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla and warm up over a low heat.

Line the bowl with plastic wrap, draping excess wrap over the sides. Evenly and firmly pack vanilla ice cream into the bowl. Smooth the surface, and then repeat with strawberry ice cream, yielding two packed layers with a flat surface. Place wafers, rounded side down, in a single even layer over the strawberry ice cream. (Use fewer wafers, if needed.) Cover with plastic wrap, and freeze until very firm, at least 8 hours. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. To make the meringue, set out all measured ingredients. Combine egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer set at high speed until fluffy and slightly stiff, about 3 minutes. While still beating the mixture, gradually add sugar, no-calorie sweetener, and vanilla extract. Continue beating until mixture is fully blended and stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside. Remove bowl from the freezer and uncover. Place a 9-inch pie pan firmly over the bowl, upside down, and carefully flip so the pie pan is on the bottom. Gently tug on the plastic wrap to release the ice cream from the bowl, leaving the ice cream in the pie pan. Remove the plastic wrap.

Retain 1 cup flour for later use. Add 1/2 cup of water to the dry ingredients and mix by hand. Continue to add water by the tablespoon until the flour is incorporated - but not sticky. If the dough mixture becomes too sticky - add flour until the dough is dry to the touch. Lightly flour the working surface. Turn the dough mixture onto the floured working surface and continue to knead the dough until it is smooth. Cover the dough with a clean towel and let rest for approximately 15 minutes. Once the dough has rested for approximately 15 minutes, divide the dough into 4 pieces. Re-flour each piece thoroughly. Using a rolling pin, flatten each piece of dough until it is approximately 1/8-inch thick. Using a pizza cutter - cut each piece of dough into strips approximately 1/2-inch wide and each strip into \\little nuggets\\ approximately 3/4-inch wide. Using the tip of a dinner fork slightly tilted on an angle, press each \\nugget\\ into the fork tip and roll downward. This will give you a little round piece of dough with ridges. Place the finished gnocchi on a floured pan until the process has been completed with all of the remaining dough. Bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil - add the finished gnocchi carefully to the boiling water and stir completely to avoid sticking. Reduce the heat to a slow boil and cook the gnocchi for approximately 8 minutes or until the desired tenderness is attained. Drain the gnocchi thoroughly using a colander and serve immediately with your favorite sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 60213,&quot;Pan-Fried Spicy Crab Cakes 1 tablespoon water 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup finely chopped yellow onions 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup finely chopped celery Garnish: Green onions 1/4 cup seeded and finely chopped red bell pepper 1/4 cup seeded and finely chopped yellow bell pepper Salt Cayenne 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 pound lump crabmeat, picked over to remove shells and cartilage 1/4 cup chopped green onions, green parts only, plus extra for garnish 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves 3 tablespoons Creole mustard Juice of one fresh lemon (or 3 tablespoons) 1/2 cup mayonnaise Worcestershire sauce Hot pepper sauce 1 1/2 cups dried fine bread crumbs 1/4 cup all-purpose flour Essence, recipe follows 2 eggs (for egg wash) 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Melt butter in a small saute pan over medium heat.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Fit a sheet pan with a wire rack and set aside. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F in a deep fryer or Dutch oven. To make the Nashville hot oil, whisk together the cayenne, dark brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of the salt, chili powder, granulated garlic, paprika and black pepper in a glass or metal bowl. Once the oil is up to temp, add about 1 large ladleful (6 to 8 ounces) to the spice mixture to let it bloom. Be careful as it will bubble aggressively. Whisk until smooth. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Drain the shrimp, add to the flour mixture and gently toss to combine. Working in batches, gently place the shrimp into the oil, one at a time, making sure the shrimp are not sticking together. Alternatively, use a spider to scoop up a bunch of shrimp from the dredge, shake the spider to knock off the excess flour mixture and gently lower into the oil. Fry the shrimp, moving them around constantly, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to the prepared sheet pan and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining shrimp. For the grits: To milk the cobs, first cut off the kernels and set aside. Then hold the raw cob in a wide shallow bowl or over a plate and drag the sharp edge of a chef\\u2019s knife along the length to extract all that juice embedded in the cob. Reserve for later. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a saucepan until melted. Add the scallion whites and corn kernels and saut for 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the water. Using a blender or immersion blender, blend the scallions, corn and water until smooth. Add the milk and bring to a simmer. Slowly rain in the grits while whisking vigorously. Keep at a light simmer while stirring constantly until the cornmeal is no longer toothsome, 20 to 30 minutes. If the grits become too thick, add in more water to ensure the grits continue to cook properly while still achieving a creamy consistency. Off the heat, add in the cheeses, reserved \\u201ccorn cob milk\\u201d and remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Whisk until smooth. If the grits are too tight, add a bit more water to loosen up. Season to taste with salt and pepper. To plate: Place a ladleful of grits in a bowl. Whisk the warm oil and bloomed spices until smooth again. Using a pastry brush, dab each shrimp with the spice mixture before placing on the grits. Top the bowls with the sliced scallion greens and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 60217,&quot;Iceberg Lettuce Wedges with Russian Dressing 3/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup chili sauce 1/4 cup sour cream 3 tablespoons sweet pickle relish 2 tablespoons black or red caviar, optional 2 teaspoons snipped fresh dill 1 teaspoon minced capers 1 iceberg lettuce, cut into (1-inch)-thick wedges Instructions: Whisk together all dressing ingredients, cover, and store in refrigerator until ready to use.

F. Trim and peel the carrots. If any sections are significantly wider than the others, peel them so the carrot is fairly even in width. Cut into 2-inch lengths and put in a large skillet. Add the butter, maple syrup, miso, coriander, garlic powder, paprika, a pinch each of salt and pepper and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to melt the butter and miso, then cover and reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are just tender in the center when pierced with a sharp knife and the liquid has reduced to a thick glaze, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Roll out the puff pastry into a thin 11-inch square (dust your surface with flour if the pastry is sticking). Cut into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-wide strips (you\\u2019ll need as many strips as you have carrot sticks). Wrap a strip of pastry around each carrot stick, overlapping the pastry as needed and leaving the ends of the carrot exposed. Put on an unlined baking sheet, seam-side down. Brush the tops with heavy cream or beaten egg and lightly sprinkle with poppy seeds and salt. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes.

Remove backbone and ribs, but leave the skin. Combine salt, sugar, and pepper in a small dish, then rub into flesh of each fillet, making sure to spread mixture uniformly. Layer dill over 1 fillet, then replace the other fillet on top. Put stacked fillets in a flat-bottomed glass or ceramic casserole pan large enough to allow fillets to lie flat. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and place another dish or a clean cutting board about the same size as the fillets, over the top of the fillets. Make sure the dish/board doesn?t touch the sides of the lower pan. Place a 3 to 5 pound weight on top to compress fillets. Place in refrigerator to allow a marinade to start forming. Once a day, flip fillets, ensuring both are well soaked in marinade. Replace the plastic wrap and weight, then return to refrigerator. After 4 to 5 days, the process is complete and the gravlachs will be ready. The weight flattens the fillets, and the loss of moisture produces the distinctive firm texture of lox. The gravlachs can be eaten right away. Or slice into halves or thirds, wrap securely, and freeze. To serve, cut thin slices but leave skin behind. This is generally easiest if the gravlachs is still slightly frozen. Mild Mustard-Dill Sauce: Combine mustard, sugar, and flour, then add enough vinegar to make a thick sauce. Add 1 tablespoon of mixture to mayonnaise, then stir in chopped dill and whipped cream. Present in a small dish with a serving spoon alongside the gravlachs. Serving Suggestions: Serve atop wafer crackers or melba-style toast with cream cheese, finely chopped onions, capers. For a more traditional twist, serve mild mustard-dill sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 60237,&quot;Fresh Mozzarella Planks 8 mozzarella planks, 2 by 4 inches, 1/4-inch thick 1 cup milk, mixed with 1 cup beaten eggs 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 cup ground Parmesan 1 tablespoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon ground white pepper<br> 3 cups panko breadcrumbs<br> 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> Vegetable oil, for frying<br> Instructions: Pre-chill or slightly freeze the cheese planks for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, Parmesan, salt and pepper in one bowl, and whisk together the breadcrumbs, parsley and garlic powder in another bowl. Dip each plank into the flour mixture, then dip in the egg wash to cover, and finally cover with the seasoned panko breadcrumbs. The exterior must be covered evenly, or the cheese will \\leak\\ out during cooking. Repeat the process with the remaining planks. Place the cheese planks on a baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes. Heat oil in a fryer or deep pot to 350 degrees to 375 degrees F. Fry the planks until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.

Set aside. Melt the butter and add to the cold milk in the bowl of a stand mixer, then whisk in the sour cream, extracts and 2 of the eggs. Add the dry ingredients and mix with the paddle attachment until a rough dough forms. Switch to the dough hook or knead by hand until the dough is very smooth and soft, about 8 minutes. If the dough is very sticky, add the remaining flour 1 tablespoon at a time. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray and add the dough. Spray the top lightly with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm room and allow to double in size, 45 to 60 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured piece of parchment and roll into a rough 10-by-26-inch rectangle. Fold over the dough on the short sides toward the middle like you were folding a really long letter, then open the dough back up so that there are creases in the dough, dividing it into three. Spread or pipe the Cream Cheese Filling to fill the middle section within the creases, then top with the Microwave Lemon Curd. Using a sharp paring knife, cut the exposed dough on either side of the middle filling into 1-inch-wide bands. Cross one band over the filling on a slight diagonal and then cross the opposite band over the first. Continue crisscrossing all the bands. Gently shape the braided dough into a round, sealing together the ends. Beat the remaining egg together with 1 tablespoon water, then use this egg wash as \\glue\\ to keep the ends together. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and allow to almost double in size, 45 to 60 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush the dough with egg wash and sprinkle with sparkling or Swedish pearl sugar. Bake until just golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature before eating. Mix together the cream cheese, confectioners&#39; sugar, egg, zest and salt with a wooden spoon until smooth. Transfer 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice to a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over it and stir until combined; set aside. In a large microwave-safe bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, butter, salt, eggs, lemon zest and remaining 14 tablespoons lemon juice. Microwave the curd mixture on high for 3 minutes. Stir the curd, then microwave for 3 minutes more. Stir again, then microwave for 2 minutes. Stir and check to see whether the curd coats the back of a wooden spoon, has thickened in the bowl and the temperature reads 170 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. If not, zap again, a minute at a time, until you reach the right consistency. This should not take longer than 10 minutes. Stir the softened gelatin into the still-warm curd until well incorporated.

Line a standard-size muffin pan with 12 cupcake liners. Combine the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Cream on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and add the egg and banana puree. Cream for an additional 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl, and then add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Mix for 30 seconds on low speed. Add the toffee bits and buttermilk. Stir on low speed until combined. Fill the prepared cupcake liners three-quarters full with batter and bake until golden brown and baked through, about 25 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the filling: Stir the dulce de leche and toffee bits together until fully combined. Place in a pastry bag with a round tip large enough to allow the toffee bits to pass through without becoming lodged. For the icing: In a bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the butter on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Add the cream cheese and mix on medium-high speed until well combined and lump free. Scrape down the sides of the mixer bowl and add the powdered sugar. Stir on low speed until well combined. Add the vanilla extract and beat on medium-high speed for 2 minutes. Remove from the mixer and stir in the dulce de leche in by hand to create a marbled appearance. Place in a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. To assemble: Using an apple corer, remove the center core of the cupcakes and fill with dulce de leche toffee filling. Pipe the caramel cream cheese icing generously on top of each cupcake. Using a paring knife, gently poke the freeze-dried ice cream to create separated chunks. Place 4 chunks on top of each cupcake. Dredge the outer rim of each cupcake in the miniature chocolate chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 60247,&quot;Hot as a Mutha Pasta 1 pound habanero peppers, roughly chopped, plus sliced and whole for garnish 1 white onion, roughly chopped 1 shallot, roughly chopped 1 1/2 cups olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound thin spaghetti Grated Parmesan, for garnish Instructions: In a food processor, combine the peppers, onions, shallots and olive oil and blend until smooth.

Whisk the cream cheese into the slurry until smooth and set aside. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Combine cream, sugar, corn syrup, cinnamon, salt and remaining 2 1/2 cups milk in a 4-quart saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil over medium heat and boil for 4 minutes. Remove from heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch slurry mixture. Bring the mixture back to a boil over medium heat and switch to a spatula. Cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. (If you want to add the brandy or whiskey, now is the time.) Pour into a bowl and place bowl inside ice bath. Stir until cool. Spin the ice cream in an ice cream maker until frozen, then place in freezer overnight for full flavor results. For the funnel cake batter: Combine milk, vanilla and eggs in a bowl and whisk to combine. Combine flour, baking powder, cardamom and salt in a bowl and whisk to mix and aerate. Add dry to wet and combine thoroughly until there are no lumps and it is smooth (you can also use a blender to ensure that it is a smooth batter, but if you can&#39;t, put some elbow grease into it and whisk it\\u2026 if you can&#39;t, there&#39;s a whole other problem going on there\\u2026 seek medical advice or suck it up and put your big-girl panties on). Set aside in refrigerator until ready for use. For the apple pie filling: Stir together apples and lemon juice in a bowl. Set aside. Melt butter in a shallow pot, then add apples and stir to coat. Add liquor and quickly reduce by half, then stir together sugar, apple juice, cornstarch and cinnamon in a small bowl and add that. Continue to cook until apples are softened and mixture has thickened and reduced by half, then fold in caramel. Spread on a baking sheet for quick cooling. Don&#39;t eat too much of the filling, or there won&#39;t be enough for the actual dessert. (I&#39;m looking at you, put the spoon down.) For the chipotle caramel sauce: Combine sugar, lemon juice and 1/2 cup water in a 2-quart pot thoroughly and clean down sides with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystallization. Bring to a boil and let it cook until medium amber color (don&#39;t touch it, don&#39;t stir it, don&#39;t even look at it sideways, or it will know and it will crystallize on you. Seriously though). Remove from heat and slowly whisk in heavy cream (it will steam and bubble and you should watch yourself or be scarred 4evah, hot sugar is no joke). Whisk in butter, chipotle, vanilla and salt until combined and smooth. To finish: Preheat oil to 370 degrees F in a deep-fryer. Lay a flour tortilla flat on a surface, then use a pastry brush to brush the entire outer edge with the funnel cake batter. Fill with 2 scoops apple pie filling, (don&#39;t be greedy or it won&#39;t roll and close) then roll up tight. Drop the whole thing in a shallow bowl of funnel cake batter and completely coat the entire baby burrito. Use tongs to gently place the battered rolled burrito in the fryer. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove and place on a tray lined with paper towels. Place cooked pie in a serving dish and top with a generous scoop of cinnamon ice cream and a nice drizzle of chipotle caramel (don&#39;t be stingy). Now shove a bite in your piehole!

Add the onion, garlic, ginger, and jalapeno and cook, stirring, until browned, about 12 minutes. Lower the heat to medium, stir in the coriander, cumin, and turmeric, cook until fragrant, stirring, for 45 seconds. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute more. Pour in the broth and bring to a boil while whisking constantly. Add the lentils to the thickened broth, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, until very tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. When the lentil mixture has cooled, stir in the cilantro. Working in batches, transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth, or puree with an immersion blender. Return the puree to the pot and reheat over medium heat. Whisk the coconut milk, lemon juice, salt, and season with pepper to taste. Divide among warm soup bowls and garnish with the coriander sprigs. Serve immediately with the lemon wedges. Cook&#39;s Note: If making the soup in advance, adjust it&#39;s consistency when re-heating with water or broth, since it has a tendency to thicken as it sits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 60253,&quot;Slow Cooker Irish Oatmeal with Bananas and Berries 1 1/2 cups steel-cut oats 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3 medium-size ripe bananas, mashed, plus more for topping Fresh berries, for topping Instructions: Combine the oats, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon and bananas with 5 1/2 cups water in the slow cooker.

Marinate for at least 1 hour at room temperature or, refrigerated, overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and set a baking sheet fitted with a rack on the middle shelf. Meanwhile, prepare the chicken coating: Combine the 1 1/2 cups flour, the ground crackers, 1 3/4 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and the paprika in a large bowl. One at a time, take the chicken pieces from the buttermilk and dunk them in the flour dredge, pressing hard to make the coating adhere to every spot. Set aside on a plate. In a large, high-sided cast-iron pan, add lard or oil to a depth of 1 inch. Heat over medium-high heat until a droplet of water sprinkled on the surface sizzles loudly. Give the chicken pieces a fresh roll in the flour mixture if they&#39;ve absorbed it, and add as many pieces of the dark meat (thighs, wings, and drumsticks) as will fit comfortably in the pan. Fry, turning as needed, until all sides turn dark golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the cooked chicken to the baking sheet in the oven. Continue frying the rest, saving the white breast meat until last, and being careful not to burn the residue forming at the bottom the pan; that&#39;s your gravy base. When it is browned, add the chicken to the baking sheet. (Ideally the dark meat should bake in the oven for about 20 minutes and the light meat for about 10 minutes, until cooked through.) Pour off most of the fat in the pan, leaving 2 tablespoons of oil and the brown sludge at the bottom of the pan. (But if any of it looks burnt, discard that as well, because that is the base of your gravy.) Let the pan cool down for a minute. Then add the remaining 3 garlic cloves and the sage, and fry for 1 minute. Add the remaining 5 teaspoons flour and cook, stirring, until the mixture is smooth and light brown, about 2 minutes. Add the stock and whisk until smooth. Cook the gravy over low heat until it thickens softly, about 5 minutes. Season the gravy with salt and pepper to taste, remove the garlic and sage, and pour it into a spouted pitcher to pass behind the hot chicken and the mashed potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 60255,&quot;Border Grill&#39;s Sultry Oyster and Clam Martini 1 tablespoon lime juice 2 ripe Roma tomatoes 1/2 teaspoon diced pickled chipotles 2 to 3 dashes hot sauce 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar Salt and pepper, to taste 4 shucked oysters 4 shucked clams 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro 1 tablespoon diced sweet red pepper 1 tablespoon diced yellow pepper 1 tablespoon diced poblano 1-ounce vodka 1 teaspoon olive oil 1 teaspoon chopped shallots 1 teaspoon chopped chipotles (canned) Lime wedges Pearl onions Strips of serrano cl Instructions: Puree all of the spicy cocktail ingredients in a blender.

Place one half on the rolling mat. Wet fingers and palms with rice vinegar and place about 1/2 cup rice on nori, spreading it evenly and flat, and leaving a blank strip at the top of the nori about 1/2-inch wide. (Optional: Smear a line of wasabi evenly across the rice a little below the center.) Place fillings of choice evenly across the rice a little below the center (or on the line of wasabi). Lift the end of the mat closest to you, and press down on the rolling mat to stabilize. Roll the mat almost one complete turn, making sure it does not become part of the roll and that the nori goes under the rice. Roll in the shape of a cylinder.<br> Cut each roll into 4 or 6 equal slices, dampening the cutting knife between each slice by running it across a cloth dampened with rice vinegar. Rinse rice in water until the water runs clear and then drain in a colander for 1 hour. Place the drained rice in a rice cooker or in a pot with a tight-fitting lid and add 4 cups water. Over medium heat, cover and bring the water to a boil. Boil for about 2 minutes, reduce heat and allow to simmer for another 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook for about 15 minutes, or until water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, remove lid, and place a towel over pot. Replace lid and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.<br> While the rice cooks, combine vinegar, sugar and remaining 1/4 cup water in a saucepan. Heat over low temperatures, stirring, until sugar and salt dissolve. Let cool.<br> Empty rice into a hangiri (or other nonmetallic) tub and spread it evenly over the bottom with a shamoji (or large wooden spoon). Run the spatula through the rice in slicing motions to separate the grains. While doing this, slowly add vinegar mixture. Add only as much as is necessary; the rice should not be mushy. If you have help, fan the rice with an uchiwa (fan) during the cooling and mixing procedures.<br> Do not refrigerate the rice. Keep it in the tub covered with a clean cloth until ready to use. The rice will last one day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 60289,&quot;Lemon Confit 3 organic lemons, skin scrubbed well Kosher salt 4 peppercorns 1/2 lemon, juiced Instructions: Place the lemons, 2 to 3 tablespoons salt, peppercorns, and lemon juice in a quart jar and cover with water.

Add the butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Whisk the egg yolk with 1/4 cup ice water; add 2 tablespoons to the food processor and pulse a couple of times. Add the remaining egg mixture and pulse a few more times until the dough just comes together but is still crumbly. Turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap; shape into a disk and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. Put a baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 425 degrees F for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers or a fork. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Whisk the eggs, brown sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla and butter extracts, lemon juice, salt, pecans and toffee bits in a large bowl until combined. Pour the filling into the chilled crust. Transfer the pie to the hot baking sheet and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until the crust is deep golden and the filling is set around the edge but still jiggly in the center, 55 minutes to 1 hour. (Tent the crust with foil if it browns too quickly.)

Lay the leaves on top of each other, roll them up and slice as thinly as possible. You should end up with 1 - 2 mm strips of cabbage. If using kale, strip the curly leaves from the stems and break them into small pieces. If using dried seaweed, separate it into strands following the line of the \\hair\\ and then cut it into 1/6-in (5m) pieces. Put the peanuts in a seasoned wok with the cooking oil and heat gently to 260 - 275 degrees F (130 - 140 degrees C) until there is a gentle fizzing around the nuts -- it&#39;s easiest to use a thermometer for this. Deep-fry at this temperature for 15 - 20 minutes, until the nuts are glossy, crisp and fragrant (if you taste one, carefully, you will be able to tell when it has lost its raw crunch). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Reheat the oil to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Add the cabbage or kale in two or three batches and deep-fry for a couple of minutes, or until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. If using seaweed, heat the oil to 300 - 320 degrees F (150 - 160 degrees C) and deep-fry very briefly until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Mix the peanuts and cabbage \\seaweed\\ together, season with salt, then add the sugar and serve. If you are using real branched string lettuce, you won&#39;t need any salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 60337,&quot;Portable Veggie Kabobs with Tangy Veggie Dip 1 cucumber, peeled, seeded and cut into thick slices 2 large carrots, cut into thick coins 1 cup small broccoli florets 8 cherry tomatoes 4 wooden or metal skewers 1 package Hidden Valley?

Add the warm water into a small mixing bowl or a standard 2 cup measure, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let stand until the yeast softens, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix slightly to dissolve yeast and allow it to proof for another 15 minutes in a warm spot in the kitchen. Add the room temperature water and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the yeast mixture and stir to combine. Measure the flour and the salt into the bowl of a stand mixer. Combine on very low speed with the paddle attachment. Slowly add the liquid ingredients to the dry, and increase the speed of the mixer slightly to incorporate the mass. Stop the mixer and replace the paddle with a dough hook if you have one. Knead until the dough becomes smooth and begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, about 4 minutes. Place the dough on a floured board and knead the dough by hand for another 1 to 2 minutes. Add flour to dust as needed to prevent sticking. Shape the dough into a ball and place in a very lightly oiled bowl and cover with a clean towel, let stand until dough doubles in size, about 1 hour. When the dough has doubled in bulk, divide it into 6 equal pieces (about 6 ounces each). Set the pieces of dough being used on a sheet pan and cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap.

Place the turkey on a rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons salt all over the turkey, inside and out, nudging some into areas where the skin naturally separates from the bird, such as around the neck, top of the breast and between the legs and breast. Chill, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days. Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels, making sure there is no moisture anywhere, especially in the cavity. (Any wetness may cause dangerous splattering.) Place the turkey breast-side up in the basket of a turkey fryer or on the fry stand, depending on the type of deep fryer you have; follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Let the turkey sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 3.<br> Fill a turkey fryer with oil according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions, following the specifications for the weight of your turkey (see Cook&#39;s Note). Heat to 375 degrees F (this could take 30 to 60 minutes depending on your fryer). Set a rack inside a rimmed baking sheet.<br> Lowering the turkey requires upper body strength so prepare yourself. Most fryers come with a hook to lower and raise the basket or fry stand in and out of the oil. Make sure to use the hook. Lift the basket over the fryer and carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the oil, inch by inch, until about half way, and then pause to allow the cavity to fill with oil. The oil will be bubbling vigorously and that?s ok. (If it starts to splatter violently, that could mean there is water on the turkey or that the turkey is still partially frozen. If that happens, remove the turkey from the oil and check to ensure the turkey is free of moisture and not still frozen.) Once the cavity is full of oil, continue lowering the turkey until it is completely submerged. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions regarding cooking covered or uncovered and adjusting the heat. Continue cooking until the turkey is golden brown, 3 1/2 to 4 minutes per pound, 40 to 50 minutes.<br> Carefully remove the turkey from the oil and transfer to the prepared rack to drain and cool, about 30 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, make the sauce. Simmer the hot sauce, garlic and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly darker and thickened, about 10 minutes. Discard the garlic, reduce the heat to low and stir in the butter, one piece at a time, until completely melted, stirring constantly until the sauce is thick and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside. Remove the turkey from the basket or fry stand and liberally brush with the Buffalo sauce, making sure to get into every nook and cranny. Let sit 15 minutes. Repeat basting and sitting two more times. Reserve remaining sauce for serving. Serve with carrot sticks, celery sticks, blue cheese dip and remaining Buffalo sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 60356,&quot;Green Salad with Dressing 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon red-wine vinegar 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1/4 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups cubed mango, frozen/defrosted or jarred 1 head romaine (about 1 1/2-pounds), chopped 1/2 seedless cucumber, cubed Instructions: Whisk together juice, honey, vinegar, and garlic.

Prepare the chocolate by melting it in the top of a double boiler, stirring until it is smooth. Add 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) of the butter and stir until it is melted and blended. Add the warm milk and stir until smooth. Set the chocolate aside to cool. Line the bottoms only of three 9-inch cake pans with circles of parchment paper, or grease each pan bottom only with solid shortening and dust lightly with flour. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Whip the egg whites until stiff using the wire beater of the mixer. Transfer the beaten whites to a separate bowl and set aside. In the mixer bowl, cream the remaining 1 1/2 sticks of butter and the sugar together until fluffy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the melted, cooled chocolate and the vanilla. Mix well. With the mixer on very low, stir in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Do this by adding about a third of the flour and slowly stirring it in completely. Then add about half the buttermilk and stir it in. Continue adding flour and buttermilk in this manner, ending with the flour. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and stir again. With a long-handled spoon or spatula, fold and stir the beaten egg whites into the batter until the batter is smooth with no visible clumps of whites. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 30 to 40 minutes. Bake on the middle rack of the oven, allowing at least 1/4-inch clearance between the pans and the oven walls. The cake will rise above the pan edges as it bakes but will not spill over and will settle back down as it continues to bake. The cake is done when it begins to pull away from the sides of the pans and springs back to a light touch. Cool the layers in the pans for about 8 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of each pan and turn the layers out onto wire racks that have been sprayed with cooking spray. Cool the layers completely before frosting. For the frosting: Place the butterscotch morsels in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water or in the top of a double boiler. Stir until melted, then remove from the heat. In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the cream cheese until smooth. Add the butter and confectioner&#39;s sugar, and continue mixing. Add the melted butterscotch morsels and the heavy cream and vanilla, and mix until fully combined. To assemble the cake: Place one layer on a cake stand and spread with frosting. Frost each layer completely, top and sides, as it is added to the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 60372,&quot;Caramel Apple Cheesecake 8 whole graham crackers 1 cup lightly toasted walnuts, divided 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided 1 tablespoon orange zest 3 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature (recommended: Philadelphia) 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed light muscovado sugar 4 large eggs, at room temperature 1 large vanilla bean, seeds scraped 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 recipe Apple Mixture, recipe follows 1 recipe Apple Caramel Sauce, recipe follows 2 cups apple juice 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 vanilla bean, reserved from the cheesecake mixture 1 tablespoon cold butter 3 Granny Smith apples, peeled, seeded and thinly sliced 3 Fuji apples, peeled, seeded and thinly sliced 1/4 cup apple brandy (recommended: Calvados) 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1/4 cup water 3/4 cup heavy cream Pinch salt 3 tablespoons apple brandy (recommended: Calvados) 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the graham crackers, 1/2 cup of the walnuts and brown sugar in a food processor and process until finely ground. With the motor running, add the butter through the feed tube and process until the mixture just comes together. Spray the bottom and side of the pan with cooking spray. Pat the mixture evenly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, place on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until lightly golden brown and just set, about 8 minutes. Remove to a baking rack and let cool completely. Combine 1/4 cup of the sugar and the orange zest in a food processor and process until combined. Place the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand fixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the orange sugar, remaining granulated sugar, and light muscovado sugar and beat again until the sugar is incorporated and the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, 1 at a time and mix until just incorporated, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the vanilla seeds and vanilla extract and beat until combined. Add the salt and heavy cream and mix until just combined. Scrape the mixture into the prepared pan. Set the cheesecake pan on a large piece of heavy duty aluminum foil and fold up the sides around it. Place the cake pan in a large roasting pan. Pour hot tap water into the roasting pan until the water is about halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan; the foil will keep the water from seeping into the cheesecake. Bake until the sides of the cake are slightly puffed and set and the center still jiggles, about 55 minutes. Turn the heat off and prop the door open with a wooden spoon and allow the cake to cook in the water bath for 1 hour. Remove the cake to a baking rack and allow to cool to room temperature for 2 hours. Cover the cake and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours until chilled through. Top with the warm apple topping, drizzle liberally with the caramel sauce and sprinkle with the remaining toasted walnuts. Serve additional sauce on the side. Bring apple juice, sugar and vanilla bean to a boil in a large saute pan over high heat and cook until slightly thickened and reduced to 1/2 cup. Stir in the butter until melted.

Remove the wings from the turkey and set aside on a baking sheet or large plate. Remove the legs and then separate the thighs from the drumsticks; place on the baking sheet. With kitchen scissors, cut along the ribs to remove the backbone from the turkey, leaving behind a full bone-in breast. (Alternatively, ask your butcher to cut the turkey into parts.) Sprinkle the wings, thighs and legs with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large braiser or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, brown the wings, legs and thighs until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add to the pan 4 tablespoons of the butter, the celery, leeks and onions, and 2 tablespoons of the chopped herbs. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables have softened, 5 minutes. Add the flour, stirring until completely incorporated. Pour in the cognac and 4 cups of the chicken stock and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Return the seared turkey parts to the pan, skin-side up, without submerging them completely in the liquid. Reduce the heat to medium low, cover and cook until the meat is tender and easily pulls away from the bone, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, rub the remaining 4 tablespoons butter over the skin of the turkey breast. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons chopped herbs and some salt and pepper.

In another small bowl, whisk the egg and mint extract and set aside. With a hand held mixer beat the butter until smooth in a large bowl. While mixing, gradually add the sugar mixture, and continue beating until lightly colored and fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stop mixing and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg mixture and beat until smooth. Gradually add the flour, mixing slowly until blended. Turn the dough out of the bowl, divide in half. Place the halves between 2 pieces of lightly floured parchment or waxed paper. Roll into a 10 by 12 by 1/4 inch rectangle. Slide the sheets of dough/parchment sheets onto a baking sheet, and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours or overnight. For the chocolate dough: Whisk the sugar, cocoa, salt in a medium bowl. With a hand held mixer beat the butter until smooth in a large bowl. While mixing, add the cocoa mixture, and continue beating until lightly colored and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.

For a spiral cookie: Put 1 of the chocolate doughs on the workspace and remove the top sheet of parchment. Brush dough lightly with cold water. Place a sheet of vanilla dough on the workspace, and remove top sheet of paper. Using the bottom piece of the paper to lift the dough, place the vanilla dough on top of the chocolate dough. Take care to line up the edges of the 2 doughs and trim as needed. Lightly press to smooth and seal the doughs together. Remove the top piece of paper. Brush the surface of the dough lightly with cold water. Position the sandwiched doughs with the long edge facing you. Using the edge of the paper as a guide, roll the doughs into a tight cylinder, 2 inches wide. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Repeat with remaining 2 sheets of dough. Evenly position racks in the oven, and preheat to 325 degrees F. Slice the dough crosswise into 1/4-inch thick cookies. Lay about 1/2-inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake until just golden - not too dark you&#39;ll lose the definition of the spiral, about 14 to 16 minutes. Roll and layer the two doughs into 15 by 18-inch rectangles, and 1/4-inch thick in the same way as the Spiral Cookies. Put 1 of the chocolate doughs on the work space and remove the top sheet of parchment. Brush lightly with a little cold water. Place 1 of vanilla doughs on the work space.

Lower the heat to the lowest setting, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft and translucent, about 20 minutes. Turn the heat up to high, and cook, stirring all the time, until the vegetables turn light golden brown. Remove them from the pan, and let sit at room temperature.<br> Heat a saute pan over high heat. When quite hot, add 1/4 cup of the remaining oil, then the zucchini; saute it for a minute to get even heat distribution. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and continue to saute until the zucchini is lightly golden brown and cooked through. Remove the zucchini from the pan, and let sit at room temperature.<br> Whisk the eggs, Sheba spice, Aleppo chili and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl until frothy. Add the feta, Cheddar, Parmesan, chives, cilantro, parsley, chervil, the onion mixture and the cooked zucchini, and briskly stir until everything is well incorporated.<br> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Heat an 11-inch saute pan over high heat, then add the remaining 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil. Add half the egg mixture to the pan and IMMEDIATELY give 1 or 2 quick saute flips to incorporate the mixture at the bottom of the pan (which is cooking) with the raw on top. Add the rest of the mix, IMMEDIATELY give 2 more quick flips, then flatten out the top of the mixture with a spatula. Continue cooking for about 3 minutes (this will help the frittata have a nice golden-brown top). Transfer the pan to the oven, and bake until golden brown on top and cooked through. If it doesn&#39;t brown on top, place the pan under a salamander or broiler until golden brown.<br> Let the frittata cool for 2 minutes, then tap on the side of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen the frittata. Place a cutting board on top of the pan, and quickly invert them both; the frittata should slide out onto the cutting board. Refrigerate the frittata on the cutting board until cold, then slice as desired. Serve with the harissa aioli. Process the peppers, lime zest and juice, garlic, caraway, coriander, cumin, Sriracha, salt and paprika in a Vita-Prep or blender to a fine puree. Add the mayonnaise, and process just to combine.

Do not drain meat, onions or mushrooms. Add the garlic powder to the undiluted cream of mushroom soup and stir well. Add soup mixture to the meat, mushrooms, and onions in pan, and add the chopped red peppers, stirring until thoroughly mixed--juices will hold it together. Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Into individual crocks or bowls, spread the frozen green beans on bottom of each crock (green peas may be substituted). Fill crocks with meat mixture. Top each crock with 1 cup of mashed potatoes, in a big dollop or piped through a pastry bag to make them more elegant. Bake until potatoes are crisp and slightly browned, about 20 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Malbec]&quot; 60443,&quot;Pommes Chef Anne 3 russet potatoes, scrubbed clean Extra-virgin olive oil 3/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Working 1 potato at a time, slice very thin on the mandoline. It is important to work with purpose here (quickly) because the potatoes will discolor. Do not put the potatoes in water because this will wash the starch off the potatoes. Coat an 8-inch nonstick saute pan with olive oil. Starting from the center, make concentric circles of potatoes in the bottom of the pan. Remember that eventually the bottom will be the top so it is important for the first circles of potatoes to look pretty. Brush each layer with olive oil and every 2nd or 3rd layer sprinkle liberally with grated cheese and salt. After every layer of potatoes, press the potatoes so they are very compact. Repeat this process with the remaining 2 potatoes. Place the pan of potatoes over medium heat and cook until the olive oil begins to sizzle and the potatoes begin to brown on the bottom. Put the pan in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and place a tight fitting lid on the pan. Drain the excess oil out the side of the pan. THIS STEP IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!! After the excess oil has been drained, completely flip the pan so the cake is turned out onto the bottom of the lid, then slide the cake off the lid back into the pan so the brown side of the cake is now up and the top becomes the bottom. We see now why draining the excess oil is important. If you attempt this without draining the oil it will drain out on your wrist and burn you. Return the cake to the oven and bake until the cake is fork tender, another 10 to 15 minutes.

Lemony Oil: Remove the zest (skin) from the lemons, taking care not to include the bitter white pith. Squeeze the lemon juice into a saucepan and add the zest and oil. Warm the oil over medium-low heat until it sizzles gently, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, set aside for at least 1 hour, or overnight, to perfume the oil with the lemon. Strain the oil and discard the zest. The mild flavor of pure olive oil balances nicely with the lemon. A full flavored extra-virgin olive oil however is too potent. If you only have extra-virgin on hand, temper it by blending equal parts extra-virgin olive oil with a neutral tasting vegetable oil. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 60449,&quot;Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4 cups cake flour<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup (2 sticks) really cold butter, cut into cubes<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 2/3 cup packed brown sugar<br> 2 large eggs, lightly beaten<br> 2 cups dark chocolate chips, such as Ghirardelli 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chunks<br> Instructions: Whisk together the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.

Use masking tape to mark off a 6-by-7-inch rectangle on top of the watermelon (with 7 inches running along the length of the watermelon and 6 inches running along the width), slightly off center and a little toward one end of the watermelon (which will be the rear end of the pig). Use the tape as a guide to cut out the top of the watermelon. Reserve the cut piece. Scoop out 4 cups of watermelon balls using a melon baller. Remove the remaining watermelon flesh and save for another use. To make the nose: Remove most but not all of the flesh from the reserved piece (there should still be pink showing). Use a 2-inch round cutter to cut a nose piece out of the very center. Trim away any ragged flesh to make a flat pink nose. Cut 2 small spaces in the center with a paring knife and press a raisin into each for nostrils. Cut a thin slice from the front of the watermelon to make a flat space for the nose. Attach the nose with 2 toothpicks. To make the feet: Cut the reserved piece of rind in half, right through the space used to make the nose. There will be an arch on each piece, where the nose was cut out. Cut each of these pieces in half, about 1/2 inch above the arch (reserve the pieces without the arch). Cut off the rind from both sides of the arch on each piece, slanting in toward the arch to make 4 feet total. Put the feet under the sides of the pig so they&#39;re cradling his belly.<br> To make the ears: From the remaining pieces, cut 2 triangles for ears, following the curve of the rind so the ears flop naturally. Attach the ears with toothpicks to the top of the watermelon on either side of the cavity, with the pink side facing forward. To make the eyes: Use an apple corer to cut 2 rounds from the remaining scraps. Slice off the pink flesh to create 2 small white circles. Carve a space in the center of each circle (but don&#39;t go all the way through) and press a raisin in each for eyes. Attach the eyes with toothpicks.<br> To make the tail: Use a paring knife to cut a thin strip of green rind 2 to 3 inches long and about 1/4 inch wide. Twirl the piece tightly about the handle of a spoon or a pen and secure with a rubber band to allow the tail to curl; let sit about 15 minutes.<br> Toss the watermelon balls, raspberries, plums and peaches in a large bowl. Add the honey and lemon juice and toss well to coat. Spoon the fruit into the pig. Carve a small niche in the back of the pig that will fit the tail. Unwrap the curly tail and insert it into the space. Refrigerate the pig until ready to serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 60465,&quot;Cheesy Spicy Buffalo Chicken Calzone Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking sheet and football pan 2 slices provolone cheese<br> Two 11-ounce tubes refrigerated thin-crust pizza dough<br> 1/2 cup Buffalo wing sauce<br> 1/2 rotisserie chicken, skin and bones discarded, meat shredded<br> 3 cups grated Swiss or mozzarella cheese 3 scallions, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced<br> 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese<br> Olive oil, for drizzling Garlic salt, for sprinkling Ranch dressing, for serving Celery sticks, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Measure the imprinted stitching on an approximately 12-by-8-inch football-shaped baking pan and cut the provolone into 2 long strips and 7 shorter strips to imitate; set aside. Spray the football pan with the cooking spray. Unroll 1 tube of dough and cut in half widthwise. Bake one of the halves on the prepared baking sheet until lightly done, about 8 minutes. (Reserve the other half of the dough.) Use a knife or kitchen shears to cut the baked dough into a football shape slightly smaller than the pan. In a medium bowl, toss together the Buffalo sauce and shredded chicken. Unroll the remaining tube of dough and drape into the prepared football pan, letting the extra dough hang over the sides. Fill with half of the chicken mixture, half of the grated Swiss or mozzarella and half of the scallions. Top with the football-shaped crust. Add the remaining chicken mixture, grated cheese and scallions. Add the blue cheese. Top with the reserved uncooked dough half. Use a knife to trim the excess edges of dough, leaving a little extra to pinch the 2 edges of dough together. Put the pan on a baking sheet. Bake until the crust is just beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and invert the football pan onto the baking sheet to unmold the calzone. Drizzle the crust with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic salt. Continue to bake until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Arrange the strips of provolone to mimic the football stitching; the heat of the calzone will slightly melt the cheese and adhere it to the football. Let stand 5 minutes. Slice and serve with ranch dressing for dipping, and celery sticks on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 60466,&quot;Toasted Pumpkin Seed Crusted Halibut 1 cup pumpkin seeds 1/2 cup sunflower seeds 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 whites 2 pounds boneless halibut fillet 1/4 cup olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the oil from the Dutch oven. Add the garlic from the marinade and the onions, and cook, stirring, until the onions are translucent, 10 to 12 minutes. Add back the pork, the strained marinade, 1 cup water and the bay leaves, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium, cover and cook at a medium boil, stirring periodically, until the pork is tender but not falling apart, about 1 hour 25 minutes.<br> Add the vinegar, but do not stir. Cook, uncovered, until the sauce is reduced to the consistency of a loose marinara, about 20 minutes more. Remove from the heat, and skim and discard fat (pork belly will render a good amount). Allow the pork and sauce to sit 15 minutes before serving; the sauce will continue to thicken. Serve over jasmine rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 60481,&quot;Raspberry Sauce 2 pints raspberries 1/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon lemon juice Instructions: Combine raspberries and sugar in a saucepan.

Add the orange slices and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet. Cut a piece of parchment into a circle to fit a large shallow saucepan. Bring 2 cups water, the honey and sugar to a boil. Add the orange slices and place the parchment directly on top. Reduce the heat and simmer until the oranges are soft and the liquid has reduced to a syrup, 30 to 40 minutes. For the rice pudding: Put 1 3/4 cup water, the milk, rice, water, sugar, salt and vanilla seeds into a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and then simmer until almost all the liquid has absorbed, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Remove the vanilla bean and cool. Whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Fold into the rice pudding. For the sabayon: Prepare a large ice bath and set aside. Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches of water and set over medium heat to bring to a simmer. In a large stainless steel bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and salt until very pale yellow. Add the wine and whisk to combine. Place the bowl over the pan of simmering water and whisk until the eggs have thickened and tripled in volume, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to the ice bath. Whisk until chilled. In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add the orange juice and fold into the chilled sabayon. Divide the pudding among serving dishes and top with the oranges slices and their syrup. Finish with the orange sabayon. Serve with Orange-Cardamom Madeleines. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Whole Almonds 1/2 head iceberg lettuce, shredded 1 1/2 cups sliced celery 1 package (10.5 ounces) cherry tomatoes, halved 1 bag (13 ounces) frozen peas, thawed 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese 3/4 pound red beets 1/2 pound sliced bacon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350F. Wash the beets and remove the stem and root ends. Wrap each beet in aluminum foil so that the opening is at the top of the beets. Roast for 45 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center enters easily. While the beets are roasting, spread the almonds onto a baking sheet and bake in the same oven for 6 minutes or until the nuts appear toasted. Prepare the hardboiled eggs by placing the eggs into a saucepan that is large enough to hold them in a single layer. Top with cold water until the eggs are submerged and there is 1 inch of water above them. Heat over medium-high heat. When the water comes to a rolling boil, remove the pot from the heat, cover and let sit for 12 minutes. Remove the eggs to a bowl of ice water to cool before peeling. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise and set aside. In the blender, blend the basil, pine nuts, salt, sugar and olive oil until combined and slightly chunky. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, sour cream and red wine vinegar with 1/2 teaspoon salt. The 7 layers: (1) In a large glass (or trifle) dish, combine the iceberg lettuce and celery slices. Gently push this mixture back from the sides to arrange the eggs so that the yolks are facing outward and the eggs \\standing up\\ along the walls of the bowl. Drizzle with a few tablespoons of the dressing over the lettuce and celery mixture. (2) Toss the cherry tomatoes with a pinch of salt and layer on top of the lettuce. (2) Drizzle the tomatoes with all but 2 tablespoons of the pine nut pesto. (3) Top with the peas (4), then the cheese (5), then the beets, and all but 2 tablespoons of the remaining dressing (6).

Get in the habit of tasting recipes in stages; this way if something is not quite right, adjustments can be made on the spot. Season the beef shoulder all over with salt and pepper then put it in a large soup pot. Add enough water to cover by 1 inch, about 3 quarts, and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Mix in the onions, garlic, chipotles, and jalapeno. Stir in the Ancho cl Powder. Pour the entire can of tomatoes, with the liquid, into a bowl and hand-crush until chunky; add the crushed tomatoes to the pot along with the tomato paste. Simmer until the meat is fork tender and comes apart with no resistance, about 2 hours. As it cooks down, add more water if necessary. After the chili has cooked a couple of hours, take a wooden spoon and beat it vigorously so the meat shreds apart. Add the next layer of flavor by stirring in the beans and cornmeal. Season with salt and pepper and simmer for another hour, stirring occasionally. Partially cover the pot so the steam does not get trapped under the lid and drip down into the chili making it watery. In the last 5 minutes of cooking, stir in the grated chocolate. Garnish each serving with shredded Cheddar and saltine crackers. This homemade chili powder will add a smoky depth to chili and as a dry rub for steaks. Toast the ancho cl pieces over low heat in a dry skillet until fragrant, shaking the pan so they don&#39;t scorch. Put the chiles in a mini food processor and pulse to a powder. Add the remaining ingredients and buzz again to combine.

Whisk the whole eggs and egg yolk with the olive oil and 2 tablespoons water in a measuring cup, then pour into the well. Stir together until a craggy dough forms. (If the dough is too crumbly, add up to 1 more tablespoon water.) Turn out the dough onto a generously floured surface and knead, folding the dough onto itself, until smooth, about 10 minutes. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate overnight; bring the dough to room temperature before using. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Cover 3 of the pieces and set aside. On a semolina- dusted surface, roll out the remaining piece of dough as thin as possible with a rolling pin so it is nearly see-through. Roll up the sheet into a thin log. Slice crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick strips. Transfer the pasta to a baking sheet dusted with semolina, then sprinkle with more semolina. Repeat with the remaining dough. Cover with plastic wrap until ready to cook. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pappardelle and cook until tender, 5 to 6 minutes.

Combine the salt, sugar, shallots, garlic powder, smoked paprika and cayenne in a small bowl to make a dry rub. Massage the rub into all sides of the meat, being sure to use it all. Lay the brisket on a sheet pan. Light a grill on low heat on one side, keeping the other side turned off; you should maintain a temperature of 250 to 300 degrees F the whole time you are grilling. Place the hickory chips in a foil pan. Cover with foil and cut slits in the top to release the smoke. Place the foil pan on the lit side of the grill. Place the brisket fat-side up on the turned-off side of the grill and close the cover. Cook, flipping a few times, until very tender but not falling apart and the center reaches about 200 degrees F, 3 to 4 hours. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes, then slice the brisket into thin slices across the grain. Serve over buttered toasted buns or with Corn Cakes and Crunchy Slaw. Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the wet ingredients. Whisk together the egg and buttermilk in a large mixing bowl. While whisking, pour in the melted butter and stir until combined. Stir in the dry ingredients just until combined. (Be sure not to overwork the batter.) Fold in the Cheddar, corn, if using, and chives. Place the skillet over medium heat and add enough butter to coat the bottom. Ladle about 1/2 cup batter into the pan, spreading gently to form a thick circle. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip over and cook until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes more. Melt a small pat of butter in the skillet in between each batch (this will help the corn cakes rise). Serve immediately, with more butter and maple syrup, if desired. Whisk together the mayo, dill, granulated sugar, vinegar, mustard, garlic powder, pepper and salt in a large bowl. Remove the stem from the broccoli and slice thinly, then add to the bowl. Cut the crown of the broccoli into small florets and add to the bowl, along with the cabbage and fennel. Toss until the vegetables are evenly coated in the dressing. Garnish with the fennel fronds.

Let cool at room temperature. Use a cleaver to crack and remove the meat from the claws, knuckles and tails. Remove the cartilage from the claws and the intestine from the tails of the cooked meat. Cut the meat into 1/2 inch dice. You may pick all the meat from the carcass and freeze the carcass for soup or broth. Place the cucumber in a colander for at least 5 minutes to drain the excess liquid. Combine the lobster, cucumber and mayonnaise. If the salad is to be served within the hour, add the scallions. If not, add them 30 minutes before serving with salt if needed and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes before serving.; Place a stainless steel mixing bowl on a damp cloth to keep the bowl from sliding around. Add the egg yolk, mustard and tarragon to the bowl and whisk until blended. Drizzle the oil into the bowl while whisking constantly. Be sure that the mixture is smooth and well blended at all times. Stop adding the oil periodically to allow yourself time to catch up; when there is no oil visible, continue adding and whisking. When half the oil is added, add 1 teaspoon of the lemon juice. Alternate between the remaining oil and lemon juice, whisking all the while, until both are incorporated. Whisk in the ice water. (The water stabilizes the mayonnaise, which prevents separating, a common flaw of homemade mayonnaise.) Season to taste with salt and pepper and cayenne. Whisk. Store in a small container, covered and refrigerated, until needed. To assemble the roll, prepare the lobster salad and chill for at least 30 minutes. Preheat a large heavy skillet over medium low heat. Lightly butter both sides of each bun. Place in the pan and cook for about 2 minutes until golden brown. Turn the buns over and toast the other side. Or toast the buns under a broiler instead. When they are ready, stuff them with the chilled lobster salad.

Cut four large pieces of parchment paper into 14-inch hearts by folding the paper in half and cutting half of a heart shape (like you would to make a paper valentine). Set aside. In a medium bowl, toss together the fennel, kale, 2 tablespoons of the oil and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Open the hearts so the tip is facing toward you. Place two slices of orange on the right side of each heart, close to the center. Divide the vegetable mixture on top of each set of orange slices. Place a piece of fish on top of each mound and season each fillet with 1/8 teaspoon of the remaining salt and 1/8 teaspoon fennel pollen. Drizzle each piece of fish with 1/2 tablespoon of the remaining oil. Top each fillet with one of the remaining orange slices. Close the heart so it is now just a half of a heart and rotate it so the mound is facing you and the tip is away from you. Begin to make small folds, each one overlapping the last, around the edge of the package to seal the edges. When you get to the tip, fold the point under the packet. Place the packets on a baking sheet and cook until the packet is slightly brown and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. Using scissors or a small pairing knife, cut open the top of the each packet carefully, as the escaping steam will be hot.

Add the snow peas, mint, pistachios, feta, lemon juice and zest, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper and toss gently. Set aside. Heat a large nonstick pan over a medium heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season the salmon fillets on both sides with the lemon pepper. Cook the salmon until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the salmon and cook to desired doneness, about another 2 to 4 minutes, depending on thickness of your fillets. Serve family style, placing the salad on a platter with the salmon on top. Place the Fried Eggs over the salmon and garnish with balsamic glaze and mint leaves. Or serve individual portions on 4 plates. Heat some oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. There should be just enough oil to cover the edges of the eggs when they are cracked into the skillet. Once the oil is mildly hot, crack in the eggs one at a time. Cook until the eggs begin to turn white, then use a small spoon to carefully spoon the hot oil over only the whites of the eggs (avoiding the yolks). This will help the whites cook slowly so the tops will set but still look pretty. Important: Don\\u2019t spoon any oil over the yolks yet! Only spoon oil over the whites for now to prevent the eggs from turning cloudy. After a minute or two of cooking, once the whites are set and not jiggly or loose, carefully spoon the oil over the yolks. Continue spooning the oil over the eggs until they appear to be done to your liking. Remove the eggs from the skillet with a slotted spatula, then drain them briefly on a paper towel before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 60503,&quot;Pasta with Zucchini and Mint Kosher salt 12 ounces medium pasta shells 1 thick slice day-old country bread, torn into pieces 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest Freshly ground pepper 4 ounces pancetta, diced 1 red onion, finely chopped 1 large zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 2 ounces) Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Cut a thin slice from the bottom of the watermelon&#39;s rind (but not into the flesh) so that the watermelon will sit upright. Invert an 8-inch-wide bowl over the top, like a hat. Using the bowl as a guide, score around the circumference of the watermelon with a serrated knife. Remove the bowl and use the scored line as your guide to cut the top off the watermelon. Carve a line between the flesh and rind as far down as you can go and score down the center of the flesh. Use a large serving spoon to scoop out the flesh in two big pieces as best as you can. Slice the scooped flesh into 1-by-7-inch sticks and transfer to a small baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 4 hours. (These are your cocktail stirrers.) Bevel the edge of the watermelon with a paring knife, holding it at a 45-degree angle. Place the second watermelon on top to check the fit. Trim the bottom watermelon as needed so the second watermelon rests securely on top.<br> For the top keg: Place the second watermelon in a small bowl to stabilize it, and with a sharp paring knife, carve out a circle in the top to make a lid as you would when carving a jack-o&#39;-lantern. Puree the flesh of this watermelon using an immersion blender or drill technique, explained below. To prepare with an immersion blender: Set the watermelon in the sink (to avoid splashes). Remove the lid and insert the immersion blender into the flesh. Gently push and move the immersion blender down and around in the watermelon to puree the center. As more of the watermelon becomes pureed, move the blender to the sides to puree the flesh, leaving just a thin wall of flesh lining the rind.<br> To prepare with a drill: Fasten one beater from an electric hand mixer to the tip of a drill and tighten the chuck. Set the watermelon in the sink (to avoid splashes) and push the beater into the flesh. Gently push and move the beater down and around in the watermelon to puree the center. As more of the watermelon becomes pureed, move the beater to the sides to puree the flesh, leaving a thin wall of flesh lining the rind.<br> Pour the pureed juice from the watermelon through a fine mesh strainer, discarding any pulp and seeds; you should have 6 to 7 cups of strained juice. Insert a tap into each of the watermelons according to the package directions. Pour the watermelon juice, grenadine, lime juice and 2 cups tequila in the bottom keg. Pour the orange juice and remaining tequila in the top keg. Chill for 2 hours before serving. To serve: Stack the kegs. Fill tall glasses with ice. Pour in equal parts of the orange mixture from the top keg, then the watermelon mixture from the bottom keg and a top-off of cold seltzer.

Transfer turkey to a platter. Let stand for 15 minutes before carving. Method for the Charcoal Kettle Grill: Open all vents on the grill. Use charcoal dividers to hold the charcoal briquettes. Divide the briquettes evenly, place them in the dividers and place the dividers on either side of the charcoal grate, as close as possible to the outside edges. Ignite the briquettes and, keeping the lid off, let them burn until lightly covered with a gray ash, about 25 to 30 minutes. If necessary, use long-handled tongs to rearrange the briquettes so the coals will burn evenly on both sides. Place a foil drip pan on the charcoal grate between the baskets of coals. Put the cooking grate in place, positioning the hinged sides of the grate over the briquettes so that more charcoal can be added easily. Arrange the bird breast side up in the center of the cooking grate. Place lid on the grill, leaving all vents open, and grill as directed above. Add briquettes as indicated on the chart below at the end of each hour to maintain the heat. Charcoal Briquette Guide for Kettle Grill: For a 26 3/4-inch grill, use 30 briquettes on each side for the first hour of grilling and add 9 briquettes to each side every hour to maintain heat. For a 22 1/2-inch grill, use 25 briquettes on each side for the first hour of grilling and add 8 briquettes to each side every hour to maintain heat. For an 18 1/2-inch grill, use 20 briquettes on each side for the first hour of grilling and add 7 briquettes to each side every hour to maintain heat. Method for the Gas Barbecue: Ignite the grill and turn all burners to high. Close the lid and preheat 10 to 15 minutes to bring the grill to 500 to 550 degrees. Turn burners down to medium heat. Place turkey breast side up in a roast holder inside a foil drip pan. Position pan in the center of the cooking grate and place the lid on the grill. For three burner grills, set front and back burners to medium and turn off center burner. For two burner grills, turn the front and back burners to medium.
