Add the butter and pulse until completely combined. (The texture will be similar to wet sand.) Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 7-inch springform pan. Wipe out the bowl of the food processor and add the cream cheese, sugar, sour cream, vanilla extract and eggs. Process until completely smooth, opening the lid and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Pour the mixture over the crust.<br> Tear off a large piece of aluminum foil, about 1 1/2-feet long, and put the cheesecake pan in the center. Wrap the foil around the pan, folding down the sides as needed so the top of the pan isn?t covered. Tear off a second piece of aluminum foil, about 2-feet long, and lay the foil in front of you with the longer side closest to you. Folding it toward you (the long way), fold the foil in half once then old once again to create a foil sling for your cheesecake. Pour 2 cups water in to the bottom of the Instant Pot?, insert the machine&#39;s trivet. Put the cheesecake pan in the center of the foil sling then pick up both sides of the sling and bring them up the sides of the pan. Carefully lower the pan onto the trivet. Fold down the foil sling as needed so that it fits in the pot but does not touch the cheesecake. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set top pressure cook on high for 35 minutes.<br> After the pressure cook cycle is complete, turn off the heat and let the steam release naturally for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for steam release and allow any residual steam to air out. Be careful of any remaining steam and unlock and remove the lid and carefully use the foil sling to lift out the cheesecake and set it over a cooling rack. Remove the foil from around the cake pan then use paper towels to blot off any excess liquid from the top and sides of the cheesecake. Use a small offset spatula or the tip of a paring knife to loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan. Allow to sit at room temperature until mostly cooled, about 1 hour. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely set, at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Once set, remove the plastic wrap from the cheesecake and use a small offset spatula or the tip of a paring knife to again loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan. Remove the outer ring from the pan and set the cheesecake aside. For the sour cream topping: Combine the sour cream, confectioners? sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl and whisk until completely smooth. Spread on top of the cheesecake, leaving a small border around the edges of the cake.

Drain the bean sprouts and serve mounded on several plates.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 21241,&quot;Butternut Squash Risotto 1 small butternut squash 6 cups vegetable stock 3 tablespoons unsalted butter or extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups risotto rice (Gabriele prefers carnaroli) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for topping Chopped fresh parsley, for topping Instructions: Break down the squash. Cut the stem end off the squash, then use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. Slice in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds and stringy pulp from one half. Reserve the other half for another use. Slice the squash lengthwise about 1/2 inch thick, then slice crosswise into 1/2-inch cubes. Cook the squash. Bring the stock to a boil in a saucepan, then reduce the heat and keep at a simmer. Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the squash; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water and cook until the squash is tender, 10 to 15 more minutes. Use a wooden spoon to partially mash the squash, pressing it against the side of the pan. Make the risotto. Stir in the rice and season with salt and pepper. Add a ladleful of hot stock to the rice and cook, stirring, until absorbed. (Don&#39;t add too much stock at once, and make sure it is hot; otherwise, it will stop the cooking process.) Continue adding stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring until absorbed before adding more. About halfway through, add more salt and pepper to taste. The entire cooking process takes about 20 minutes; start tasting for doneness after about 15 minutes. If you&#39;ve used all of the stock and the rice is not yet al dente, heat a few cups of water and add ladlefuls as you did with the stock until the dish is done. The risotto is done when you can drag the spoon through the center of the pan and make a clean line in the rice for a few seconds. Season with more salt and pepper to taste, if needed. Serve the risotto. Transfer to serving bowls or a platter and top with Parmesan and parsley. Never leave finished risotto in the pan-it will keep cooking into a mush. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 21242,&quot;Marinated Artichokes 6 lemons, halved crosswise 16 baby artichokes (or 6 large artichokes) 3 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 4 cups plus 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 heads garlic, halved crosswise 1 bunch fresh thyme 1 bunch fresh tarragon 1 cup white wine Instructions: Fill a large pot with cold water and squeeze 3 of the lemons into it (this is known as acidulated water). Keep it off the heat for now. The cut artichoke hearts have to head straight into the lemon water to keep them from browning. Trim the artichokes: Lay an artichoke on its side and trim the brown woody tip of the stem. Using a very sharp or serrated knife, cut the top one-third of the thorny artichoke leaves off, leaving a flattened top. Use your hands to tear off the toughest outermost leaves from around the bottom of the artichoke, leaving most of the leaves untouched. Lay the artichoke on the board again and this time cut it in half lengthwise, from stem to top. Using a paring knife or a peeler, carefully peel off the outermost layer of the stem. Use a spoon to scrape away the inedible furry choke in the center of the artichoke. Voila-you have an artichoke heart! Quick, put it in the acidulated water. Repeat to trim the rest of the artichokes. Poach the artichokes: Add more water to the pot if needed to cover the artichokes. Season the water with 3 tablespoons salt. Place the pot over medium-low heat and bring the water to a simmer. Poach the artichokes for about 15 minutes, or until they&#39;re easily pierced with the tip of a knife. Drain the artichokes. Transfer them to a large bowl and set aside. Marinate the artichokes: In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the garlic halves cut-side down and sear them until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the thyme and tarragon. Squeeze the remaining 3 lemons into the pan and throw in the squeezed lemon halves as well. Add the wine and simmer on high heat until it has reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 4 cups olive oil and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring the marinade to a boil, then turn off the heat. Carefully pour the hot marinade over the artichokes and stir to combine. Transfer the artichokes and marinade to mason jars with lids or airtight containers and refrigerate. Marinate for at least 1 hour, but ideally overnight, before serving. Store them in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 21243,&quot;Chai Chocolate Custard with Ginger Cream 4 whole clove 4 green cardamon 1 stick cinnamon 1/2-ounce dry whole ginger 3 pieces black pepper 16 ounces heavy cream 10 ounces milk 3 ounces sugar 7 1/2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate 1/2-ounce Darjeeling tea 7 egg yolks 6 ounces heavy cream 3 ounces milk 1 1/2 ounces sugar 3/4 tablespoon whole dried ground ginger 1 sheet gelatin Pinch of Salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Combine all spices and place in a mortar. Using the pestle, crush them. Set aside. In a medium sauce pot, combine the heavy cream, milk, and sugar. Bring to a scald. Pull from heat. Add the crushed spices and allow to infuse for about 10 minutes. Add the chopped chocolate. Stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. At this time mixture should be heated slightly, the tea added and infused for 10 minutes. After the infusing process, add a small amount of warm mixture the yolks and temper. Add entire yolk mixture back to the custard, stir. At this point the entire mixture should be passed through a chinois. Pour custard base into desired oven proof dishes. Fill about 2/3 full allowing room for the ginger cream. Bake in a water bath just until set. Allow the custard to sit at room temperature to cool for about 30 minutes. Chill. Combine heavy cream, milk, and sugar. Bring to a scald. Pull from the flame. Add ground ginger and allow to infuse for about 15 minutes. In the meantime, presoak a gelatin leaf in cool water. Pass milk mixture through a chinois. Add gelatin and stir until dissolved. Cool mixture in ice bath while stirring. Just before it sets, pour ginger cream over the top of the baked chocolate custard. The top should be smooth and just the white should be showing. Chill and allow the ginger cream to set. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 21244,&quot;Coconut and Mustard Prawns 1 pound medium-sized prawns (large shrimp), cleaned, shells removed, tails left on Kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric 1/2 teaspoon red cl powder 4 teaspoons English mustard 1 teaspoon cornflour 4 tablespoons mustard oil* 1 teaspoon nigella seeds (fennel flower, black caraway)* 2 green chiles, left whole 1 onion, finely sliced 2 teaspoon garlic paste, made by blending 1 garlic clove with 1 tablespoon water 2 teaspoon ginger paste* (make your own by crushing or blending fresh ginger to a rough paste, adding water, if necessary, to loosen) 5 ounces freshly grated coconut 1 cup water Handful chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish Instructions: Place the prawns into a bowl, sprinkle over the salt, ground turmeric and red cl powder, and set aside to marinate for 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, blend the English mustard, cornflour and a splash of water, to a paste in a small bowl.

It is important to maintain the temperature, so you may need to adjust the heat or remove the pan from the burner to keep it where you want it. Prepare the pate a choux: Place the water, salt, granulated sugar, zests, and butter in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the bread flour all at once and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Return the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, push the paste from side to side with the wooden spoon. Turn it onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, which helps it dry. Keep the paste moving, or it will burn. The paste will dry out and leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. Continue mixing and slowly add the eggs 1 at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth again. The number of eggs used will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 2 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about 1 foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in 1 big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated. Prepare the cloud puffs: Cut a piece of parchment paper the same diameter as the pan of cooking oil. Place the pate a choux in a piping bag fitted with a plain tip. Pipe the mixture onto the parchment paper. In small 3/4-inch dabs about 1/2-inch apart. To fry, take your fully piped round of parchment and flip it over into the hot oil. Be careful not to splatter the hot oil. The parchment will sit on the surface of the oil and as the puffs fry, they will release themselves from the paper. Once this happens remove the parchment from the oil and continue to fry the puffs until they are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn them over to evenly fry each side. They will increase in size as they cook. Use a large slotted spoon or spider to remove the puffs from the hot oil and set them on a paper towel to drain. While the puffs are still warm, sprinkle them with granulated sugar until evenly coated. Dust them with the powdered sugar just before serving. They are best served immediately, as they tend to get soggy after a few hours. Jacques&#39; tip: If your oil is too hot, add a small amount of cold oil to lower the temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21257,&quot;Chicken with Roasted Peppers 6 whole chicken legs with thighs Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 medium onions, thinly sliced 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 teaspoon paprika 2 red bell peppers, roasted, peeled, seeded and chopped 2 yellow bell peppers, roasted, peeled, seeded and chopped 2 poblano chiles, roasted, peeled, seeded and chopped 1 tomato, peeled, seeded and diced 1 1/4 cups chicken stock Instructions: Preheat grill or broiler.

Position your knife parallel to the cutting board and slice the chicken horizontally in half. Using the same method, divide those breast halves in half again. Each slice should be 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Continue with the remaining breasts. Transfer the chicken to a mixing bowl. Combine the garlic, cilantro and galangal in a mortar (see Cook&#39;s Note). Grind the ingredients with a pestle until they turn into a smooth paste. Add the oil, fish sauce, coriander, sugar and pepper. Stir to incorporate the ingredients. Pour the marinade over the chicken and toss to coat. Cover the chicken and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. For the pickles: Combine the sugar and salt with 1 1/2 cups hot water in a mixing bowl. Stir to dissolve the sugar and salt, then add the vinegar, carrot, daikon and onion. Toss to coat the vegetables in the brine, then place a plate on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. If there are bits of carrots or daikon left uncovered, wait 10 minutes for them to soften and sink into the brine. The pickles are ready in 1 hour, but will improve the longer they sit in the brine. For the cilantro dressing: Combine the mayonnaise, Maggi Seasoning, white vinegar and cilantro in a bowl. Stir to incorporate the ingredients. To cook the chicken: Add a tiny amount of oil to coat a heavy-bottomed skillet set over medium high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add a few slices of chicken, taking care not to overcrowd the skillet. Sear the chicken until the edges caramelize, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip the chicken and sear until cooked through, another 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chicken. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken. For the bnh m: Split each baguette in half, then spread the dressing on the bottom half. Place a layer of cucumber on the dressing, then a layer of pickles. Add a few slices of seared chicken and top with a few sprigs of cilantro and slices of jalapeno before closing each bnh m. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21265,&quot;No-Yeast Dinner Rolls 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for the baking dish 4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 5 teaspoons baking powder<br> 2 teaspoons sugar<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 cups milk, at room temperature<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Sprinkle the meat on both sides with salt and pepper. Add olive oil to the pressure cooker, then sear meat, allowing it to brown, flipping once. Remove the meat from the pan. Add garlic, shallots, carrots and celery to the pressure cooker, then sprinkle with salt and pepper and allow to sweat lightly until tender, about 8 minutes. Deglaze the pan with red wine, scraping the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Drop in bay leaves, then add stock and tomato. Place the meat back in the pressure cooker, nestling into the veggies and liquid. Top off with fresh thyme. Seal the pressure cooker according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions, and pressure cook on high for 45 minutes. Depressurize pot according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions, then remove lid when it&#39;s safe to do so. Let meat cool until it&#39;s comfortable to touch, then shred by hand. It will be very tender and easy to do! Reserve the bones, scooping marrow out with a spoon, to be added to the finished sauce. Puree all remaining veggies and liquid with an immersion blender until smooth, then blend in the reserved bone marrow, chopped green chiles and Worcestershire sauce. Taste for seasoning. Add the shredded meat back to the sauce. Reheat when you are ready to serve. Cut potatoes into fries with a tabletop french fry cutter or by hand. Rinse potatoes in cold water, and hold in water. Set a pot of salted water to boil, then add potatoes and blanch in the water just until they begin to soften on the outside, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and cool. To make the best, crispiest french fries, you&#39;ll need a deep-fryer or a Dutch oven filled with oil and a deep-frying thermometer attached. Bring the oil to 250 degrees F and fry the potatoes 4 minutes, then drain and cool. (These can be held for 2 to 3 days, refrigerated.) When ready to eat, bring the oil to 370 degrees F and fry the potatoes again until crispy golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain and season right away with salt and pepper. Preheat the broiler or oven to 450 degrees F. Place fries in an ovenproof dish, smother with bison gravy, then top with Gruyere. Broil or bake until the cheese is just melted.

On a lightly floured work surface, cut the dough into 4 equal pieces with a bench scraper. Using your fingertips, flatten the dough pieces. Transfer 1 of the pieces to the back of a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and lightly dusted with cornmeal. Cover generously with walnuts and Gorgonzola and top with another piece of dough. Press down on the edges to seal. Using a small palette knife, cut 8 evenly spaced holes in the dough. Stretch the dough to enlarge the holes. Lightly brush the fougasse with olive oil and cover lightly with plastic wrap. Place the loaf in a warm place and let rise for 30 minutes. Repeat to make 1 more loaf. Working with 1 loaf a time, slide the fougasse, still on the parchment paper, onto the baking stone. Bake until crispy and brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the fougasse to a rack to cool. Repeat with the remaining loaf. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pate fermentee and water and, using your hands, break up the dough into the water. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the pate fermentee mixture and mix by hand until firm and cohesive, about 3 minutes. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough until very elastic and smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 78 degrees F. Transfer the dough to a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap (the plastic should not touch the dough). Place the bowl in a warm place (about 75 to 78 degrees F.) and let rise for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes, fold the dough and turn it over in the bowl. (It will somewhat deflate the dough, but it is gentler than what&#39;s commonly referred to as \\punching down.) Let the dough rise, undisturbed, for 1 hour more. (The dough will rise considerably at this point.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Press the dough gently into a rectangle, to degas it. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and yeast. Add the water and, using your hands, mix until incorporated, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, mix in a mixer on the lowest setting possible.) Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put in a warm place (about 75 degrees F.). Let the dough ferment for 1 hour. Take the dough&#39;s temperature. It should be at 75 degrees F. Refrigerate the dough at least 10 hours and up to 36 hours. When ready, it will be roughly doubled in size and have a fine network of filaments and holes. Make this recipe the night before you mix the dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Tempranillo, Pinot Noir]&quot; 21296,&quot;Grilled Shrimp Marinated in Paprika, Garlic and Thyme with White Wine Sauce 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 shallot, sliced 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 cup dry white wine 2 tablespoons heavy cream 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives, plus more for garnish Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup canola oil 2 tablespoons Spanish paprika 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped to a paste 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 16 extra colossal shrimp (4 to 6 per pound size), peeled and deveined Salt and freshly ground black pepper Basil Oil, for drizzling Instructions: For the white wine sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

While pasta cooks, you will need 3small skillets set up and a food processor near by. Set up 3 serving dishes that would hold half a pound of pasta each on a counter near the stove. In first skillet, melt butter with olive oil over medium heat, add onion, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and sweat 5 to 6 minutes. Add stock and zest and bring to a boil. Add peas, season with salt and pepper and heat through, about 2 minutes. Put in food processor and process until a smooth sauce forms and transfer to a bowl, fold in fresh ricotta, basil and mint with rubber spatula, adjust seasoning salt. When pasta is ready, add a ladle of pasta water or chicken stock, if needed and 1/3 of the pasta to the bowl. Toss the pasta with sauce. In the second skillet while peas are cooking, add chicken stock, carrots, curry powder, hot sauce, salt and pepper, to taste, honey and butter. Bring to a boil and let simmer to heat through, 10 minutes. While carrots are cooking, grind roasted peppers into a paste. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in third pan over medium-low heat and saute the garlic and red pepper, stir in ground peppers and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Rinse processor bowl and return to base to grind the carrots when they are tender. When peppers are hot, stir in balsamic vinegar and parsley and let simmer over low heat. Stir in starchy cooking liquid or stock, scrape sauce into serving dish and coat 1/3 of the pasta and cheese. Grind carrots into a smooth paste and transfer to a serving dish. Thin carrot sauce with starchy liquid or stock and toss with remaining half pound of pasta and chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 21308,&quot;Stargazy Pie Pie dough 8 pilchards or herrings 1 onion, finely chopped 1/4 cup each chopped parsley, fennel and thyme leaves 1 pinch saffron 2 tablespoons milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).

Season the dressing with salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil on the romaine hearts and season with salt and pepper. Place the romaine cut-side down on the grill and cook until nicely marked, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush the bread slices with olive oil and place on the grill. Cook until grill marks appear on both sides and the bread is crispy, about 5 minutes. Spread the sugar out on a small plate. Dip the cut sides of the lemons into the sugar. Place the lemon halves on the grill and cook until slightly charred and grill marked, 2 to 3 minutes. Cut the bread into bite-sized pieces.

If your barbie is small, feel free to cut the salmon in half to make it more manageable. Place the salmon skin side down on a plastic board and, using a sharp knife, slash it evenly all over on the eshy side, making the incisions about 1/2-inch deep. Scatter the lemon zest and most of the chopped fennel tops or basil over the salmon, then push these avorings into the incisions - don&#39;t hold back; really push them in! Rub the fish lightly all over with olive oil then season with salt and pepper, giving the skin side a generous amount as most of this will fall off. When your barbie&#39;s ready, lay the salmon on the bars, skin-side down. The esh will start to color from the bottom up and after about 4 minutes the skin should be beautifully golden brown. Carefully ip the salmon over with a roasting fork or a spatula and cook for a further 2 to 3 minutes on the other side. While it&#39;s cooking, gently ease the skin away from the fish and put it on the barbie alongside to crisp up. If your salmon is wild it will have slightly less fat in it, so will be a drier fish. You can therefore cook it for a shorter amount of time, even leaving it slightly undercooked - although this might feel unusual to anyone who nukes fish beyond belief. If it&#39;s (organically) farmed, cook it through, but please don&#39;t overcook it or it will become too dry. Lift the salmon carefully off the barbecue and place it on a nice serving platter or board. Allow to cool a little, then break the skin into pieces, a bit like poppadums. Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise, remove and discard the seeds, chop it up and mix it in a bowl with the yogurt. Balance the avors with the lemon juice, half the chopped cl and half the chopped mint or oregano. Drizzle over a little extra-virgin olive oil. Season carefully, to taste, with salt and pepper. Break the salmon up with a fork into 4 to 6 chunks. Serve with the cucumber yogurt, sprinkled with the rest of the chopped cl and the remaining fennel tops or basil. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and make sure everyone gets a piece of the crunchy fish skin. \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Cut the leaves at the base, where they were connected to the root; the leaves should be about 9 inches long. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the center rib so the leaves roll up more easily. Set aside. Stir the cream cheese, scallions, mustard, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl to combine. Lay 1 of the tortillas on a clean work surface, and place 1 of the romaine leaves neatly on top. Place 2 slices of the ham next to each other to fit neatly on top of the lettuce. Spread 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture over the ham, then line up a quarter of the roasted pepper strips along one edge. Line up 1/4 cup of the shredded carrots on top of the peppers. Roll up the wrap tightly, starting from the edge with the peppers and carrots, so the wrap holds together with the peppers and carrots in the middle. Place the wrap seam-side down. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, peppers, carrots, ham and cream cheese mixture. Cut the wraps into 1-inch pieces, then skewer each piece from the top through the seam side with a toothpick or skewer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Vermentino]&quot; 21321,&quot;Rosy Cocktail 2 ounces Gold Tequila 3 ounces cranberry juice 1 ounce freshly squeezed lime juice 2 ounces Grand Marnier 2 slices lime Instructions: Pour the tequila, cranberry juice, and lime juice over ice and shake well.

Fill each cavity with 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and re-form the plums by pressing the halves together. If using larger plums, halve them crosswise, remove the pits and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Toss the diced plums with 1/4 cup of the sugar. Prepare gnocchi dough according to the recipe without the pepper or cheese. Bring the water to a boil in a large pot. Meanwhile, on a flour-dusted surface roll the dough under your palms to form a cylinder 2 inches in diameter and slice into 24 rounds. Flatten each into a circle 5 inches in diameter. Place a plum or about 3 tablespoons of the diced plums or 2 tablespoons jam in the center of each dough circle. Gather the dough up around the filling, enclosing it completely without tearing the dough. Pat the dough between your hands to seal and even the gnocchi. Drop gnocchi in the boiling water. Cook until the dough is tender, stirring gently to prevent sticking, about 8 minutes after they rise to the surface. Meanwhile, in a medium-size skillet, melt the butter and the bread crumbs and toast until golden brown. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Transfer to a baking dish. Remove gnocchi from the water and roll in the bread crumb mixture until all are well coated.

Let sit until foamy on top, about 5 minutes. Combine the cinnamon, salt, cardamom and 3 1/2 cups flour in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Whisk together the eggs, oil, honey and vanilla in a medium bowl. Stir the yeast mixture and oil mixture into the dry mixture and then knead, either on a work surface or with the dough hook, adding up to 1 cup more flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky, 15 minutes by hand and 7 to 10 minutes by mixer. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. For the filling: Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and roll it out, dusting with flour as needed to prevent sticking, into an 18-by-12-inch rectangle. Spread it with the apple butter and sprinkle with the cinnamon and almond paste. Roll up tightly starting from a long end (so that it results in an 18-inch-long roll), and pinch the edges to seal. Cut into 12 rolls and place in the prepared baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. (Or cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then go right to preheating the oven.) When ready to bake, remove the rolls from the refrigerator and loosen the plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature until puffy, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Beat the egg with a splash of water in a cup. Remove the plastic wrap from the baking dish and brush the rolls with the egg wash. Bake until the rolls are lightly browned and have an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, 35 to 40 minutes. For the frosting: Meanwhile, blend the blanched almonds in a food processor, scraping the sides occasionally, until creamy and spreadable, 5 to 10 minutes.

Make sure the whipping attachments are clean and then whip the remaining 2 cups cream with the sugar and vanilla until slightly stiff peaks form. Gently fold some of the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture to lighten it up. Then add the peanut butter mixture back into the whipped cream in 3 parts, gently folding until combined, trying to keep it light and fluffy, and then set aside. In a 9-inch springform pan, arrange a layer of cookies (about 16) overlapping in a circle, covering the entire surface. Spread a layer of whipped cream over the cookies, making sure all the cookies are covered, and top with banana slices. Repeat with the remaining cookies, whipped cream and banana slices, making 5 layers total and finishing with a layer of whipped cream on top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. Cook&#39;s Note: Using a baby off-set spatula is a great tool to help smooth out the peanut butter whipped cream in your springform pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 21354,&quot;Dill Hummus and Toasted Pita Wedges 2 (16-ounce) cans garbanzo beans, drained 1/4 cup plain yogurt 1/4 cup olive oil, plus extra for pita 1/4 cup lemon juice 2 tablespoons freshly chopped dill leaves, plus extra for garnish 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 teaspoons hot paprika, plus extra for garnish Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 pita pockets Instructions: Special Equipment: Food processor Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Brush the cakes with the pineapple juice, letting it soak into the holes; set aside. Make the filling: Bring the dried pineapple, pineapple juice, cream of coconut and 1/2 cup water to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the dried pineapple is soft and the liquid is reduced to a thick syrup, about 20 minutes. Let cool, then mash with a potato masher to make a chunky jam. Make the frosting: Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until smooth. Add the cream of coconut, increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until thick, 2 to 3 more minutes. Assemble the cake: Place 1 cake layer on a platter; spread the pineapple filling on top, stopping about 1/2 inch from the edge. Top with the second cake layer and press down gently. Cover the whole cake with the coconut frosting. Top with the toasted coconut and dried pineapple.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.)

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the mixture is syrupy, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside to cool. Make the ice cream cake: Brush a 5-by-9-inch loaf pan with vegetable oil and line with plastic wrap. Scoop the lemon sherbet into the pan and spread into an even layer. Top with the vanilla ice cream in an even layer. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and press with your hands to smooth the surface and firmly pack the ice cream. Freeze 30 minutes. Uncover the ice cream and arrange the ladyfingers in a single layer on top, trimming them as needed to fit. Brush the ladyfingers with half of the prepared lemon syrup. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight. Make the meringue: Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until foamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the sugar, then increase the mixer speed to high and beat until stiff shiny peaks form, about 4 more minutes. Uncover the cake and invert onto a parchment-lined baking sheet; let the pan stand overturned until the cake slips out. Remove the plastic wrap and cover the cake completely with the meringue, using the back of a spoon to make swirly peaks. Freeze until firm, at least 2 more hours. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Bake the cake until the meringue peaks are golden, 3 to 5 minutes, or brown the meringue with a kitchen torch. Let the cake soften 10 minutes at room temperature before slicing.

Pour the broth into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Put the currants in a small bowl and pour enough broth over them to cover. Set aside. In another small bowl, combine the curry powder, garam masala, salt, and black pepper and reserve. Scatter the bacon in a 4 to 6 quart enameled cast-iron pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Stir the pieces around occasionally until the bacon is firm and just golden brown, about 5 minutes. With the slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a small bowl and reserve. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the pot, reserving the excess fat in a small bowl. Brown the chicken thighs in batches over medium-high heat, taking care not to crowd them in the pot, until they are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Add the reserved bacon fat, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the pot becomes too dry. Remove the chicken and reserve in a medium bowl. Add 2 teaspoons reserved bacon fat to the pot (if there is none left, use 2 teaspoons canola or vegetable oil). Add the cl and toast the cl in the fat, about 30 seconds per side, until very fragrant. Add the carrots, bell peppers, onions, and garlic and cook until slightly softened, about 6 minutes. Add the tomatoes, spice mixture, ginger, and the currants and their broth. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the tomatoes have cooked down to a puree and the sauce has thickened around the vegetables, about 8 minutes. Nest the chicken thighs gently in the vegetable sauce so that the skin side faces up and is above the surface of the gravy. Tent the pot loosely with foil and transfer to the middle rack of the oven. Bake until the country captain resembles a roiling stew around the chicken thighs, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the sauce has thickened further and the chicken skin is just beginning to crisp, about 15 minutes more. Remove from the oven, skim any excess fat from the surface, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Discard the cl. With tongs, transfer 3 thighs to each of 4 wide, deep bowls filled with 1 cup hot white rice.

Bake until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Transfer the cupcakes to plates or a baking sheet that will fit in the freezer. Top each cupcake with a scant 1/4-cup scoop of vanilla ice cream, then place in the freezer until the ice cream is very hard, at least 1 hour. For the meringue: Meanwhile, combine the sugar, cream of tartar, salt and egg whites in the metal bowl of a stand mixer and whisk by hand to combine. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer the bowl to the mixer and fit with the whisk attachment. Add the vanilla and whisk on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, 5 to 6 minutes.\\u202f \\u202f\\u202f Divide the meringue into 3 medium bowls. Using the gel food coloring, tint one bright green, one bright orange and one bright purple. Transfer each to an individual piping bag each fitted with a different tip (open star tips, such as 4B and 822; a round tip, such as 803). Working with one cupcake at a time, remove from the freezer and pipe meringue all over to resemble monster fur, completely covering the ice cream but leaving a small rim of cupcake exposed at the bottom (to more easily move after piping). Place back in the freezer for 20 minutes. Transfer the mini monsters to a heatproof surface, such as a baking sheet. Toast the meringue with a culinary torch until lightly golden. Dot each mini monster with 2 candy eyes. Let sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 21392,&quot;Creamy Chicken Macaroni Salad Kosher salt 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish 1/3 cup mayonnaise 3 tablespoons sour cream 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 8 ounces dried elbow macaroni 1/2 cup frozen corn, thawed 1 cup canned black beans, drained and rinsed 1 cup shredded rotisserie chicken, skin and bones removed 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion 2 vine-ripened tomatoes, chopped 1/2 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded and minced Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Whisk together the eggs, milk and salt in a smaller bowl until blended. Pour the egg mixture and melted butter into the flour. Gently stir to combine, breaking up any big lumps. (Don&#39;t stress over small lumps of flour.) Bake: Fill each cup in the muffin tins about three-quarters of the way full. Place the tins in the center of the oven and bake for 12 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until the popovers develop a nice brown color, are cooked through and feel crusty, an additional 10 to 12 minutes. (Opening the oven door while popovers bake increases the chance they will deflate, so look through the window but don&#39;t give in to temptation! Finish: Remove the tins from the oven and pierce the tops with the tip of a small knife to allow steam to escape as they cool. Turn the popovers out on a wire rack. Serve immediately with Spiced Pear Jam and Sesame Butter. Combine the pears, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and 1 cup cool water in a medium pot. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the pears start to break down, 10 to 12 minutes. (The liquid should be fairly thick and will thicken some more as it cools.)

Add the pork chops and marinate, refrigerated, turning occasionally, for 2 to 4 hours. In a clean, large plastic bag, combine the bread crumbs, masa harina, Parmesan, and Essence. Shake to mix. Remove the pork chops from the marinade and shake to remove any excess. One at a time, add the chops to the dry mixture and shake until evenly coated. Remove, place on a large plate, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. In a large skillet or saute pan, heat the remaining 1/3 cup of oil over medium-high heat. Add the chops and cook until golden brown and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and serve immediately on top of portions of the Cheesy Potatoes au Gratin, with grilled asparagus on the side. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \\New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch, published by William and Morrow, 1993. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease a medium gratin dish with butter. Cover the bottom of the pan with an overlapping layer of potatoes. Lightly season with salt and pepper and top with a sprinkling of cheese (about 2 tablespoons). Continue layering potatoes, seasoning, and cheese, ending with the remaining cheese on top. Pour the cream over the potatoes, pressing lightly with your hands to cover the potatoes with cream. Cover with aluminum foil and bake until the cheese is absorbed into the potatoes and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife, about 50 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the mixture is bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest 10 minutes before cutting into portions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 21411,&quot;Chicken in a Pot, No Pie 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 turn of the pan 2 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces 2 starchy potatoes, skin left on and diced (recommended: Idaho) 1 medium onion, chopped 2 ribs celery with leafy green tops, finely chopped 2 carrots, peeled and diced 1 bay leaf, fresh or dried Salt and pepper 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup dry white wine, eyeball it 5 cups chicken stock 1 1/2 pounds chicken tenders, chopped 1 small bunch pencil asparagus, trimmed of woody ends and cut into 2-inch pieces 1 cup frozen peas, a couple of handfuls 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh tarragon, 4 to 5 sprigs, chopped Serve with crusty whole-grain bread - a lot easier than making pastry!

Add the cream of tartar, lemon juice, zest, and vanilla extract; continue to whip until the whites hold soft peaks. Sift the cake flour, sugar, and salt, together; gently fold the dry ingredients into the whites with a rubber spatula. Take 2 (6-ounce) ramekins and put 10 raspberries in the bottom of each. Spoon the batter into the ramekins and set them in a bamboo steamer with a lid. Heat 2-inches of water in a wok over medium flame, set the steamer in the wok and steam the custard for 15 to 20 minutes. Run a thin knife around edges of the ramekins and turn upside down onto plates. Garnish with raspberries, mint, and a dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar. VARIATION: To steam the custard at the same time as the Black Bass in Miso Soup entree, simply prepare the batter before assembling the steamers. Wrap the ramekins in plastic wrap (so they won&#39;t smell of fish) and put them in the top tier of the bamboo steamer. Steam everything together as directed in the recipe. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 21416,&quot;Twice Grilled Peppers with Buffalo Mozzarella and Caper-Basil Vinaigrette 3 red bell peppers 3 yellow bell peppers 3 orange bell peppers 3 tablespoons olive oil 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Italian or French bread, thinly sliced and grilled 1 pound buffalo mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices Fresh basil leaves, for garnish 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 clove garlic, finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup pure olive oil 2 tablespoons capers, drained 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves Instructions: Heat your grill to high.

For the sauce: Cook the pasta for half the recommended cooking time; the pasta should still be very firm. In a skillet, cook the garlic in the butter and olive oil for a few minutes, and then pour in the wine. Allow this to reduce for a couple of minutes, and then pour in the tomatoes. Stir the mixture together, season with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes, and allow to cook for 10 minutes. For the seafood: In a separate skillet, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Sear the scallops, then the shrimp, until they&#39;re nice and black/brown. Meanwhile, grab 2 large sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil and overlap them in a platter with a little depth. It should be large enough to hold the entire pasta dish. Mix the drained pasta with the sauce and tip it onto the foil. Then arrange the sauteed seafood on top. Tightly wrap the foil into a package. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and keep warm until serving. To serve: Open the foil package right before serving. Drizzle warm cream over the top and sprinkle with torn basil and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 21419,&quot;Chicken Etouffee 1 (4-pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces Salt Cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 8 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 cup flour 1 cup finely diced yellow onion 1/2 cup finely chopped celery 1/2 cup finely chopped bell pepper 2 bay leaves 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 bottle dark lager or amber beer 1 quart cold chicken stock 2 teaspoons brown sugar 1/4 cup hot sauce 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce 1/4 cup chopped parsley Instructions: Season the chicken pieces with salt and cayenne pepper. Heat the oil in a large dutch oven over medium high heat and sear chicken pieces on both sides until golden brown. Remove to a platter and reserve. Add butter to pan and when melted, add flour, and stir to combine well. Continue to cook roux, stirring constantly, until chocolate brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.

Add garlic and cook another 2 minutes, then add the beer and stir well to loosen any brown bits from pan bottom. Add the stock, brown sugar, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine well. Bring to a boil, return chicken pieces to the pot, and simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes, until chicken is very tender. Remove chicken pieces to a platter and when cool enough to handle, remove chicken meat from the bones. Return chicken meat to etouffee and continue to cook another 30 minutes, until sauce is thickened and flavorful and chicken is beginning to fall apart. Add chopped parsley and stir well to combine.

To cut the flesh off the pit, stand a mango on one end and slice the flesh from one side of the pit. Turn the mango around and slice the flesh off the other side. You&#39;ll be able to get a couple thin slices of flesh off the pit on each end. Cut the large pieces into long 1/2-inch-wide \\fingers.\\ Salad: In pointed Sno-Cone cups (you&#39;ll need a snow-cone holder or a glass to support each cup) or in paper cups or glasses, combine a portion of mango, jicama and cucumber \\fingers\\ or wedges (they will be standing in the cups).

Grease 3 (10-inch) cake pans with the 2 teaspoons of the butter. Line each with parchment paper and butter with 1/2 teaspoon butter. Set aside. Place the cocoa in a bowl and slowly add the hot coffee, whisking until smooth. Set aside and cool. In a large bowl, whisk together the sour cream and vanilla. Whisk in the cooled coffee mixture. Sift the flour, baking soda, and baking powder together onto a sheet of waxed paper or into a bowl. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the remaining pound butter and the sugar. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. On low speed, add the flour mixture alternately with the coffee-sour cream mixture. Beat until glossy. Divide the batter among the 3 prepared pans. Bake a cake tester comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool completely in the pans on a wire rack. Remove the cakes from the pans and peel off the parchment paper. Using a long serrated knife, trim off the rounded top from each to make a flat surface. Place the first cake layer on a cake plate or stand. Spread about 1 1/2 cups of the chocolate icing across the top, out to the edge of the cake, and sprinkle with about 3/4 cup crushed butter toffee. Repeat with the second layer and another 1 1/2 cups icing and 3/4 cup crushed toffee. Place the third layer upside-down on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining icing, and press the remaining crushed toffee onto the sides and top of the cake. Serve. Combine the cream, butter, cocoa, and corn syrup in a large saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat. Put the chopped chocolate in a large bowl. Add the hot cream mixture and let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Add the vanilla and almond extracts and whisk to blend. Cover and refrigerate until needed. (The icing will keep refrigerated for up to 3 days.) Line a baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Combine the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cream in a medium heavy saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Continue to cook until the mixture reaches 300 degrees F, or the hard-crack stage (a drop of boiling syrup immersed in cold water crackles). Remove from the heat, add the vanilla, and stir. Pour onto the prepared sheet and let cool completely. Crack the toffee into large shards with a rolling pin. Place the pieces in a large deep pot and break into smaller pieces with the end of the rolling pin. Store in an airtight container until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 21424,&quot;Chicken Parmesan Meatballs with Soft Polenta 1 1/2 pounds ground chicken 1 cup whole-milk ricotta cheese 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 2 cloves garlic, grated 1 large egg 1/2 medium yellow onion, grated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil, for the pan 2 cloves garlic, sliced 1 sprig fresh oregano 1/2 medium yellow onion, diced One 28-ounce can tomato puree Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces sliced fresh mozzarella Soft Polenta, recipe follows 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan Torn fresh basil leaves, for serving, optional Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 cup yellow cornmeal or polenta 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Prepare a grill for indirect heat. If using a charcoal grill, build hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. For the meatballs: Combine the ground chicken, ricotta, Parmesan, breadcrumbs, parsley, nutmeg, garlic, egg and onion in a medium bowl until just mixed. Do not overwork. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture into 8 portions and roll into balls.<br> Heat a cast-iron pan on the hot side of the grill until nice and hot. Brush the pan with enough olive oil to liberally coat the surface, about 3 tablespoons. Place the meatballs in the pan and cook, flipping them, until all sides are caramelized, about 3 minutes. Move the pan to the indirect-heat side of the grill and cover the grill. Cook for 5 minutes. For the sauce: Add the garlic, oregano and onion to the pan with the meatballs and saute until the onions begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the meatballs, then add the tomato puree and 1/2 cup water. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the grill and continue to cook until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is reduced slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. For topping and serving: Top the meatballs with the mozzarella, cover the grill and cook until the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Discard the oregano sprig. Spoon the meatballs on top of the Soft Polenta. Spoon any remaining sauce over top and serve topped with the Parmesan and basil if using.<br> (Alternatively, you can cook the meatballs and the sauce as directed in a cast-iron skillet on the stovetop over medium heat, then transfer the skillet to a 400 degrees F oven for 10 to 15 minutes before melting the cheese.) Add 4 1/2 cups water, 1 tablespoon salt and the olive oil to a medium saucepot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk in the cornmeal in a steady stream, until it is all incorporated and smooth. Reduce the heat to medium low and continue to cook at a simmer until the polenta is creamy and fully hydrated, 30 to 40 minutes. Take the saucepot off the heat and whisk in the butter and Parmesan. Season with additional salt and pepper. Transfer the polenta to a large serving bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 21425,&quot;Cucumber and Lemony Dill Cream Cheese Tea Sandwiches 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill Zest and juice of 1 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 slices good-quality white bread* 1/3 large English seedless cucumber (about 4 inches), thinly sliced Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, fresh dill, lemon zest, and lemon juice.

Grease paper and set sheet aside. Reserve any remaining melted butter for later. Line two more shallow baking sheets or trays with waxed paper for holding and chilling assembled candy and set them aside. Cut each stick of butter in half and place next to work surface, along with measured salt, baking soda, vanilla and coarsely chopped macadamia nuts. Place chopped chocolate in a heat proof bowl and set aside. Place a cup of hot water next to stove and put a pastry brush in water.<br> To prepare toffee: Place a 2 1/2-quart heavy bottomed saucepan on the stove. Place water, sugar and corn syrup in the pan and stir gently to combine. Place pan over medium heat and as sugar dissolves, swirl pan gently. Let mixture come to a rolling boil and, once boiling and mixture is clear, don&#39;t stir or swirl pan anymore. If, while sugar is boiling, any sugar crystals cling to sides of pan, use moistened pastry brush to wash sides of the pan. Cook syrup until starts becoming a very light amber color. Lower heat and add butter, one half stick at a time, stirring very gently. (Only add additional butter after preceding piece has become melted and fully incorporated.) Once all the butter has been added, place candy thermometer into mixture, making sure that the bottom tip does not touch the bottom of the pan. Raise heat to medium and boil mixture until the temperature reads between 295 degrees F and 300 degrees F. Remove thermometer from pan and pan from stove and immediately stir in salt, baking soda, vanilla and macadamia nuts. (Quickly stick thermometer it warm water to aid in clean up.) Immediately, pour candy mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Brush the bottom of a long off-set metal spatula (an icing spatula is perfect) or a knife with some melted butter. Spread the candy mixture out so that it is 1/4-inch thick. Use the knife to push the sides back into a rectangular shape as the mixture cools. Let the mixture set for a few minutes.<br> To melt chocolate: While toffee firms up a bit, melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a skillet with 1-inch of hot but not simmering water (stirring constantly until smooth). Be careful not to allow any water to enter bowl of chocolate.<br> To cut candy: While candy mixture is still warm and pliable, use a buttered pastry scraper to score the candy into 1 1/2 by 2-inch rectangles. Let set further until the candy is firmer (5 minutes at room temperature). Score again through original cuts, making sure candy is in separate squares all the way through to the bottom. ( If stubborn, use your pastry scraper and mallet to knock through any sticky, tough spots. Hit the top (wooden part) of the scraper with a heavy mallet.)<br> To fully assemble candy and chill: When chocolate is firm, pour melted chocolate over top of scored candy and, using a spatula, spread it out evenly. It&#39;s okay if the chocolate runs down into grooves in candy. Scatter 2 cups of the ground toasted nuts on top of the chocolate and press them into the chocolate. Reserve the remaining 1 cup of nuts. Lift one end of the parchment paper so the first line of cut candy bends and separates from the next line. Carefully lift one piece off at a time. Sprinkle with some additional nuts to coat any exposed chocolate. Place candy on prepared baking sheets lined with waxed paper (in a single layer) and refrigerate (covered with plastic wrap) so chocolate will harden. Once set, place candy in an air-tight tin, separated in layers with waxed paper. Although these candies may be stored at room temperature, to best preserve fresh flavor, store them in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 21427,&quot;Italian Trio Salad 1 head radicchio, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 large or 2 small endive, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> 1 head Treviso or 1/2 other small radicchio, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> 2 cups baby arugula<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Combine the radicchio, endive, Treviso, arugula, olive oil, lemon juice and salt in a large bowl.

Meanwhile, in a food processor combine the sambal, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, lime zest and juice, cl de arbol, garlic, Fresno chiles and ginger. Process until well chopped up. Once the sugar mixture has turned a caramel color, remove from the heat and carefully dump in the chopped aromatics; take care as the hot caramel will bubble up and steam. Stir the caramel well to mix in the aromatics, then return to the heat. Mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water to create a slurry; stir into the sauce. Simmer until thickened to the consistency of ketchup. Cool before serving. (Makes 2 cups.) For the plantain chips: Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven. While the oil is heating up, trim the ends of the plantains and then slice lengthwise into thin (about 1/16-inch thick) planks using a mandoline. In small batches to avoid overcrowding, fry the plantain planks until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Gently move the plantains around in the oil as they fry--this helps them crisp up. Drain on paper towels or a cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Sprinkle the chips immediately with the salt and smoked paprika. Serve with the sweet cl dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 21432,&quot;Vegetable Napoleon with Grilled Portobello Mushroom and Tomato Basil Bisque 2 tablespoons butter 1 small red onion, diced 3 celery ribs, diced 1 small red bell pepper, diced 1 pound fresh tomatoes 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 (16-ounce) can diced tomatoes 1 cup chicken stock 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup fresh basil Salt Freshly ground black pepper 12 portobello mushrooms, cleaned and gills removed Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup olive oil 12 slices fresh mozzarella cheese 12 large slices fresh tomato 6 sprigs fresh basil Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add onion, celery, and bell pepper and saute until they begin to soften. While they are cooking, cut fresh tomatoes in half, squeeze out seeds. Stir the fresh tomatoes into the skillet along with tomato paste and diced canned tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low and simmer partially covered to integrate flavors, about 5 minutes. Add stock and cook for another 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season portobello mushrooms with salt and pepper and brush with olive oil. Place on baking sheet in oven for 10 minutes.

Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment. Place the wings in a single layer on a kitchen towel. Pat completely dry with another towel. Season them with salt. Transfer the wings to the prepared baking sheets in a single layer, leaving space between the wings. Bake until golden brown with crispy edges, 45 to 55 minutes. Make the sauce: Combine the marmalade, soy sauce, the 3 tablespoons vinegar, 2 tablespoons mustard and the hot sauce in a small saucepan. Place over medium heat, whisking gently, until warm, 1 to 2 minutes. Add water, if necessary, to loosen the sauce. Taste and add more vinegar or mustard if needed to heighten the acidity. Taste for seasoning. Set aside. When the wings are baked, pile them up on a serving platter. Whisk the scallions and Fresno cl into the sauce and drizzle generously over the wings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21435,&quot;Vanilla Baked Fruit 1 tablespoon vanilla sugar 9 ounces mascarpone cheese 9 ounces double cream 1 tablespoon vanilla sugar 2 pound superfine sugar 4 vanilla beans Instructions: Simply mix the sugar into the mascarpone. This cream has a lighter texture than mascarpone cream. It goes well with almost any dessert. Whip the cream and sugar until the mixture stays in soft peaks. Don&#39;t over-whip. Don&#39;t buy vanilla essence and don&#39;t buy ready-made vanilla sugar. It&#39;s so expensive, you don&#39;t get much and you can so easily make a much better version yourself. You should use vanilla pods. Although the pods are quite expensive, the recipe works out much cheaper in the long run because of the amount you can make. VANILLA SUGAR: Don&#39;t buy vanilla pods that are dry and hard -- buy them fat, sticky and squashy. What we want to do is infuse the natural vanilla flavor of the vanilla pods into the sugar. It is perfectly fine, and obviously quicker, just to pop the pods in an airtight container with the sugar; you will achieve a more subtle flavor. I really like this recipe, though, because you get the maximum flavor from the pods. You need a food processor for this one. Put your vanilla pods in the mixer, blitz, scrape the sides and blitz again. Add all the sugar and blitz for about 2 minutes. Sieve the mixture into a bowl, return any lumps to the food processor and blitz again. (You may want to repeat this process if you want it really fine). The result will be a slightly ashy-colored mixture -- now that&#39;s real vanilla sugar! Store it in an airtight container. It should last you for ages. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 21436,&quot;Neelys&#39; Cheesy Chicken Parmesan 6 boneless chicken breasts 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 3 eggs, beaten 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons vegetable oil, for frying Tomato Sauce, recipe follows 2 cups shredded mozzarella 1/2 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 2 (20-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes 2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, chiffonade Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. On a cutting board, place the chicken breasts between a piece of plastic wrap and pound the chicken out until it is 1/2-inch thick. In 3 separate shallow dishes, place the flour, eggs, and bread crumbs. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge the cutlets through the flour, then eggs, and then the bread crumbs. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the vegetable oil. Place the cutlets in the oil and fry until brown on each side, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place the cooked cutlets in a baking dish. Spoon tomato sauce over each cutlet and sprinkle evenly with the cheeses. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and saute the onion and garlic. Add salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant and tender; about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, and let simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 21437,&quot;Chocolate Pudding-tini 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for rimming glasses 1/4 cup cornstarch 2/3 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon ancho chili powder 1/4 teaspoon table salt 3 cups half-and-half 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract Chocolate Whipped Cream, recipe follows 1 cup heavy whipping cream 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon chocolate liqueur (recommended: Godiva) Instructions: Add a few tablespoons of water to a small rimmed plate. Add 3 tablespoons of cocoa to another small plate and break up the lumps. Dip the rims of 4 martini glasses into the water then into the cocoa. Set aside. Fill a saucepan halfway up with water and bring to a simmer over low heat. In a large glass bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, the cornstarch, sugar, chili powder and salt. Put the glass bowl over the simmering water (making sure the bottom doesn&#39;t touch the simmering water) and slowly add the half-and-half while whisking. Stir the mixture occasionally while it cooks and thickens, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and to whisk out the lumps when they form. Continue to cook the mixture until it becomes very thick and coats the back of the spoon, about 25 minutes. Stir in the chopped chocolate, butter, and vanilla, and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Using kitchen towels, carefully pour the chocolate mixture (it will be hot) into a large liquid measuring cup. Pour the chocolate into the rimmed martini glasses. Let the pudding cool slightly and put a small piece of plastic wrap over the top of the pudding, being careful of the cocoa rim. Refrigerate for 2 hours. Top with a dollop of the chocolate whipped cream. Add the cream to a medium bowl and whip with an electric hand mixer until thickened. Whip in the confectioners&#39; sugar and chocolate liqueur and continue to beat until you get medium peaks. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 21438,&quot;Sugarcane Smoked Wings with Cane Row BBQ Sauce 2 pounds chicken wings (party wings cut) 1 tablespoon yellow mustard<br> 1 tablespoon Creole mustard<br> 1 tablespoon Cajun Select Seasoning, recipe follows Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 stalks sugarcane, split in half and cut into 6- to 10-inch sections<br> Cane Row BBQ Sauce, recipe follows Ranch dressing, for serving<br> 2 tablespoons granulated garlic 2 tablespoons paprika<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 teaspoon dried basil<br> 1 teaspoon ground celery seed<br> 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1 cup ketchup 1 cup cane vinegar<br> 3/4 cup honey<br> 3/4 cup molasses<br> 1/4 cup cane syrup<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> Dash hot sauce, such as Tabasco Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat a charcoal grill for cooking at medium heat.

Line a 9-by 13- by 2-inch pan or your oven&#39;s broiler pan with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil large enough to fully wrap the roast. The shiny side of the foil should be up. Sprinkle the roast on all sides with salt and pepper and place it in the center of the foil. Spread the onion slices over the top of the roast and pour the vinegar around it. Bring the ends of the foil together and fold several times, and then fold the ends together to completely enclose the roast. Pour about 1 inch of water into the pan around the foil-wrapped roast. Bake until the meat is fork tender and brown, 3 to 4 hours. Check the water level in the pan regularly during cooking and replenish it if necessary. If any juice seeps from the foil seals during roasting, save it to use in making the gravy. When the roast is done, remove the package from the baking pan and let it cool for a few minutes. Open the package carefully to preserve all the juices and transfer the meat to a platter. Cover with a tent of foil to keep it warm while you make the gravy. Pour the roasting juices into a measuring cup and let the fat rise to the surface. Skim off the fat, reserving 4 tablespoons in a saucepan and discarding the rest. (If the fat measures less than 4 tablespoons, add enough butter to make up the difference.) Measure the remaining defatted pan juices and reserve. If you have less than 2 cups, add water to make 2 cups. Add the flour to the fat in the saucepan and stir with a wire whisk to make a roux. Cook over medium-low heat until the flour is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the reserved pan juices and stir until thickened. Slice the roast or cut it into chunks (it will be very tender), and serve it with the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 21441,&quot;Sesame Five-Spice Roasted Nuts 1 cup peeled whole almonds, available in bulk foods section of market 1 cup whole hazelnuts, available in bulk foods sections of market 2 tablespoons sesame seeds 2 tablespoons butter 2 teaspoons five- spice powder (ground star anise, Szechuan peppercorn, cinnamon, cloves, fennel seed), available on spice aisle 1 tablespoon hot sauce 1 cup smoked almonds, such as Diamond brand, available on snack aisle Instructions: Preheat oven or toaster oven to 400 degrees F.

Set a large ovenproof skillet on a baking pan. Mix the coriander, paprika, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper together in a small bowl. Pat the chicken dry and sprinkle the spice mixture all over the chicken and inside the cavity. Pour about 1/2 cup of the beer into the skillet, then insert the open can into the larger chicken cavity. Set the chicken upright on the can in the skillet. Add 1 cup of water to the beer in the skillet. Transfer the baking pan with the skillet to the oven and roast until the chicken is golden brown all over and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the breast registers 160 degrees F, 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes. Carefully transfer the chicken with the beer can to a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the contents of the skillet out into a fat-separating measuring cup (be very careful, the skillet&#39;s handle will be hot). Spoon 1 tablespoon of the fat that has risen to the top onto the skillet. Set the skillet over medium heat and add the shallot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Pour the juices from the measuring cup into the skillet, leaving the remaining fat behind (if you don&#39;t have a fat-separator, pour the juices into a bowl and remove as much of the fat as possible with a small ladle). Bring the juices to a simmer in the skillet, about 1 minute, then add the cream and bring back to a simmer, about 1 minute. If the sauce seems too concentrated, dilute with a little water. If it seems too thin, simmer until reduced to a nice coating consistency. Stir in the parsley. Remove the can by placing tongs around the edge of the neck cavity and tipping the chicken back just slightly. Carefully twist and remove the can while holding the chicken back with the tongs. Return the chicken to the middle of the cutting board and carve into pieces. Serve the chicken with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 21445,&quot;Fresh Grilled Marlin and Chorizo with Crabalaitos and Corn Salsa 1 medium white onion, chopped 1/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste 6 tablespoons lime juice 2 cups cooked corn 6 ounces jumbo lump crabmeat 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves 1/2 avocado, chopped 1/4 cup olive oil 1 cup ice 2 tablespoons water 1 bunch cilantro 1 large egg yolk 2/3 cup vegetable oil 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 medium white onion, chopped 1/2 medium red bell pepper, chopped 1/2 cup water 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 ounces crabmeat, preferably fresh Jonah crab 1 envelope Sazon* seasoning mix 9 tablespoons vegetable oil 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves 2 tablespoons sea salt 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons paprika 1 marlin loin, cut into 8 (4-ounce) pieces 1/2 pound Spanish dry chorizo, sliced into thin rounds 2 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: To prepare the corn salsa: In a medium bowl, combine the onion, salt, and lime juice. Let it stand for 15 minutes. Add the corn, crab meat, cilantro, avocado, and olive oil. Mix together and season with more salt to taste. Place the salsa in the refrigerator until ready to serve. To prepare the cilantro sauce: Bring a pot of water to the boil. Make an ice bath by putting the ice and water into a bowl and setting it near the pot of boiling water. Turn off the heat under the boiling water and submerge the bunch of cilantro for 10 seconds. Quickly place the cilantro into the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain the cilantro, chop it roughly, and set aside. In a blender on low speed, add the egg yolk and blend until it&#39;s a light yellow color, about 1 minute. Keep the blender running and add the cilantro. Blend until it is well mixed, then slowly add the vegetable oil and salt. Set aside until ready to serve. To prepare the crabalaitos: In a medium sized bowl, put the onions, peppers, and water. Gradually whisk in the flour to avoid lumps. Add the crab meat, Sazon seasoning, 6 tablespoons vegetable oil, and cilantro and mix well. The batter should be the consistency of pancake batter. In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Spoon the batter by the tablespoonful evenly around the pan. Fry for about 1 minute; then flip and cook the other side for another minute. The crabalaitos should be very crispy. To prepare the marlin: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, and paprika. Season the marlin with the spice mix. Place the marlin on the grill and cook for 2 minutes on each side. This should result in the fish being cooked to a medium rare or medium. To finish the dish: In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and add the sliced chorizo. Fry until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. To assemble the dish: Give the cilantro sauce a quick blend to recombine the ingredients. Pour a small amount on the bottom of each plate and place a crabalaito on top. Spoon on some corn salsa and continue stacking, creating a small tower about 3 layers high for each plate. Gently place 2 pieces of marlin crisscrossed over each other and leaning against the tower. Arrange the chorizo pieces around the plate and serve with mixed vegetables, if desired.

In a large saute pan over a medium flame heat the olive oil. When it begins to smoke, add the chorizo, and cook until it becomes crispy and has rendered some fat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is translucent, increase the flame to high and add the Brussels sprouts and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and cook for 5 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced to approximately 1/4 cup, add the butter and cook for 3 more minutes, season with salt and pepper and serve in a large bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 21481,&quot;Seeded Challah 1 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast 3/4 cup warm water (100 degrees F to 110 degrees F) 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar 4 cups bread flour, plus more as needed 1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt 3 large eggs, plus 1 egg yolk 1/4 cup honey 1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for the bowl 2 tablespoons sesame and/or poppy seeds Instructions: Combine the yeast, warm water and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in a small bowl or liquid measuring cup. Set aside until slightly foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix the flour, salt and 2 tablespoons sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook on medium speed. Add 2 whole eggs, the egg yolk, honey, vegetable oil and yeast mixture. Mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms. Increase the speed to medium high and knead the dough until soft and smooth but slightly sticky, about 5 minutes (if the dough is too sticky, add 2 more tablespoons flour while kneading). Lightly coat a large bowl with vegetable oil. Put the dough in the bowl, gently turning to coat. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and set aside until nearly doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours. Transfer the dough to a clean surface and cut into quarters. Lightly dust the surface with flour, then roll each piece of dough into a 12-inch-long log, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and slightly tapered at the ends. Place the 4 logs side by side a few inches apart. Gather them together at the end farthest from you, pinching the ends together. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. To braid the dough, lift the log on the far right over the 2 middle logs. Then take the log on the far left and lift it over the 2 middle logs. Then cross the 2 middle logs over each other. Starting from the right, repeat the process until you reach the other end. Do not braid too tightly; you want the dough to maintain an even shape. Pinch the very ends of the loaf together and tuck underneath. Rock the loaf back and forth a few times to help tighten the braid. Carefully transfer the loaf to the baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and set aside until slightly puffed, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Position a rack in the middle of the oven; preheat to 375? F. Beat the remaining egg and 1/2 teaspoon sugar with a whisk and brush it all over the dough (you will not need all of it). Sprinkle with the seeds. Bake until the bread is dark golden brown all over, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 21482,&quot;Sweet and Smoky Turkey One 10- to 12-pound turkey Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons sweet paprika<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon ground guajillo chiles<br> 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> 6 cloves garlic, peeled<br> Olive oil, for drizzling 1 small red onion, peeled and halved<br> 1 orange<br> 1 lemon<br> 1 bunch fresh thyme<br> 4 cups chicken broth, or more as needed<br> 1/4 cup honey<br> Instructions: Dry brine the turkey: Place the turkey in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Rub the turkey liberally with salt and pepper. Place in the refrigerator, uncovered, 8 hours or up to overnight. Preheat a gas grill for cooking over medium heat (about 350 degrees F). Set the turkey on the counter to take the chill off. Meanwhile, put the paprika, tomato paste, vinegar, guajillo chiles, caraway seeds, coriander, cumin, cayenne pepper and 3 cloves garlic in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add some olive oil just until a thick paste is formed. Taste and season with salt. Stuff the center cavity of the turkey with the onion, orange, lemon, thyme and the remaining 3 cloves of garlic. Rub the turkey generously all over with the spice paste. Tie the legs tightly together with kitchen twine. Tuck the wings underneath the turkey. Add 2 cups chicken stock to the pan and tent with aluminum foil. Place the roasting pan in the center of the grill, directly on the grates. Let cook for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and add 2 cups chicken stock. Close the lid and continue to cook until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F, about 35 minutes more. Meanwhile, add the honey to a small bowl. Once the temperature of the turkey reaches 145 degrees F, use a turkey baster to add 1/4 cup pan juices to the bowl with the honey and whisk to combine. Using a pastry brush, glaze the bird all over with the honey mixture. Close the grill and continue to cook until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F, another 15 to 20 minutes.

Using a blender, mix the eggs, milk and flour at low speed. Add the orange liquor. Once the batter is well mixed and coats the spoon with a thin film, refrigerate, covered for 1 hour in a pitcher or bowl. Stir the batter thoroughly and before making the crepes, test the liquid by dunking a spoon in the mixture; again, it should coat the spoon with a thin film. Adjust by adding milk. Using at least two and up to four 7 to 8-inch nonstick pans, spray with oil, and heat the pans over medium-high heat. Pour about one cup of batter to coat one pan. Once covered, pour the batter out and into the next heated pan, pouring the remainder back into the pitcher or bowl. The thin layer of batter that remains on the pans will make a smooth, flexible crepe. When the crepes pull away from the edge of the pan (10 to 30 seconds), remove from the heat, tap them lightly or run a knife across the edge of the pan to release, and invert the crepes on a dry towel to cool. Stir the batter at brief intervals to re-suspend the ingredients. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21491,&quot;Mile-High Apple Pie 4 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and quartered 4 McIntosh apples, peeled, cored and quartered 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Perfect Pie Dough, recipe follows One 7-ounce tube marzipan almond paste 1 egg, beaten, for egg wash 3 cups flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, chilled or frozen Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Chill fully in an ice bath and drain. Slice into thin strips and place in a bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use. Leaving the shrimp in their shells, drop them into 1 pot of boiling, salted water and cook for about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to an ice bath until fully chilled. Peel each shrimp, discarding the shells, and slice in half down the length of the shrimp so that you have 2 flat, identical crescent-shaped pieces. Place in a bowl and refrigerate until ready to use. Drop the bean thread noodles into the third pot of boiling salted water and cook until done, about 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and cool under cold, running water. When cooled, sprinkle with a little sesame oil, to taste. Toss the noodles until they are all lightly coated with the sesame oil. Place in a bowl and refrigerate until ready to use. When ready to assemble the rolls, line up all of the components?the chicken, shrimp, noodles, lettuce, cucumbers, carrots, mint, and basil, in their own containers?on the work surface or table. Fill a large, flat bowl with warm water, making sure it is large enough to fit the rice paper wrappers. Lay a clean towel on the workspace in front of you. Carefully dip the round wrapper into the water, just to get it wet all over, trying not to crack it. It will still be slightly hard. Remove it from the water and lay it onto the clean towel, where it will continue to soften. Layer a small amount of each of the ingredients on the bottom 1/3 of the wrap. Start with a few strips of chicken, then 2 to 3 pieces of shrimp, then some noodles, then some lettuce, then some slices of cucumber, followed by some shreds of carrot, and then a pinch each of mint and basil. Fold up the bottom 1/3, fold in the sides and roll up the rest of the length to make an egg roll shape. Set aside and continue with the rest of the ingredients until all of the rice wrappers are used. Serve with soy sauce for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 21518,&quot;Pomegranate Pear Sundaes 2 cups unsweetened pomegranate juice ? cup sugar 2 cinnamon sticks 4 whole cloves 4 ripe but firm Bosc pears, peeled, halved, and cored 8 scoops Market Pantry?

Pour the heavy cream into a non-reactive saucepan and place over medium heat. While the cream is heating, slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise, using a sharp paring knife. Separate the seeds from the skin by scraping the bean with the knife. Place the seeds and skin in the heating cream. Scald the cream by heating it until bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan. Remove from the heat. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the whole egg, egg yolks, and maple syrup until well blended. Continue to whisk while slowly pouring the hot cream into the egg mixture and whisk until the mixture is smooth and homogenous in color. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the vanilla bean pieces and overcooked eggs. Your next step will be made easier if you strain the mixture into a large measuring cup with a spout. Place the molds on a baking sheet with 1-inch-high sides. Fill the molds half-full with the custard and set the sheet in the oven (it?s much easier to transfer the sheet with the molds only half-full). Now, finish filling the molds to the top. It is important to fill the molds to the top, as the custard will lose volume as it bakes. Traditionally, creme brulee is baked in a hot water bath to insulate the custard from the direct heat of the oven and to keep the eggs from cooking too fast, which would cause them to separate. Using hot water from the tap, pour enough water into the baking sheet to reach halfway up the sides of the molds. If you are using a convection oven, however, a water bath is not needed because the even circulation of the air insulates the custard from the direct heat. In either case, baking time is approximately the same, about 40 minutes. When baked correctly, the custard should tremble slightly when gently shaken. If you detect any liquid under the skin, the custard is under baked. Put them back in the oven and shake them every 5 minutes or so until they are ready. Remove the molds from the water bath and place on a cooling rack for 30 minutes. Then refrigerate for 2 hours (or for to 3 days) before serving; the custards will finish setting in the refrigerator. Let the water bath cool before removing it from the oven. Preheat the broiler. If condensation occurs during chilling, carefully blot with a paper towel to remove moisture. Place the molds on a clean baking sheet. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the sugar over the top of the custards. It is important to spread the sugar evenly; if it is too thick or too thin in places, the caramelization will not be even across the top. When the broiler is hot, place the sheet about 4 inches under the broiler and broil until the sugar is caramelized. Keep a close eye on the creme brulee during broiling. They are finished when they are light brown. Place each mold on a small dessert plate and serve immediately.

Make a well, about 8-inches wide, in the center of the flour pile. Crack all the eggs into the hole, add the olive oil and salt, and beat the eggs with a fork. Using the fork, slowly begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture. Do not worry about the lumps. When most of the flour is incorporated begin kneading the dough with your hands. Knead until it is smooth and supple, about 10 to15 minutes. It is really important to put your whole body into kneading otherwise the pasta will not develop the proper consistency. You need to knead! Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it relax for at least 1 hour. If using immediately do not refrigerate. While the dough is resting, make the filling: Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large bowl. Taste to make sure it is delicious. Put it in a pastry bag and refrigerate until ready to use. Roll the pasta: Set the pasta roller on the widest setting. Start with half the pasta dough. Using your hands flatten the dough as much as you can to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Run the dough through the roller twice dusting it with flour in between rolls if it feels sticky. Fold it into thirds turn it 90 degrees and run it through the pasta machine 2 to 3 times. Continue to run the pasta through the machine reducing the setting between each run. Stop when you get to the second to last setting. Always hold the pasta on the tops of your hands, palms down! If you hold it with your fingers up you will create stretch marks and those are never good. To assemble the ravioli: Lay the pasta sheet on a floured work surface. Brush the lower half of the pasta (the part that is closest to you) lightly with water. This is the \\glue\\ that will hold the ravioli together. Use the glue sparingly, if you use too much it will slide and not stick. Pipe 1-inch balls of filling onto the pasta that has been brushed with water, leave about 2-inches between each ball. Fold the top half of the pasta over the pasta balls to meet the bottom edge. Using your 2 index fingers poke around each filling ball to seal the ravioli shut and make sure there are no air bubbles. Cut out each ravioli using a fluted round cutter. Transfer to a sheet tray coated with semolina. Cover and set aside until ready to use. To make the sauce: Coat a large saute pan with extra-virgin olive oil. Add the pancetta and garlic and saute over medium-high heat. When the garlic is light brown and aromatic remove it from the pan and discard it. When the pancetta is crispy add the mushrooms, season with salt, to taste, and cook until they are soft and wilted. Add the chicken stock, and cook until it has reduced by half. Stir in the butter, shaking the pan frequently, and cook until the sauce thickens and looks velvety. Taste for seasoning and add salt, if needed. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the ravioli and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully remove the ravioli from the water and immediately put it in the pan with the sauce. Bring to a boil shaking the pan frequently. Remove from the heat, sprinkle in the Parmesan, and swirl until it has combined with the sauce. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately, sprinkled with a little more grated Parmesan and chopped chives.

Make the sauce: In a large wide, saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the onions are tender, 10 to 15 minutes, and then add the plum tomatoes, sugar, and oregano. Stir to blend and then pour in the canned tomatoes and their juices. Cook, stirring from time to time, until it comes to a simmer, about 5 minutes, to allow the ingredients to meld together. Taste for seasoning. Lower the heat and let the sauce continue to cook as you make the meatballs. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Make the meatballs: Put the beef in a large bowl and spread it all over the bottom of the bowl and up the sides a little. This will help you to distribute the seasoning evenly over the meat. Sprinkle the meat with the salt and add the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and red pepper flakes. Use your hands to mix all of the ingredients together. Work in 1 of the eggs with your hands. Roll 1 small ball (about 11/2 to 2 inches in diameter). Taste test: In a small skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the canola oil over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, shut off the heat (to avoid splattering), and add the meatball. Put the heat back on high and brown on all sides for a few minutes until cooked but still pink in the middle. Taste for seasoning and texture. If too moist, add more bread crumbs. If too dry, add another beaten egg or a splash of water. Adjust the salt and red pepper flakes, if needed, as well. Roll the remaining meat into 11/2-inch diameter meatballs; you should have about 20. Cook the meatballs: Heat a large skillet over high heat and add the remaining canola oil. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, shut off the heat and add the meatballs in a single layer, spreading them apart somewhat so they have a chance to brown instead of steaming. Put the heat back on high and turn the meatballs to brown them on all sides. Cook to medium-rare, 3 to 5 minutes. Squeeze the sides of 2 meatballs between your thumb and index finger to make sure they are still tender in the center. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to remove them from the pan and transfer them to a tray lined with a kitchen towel to drain any excess grease. Cook the pasta: Season the boiling water with salt until it tastes like seawater. Bring the water back up to a boil. Add the pasta to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally with a slotted spoon to make sure it doesn&#39;t clump or stick to the bottom as it cooks, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander, reserving about 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Serve the meatballs: Meanwhile, once you drop the pasta in the water, add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer over very low heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Shut off the heat and allow the sauce and meat to rest as your pasta finishes cooking. Pour off any excess grease in the skillet used to brown the meatballs, add a ladle of sauce, and warm the pan over low heat. Stir to catch any browned bits of meat in the skillet. After a few minutes, pour that sauce back in with the rest. Stir in a little of the reserved pasta cooking liquid if needed to thin. Transfer the sauce and meatballs to a large bowl and toss in half of the cooked pasta. Add about 3/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese. Stir in the remaining pasta. Serve with the remaining cheese in a bowl on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barbera]&quot; 21598,&quot;Baked Whole Bass with Apple Fennel 1 1/2 fennel bulbs, cored and thinly sliced 1/2 Spanish onion, peeled and thinly sliced 1/2 cup diced slab bacon 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 pound bass, scored 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 4 bay leaves 1 2/4 cups apple cider 2 Cortland or McIntosh apples, thinly sliced (peel if desired) 20 to 24 clams, scrubbed 1 bunch scallion greens 1 small bunch fresh thyme (not chopped) Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Place in the oven and cook for 30 minutes. Discard any unopened clams. Remove the bay leaves and serve on a large platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21599,&quot;Cashew-Cinnamon Brittle Vegetable oil 1/2 cup water 2 cups sugar 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 cup light corn syrup 2 teaspoons cinnamon 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups roasted, salted cashew nuts (if using unsalted cashew nuts, add 1/8 teaspoon salt with the sugar) 1 teaspoon baking soda Instructions: Using vegetable oil, generously oil a sheet pan (preferably one with sides), at least 11 by 17 inches. In a medium-size heavy saucepan, combine the water, sugar, cream of tartar and corn syrup and bring to a boil over medium heat. Using a candy thermometer to test it, boil the mixture until it reaches 350 degrees, or is amber-colored. Remove from the heat and, working quickly, whisk in the cinnamon. Whisk in the butter, cashews, and baking soda. Pour the mixture onto the oiled pan and spread it out a bit with a wooden spoon, to about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thickness. Don&#39;t spread it too thinly. Let harden, uncovered, in a cool place, 30 to 45 minutes. (To wash the saucepan, soak it overnight.) Using your hands, break the brittle into pieces.

Place the butter in an 8-by-8-by-2-inch square baking pan and set it over low heat to melt. When melted, sprinkle the brown sugar over the butter. Arrange the pineapple rings in a single layer on top of the sugar, making 3 rows. Cut the maraschino cherries in half, and place one half, cut-side up, in the center of each pineapple ring. Set the pan aside. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt, then sift once more. Set aside. Using an electric mixer, mix together the shortening, granulated sugar, egg and vanilla. Blend in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with flour. Stir only enough after each addition to combine. Pour the batter carefully into the pineapple-lined baking pan and bake for 40 minutes. Test for doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center or pressing the cake lightly with a fingertip; if the impression springs back, the cake is done. Run a knife around the edges of the pan and place a serving dish on top. Invert the cake onto the serving dish. Leave the pan inverted over the cake for several moments to allow the syrup to soak into the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 21610,&quot;Chopped Ceviche 8 ounces skinless and boneless black cod or monkfish fillet, chopped as finely as you can 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon Maldon, kosher, or table salt 1/3 cup lime juice 3 scallions, finely chopped 1 jalapeno or any medium sized green cl, seeded and chopped to give 1 tablespoon 4 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves, plus a little more for garnishing Tostadas or tortilla chips, for serving Instructions: Put the chopped fish in a wide shallow dish and sprinkle over the oregano, salt and lime juice. Leave this for 8 minutes. Drain the fish; it will have made a milky liquid. Add the scallions, cl and cilantro and stir gently together. You can either put teaspoonfuls onto little toasts and sprinkle over some more cilantro, or put the ceviche into a bowl and serve with tortilla chips. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 21611,&quot;Banana Cream Pudding 1 quart milk 2 cups sugar, plus 1/4 cup sugar 8 large eggs, separated, whites discarded or store for another use 1 teaspoon banana extract 1/3 cup bourbon 1/2 cup cornstarch Salt 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, plus a splash 2 tablespoons butter, cut into cubes 1 cup heavy cream 4 large bananas, sliced 1 box vanilla wafers 1/3 cup creme de banana Instructions: Scald milk, in a large sauce pot, with a pinch of the sugar (this avoids scorching the bottom of the pot). In a mixing bowl, add egg yolks, banana extract, bourbon and 2 cups of sugar and whisk together until the mixture is pale yellow in color and thickened. Add cornstarch and mix to combine. Very slowly pour in a little of the milk mixture, you have to do it slowly to temper the mixture, (otherwise the eggs will scramble). Once fully incorporated pour the entire mixture back into the pot and place over medium heat. Stir constantly until it comes to a simmer and the mixture thickens enough that it coats the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and add a pinch of salt and vanilla extract, then add butter cubes and stir to make the mixture rich and super glossy. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap onto the surface so it doesn&#39;t form a skin on the surface. Allow to cool. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, whip the cream with 1/4 cup of sugar and a splash of vanilla extract until you have stiff peaks. Set aside. Slice bananas and add to pastry cream. Line a small deep rectangular dish or a 10-inch pie dish with vanilla wafers. Splash with creme de banana then cover with banana pastry cream.

Bring the water to 170 to 180 degrees F (below the boil; if boiled, the ham will crack open at the joint). Cook at that temperature for 3 hours, then let cool in the cooking water. When ready to proceed with the recipe, remove the ham from the water. With a knife, remove the skin from the ham, and trim the surface of the meat where it is brown and skin-like around the shank bone. To make carving easier later, remove the pelvis or hipbone by running a knife around it. When the skin has been removed, trim off all but a thin layer of white fat from the surface of the ham. Run the point of your knife in a crisscross pattern through the remaining fat on the top of the ham, cutting slightly into the surface of the meat. This scoring will help the glaze adhere to the meat while it cooks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix the preserves, pepper, mustard, balsamic vinegar, and allspice together. Spread the glaze coating on the top surface of the ham, place it in a roasting pan, and bake in the 350 degree F oven for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F, and continue cooking the ham for 1 hour. Sprinkle the powdered sugar on top, and cook for another 30 minutes, until nicely glazed. Transfer the ham to a platter, and set it aside in a warm place while you make the peach sauce. Discard the accumulated fat in the roasting pan, and add the 1 cup of water to the drippings in the pan, stirring to loosen and mix in the solidified juices. Add the demi-glace, and bring to a boil. Reserve for use in peach sauce. For the peach sauce: Heat the butter in two large skillets, 2 tablespoons of butter per skillet. When it is hot, add half of the peach wedges to each skillet, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the sugar, dividing it between the skillets, and continue cooking for 3 to 4 minutes longer. Add the dried peach julienne and the vinegar, half to each skillet, and stir to mix. Combine the contents of both skillets in one saucepan. Strain the reserved demi-glace mixture over the peaches, and stir in the salt. If the sauce is thinner than you would like, add the dissolved potato starch, and bring to a boil. Boil 1 or 2 minutes. At serving time, stir in the basil. To make carving easier, make a vertical cut down into the ham approximately 1-inch above the shank bone. The object is to make a guard that your knife will not go beyond when you slice the ham; this will give a clean bottom edge to the slices and also protect your hand from the knife in case it happens to slide while you are slicing the meat. Slice the ham on the bias, stopping at the cut edge, and arrange the meat on a warm platter. Serve 3 or 4 slices of ham per person with few slices of the peaches and the sauce spooned around and over the meat. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 21641,&quot;Peanut and Vegetable Soup 2 cups white onions, diced small 1/4 cup fresh garlic, peeled and chopped 1/4 cup fresh ginger, peeled and chopped 2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil 3 teaspoons cumin seeds 2 teaspoons coriander seeds 3 small red hot chiles (bird), chopped 2 cups peeled, seeded and chopped plum tomatoes 1 teaspoon whole white peppercorns 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 1/2 cups dry sherry 2 quarts vegetable broth 1 1/2 cups coconut milk (about 1 (12-ounce) can) 1 cup smooth natural peanut butter 2 cups peeled and medium diced turnips 2 cups peeled and medium diced carrots 2 cups peeled and medium diced sweet potatoes (yellow if possible) Salt Instructions: In large pot, over low to medium heat, cook onions, garlic and ginger in 2 tablespoons of oil for about 10 minutes until onions are translucent.

Set a few chickpeas aside for garnish.<br> In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade attachment, combine the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and 1 tablespoon salt. Process until smooth and very creamy, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and process for another 60 seconds; the mixture should be light in color and thick. Add the chickpeas in 3 additions, processing until smooth after each addition. With the food processor running, slowly pour the oil into the feed tube in a steady stream and process until the mixture is creamy. If too thick, add up to 3/4 cup of the reserved chickpea liquid a few tablespoons at a time until hummus is smooth and has a sheen. Season with more salt if desired. Divide the hummus into 3 bowls. Top 1 bowl of hummus with the reserved whole chickpeas and a drizzle of olive oil and set aside.<br> To make the spinach and artichoke hummus: Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a simmer in a small skillet. Add the spinach and cook until wilted, about 30 seconds. Cool and squeeze dry. Finely chop the spinach and mix it together with the artichoke hearts. Reserve about 1 tablespoon of the mixture for garnish and stir the remainder into 1 bowl of hummus; garnish with the reserved mixture and a drizzle of olive oil.<br> To make the sweet-and-spicy hummus: Place the pine nuts in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Stir black pepper to taste into the last bowl of hummus and make an indentation in the top of the hummus.

Bake in oven 35 to 40 minutes or until beans have thickened and are bubbling. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 21659,&quot;Gnocchi and Pork Bolognese Sauce 2 pounds whole baking potatoes 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 egg yolks, beaten 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme 1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley Salt 3 cups Pork Bolognese Sauce, recipe follows 3/4 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon grapeseed oil 1 pound ground pork 1/4 cup red wine 1 medium onion, cut into small dice 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1 large bell pepper, cored and cut into small dice 2 large ripe tomatoes, chopped, juices reserved 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil 1 sprig fresh thyme 1/4 cup heavy cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the potatoes in their skins until fork tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and slice the potatoes open to cool the insides. After cooling, scoop out the potatoes and discard the skins. Run the potatoes through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl. (If you don&#39;t have a ricer, thoroughly mash the potatoes by hand with a masher.) Add the flour, egg yolks, garlic, herbs and a pinch of salt to the processed potatoes. Mix by hand until you have a pliable ball of dough. The flour might need to be adjusted at this time. If so, add a small amount at a time until the dough is smooth and pliable. (Do not over mix or you will get a tough dough.) Lightly flour a flat surface and portion the dough into 6 equal parts. Take 1 part and roll it out gently with your hands until you have a log about 3/4-inch in diameter. Carefully roll the log with your fingertips while exerting the lightest pressure outwards, not down, to draw the dough out, until you have a 10-inch log. The dough can then be sliced into 1-inch pieces and placed on a floured pan or wax paper. Repeat until all the dough has been rolled out and cut. (Once the gnocchi is portioned, it can be frozen. Place the gnocchi on the floured pan in the freezer and let set. Remove from the pan and place in a sealed container or bag.) In a large saucepan, bring the Bolognese Sauce and heavy cream to a simmer. Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and drop 20 gnocchi into the water at a time. When the gnocchi float to the surface, remove with a slotted spoon, draining well, and add to the Bolognese Sauce. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi. Continue to cook for 3 minutes in the sauce. Remove with a slotted spoon and portion into serving dishes. Heat the oil in a large skillet until warmed. Add the ground pork and cook until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the wine, onions, and garlic. Cook until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the peppers, tomatoes, basil, and thyme. Bring the mixture to a slow rolling simmer, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the cream and warm through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barolo, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 21660,&quot;Lekach Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Pinch ground cloves 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1 cup honey 3/4 cup vegetable oil 3/4 cup warm brewed coffee 1/4 cup fresh orange juice (from 1 orange) 2 tablespoons rye or whiskey, optional 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 large eggs Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cut off the top third of the panettone. Remove the insides of the bread by running a small paring knife around the edge of the loaf, leaving a 1-inch wall. Pull out the fluffy inside of the bread, leaving the base intact. Tear the insides into 1-inch bite-sized pieces. You should have about 2 cups of bread pieces. Place the pieces on a small rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with half of the butter. Toss well to coat. Place the shell on a separate rimmed baking sheet and drizzle the remaining butter over the sides and bottom of the loaf. Place both baking sheets in the oven. Bake the bread pieces, stirring half way through, until golden brown and toasted, about 12 minutes. Remove the bread pieces to a paper towel-lined plate to cool. Continue to bake the shell until lightly toasted and golden brown, about 8 minutes longer. Remove to paper towels to cool completely. Combine the heavy cream, mascarpone, sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl. Beat on high using a handheld mixer until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Place the shell on a serving plate. Layer in half of the bread pieces, half of the raspberries and oranges and a dollop of one-third of the whipped cream.

Put the potatoes in a large saucepan with well-salted cold water to cover them by 3 inches. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes. While the potatoes are cooking, add the peas to the pot. They will float on the top. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes, then remove with a sieve. Cool on a sheet tray. The potatoes are done when you can easily insert a knife through the potato. When the potatoes are done drain well, scatter on a baking sheet, and let cool for several minutes. Place in the oven to dry out, about 5 minutes. Press the potatoes through a ricer or food mill or mash with a potato masher. Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until the butter stops foaming and turns a light brown. Add the garlic and cook quickly until pale gold. Add the 1 1/2 cups of the cream, season, to taste, with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and beat in the potatoes with a wooden spoon or large whisk. Add the remaining butter by tablespoonfuls, stirring vigorously after each addition. (In this way, the butter does not melt into a golden puddle. Instead, it forms an emulsion with the potatoes, creating a very smooth puree.) In a small pot, heat the remaining cream until it reaches a boil then simmer for a few minutes. Add the cream to a blender with the peas and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Fold the pea puree into the mashed potatoes and adjust seasoning as necessary. Instead of salt, the puree can be seasoned with a little grated Parmesan.

Position 1 oven rack in the middle position and 1 in the top position and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the cauliflower in a small glass bowl, stalk end up. Use a paring knife to remove the lower leaves. Trim the curds off of the stem, keeping them as intact as possible. Try to keep the size uniformly large and make as few cuts as possible. Discard the leaves and stem. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave on high for 4 minutes. Rest, still covered in plastic, for another 4 minutes. Uncover and rest for 4 to 5 more minutes while preparing the rest of the dish. Combine 4 ounces of the cheese, the bread crumbs, egg, salt, mustard, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne in a large mixing bowl. When 1 minute remains on the cauliflower rest period, microwave the cream on high for 30 seconds. Add the cream to the bowl with the cheese mixture and stir to combine. Using your hands and a tea towel if the cauliflower is still hot, rub the large florets between your hands to break up the curds. Add the curds to the cream mixture and stir until the cheese is thoroughly melted and combined. Spread the cauliflower mixture in the prepared baking dish, place on the middle rack, and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the baking dish and turn the broiler to high. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 ounce cheese atop the cauliflower. Place on the top rack and broil until the top is bubbly and appropriately brown, 6 to 8 minutes.

In a small bowl, add the cayenne, garlic powder, dark brown sugar, black pepper and curry powder and stir to blend. Spread the spice mix on a baking sheet and put it in the oven for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, separate the bacon slices. Remove the pan from the oven and put the bacon slices, in a single layer, on the spice mix. Turn them over to lightly coat both sides of each slice with the spice mix. Arrange the bacon in 2 large skillets and cook over medium heat until golden brown. Note: because of the brown sugar, the bacon is more prone to burning, especially if cooked too quickly over high heat. As the bacon is cooked, use a slotted spoon or spatula to transfer the strips to a paper towel to drain. Drain off any excess grease from the skillets but leave a small layer in each pan. Raise the temperature of the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the bread on a baking sheet and put it in the center of the oven. When the bread is toasted, remove from the oven and set aside. Return the skillets to the stove over medium-low heat and crack 2 eggs into each skillet. Do not overcrowd. Season them lightly with salt. Cook until desired doneness. Transfer the eggs to a platter and arrange the bacon and the toast around the eggs.

Stir and cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let the bulgur soak until just tender, about 2 hours. Drain and discard the water. Place the bulgur in a large pot with 10 cups of water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to medium. Rest a wooden spoon in the pot and then place the lid on the pot, propping it on the spoon to leave an opening (to keep the water from overflowing during cooking). Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bulgur has completely fallen apart and the consistency is like a thick soup, 3 1/2 to 4 hours; after every hour of cooking, add 2 more cups of water for a total of 16 cups from start to finish. While the bulgur is cooking, place the turkey breast in a separate large pot with the cinnamon stick and onion and add enough water to submerge the turkey breast. Bring it to a simmer over medium-high heat, then cover and simmer over medium heat until an instant-read thermometer inserted thickest part reads 165 degrees F, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Puree the bulgur using an immersion blender until it\\u2019s completely smooth. (Alternatively, puree the soup in a regular blender and then pass it through a fine-mesh sieve to make sure it&#39;s completely smooth.) Remove the turkey from the pot, cut it into smaller pieces and finely shred in a mixing bowl using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a handheld electric mixer on medium speed, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the bulgur mixture to the turkey and mix using a wooden spoon to form a thick paste, adding up to 1/2 cup more bulgur as needed. Return the turkey mixture to the remaining bulgur in the pot and stir to combine. Bring to a low simmer over medium-low heat. Mix half of the melted ghee with the cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Add the ghee mixture to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to develop and the porridge to thicken, about 1 hour. Divide the haleem among eight bowls and top each one with 1 tablespoon of the remaining melted ghee and additional ground cinnamon. Sprinkle with some sugar and sesame seeds to your liking and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 21673,&quot;Braised Pork Green Chili 1/2 cup unsalted butter 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 gallon chicken stock 2 pounds braised pork butt, shredded 2 cups roasted, seeded and diced green chiles 2 tablespoons Cajun spice 2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves, minced 1 cup medium-diced tomatoes Instructions: Over medium heat in a medium saucepan, heat the butter until melted.

Mix the milk with the eggs in one; the flour mixed with the seasoned salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, paprika and cayenne in another; and the meat in a third. Then have one clean plate at the end to receive the breaded meat. Work with one piece of meat at a time. Sprinkle both sides with kosher salt and black pepper, then place it in the flour mixture. Turn to coat. Place the meat into the milk/egg mixture, turning to coat. Finally, place it back in the flour and turn to coat (dry mixture/wet mixture/dry mixture). Place the breaded meat on the clean plate, then repeat with the remaining meat. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. Drop in a few sprinkles of flour to make sure it&#39;s sufficiently hot. When the butter sizzles immediately, you know it&#39;s ready. (It should not brown right away, if it does, the fire is too hot.) Cook the meat, 3 pieces at a time, until the edges start to look golden brown, about 2 minutes each side. Remove the meat to a paper towel-lined plate and keep them warm by covering lightly with another plate or a sheet of foil. Repeat until all the meat is cooked. After all the meat is fried, pour off the grease into a heatproof bowl. Without cleaning the skillet, return it to the stove over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup of the grease back to the skillet and allow it to heat up. For the gravy: When the grease is hot, sprinkle the flour evenly over the grease. Using a whisk, mix the flour with the grease, creating a golden-brown paste. Add more flour if it looks overly greasy; add a little more grease if it becomes too pasty/clumpy. Keep cooking until the roux reaches a deep golden brown color. Pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Add the seasoned salt and black pepper to taste and cook, whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Be prepared to add more milk if it becomes overly thick. Be sure to taste to make sure gravy is sufficiently seasoned. Serve the meat next to a big side of mashed potatoes. Pour gravy over the whole shebang! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 21682,&quot;Blackberry Raspberry Pie Two 16-ounce bags frozen blackberries, thawed and strained Two 16-ounce bags frozen raspberries, thawed and strained<br> 1 cup sugar, plus 1 teaspoon for sprinkling<br> 2 tablespoons cinnamon, plus 1/4 teaspoon for sprinkling<br> 1/4 cup arrowroot powder<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 teaspoon fine salt<br> Butter, for greasing Two 9-inch unroll-and-bake refrigerated pie crusts<br> Instructions: Line a baking sheet with foil.

In a food processor combine the flour, sugar, salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 3 egg yolks, cold water and butter and process until a ball of dough has been formed. Remove the dough and, on a floured work surface, knead the dough for 5 minutes. Wrap the ball of dough with plastic and refrigerate. In a bowl combine the ricotta, 3 remaining egg yolks, 1 teaspoon black pepper, prosciutto, salami, mozzarella and romano cheese into a batter. Refrigerate while you prepare the pastry shell. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and cut one third of the dough off to be used as the top crust. With the remaining larger piece, flour a work surface, place this larger piece of dough on the work board and begin to roll the dough to approximately a 12-inch wide circle. Brush the inside of the springform pan with olive oil and transfer the rolled out circle of dough to the pan. Using your finger tips, press the dough evenly into the bottom of the pan, making sure that the dough has a flat bottom and the edge is tucked into the seam of the pan. Pull the dough up the side of the pan to the top edge and the dough should just rise to the top of the pan. Pour the cheese and meat filling into the prepared dough and shake the pan to distribute the filling evenly. Roll the remaining smaller piece of dough to a 10-inch circle and place this on top of the pan. Pinch the edges of the two pieces of dough together to seal the edge completely. Cut a cross into the top crust so that steam may escape during baking and place into the preheated oven, on a cookie sheet, in the center of the oven, and bake for 45 to 55 minutes. The top should be well browned when thoroughly baked. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for 10 minutes, run a sharp knife around the edge to loosen the crust from the pan, and open the springform pan. continue to cool completely before serving at room temperature.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 21684,&quot;Drunken Spaghetti Salt 1 pound spaghetti 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 3 to 4 anchovy fillets, chopped 3 dried chili peppers, crushed, optional 2 cups red wine Small bunch fresh Italian parsley, chopped 1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino cheese Instructions: Bring salted water to boil in a large pot.

Set aside to let the flavors develop. Cut four 16-inch long sheets of parchment paper. Fold each sheet in half and open it like a book. Divide the pieces of parchment between 2 baking sheets (2 pieces per sheet). Toss the corn and green beans with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of black pepper in a bowl. Divide between the 4 parchment sheets, mounding the mixture on one side of the fold. Sprinkle each cod fillet with 1/4 teaspoon salt and place on top of a vegetable mound. Dot with butter and drizzle with wine. Fold over the top half of the parchment, crimping and overlapping small folds along the open edge to seal tightly. Bake until the parchment puffs, about 15 minutes; the fish will be tender and cooked through. Transfer the packs to plates. Avoiding the hot steam, carefully cut open the pack. Spoon the reserved tomato-basil salsa with juices over each fillet and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 21700,&quot;Air Fryer Buffalo Chicken Wings Nonstick cooking spray, for the basket 2 pounds chicken wings, split at the joint and tips removed<br> Kosher salt<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/2 cup hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s RedHot<br> Ranch or blue cheese dressing, for serving Instructions: Spray the basket of a 3.5-quart air fryer with cooking spray and set aside. Pat the chicken wings dry and sprinkle generously with salt. Place the wings in the fryer basket so they are not touching (if necessary to fit, line up the drumettes standing upright along the sides). Set the air fryer to 360 degrees F and cook for 12 minutes, then flip the wings with tongs and cook for 12 minutes more. Flip the wings again, increase the heat to 390 degrees F and cook until the outsides are extra-crispy, about 6 minutes more. Meanwhile, warm the butter in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until melted, about 1 minute.

Cut the meat off the breast bone, reserving the carcass. Remove the skin from the breasts and legs and spread the skin, fat-side down, on paper towels or paper plates to dry. Reserve for Gimme Some Skin (see separate recipe). Halve a large onion, leaving the skin on, and place it cut side down in a 6- to 6 1/2-quart stovetop pressure cooker. Sear it over high heat, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Add the 2 halved carrots, 2 halved celery stalks, leek tops and dried mushrooms to the pot. Then add the chicken carcass, legs, thighs and wings with the peppercorns and bay leaves. Add the water and use tongs or a wooden spoon to push as much of the chicken under water as possible. Attach the pressure cooker&#39;s lid and heat on high. When full pressure is reached, about 5 to 10 minutes, lower the heat to medium-low. (You shouldn&#39;t hear the whistle, only a soft hiss). Cook 30 minutes. Remove the pressure cooker from the heat and release the pressure by placing the cooker in the sink and dousing with cold water for one minute. Then release the pressure lock and remove lid. Strain the solids first through a colander, then a fine sieve or cheesecloth. Return the stock back to the pot. Add the shoyu, togarashi, lemon juice and chicken breasts to the pot and bring to a boil (without the lid), then reduce the heat to low. Simmer 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, check the breasts for doneness (I usually pull them at 150 degrees F) and remove to a large bowl. Add the remaining diced carrots and parsnips to the broth and simmer 3 minutes more. Then add the remaining diced celery and leeks. Kill the heat and allow to sit for 3 minutes, then taste the broth and correct with salt and/or lemon juice to taste. Since they&#39;re so hot, shred the chicken breasts by either pulling apart with two large forks or hit them with a hand mixer on low\\u2026that&#39;ll do the trick, too. To serve, ladle soup in the bowls, top with some of the breast meat, garnish with the celery leaves and serve with chicken skin \\sandwiches.\\ (See separate recipe for Gimme Some Skin.) Like any soup\\u2026this one is better the next day. Oh, and discard the solids from the pressure cooker\\u2026they&#39;ve given their all. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 21703,&quot;Everglades City Stone Crab 8 (12-ounce) stone crab claws Instructions: In a large pot of boiling water, boil the stone crab claws for 8 minutes.

Transfer the clear butter to a liquid measuring cup, leaving the milk solids on the bottom of the pan; discard the solids. Heat 1 inch of water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until steaming but not simmering. Combine the egg yolks, 1 tablespoon water and 2 teaspoons lemon juice in a medium stainless-steel bowl. Set the bowl on the saucepan (do not let the bowl touch the water). Cook, whisking constantly, until the egg mixture is pale yellow and thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Check periodically to make sure the water isn\\u2019t boiling or the egg yolks might overcook. Remove the bowl from the saucepan; slowly pour in the melted butter, a drop at a time at first, whisking constantly until thick. Whisk in the remaining 2 teaspoons lemon juice, the cayenne and ? teaspoon salt. If the sauce is too thick, whisk in some warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to loosen. Return the bowl to the saucepan of water with the heat turned off to keep warm; whisk occasionally. Make the Eggs Benedict: Fill a large wide pot with 3 inches of water. Heat over medium-high heat until steaming with small bubbles; reduce the heat as needed to maintain a bare simmer. Stir in the vinegar. Crack 4 eggs into individual small bowls or ramekins. Carefully tip the eggs into the water, spacing them as far apart as possible. Cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 3 to 3? minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate lined with a kitchen towel. Gently blot the eggs dry and trim off any wispy pieces. Repeat with the remaining 4 eggs. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the Canadian bacon and cook until lightly browned and warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Meanwhile, toast the English muffins and spread with butter. Top each English muffin half with a slice of Canadian bacon and a poached egg. Thin the hollandaise sauce with more warm water, if necessary, and season with salt. Spoon over the poached eggs and sprinkle with chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 21708,&quot;Eggs Benedict 1 1/2 cups white wine vinegar 5 peppercorns 1 shallot, finely sliced<br> 1 sprig fresh tarragon<br> 3 large free-range egg yolks<br> 1 cup melted and skimmed (clarified) unsalted butter, warm 1 cup melted and skimmed (clarified) unsalted butter, warm<br> 1/2 lemon, juiced<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup white wine vinegar Salt 10 eggs<br> 5 English muffins, split 5 ounces salted butter, softened<br> 15 ounces sliced Scottish smoked salmon<br> 2 ounces American caviar<br> Instructions: For the hollandaise sauce: Place the white wine vinegar, peppercorns, sliced shallots and tarragon into a pan, bring to the boil and reduce by half. Strain and reserve. Place a large pot filled partway with water to the boil, then lower and keep at a simmer. Place the egg yolks in a bowl that will fit over the pot of simmering water but not touch the water. Add 1 tablespoon of the reduced vinegar to the eggs and place the bowl on top of the pot, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Beat the eggs with a balloon whisk, occasionally removing the bowl from the heat so the mixture does not become scrambled, until the eggs thicken and double in size. Remove the bowl from the pot, then whisk a small ladle of the warm clarified butter into the eggs. Continue to gradually add the butter while whisking. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a small amount of warm water. Whisk in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. For the poached eggs: Mix the white wine vinegar, some salt and 5 cups water in a pan, bring to the boil and then bring down to a simmer. For the toasted English muffins with smoked salmon: Meanwhile, place the English muffin halves into a toaster and toast until golden brown. While the muffins are still warm, spread the softened butter onto the open toasted side of each and layer 1 1/2 ounces of the sliced salmon on each buttered muffin half. To poach the eggs, crack each egg into an individual small bowl. Use a whisk to gently stir the simmering poaching liquid in a counter-clockwise direction, and pour each egg into the water in the same direction the water is moving. Gently simmer for 1 minute. Remove with a strainer, drain and place onto a garnished English muffin half. (If you are keeping the eggs for later, remove them from the water with a strainer and place immediately in salted ice water. Reheat them in the same cooking water.) Spoon 2 tablespoons of the hollandaise sauce over each poached egg and garnish with 1/2 teaspoon of the caviar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21709,&quot;Steak and Stout Pie 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) olive oil 1 kilogram (about 2.2 pounds) beef brisket, trimmed and cut into 2-centimeter (1-inch) cubes Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons (34 grams) flour 1 tablespoon (14 grams) unsalted butter 3 carrots, peeled and diced 2 stalks celery, diced 2 yellow onions, large diced 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon (15 grams) tomato paste 1 tablespoon (12 grams) brown sugar 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons finely chopped thyme 2 bay leaves 1 1/2 cups (375 milliliters) stout 2 cups (500 milliliters) beef stock 2 medium potatoes, peeled and 2-centimeter (1-inch) diced 3/4 cup (168 grams) unsalted butter 3/4 cup (180 milliliters) water 2 3/4 cups (370 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 egg 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) milk Instructions: For the filling: Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C) and heat a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium high. Add the oil to the pan, season the beef well with salt and pepper and dust with 2 tablespoons of the flour. Sear the beef in two or three batches until browned on each side, about 8 minutes total, removing the meat to a dish once seared. Add the butter to the pan and turn the heat down to medium. Add the carrots, celery and onions, season with salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes or until softened and lightly brown. Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute or two. Add the tomato paste, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, bay leaves and beef. Scatter with remaining 2 tablespoons flour and stir well to combine. Add the stout, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any brown bits. Add the beef stock and potatoes and bring the mixture to a boil. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, transfer to the oven and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until the beef is tender. Transfer the beef and vegetables to a bowl, leaving the braising liquid in the pan. Place the braising liquid over high heat. Bring to a boil to reduce by about half. Keep warm over low heat or if prepping in advance, transfer to a container and place in the fridge for up to 2 days or freezer for 3 months. Season the beef and veg with more salt and pepper, if needed, and set aside to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the pastry by combining the butter and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil and melt the butter. Remove from the heat and add the flour and salt. Stir to bring together and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. When cool enough to handle, knead the dough until very smooth and a little elastic. Wrap in plastic and set aside to rest for 30 minutes. When ready to bake, set a rack to the bottom position and preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan with aluminum foil. On a lightly floured surface, divide the pastry in two, one slightly smaller than the other. Roll the larger piece of pastry out to 1/2-centimeter (1/4-inch) thick and transfer to the springform pan, lining the bottom and up the sides. Fill with the cooled beef and veg. Roll out the remaining pastry and drape over the filling, crimping and sealing the edges with a fork or by pinching with your fingers. Beat together the egg and milk and brush over the top of the pie. Cut a vent into the center of the pastry and place on a large baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the pastry is golden. Allow the pie to cool for 10 minutes before unmolding, slicing, and serving with the reduced braising liquid as a gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Pinot Noir]&quot; 21710,&quot;Chicken \\Stir-Fry\\ Cheat Sheet 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon sesame oil<br> 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds 2 teaspoons finely minced fresh ginger Two 8-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1 cup diced Spanish onion (1/2-inch dice) 1/2 cup diced carrots (1/2-inch dice) 1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces<br> 1/2 head broccoli, cut into medium florets 1 cup thinly sliced scallions Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds and ginger.

Form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Lightly flour the dough and roll it between 2 pieces of parchment or plastic wrap to about 1/4 inch thick. Press into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, patching any holes. Use a fork to gently prick the crust, ensuring that steam can escape while it bakes. Freeze until hard, 6 to 8 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the tart crust until pale golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack. For the pastry cream: While the tart crust dough is chilling, bring the milk, vanilla bean paste and salt to just under a boil in a medium pot over medium heat. Meanwhile, whisk the sugar, cornstarch and egg yolks in a medium bowl until smooth and combined. Whisking constantly, ladle half the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture, one ladle at a time. Continue until all the hot milk has been whisked in and the egg mixture is now warm. Return the milk and egg yolks to the pot and cook over medium-low heat, whisking, until thickened to a pudding consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Immediately strain through a chinois or fine-mesh sieve into a large airtight container. Stir the butter cubes into the pastry cream until melted and combined. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface of the pastry cream, and refrigerate until chilled through, about 2 hours. For the assembly: Spread the fudge sauce over the cooled tart shell and top with an even layer of thinly sliced bananas (using about half). Add a layer of pastry cream (about 1 cup) and smooth into an even layer; reserve the remaining cream for another use (see Cook&#39;s Note). Top with the remaining sliced bananas, shingling them slightly and arranging them in a concentric circle. Sprinkle the sugar over the bananas and brulee with a kitchen blow torch until golden brown. Garnish with some chopped walnuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 21719,&quot;Strawberry Soup 2 pints strawberries, washed and hulled 1/4 cup sugar 1 to 2 tablespoons water 1/2 cup red wine mixed with teaspoon cornstarch Whipped cream, optional Instructions: Reserve 4 of the best strawberries for garnish and roughly chop remaining berries.

Remove from the skillet and transfer to a plate. Remove the stems and seeds and place in a saucepan. Add enough hot water to just cover and bring to a boil. Cover the pan, remove from the heat and allow chiles to soak until very soft and plumped, about 20 minutes. Strain in a fine mesh sieve over a bowl and reserve soaking liquid separately. In a blender, combine the chiles, 2 tablespoons of the onion, 3/4 teaspoon of the garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, oregano, thyme, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, cloves, and vinegar and puree until smooth, adding a little of the cl soaking liquid (only as much as is needed) to enable the mixture to blend. The consistency should be thick but smooth. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Trim the pork tenderloins of all silver skin and place in a re-sealable plastic food storage bag. Add 1/4 cup of the chili sauce and turn so that the tenderloins are both well coated with the sauce. Refrigerate for 45 minutes and up to 4 hours. Remove the meat from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a large skillet and, when hot add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.

Season steaks with salt and pepper. When pan starts to smoke, carefully add steaks. Allow the steaks to cook for about 3 to 4 minutes on 1 side, without moving or piercing the meat. This will help create a good, crusty sear. When steaks are brown, flip and sear the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove meat to a large plate and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Decoratively line a large platter with arugula. Tear the roasted peppers into large pieces and scatter over the arugula. In a small bowl, whisk in the remaining olive oil, balsamic vinegar and any meat juices that may have collected on the plate from the steaks. Season with salt and pepper.

Cook, flipping once, until crisp on both sides, about 7 minutes total. Remove from the heat and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool slightly. Drain half the bacon grease from the skillet, leaving just enough to coat the skillet. Add the onions and turn the heat to medium-high. Saute until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the squash, thyme, some salt, a few turns of pepper and a few pinches of crushed red pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 more minutes. Add the wine and broth. Roughly chop the bacon and add it to the skillet along with the apples. Bring the mixture to a light boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, while you make the biscuits.<br> For the biscuits: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Add the butter and, using a food processor, pastry cutter or your hands, incorporate the butter until the mixture is the consistency of raw oatmeal. Mix in the cream until the mixture comes together to form a dough. Turn it out onto a floured work surface, pat it out to 3/4-inch thick and then cut out round biscuits, re-rolling scraps as needed. Turn off the heat before dotting the top of the skillet with the biscuits. Brush the biscuits with the beaten egg and top with black pepper.

Pour only enough olive oil (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) on a cookie sheet to prevent the chicken and the fennel from sticking. Place the chicken breast in a single layer on the sheet pan. Place in the broiler for 7 minutes. Remove and add the fennel in a single layer and brush both sides with the olive oil. Season fennel slices with salt and pepper on both sides. Squeeze juice of 1 lime over the fennel slices and place under the broiler. Broil for 5 minutes. Some of the edges may blacken slightly. Remove the fennel from the oven and using tongs or a spatula, and turn over each slice of fennel. Top with the Parmesan. Place back under the broiler for 1 1/2 to 3 minutes, or until cheese starts to brown. Allow fennel to remain in the pan until ready to serve. Do not refrigerate.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the shallots and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the ground beef and season it with 1 teaspoon of salt. Brown the beef, breaking it up with a spoon or spatula. Stir in the green beans and cook for a few minutes, until thawed. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the mixture to a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish and spread it out evenly. Set aside while you make the creamed soup. Discard the juices that remain in the skillet, wipe it out, and return to medium heat. Melt the butter and whisk in the flour to make a paste. Cook, whisking, for 2 minutes. Whisk in the pale ale, then add the chicken stock very gradually, in 3 or 4 additions, whisking continuously and allowing the mixture to thicken before each addition. Whisk in the heavy cream, a bunch of turns of black pepper, the thyme, and the nutmeg. Increase the heat and continue whisking frequently until it just begins to simmer, then reduce the heat to low and simmer very gently for 5 minutes, whisking occasionally. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. Pour or ladle the mixture all over the ground beef and fold together to incorporate. Top with perfectly aligned rows and columns of Tater Tots (adding a layer of cheese under or over the tots, if desired) and season with salt and pepper.

Stir to wet sugar. Cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer, covered, without stirring, for about 1 minute to dissolve sugar. Uncover and wash down the sides of the saucepan with a wet pastry brush. Cook until syrup registers 242 degrees (the upper end of the soft-ball stage) on a candy thermometer. Or cook until you can blow a bubble (resembling a soap bubble) by dipping a slotted spoon into the syrup, holding it up, and blowing gently but steadily through it.<br> Meanwhile, in a heatproof, stovetop-safe bowl (a stainless steel electric mixer bowl is ideal, otherwise a stainless steel bowl suitable for using with a hand held electric mixer) beat eggs until pale and thick; set aside. Just before syrup reaches 242 degrees, begin beating eggs again on medium speed. When the syrup is ready, remove it from the heat and pour it in a thin steady stream over the eggs, beating constantly. To avoid splashing hot syrup on yourself or all around the sides of the bowl, pour it next to the beaters. Stop beating and place mixture on the stove over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a whisk (to avoid scrambling the eggs) until mixture registers at least 160 degrees on insta-read thermometer, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and continue beating with an electric mixer until mixture cools to room temperature.<br> Divide butter into 1-tablespoon sized lumps. Add butter, a few pieces at a time, continuing to beat until mixture is smooth and spreadable. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 21742,&quot;Hot Potato Chips with Blue Cheese Sauce 2 1/4 cups whole milk 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 small Spanish onion, finely chopped 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Pinch cayenne pepper 1/2 pound crumbled blue cheese Homemade Potato Chips, recipe follows, or good-quality store-bought potato chips 6 large Idaho potatoes, peeled and sliced lengthwise into 1/8-inch thick slices on a mandoline 2 quarts peanut oil Salt Instructions: Place the milk in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Heat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the warm milk, and continue whisking until thickened. Season with salt and cayenne pepper. Continue cooking for 5 minutes, whisking occasionally. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese. If the sauce is too thick, thin it with a little extra milk. Serve sauce warm with potato chips for dipping. Place the potato slices on a baking sheet between layers of paper towels to make sure they are very dry before frying. Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan until the temperature of the oil reaches 400 degrees F on a deep-fat thermometer. Fry the potatoes in small batches until golden brown on both sides, turning once. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a brown paper bag or another baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Season with salt immediately. Serve hot with the blue cheese dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 21743,&quot;Cider Pumpkin Bread with Raisins and Walnuts 2 cups brown sugar 2 cups pumpkin puree 2 eggs 1 cup oil 1 cup apple cider 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons baking powder 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 cup raisins 1 cup walnuts Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Bake for about 2 hours and then finish them in the smoker for another 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 21745,&quot;Apricot and Tequila Glazed Turkey 5 California (dried Anaheim) chiles, stemmed and seeded 3 3/4 cups chicken broth, divided 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted 3 tablespoons tequila Salt 1 (14-pound) turkey, giblets removed and reserved 1/3 cup apricot preserves (recommended: Bon Maman) 2 teaspoons dried oregano, crumbled 2 cloves garlic Freshly ground black pepper Dried apricots, California chiles, fresh cilantro, for garnish. Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the chiles and 2 cups of chicken broth in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and then turn off the heat. Let the chiles stand for 5 to 10 minutes to soften. Mix 3/4 cup of chicken broth, melted butter, and tequila in a small metal bowl. Season with salt. Using a kitchen flavor injector, inject the mixture into the thighs, breasts, and legs of the turkey. If the mixture solidifies, place the bowl over a gas burner or in a warm oven until the butter melts. Place the turkey on a rack set in a large roasting pan. Tuck the wing tips under the turkey body. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Place the giblets in the pan. Transfer the chiles with their liquid to a blender. Add the apricot preserves, oregano, and garlic and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer the cl puree to a medium saucepan. Rub about 1 cup of the cl puree all over the turkey (reserve the rest for the sauce at the end), working some of it between the breast and the skin. Season the turkey generously with salt and pepper. Add 1 cup broth to the roasting pan and roast for 45 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Continue roasting the turkey until a thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 2 hours longer, basting every 20 minutes with drippings. Cover the turkey loosely with foil if it begins to brown. Transfer the turkey to a platter, reserving the pan juices, and allow to rest while preparing the sauce. Strain the pan juices into a large, heavy saucepan and discard any solids. Spoon the fat from the top of the liquid and discard. Add the remaining cl puree to the saucepan and stir until well combined. Boil over high heat until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Garnish the turkey with dried apricots, dried chiles, and fresh cilantro. Serve with the cl puree alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 21746,&quot;Zucchini-Pistachio-Raisin Quick Bread with Orange Glaze 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter or vegetable oil, plus more melted butter, for the pan 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 cup raisins 3/4 cup chopped toasted pistachios 1/2 cup plain yogurt or sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest, optional 1 cup shredded zucchini, excess moisture squeezed out 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon milk 1 teaspoon orange zest, plus 1 tablespoon juice Instructions: For the quick bread: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush one 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan or three 6-by-3-by-2-inch mini loaf pans with melted butter and set aside. Combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add the raisins and pistachios and toss together. Set aside. Whisk together the melted butter, yogurt, vanilla extract, eggs and grated zest if using in a small bowl. Stir in the shredded zucchini. Fold this mixture into the flour mixture until just incorporated. Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan(s). Tap the bottom on a hard surface a few times and smooth the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes for the regular loaf and 35 to 40 minutes for the minis. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes, then turn the bread out and let cool completely on the rack. For the orange glaze: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk and orange zest and juice in a small bowl. Pour the glaze over the bread and allow to set at room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Cook&#39;s Note: When measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off the excess. (Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour, resulting in dry baked goods.) Try not to use dark coated baking pans; the quick bread could get too dark. Most quick breads taste better if left to sit overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 21747,&quot;Grilled Chicken Thighs and Romaine with Dijon Vinaigrette Vegetable oil, for the grill 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 small clove garlic, finely grated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 pounds) 1 head romaine, trimmed and quartered, root end attached Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium heat; lightly coat the grates with vegetable oil. Whisk together the vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a generous grinding of pepper in a large bowl. While whisking, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the dressing is smooth and thick. Transfer half to a small bowl and whisk in the parsley and tarragon; set aside. Add the chicken to the dressing remaining in the large bowl and toss to coat. Grill skin-side down until lightly charred, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Cover the grill and cook until no longer pink near the bone and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of each chicken thigh reads 165 degrees F, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to a platter and rest for at least 5 minutes before serving. While the chicken rests, grill the romaine, turning to slightly char all sides, until the core end is tender, about 5 minutes. Put 1 wedge of romaine on each of 4 serving plates; top with 2 chicken thighs and drizzle with the reserved herbed dressing. ? &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 21748,&quot;Cretan Dakos - Koukouvagia (Owl) 10 small Cretan barley rusks (dakos) 2 medium tomatoes 6 ounces feta cheese, crumbled 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano leaves 1 medium white or yellow onion, grated, optional Instructions: Wet the rusks and dry with a clean towel.

Place the graham crackers in the bowl of a food processor and process until you get fine crumbs. (This can also be done in a large plastic zip-close bag with a rolling pin.) Pour the crumbs into a large bowl. Add the melted butter and stir until evenly mixed. Press the crumb mixture into a 9-inch pie plate, gently packing them so they&#39;re firm and in an even layer. If you go up and over the sides, that is fine. Bake the crust for 5 minutes; let it cool and then chill for 20 minutes. For the filling: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, add the cream and confectioners&#39; sugar and whip until firm peaks form. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the root beer, milk, pudding mix and root beer extract until thick, about 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold 2 cups of the whipped cream into the root beer mixture until almost completely blended. Pour the filling over the chilled crust and smooth out with a spatula. Top the pie with the remaining whipped cream. Garnish with maraschino cherries and chill for at least 2 hours.

Heat the butter and oil in a shallow heavy-bottomed skillet, like a Le Creuset. Saut the onions first, getting them translucent and soft and starting to color, about 2 minutes. In a mini processor, process the carrots and celery until very finely chopped; this makes a smoother sauce so I can sneak veggies past the kids. Add the carrots and celery to the skillet and mix. Add the garlic. Cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Add the turkey meat and cook, stirring, until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the cup of white wine and reduce slightly. Add the tomato paste, milk, bay leaves and Parmesan rind and simmer down for a little bit, 3 to 4 minutes. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. It shouldn\\u2019t be too liquidy (this is a note from Stanley Tucci haha! He\\u2019s a big fan of the classic Italian Bolognese which is a dryer sauce). Put the lid on and transfer it to the oven. It should cook in the oven for 45 minutes with the lid on; give it a stir if you want at the midway point. I prefer the oven but you can also keep it on the stovetop if you prefer. I just think the oven adds a rich caramel-LY depth and melts everything together so beautifully. When the sauce is done, remove the bay leaves and Parmesan rind. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions, then drain it, saving 1 cup or so of the pasta water. Pour the pasta back into the pasta pot, add the reserved water, knob of butter and the grated Parmesan cheese and mix. Add it to the sauce and stir to coat the pasta. Sprinkle with extra Parmesan and serve in shallow bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 21751,&quot;Scallion Sour Cream 4 scallions (white and green parts), sliced 1 cup sour cream 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the scallions, sour cream, salt, and pepper in a blender and pulse until smooth.

Simmer for 20 minutes or until just tender. Drain the potatoes and return them to the saucepan, over low heat. With a potato masher, puree the sweet and regular potatoes with the butter or cream or broth if you are on a diet. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Here too, you can zap up the adults&#39; portion. Remove half of the kids portion and leave it plain; add to the adults&#39; version either grated orange zest, fresh horseradish or your own favorite seasoning. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 21753,&quot;The Ultimate Potato Gratin 1 head savoy cabbage, cored, cleaned, and shredded 1 (2-inch) piece slab bacon, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 bunch fresh chives, finely chopped to 1/4 cup 2 pounds baking potatoes, unpeeled and thinly sliced (about 1/8-inch), see Cook&#39;s note* 2 1/2 cups heavy cream 2 cups grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Finely shred the cabbage. Cut the bacon into 1/2-inch chunks. Place a small skillet over medium-low heat and fry the bacon, until crisp. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Set aside. Add 1 tablespoon butter to bacon fat in frying pan. When it has melted add 1/2 the garlic and give it a quick stir with a wooden spoon to soften. Add the cabbage and coat it with the butter. Slowly let it wilt. Add the bacon. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove from heat and add most of the chives, reserving a little for the garnish. Generously butter the bottom and sides of a 9 by 13-inch ovenproof casserole dish. In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, 1 1/2 cups of cream, 1 cup of Parmesan, and the remaining garlic. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using your hands, place a layer of potatoes in the casserole dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan and repeat with 2 more layers. Spoon the cabbage mixture on top and spread it out evenly over the potatoes. Top it off with 2 more layers of potato and Parmesan. Pour the remaining 1 cup cream over the dish. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour. Remove foil and bake for 30 minutes until golden brown. Leave for 10 minutes before serving.

Sprinkle the beef chuck liberally with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Heat a large saute pan over high heat until it smokes. Add the grapeseed oil and allow the oil to heat for a few seconds. Carefully place the chuck in the pan and sear each side until browned (do not move the meat too much; it will release from the pan when it is ready to be moved). Transfer the meat to a roasting pan or ovenproof casserole dish. In the saute pan, add the onions, carrots and celery and cook until the onions and carrots get some color, 8 to 10 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the red wine and allow the wine to simmer until the alcohol has cooked off, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in the tomato paste and then the beef broth and allow the cooking liquid to simmer for a few minutes to marry the flavors. Season with salt and pepper and then pour the cooking liquid over the roast in the roasting pan. Cover the roast with a layer of plastic wrap and then a layer of aluminum foil. Cook until tender, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the roast from the oven and allow it to rest in the cooking liquid for 30 to 40 minutes. For the pan jus: After the meat has rested, strain the cooking liquid and pour it back into a pan. Bring to a simmer and simmer until reduced to 4 cups. Whisk together the cornstarch and 6 tablespoons water. Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering cooking liquid and then cook the jus until it thickens to cover the back of a spoon. Season with pepper. For the whipped potatoes: In a pot, cover the potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are fork-tender. Drain the potatoes; set the strainer over the sink and allow the potatoes to steam for 5 minutes. Pour the potatoes back into the pot, add the melted butter and sour cream and whip with a hand blender until smooth. Season with salt and white pepper. Bring a pot of water to a boil; prepare an ice-water bath. Blanch the broccoli in the boiling water and then transfer to the water bath to stop the cooking process. Repeat with the carrots. Drain and set aside. To plate: In a large saute pan, heat the grapeseed oil until it begins to smoke. Add the broccoli and carrots and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Divide the whipped potatoes among 6 plates. Slice the pot roast and place the slices on top of the potatoes. Ladle the pan jus over the pot roast. and then place the broccoli and carrots around the plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot]&quot; 21755,&quot;Poona Pancakes 1 cup basmati rice 1 cup black bean dal* or lentils 3 cups water 5 tablespoons plain yogurt 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced 2 serrano chiles, stems and seeds removed, diced 1 small red onion, diced 1/2 bunch cilantro, stems trimmed, roughly chopped 1/3 cup vegetable oil Yogurt, for garnish Tomatoes, chopped, for garnish Cilantro, chopped, for garnish Instructions: Pick over the rice and dal to remove any pebbles or dirt. Process in a food processor or blender until it becomes a coarse flour mixture, about 5 minutes. Combine this mixture with water, yogurt, and salt in a bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place at least 12 hours or as long as 24. When ready, the batter should be smooth and foamy, a bit thinner than pancake batter. Just before cooking, add the tomatoes, serrano chiles, red onion, and cilantro. Stir to combine. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a small, well-seasoned cast iron skillet over high heat until it is very hot. Pour in 1/3 cup batter, reduce the heat to low, and spread the batter evenly with a ladle or spatula. Fry until well browned, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat this procedure, heating an additional teaspoon of oil each time, until all the batter is fried. Stack the pancakes between layers of aluminum foil in a roasting pan and keep warm in a 200 degree F oven. To serve, arrange 2 pancakes on each plate and top with some yogurt, tomatoes, and cilantro.

Microwave until slightly softened and a little pliable but not melted, about 10 seconds. Knead the candies together to blend into a uniform pinkish color. Divide into 2 equal sections and roll each piece into a hot dog shape. Freeze for 2 hours to harden. Using the food coloring marker, add \\grill marks\\ to the hot dogs. For the grill cake: Bake two 9-inch cake rounds according to the cake mix box instructions, then let cool completely. Trim the cake tops, place on large plate and frost with the chocolate frosting. For the coals: Preheat the broiler on low. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange the mini marshmallows on the prepared baking sheet in a 7-inch diameter circle (the marshmallows will melt together and form a disk). Place under the broiler until the marshmallows are slightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool completely. For the cheeseburgers: In a medium pot, combine the marshmallows, chocolate chips and butter and heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the marshmallows and chocolate are melted. Remove from the heat, stir in the cereal and vanilla and mix until completely combined. Form into patties. Cut the fruit leather into 3-by-3-inch pieces and arrange on top of the puffed rice cereal patties.

Add the coconut milk, lime juice, vegetable oil and fish sauce and blend to make a smooth, slightly thick sauce. Season with salt. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve. Make the fish: Preheat a grill to medium high. Lay the banana leaves on a work surface, overlapping each about halfway, so the leaves are large enough to wrap around the fish, with the tail and head sticking out slightly. Lightly brush the banana leaves with vegetable oil. Cut three 24-inch pieces of kitchen twine and run under water to moisten (this will prevent the twine from burning on the grill).<br> Make 2 or 3 slits crosswise on each side of the fish, cutting about 1/2 inch into the flesh. Season the fish inside and out with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt total. Stuff the lime and ginger slices, chiles, and cilantro and mint sprigs into the cavity of the fish. Set the fish at one short end of the banana leaves and roll it up, leaving the head and tail sticking out, then tie together in 3 places with the kitchen twine. Once the grill registers 425? F to 450? F, grill the fish until the banana leaves are charred, about 12 minutes. Flip and grill until the fish is cooked through, 12 to 14 more minutes.

Moisten the ribs with lemon juice and then coat all sides with the rub, making sure to distribute evenly. Arrange the grill or smoker for indirect heating so the ribs will not be directly over the heat source. Using low heat and applewood chips (about half a pound), place ribs on cool part of the grill, wrap in foil, make a few incisions in the foil and smoke for 1 hour. Meanwhile, whisk together all glaze ingredients. After 1 hour, pour a third of the glaze on top of the ribs and seal tightly in the foil, being careful not to tear it. Do the same with remaining racks. Return ribs to the grill and cook meat-side down for 30 minutes, maintaining low heat. Occasionally check the grill to make sure it remains low. After 30 minutes, flip the foil bundles and continue cooking. After 1 hour of cooking, remove the ribs from the grill and let rest in the foil for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, raise grill heat to medium-high. Cut the lemon in half and grill flesh-side down until nicely marked and slightly soft, 3 to 5 minutes. When done resting, remove the ribs from the foil and place on the grill meat-side down and cook for 4 minutes. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes.

Refrigerate until ready to serve. For the beans: Heat the olive oil in a large cast-iron high-sided pan over medium heat. Add the onion and green chiles. Season with a pinch of salt and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and paprika and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the beans, salt and several grinds of black pepper. Add 3/4 cup water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until the beans begin to fall apart, 8 to 10 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash the beans to your liking (from chunky to smooth, based on your preference), adding a few tablespoons of water if they seem dry, or continue to cook for a few minutes more if they seem too wet. Add the lime juice and stir to combine. Adjust seasoning, to taste. To assemble: Lay the tortillas out on your work surface. Divide the beans among the tortillas, centering them on the lower half of the tortillas. Top each with 2 tablespoons of the cheese. Fold the bottom of the tortillas over, fold in the sides and roll up. Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom. Add as many burritos as will fit, seam side down, and cook, turning as needed, until very golden and crisp and heated through, just a couple of minutes. Season the toasty burritos with a pinch of salt. Serve the burritos with the salsa on the side. The salsa will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for 4 to 5 days. Leftover burritos will keep, wrapped in plastic, in the fridge for 2 to 3 days or in the freezer for 2 to 3 months.

Cook over a moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thickened and reduced by about a third, about 20 minutes. Chill for at least an hour before serving over the warm peach crisp. To prepare the peach crisp, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch square or 8- by 12-inch baking dish. Start with the crumb mixture. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Cut the cold butter into pieces. Add the butter to the bowl and use a fork, pastry cutter or pastry blender to cut into the flour mixture. The mixture should resemble a moist, coarse meal. Place the peaches in a bowl, add the lemon zest to the peaches, mix in the lemon juice and maple syrup and gently stir the peaches to combine. Pour the peaches into the prepared baking dish. Top with the crumb mixture, evening out the surface with a fork. Cover tightly with foil and bake, about 15 minutes.

Make it from something flavorful and it will add rather than take away from the taste.

Cut a piece of foil 9 by 23-inches. Butter the corners and sides of a 9 by 9-inch baking pan. Line the pan with the foil, leaving an overhang on two sides. Fold the overhanging foil to make them doubly thick. (This will make it easier to lift the bar out of the pan.) For the topping: Whisk the coconut cream with the egg white and vanilla in a medium bowl. Toss the shredded coconut with the flour in another medium bowl. Stir the shredded coconut mixture into the coconut cream mixture. Set aside. For the base: Whisk the flour with the cocoa powder and salt in a small bowl. Put the cookie dough on a clean work surface and dump the flour mixture on top. Knead the flour mixture and dough together until it is dark and homogenous. Sprinkle a little extra flour on the work surface, and use a rolling pin to gently press and roll the dough into a 7-or-8-inch square-don&#39;t worry if it cracks a bit. Put the dough in the prepared pan, using your fingers to press it evenly into the sides and corners. Scatter the coconut topping evenly over the base, making sure you cover the edges well and being sure not to press down so that the coconut mixture lies on top of the dough. Scatter the chocolate on top and press it lightly into the coconut. Bake until the coconut is a toasted golden brown, the topping seems dry and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool completely on a rack before gently lifting out of the pan by the overhanging foil, about 20 minutes.

We even have guests who ask for it specifically every time they visit. The fruit sinks to the bottom as it cooks, leaving a light sponge on top with a lovely sugary crust. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line the sides and base of a 8 by 8-inch square cake pan with parchment paper.<br> Using an electric whisk or hand held mixer, whisk the eggs, 6 ounces caster sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl, until the mixture is thick and mousse-like, and the whisk leaves a figure of eight pattern, this will take about 5 minutes.<br> Melt the butter in a saucepan with the milk, and then pour the mixture onto the eggs, whisking continuously. Sift in the flour, cinnamon, and baking powder, and fold carefully into the batter so that there are no lumps of flour. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, and smooth the surface.<br> Peel and core the apples, and cut them into thin slices, and then arrange them over the batter. They will sink to the bottom. This is meant to happen! Sprinkle the cake with the remaining 1/2 ounce sugar, and bake in the oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, and bake until well risen and golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.<br> Allow the cake to cool in the tin, cut into squares and serve warm.

Use a wet pastry brush to wipe around the sides of the pan to dissolve any sugar crystals that may form. Clip a candy thermometer on to the side of the pan and bring the sugar mixture to a rolling boil over medium heat, and cook until the thermometer reads 236 degrees F. Pour into a stainless steel bowl and allow it to cool to 200 degrees F. While the syrup is cooling, push a wooden stick into each apple from the top through the core. The stick should be deep enough so it won&#39;t fall off when you dip the apple into the caramel. Line a cookie sheet with a silicone baking mat or waxed paper. Dip each apple into the 200 degrees F caramel, watching carefully, so as not to dip your fingers into the caramel. Remove the excess caramel by turning the apples over the caramel bowl and then transfer to the cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining apples. Chill for 15 minutes, then remove them from the silicon mat or waxed paper.

Bring to a boil uncovered, stirring to dissolve the salt, then turn off the heat and cover. Allow to cool completely, then place in the fridge to chill. For the turkey: Remove the turkey from its packaging and remove the bags inside that hold the neck and giblets. Rinse the neck and giblets and put them in a plastic bag in the fridge; you&#39;ll need them for the Maple-Whiskey Gravy. Rinse the turkey thoroughly with cold water. Place the turkey in a large brining bag or pot. Pour in the maple-whiskey brine, cover with cold water and place in the fridge for 16 to 24 hours so the brine can work its magic. When ready for roasting, preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse it thoroughly again inside and out. Soak the turkey in cold water for 15 to 20 minutes, then rinse again and pat dry. Tuck the wings underneath the turkey, then tie the legs together with kitchen string. Place the turkey breast-side up on a rack in a large, shallow roasting pan. Cover the pan with heavy-duty foil so that it&#39;s well sealed. Roast for about 10 minutes per pound (about 2 1/2 hours for a 15-pound turkey and about 3 hours 20 minutes for a 20-pound turkey).<br> Remove the turkey from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Remove the foil and set aside. (Put stuffing in the bird if you wish at this point.) Rub the butter all over the skin of the turkey, getting in the crevices. Insert a probe thermometer into the thigh, near the hip joint. Place the turkey, uncovered, back in the oven. Continue roasting, basting or brushing with the juices in the pan every 30 minutes, until the thermometer registers 165 degrees F and the juices are no longer pink. This could take another 2 to 2 1/2 hours, depending on the size of the bird. Remove the turkey from the oven and cover lightly with foil until you are ready to carve it. Pour the pan drippings into a fat separator and set aside for the Maple-Whiskey Gravy. Put the giblets and neck in a small saucepan of water over medium heat and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to medium low and simmer until the giblets are cooked, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the giblets and neck, set aside and keep the water in the saucepan. In the turkey roasting pan (which should not have been cleaned!), add back 1/4 cup turkey fat. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk it into the fat to form a paste. If the paste is too thick or clumpy, add a little more fat. If it&#39;s too greasy, sprinkle in more flour. Whisk and cook the roux over medium-low heat until deep golden brown. Turn off the heat and add the whiskey, then turn the heat back on and whisk it in. Pour in the chicken broth, whisking the whole time, then add the maple syrup. Allow it to cook and thicken for several minutes, whisking occasionally. If the gravy gets too thick or if it&#39;s too salty, thin it with a little of the giblet water. If the gravy is too thin, just keep cooking until it thickens up. Taste, then add salt and plenty of black pepper. Chop the giblets and add them to the gravy. Remove as much of the neck meat as you can and add it to the gravy too. Serve immediately! &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 21851,&quot;Baked Figs with Grappa 14 ounces/400 g dried figs 2 cups/500 ml almonds 2 tablespoons/30 ml sugar 3 ounces/100 ml grappa Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

(You can draw a clean finger through the center of the pan to allow some water to seep in.) Add the corn syrup and bring to a boil. Add the butter and boil until the mixture reaches 300 degrees F. Turn off the heat and whisk in the cocoa; then stir in the nuts. Quickly pour the mixture onto the center of the prepared pan and let it spread out \\u2014 it may not reach the sides of the pan. Set aside to cool at room temperature until hard. Using your hands (I wear gloves to avoid fingerprints), pry the toffee out of the pan and break into large pieces. Store in an airtight container. The toffee will keep well for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Port, Tawny Port, Madeira, Sherry]&quot; 21856,&quot;Eight Jewel Stuffing for Turkey 3 cups glutinous rice 30 dried Chinese black mushrooms 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 1/4 cups bamboo shoots, diced 1 1/4 cups peeled water chestnuts, preferably fresh, coarsely chopped 8 Chinese sausages (lap cheung) diced 4 ounces Smithfield or country ham, diced 1 cup raw peanuts 6 scallions, green and white parts, minced 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic 1/4 cup thin soy sauce 1/4 cup dry sherry about 4 cups chicken stock Salt and black pepper, to taste Instructions: Soak the glutinous rice in cold water for 1 hour.

Add the pecans and set aside.<br> For the bread: Combine 2 cups of the flour, the sugar, undissolved yeast and salt in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, or in a large bowl. Heat the milk, butter and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan until very warm (120 to 130 degrees F); stir into the flour mixture. Stir in the eggs and enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Continue to knead in the mixer at a speed of 1 or 2 until the dough is smooth and elastic, 3 to 5 minutes. Alternately, knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 8 to 10 minutes. Cover; let rest on a floured surface for 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 32 pieces; roll into balls. Pour a third of the pecan glaze into the prepared pan and place a third of the dough balls over it. Repeat twice with the remaining glaze and dough. Cover and let rise in a warm draft-free space until the dough rises to the top of the pan, about 45 minutes. Or, you can let it rise in the fridge for 2 to 24 hours, in which case you should let the dough rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before baking. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the bread for 30 minutes. Cover with foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate.
