Deeply pierce the squash all over 12 to 16 times with a fork, then place on the rack (if needed, trim the stem so the squash fits comfortably in the pot, but be careful not to cut into the squash itself). Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 12 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> Meanwhile, add the canned tomatoes to a medium bowl and use your hands to lightly crush the tomatoes. Set aside.<br> After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for quick release and wait until the quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid. Use 2 kitchen towels to remove the rack and squash to a cutting board. Carefully pour the water out of the pot. Allow the squash to cool slightly while you prepare the marinara sauce. Set the pot to high saute and allow it to heat up for 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, then add the onions and a large pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and starting to brown lightly, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the reserved tomatoes and a large pinch of salt and bring to a strong simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced slightly and thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with additional salt and red pepper flakes if needed.<br> While the sauce is reducing, remove the squash from the rack and split it in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to remove the seeds, then use a fork to scrape the strands of squash from the inside of the skin.<br> Transfer the squash to a large platter and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon salt and red pepper flakes to taste. Season with more salt if needed, then top with the hot marinara sauce.

In a large wide pot, bring the milk to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid burning the bottom (a nonstick pot works really well for this purpose). This will take a little while so be patient! Add the lemon juice and turn the heat down to low. Stirring gently, you should almost immediately see the curds (white milk solids) and whey (the greenish liquid) separate. Don&#39;t fret, this is perfect! Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour the contents into the cheesecloth-lined colander. Gently rinse with cool water to get rid of the lemon flavor. At this point, you could squeeze out some of the liquid, and serve with some honey and some nuts, almost like a fresh ricotta! Grab the ends of the cheesecloth and twist the ball of cheese to squeeze out the excess whey. Tie the cheesecloth to your kitchen faucet and allow the cheese to drain for about 5 minutes. Twisting the ball to compact the cheese into a block, place it on a plate with the twisted part of the cheesecloth on the side (this will ensure your block of cheese is nice and smooth!) and set another plate on top. Weigh the second plate down with cans of beans or a heavy pot. Move to the refrigerator and let it sit about 20 minutes. Unwrap your beautiful disc of homemade cheese! You did it! You can now use this in any number of traditional Indian dishes, like saag paneer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 6241,&quot;Creamed Spinach 1/2 cup Hidden Valley?

Generously dust a work surface with flour and roll out 1 dough ball to 12 inches in diameter. (Keep the other dough covered.) Drape the dough round in the pan so the edges overhang by about 1 inch. (It&#39;s ok if it doesn&#39;t completely lay across the bottom of the pan, it will stretch as you add more layers.) Brush the edges with oil first to anchor them, then brush the rest of the dough. Roll another ball in the same way, lay it on top of the first and brush with oil the same way. Continue rolling, layering and brushing with 4 more balls of dough for a total of 6 layers, leaving the last layer unbrushed with oil. Gently spread the chard filling into the crust.<br> Crack one egg into a ramekin. Make a 2-inch-deep-by-2-inch-wide indentation in the filling 1 inch from the edge of the pan using the back of the handle of a wooden spoon. Slide the egg into the hole. Repeat the process with 4 more eggs, spacing them evenly around the pan. Do not put an egg in the center. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper.<br> Roll another ball of dough to 12 inches in diameter. Lay it over of the filling with a 1 1/2-inch overhang and brush with oil. Repeat with the remaining 5 balls of dough leaving the top layer unbrushed with oil. Trim the overhang to 1/2 inch.

For the nougat: Combine the peanut butter, vanilla and marshmallow cream in a large mixing bowl and reserve. Combine the sugar, cream and butter in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir with a heatproof spatula until the sugar dissolves. Fit the saucepan with a candy thermometer and continue monitoring until the mixture starts to turn a light amber color and the temperature reaches 250 degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes. Once your nougat hits 250 degrees F, remove from the heat and add to the marshmallow mixture. Mix together to completely combine, but don&#39;t overwork. The mixture should be light and fluffy. Turn out the nougat into the prepared pan and spread evenly with a rubber spatula coated in nonstick spray. Place in the refrigerator to cool and get going on your next layer, the caramel. For the caramel filling: Add the sugar, cream and corn syrup to a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Carefully stir to combine with a heatproof spatula until the sugar dissolves and bring the mixture to a boil. Stop stirring and boil until the mixture begins to turn an amber color and reaches 250 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, carefully, as it will foam up. (Adding the butter at the end will stop the cooking and keeps your caramel soft and chewy.) Keep stirring until it&#39;s all dissolved, and then stir in the peanuts. As tempting as it may be, never stick your finger in hot caramel to taste, sugar burns and hurts! Pour the caramel over the nougat and spread evenly with the spatula. Place in the refrigerator until the caramel is completely cool, 15 minutes. Transfer the candy to a cutting board. Cut lengthwise into thirds and then across in nine 1-inch rectangles, using a sharp knife that has been sprayed with nonstick spray. You can mark the caramel nougat with your knife as a guide before cutting out your bars. For the chocolate: Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted and is smooth, 8 to10 minutes. Dip each candy piece and completely cover with chocolate on all sides, using two forks, allowing the excess to drip off. Place on a wire cooling rack for the excess to drip off while you dip all of the bars. Once the bars are dipped, transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet and allow the chocolate to set in the fridge at least 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6291,&quot;Cold Cream of Watercress Soup 6 tablespoons olive oil 4 leeks, white parts only, thoroughly washed and chopped 3 bunches watercress, thoroughly washed, leaves separated from stems, stems chopped 6 cups chicken stock 5 medium baking potatoes, peeled and sliced Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup creme fraiche or 1/2 cup each heavy cream and sour cream 1 teaspoon lemon juice Instructions: Heat a large saucepan with olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the leeks and the watercress stems only and saute until wilted, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken stock and potatoes and season well with salt and pepper. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare an ice water bath by partially filling your largest mixing bowl with ice cubes and water. In batches to avoid overfilling and splattering, ladle the soup into a blender or food processor, adding some of the creme fraiche and watercress leaves with each batch and reserving about 2 dozen whole leaves for a garnish. Puree each batch and transfer to a fine-meshed strainer held over a large mixing bowl that fits inside the ice water bath, using a rubber spatula to press the puree through the strainer. Taste the puree, adjust the seasonings, if necessary, with more salt and pepper, and stir in the lemon juice. Place the bowl of soup inside the ice water bath and chill it until cool, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Remove the bowl of soup from the ice water bath, dry its underside, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Before serving, taste the soup.

While the dough is rising, prepare the remaining ingredients for the garlic knots and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Mix the butter with the thyme, rosemary, 2 tablespoons Parmesan and garlic. Turn the risen dough out onto a floured surface. Stretch the dough into a rectangle. Spread half of the butter mixture on half of the dough. Then fold the dough in half, covering the butter with the dough. Using a pizza wheel, divide the dough into 18 strips. First cut through the middle, then you can cut each half into 9 pieces. Stretch each strip and tie into a knot and tuck the ends underneath the center of the knot. Place the knots onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle the knots with some of the Parmesan and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over low heat, melt the remaining herb butter. Once the knots come out of the oven, baste them with the melted butter and sprinkle them with the remaining Parmesan. Serve warm and enjoy! In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom, about 5 minutes. Once bloomed, add the olive oil. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together, switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead, adding a bit more flour if needed, so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl, 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl, remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and, with floured hands, continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you&#39;d like! Cook&#39;s Notes: This dough is wet dough, keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough. Trust your gut as a chef, if the dough is to wet, add more flour, if it is too stiff, add a little water. Sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don&#39;t need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature, it should just feel warm to the touch. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 6311,&quot;Ultimate Pumpkin Pie 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 5 teaspoons sugar Salt 12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 15-ounce can pure pumpkin 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened Salt 3 large eggs, plus 1 egg white 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 cup pecans 1 cup fresh cranberries, or frozen, thawed and drained 1 2.3-ounce package amaretti cookies (about 12) Instructions: Make the crust: Combine the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt in a large bowl.

Drain potatoes and parsnips and return them to the hot pot. Add the milk or cream and mash. Stir in the parsley, and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, to taste. Meanwhile, put the meat in a bowl and add 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire, the egg, cracker crumbs, grated onion, salt and pepper, to taste. Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix meat to combine and form into 4 oval shaped loaves, no more than 1 1/2 inches thick and arrange them on a baking sheet. Drizzle with about 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and bake for 20 minutes. While meat is in oven, in a medium skillet over medium heat add the butter and melt, then add the onions and bay leaf and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook for 15 minutes, then add the garlic and sage and cook for another 3 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and stir 1 minute, then whisk in the stock, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire and season liberally with black pepper, to taste. Cook for 1 minute to thicken the sauce. Serve the steaks, on individual plates, whole or sliced with gravy on top, a mound of mashed potatoes and parsnips and 1 cup of watercress leaves alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 6313,&quot;Fudge Pops 3 cups milk 1/2 cup chocolate milk powder 2 tablespoons malted milk powder 2 tablespoons light corn syrup Instructions: In a blender combine the milk, chocolate milk powder, malt powder, and corn syrup and blend well. Pour into a popsicle mold with lids, insert wooden sticks, and then freeze. Notes about the recipe: Why buy these when they&#39;re so easy to make. And the kids can do it themselves, as long as you clean up the counter afterwards. Buy popsicle molds at specialty cookware shops or a large discount store like target in the summer. I used to ride my bike up town to the dairy store and buy these to keep me cool in the summer. We didn&#39;t have air conditioning so this was the alternative. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 6314,&quot;Crispy Asian Brussels Sprouts Salad One 16-ounce bag shaved Brussels sprouts 1/4 cup olive oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard Zest and juice of 1/2 orange 2 scallions, thinly sliced 1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds 1/2 cup fried wonton strips, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Saute until the chicken is cooked and the vegetables are soft. Add the oregano and cumin and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Deglaze the pan with the tequila and lime juice and let simmer until the liquid is almost evaporated. Remove from heat. Shred the chicken with 2 forks and let cool. Stir in the cilantro. Wrap the tortillas in paper towels and microwave for 2 minutes to make the tortillas pliable. Place about 4 tablespoons of the chicken mixture on 1 tortilla, roll tightly and close with a toothpick. In large cast iron skillet, heat 1/2 inch of canola oil to 350 degrees F. Cooking in batches, add the rolls to the hot oil, placing them seam-side down. Cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes, and turn to cook the other side until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels. Remove the toothpicks and serve with the Guacamole and Tomtillo Salsa. Place the avocados, jalapeno, red onion, tomato, beer, sour cream, lime juice, cilantro, salt and pepper in a blender and puree. Rub the tomatillos with oil; grill until browned all over.

For the summer rolls: Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a small pot and add the shrimp. Cook until the shrimp turn pink, about 2 minutes. Drain well and let the shrimp cool. Slice the shrimp in half lengthwise. Prepare the vermicelli according to package instructions and splash with mirin. Hold the noodles in the colander to allow the mirin to drain and the vermicelli to cool. Meanwhile, halve, pit, peel and slice the avocado into 1/4-inch slices. Peel, pit and slice the mango into thin strips and set aside. Fill a large bowl with warm water. Place a spring roll wrapper in the water and soak until soft, about 2 minutes. Gently transfer the wrapper to a dry board and blot excess water with a paper towel. The paper can rip easily if it soaks too long, so be sure to remove it from the soaking water as soon as it&#39;s pliable. Allowing the summer roll ingredients to chill before rolling produces best results. Starting an inch from the bottom of the wrapper, place 3 Thai basil leaves face down in a row. Next, place 3 shrimp face down in a row on the basil. Place 2 slices of avocado across the shrimp, top with some vermicelli and finish with 2 mango slices. Fold in the sides of the wrapper and roll tightly. Place the roll on a tray with the Thai basil-side up and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Serve the rolls with the cashew dipping sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 6318,&quot;Almond Logs 1/4 of the Ultimate Butter Cookie Dough 1 egg white, slightly beaten 1/4 cup finely chopped blanched almonds 1/4 cup sugar Instructions: Prepare the Ultimate Cookie Dough and divide it into four equal parts.

Roll into heaping-tablespoon-size balls. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes; remove to a plate. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook, turning, until browned all over, about 1 minute. (You might have to do this in 2 batches.) Pour in the marinara sauce and return the onion to the skillet; gently stir. Cover and simmer 20 minutes. When ready to serve, split the dinner rolls and sprinkle some mozzarella on the bottom rolls. Top each with a meatball, some sauce and more mozzarella and sandwich with the top rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 6323,&quot;Pork Lovers Baked Beans 2 tablespoons butter 1 large onion, diced<br> 1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped<br> 1 pound Mexican chorizo<br> Three 28-ounce cans baked beans<br> 1/2 cup mustard<br> 1/4 cup barbecue sauce<br> 1/4 cup ketchup<br> Several dashes hot sauce<br> 6 thin slices bacon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat and fry the onion and jalapeno for a couple of minutes. Add the chorizo and saute until almost cooked, about 5 minutes. Pour onto a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess grease from the chorizo. Pour the beans into a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. Add the mustard, barbecue sauce, ketchup and hot sauce. Add the chorizo mixture and stir it all together. Lay the bacon slices on top and bake until the beans are bubbly and the bacon is brown, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 6324,&quot;Fresh Corn \\Grits<br> 4 ears corn 1 large onion<br> 8 fresh thyme sprigs<br> 4 garlic cloves<br> 3 bay leaves<br> 1 tablespoon black peppercorns<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for coating the pan<br> Kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Pull back the husks from the corn to expose about 3 inches of the cob. Place the corn on a sheet pan. Quarter the onion and add it to the sheet pan. Roast until the husks start to brown and the corn is just cooked, about 20 minutes. Remove the husks and silks from the corn. Stand each cob on its end in another sheet pan and, holding the top, slice downward along the cob to remove the kernels. (Doing this over a sheet pan catches the kernels for you.) Set the kernels aside. Place the cobs, roasted onion, thyme sprigs, garlic, bay leaves and peppercorns in a pot and cover with water. (If you need to, snap the cobs in half to fit into the pot.) Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer for 45 minutes to make a stock. Place half of the corn kernels in a blender with one ladle of the developing stock and puree until smooth. Transfer the remaining kernels to a cutting board and roughly chop. Coat a large saute pan with some olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Add the chopped corn mixture to the pan and cook just to sweat and soften it, 3 to 5 minutes. Scoop up some of the roasted onion pieces from the stock and add to the corn mixture. Pour in the corn from the blender and 1 cup of the corn stock. Cook until the grits thicken to a porridge-like consistency, another 5 minutes or so. If they are too thick, add more stock; if too think, cook them a bit longer. Season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 6325,&quot;Positively, Absolutely, Not Real Bouillabaisse 1 pound raw fish heads, bones, tail, and lobster tail shell 4 whole fresh bay leaves 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns 6 cups water 1/2 cup olive oil, divided 6 ounces onion, coarsely chopped 3 ounces fennel bulb, coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt, divided 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped 1 (3-inch) piece orange peel, optional 1/16 teaspoon saffron 8 ounces firm fish fillets, such as farmed cobia or wild striped bass (1 or 2 types), skin and bones removed, cut into 1-inch pieces, at room temperature 8 ounces flaky fish fillets, such as black cod, wild halibut, or black rockfish (1 or 2 types), skin and bones removed, cut into 1-inch pieces, at room temperature 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 8 ounces mussels, cleaned and beards trimmed, at room temperature 1 large raw lobster tail, shell removed and meat cut into 1-inch pieces, at room temperature 1 baguette, sliced 1 clove garlic, cut in half 1 recipe Rouille, recipe follows, optional 1 large red bell pepper 3 large cloves garlic, peeled 1 fresh red cl, stem removed and seeded 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt 1/2 cup olive oil Instructions: For the fish stock: Rinse the fish heads and place in a tall 6-quart pot with tails, bones, lobster shell, bay leaves, 1 teaspoon sea salt, black peppercorns, and water.

Remove the pot from the heat, add the mussels and lobster, cover, and let stand until the fish is cooked through and the mussels open, 2 to 4 minutes. Discard any unopened mussels. To serve: Set the broiler to high. Lightly rub the baguette slices on both sides with the garlic. Place the prepared bread slices on a half sheet pan and broil, 1 inch away from the broiler, for 1 to 2 minutes. Turn the slices over and broil for another 1 to 2 minutes. Top with Rouille, if desired, and serve with fish stew. Cook the bell pepper over a gas burner set to high, turning every few minutes, until the skin blackens and is thoroughly charred. Remove the pepper to a metal mixing bowl, cover with a spare pot lid, and cool for 5 minutes. Remove the blackened skin from the pepper by rubbing with a clean kitchen towel. Pull out the stem and seed cluster and discard along with the skin. Place the roasted and skinned pepper, garlic, cl, lemon juice, and salt in the bowl of a mini-food processor. Process until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Stop and scrape down the side of the bowl once or twice. With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until thick.

Add the mushrooms and cook until they are tender and give up their juices. (While the mushrooms are cooling, begin sauteing the bacon in a separate skillet for the potatoes.) Add the merlot and cook for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate small bowl, make a slurry with 1 tablespoon water and the cornstarch, then add the tomato paste and Dijon mustard and mix thoroughly until smooth. Add this mixture to the pan of mushrooms along with demi-glace and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Turn heat down to medium-low, and allow to reduce and thicken. White the mushrooms are cooking, heat the oil in the deep-fryer to 375 degrees F or according the manufacturer&#39;s instructions for potatoes. Saute the bacon strips in a skillet until crispy. Remove to paper towels to drain and cool to room temperature. Drain excess bacon fat from the skillet leaving a coating in which to saute the onion. Cook until the onion becomes translucent. Deep-fry the baby potato slices until golden and drain on paper towels. Transfer them to the pan of onions, and crumble in the bacon. Toss in the scallions and season with salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F for the steak, if you are finishing in the oven. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet with oven-safe handles. Season the steaks with salt and pepper and sear for about 2 minutes per side undisturbed (to let seasonings integrate into the surface of the meat) and then to your preferred level of doneness. Transfer the entire skillet to the oven to finish (about 10 minutes for medium- rare) They can also be cooked on a grill. Let steaks rest, then slice into 1/4-inch thick slices.

Whisk in the club soda and a pinch of salt. Gradually whisk in the flour and mix until just combined, then whisk in the melted butter. The mixture should be the consistency of really thin pancake batter. If it&#39;s a little thick, add a little more milk. Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes before using. (HINT, HINT: Crepe batter can be made up to a couple days ahead and refrigerated.) For the cherry compote: In a medium saucepan, combine the cherries, granulated sugar, lemon zest and juice and 1/2 cup water. Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook until the cherries release their juices and the liquid concentrates and becomes slightly syrupy, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve. For the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the mascarpone, chocolate chips, granulated sugar and cinnamon. Stir to combine and reserve. To make the crepes: In a small nonstick saute pan, melt 1?2 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Swirl the butter around to coat the bottom of the pan. Wipe out any excess with a paper towel, saving the paper towel to use again--you will. Slowly ladle 1 1/2 to 2 ounces of crepe batter into the pan, tipping and rolling the pan around to allow the batter to evenly coat the bottom. It will take a little practice to get the motion of the ocean, the correct temperature of the pan and the proper amount of batter. Even for an experienced crepe maker, it takes a couple tries to get into the groove. The first few crepes always get tossed--accept it and move on. When the edges of the crepe begin to pull away from the pan and the bottom begins to brown, turn over the crepe and cook for 1 more minute. Remove the crepe from the pan, let cool and set aside in a stack separated by layers of parchment paper to keep the crepes from sticking together. Repeat this process with the remaining batter, wiping the pan with the paper towel or adding more butter as needed--once you get into the swing of things it&#39;s fast and fun! To assemble: Place a couple tablespoons of the mascarpone filling in the middle of each crepe and spread the filling over half the crepe in an even layer. Roll around the filling to seal. Place 2 filled crepes on each serving plate and spoon the warm cherry compote over the top. Dust with powdered sugar and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 6378,&quot;Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi with Avocado Salsa 2 cups heavy mayonnaise 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 cup olive oil One 46-ounce can pineapple juice 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Four 8-ounce fillets mahi-mahi 3 tomatoes, diced 2 avocados, diced 1 medium red onion, diced 1/4 cup cut pineapple 1/2 cup diced jalape?os 1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped 1/4 cup Key lime juice Salt and pepper Two 8-ounce cans black beans 3 tablespoons butter, melted 2 cups cooked quinoa Instructions: In a blender, mix the mayonnaise, garlic and 1/4 cup olive oil.

Preheat a pizza stone or baking steel in the oven to 500 degrees F or as high as your oven will go for 1 hour before baking. Spread the mozzarella on the base of the pizza crust. Top with the rib-eye and as many scallions as you like. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the beef begins to caramelize and cook through, 8 to 10 minutes. Toss the arugula with some chili vinaigrette to taste. Remove the pizza from the oven, slice into 6 pieces and top with the arugula. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve. Combine the flour and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook. Add 1 3/4 cups of the water (reserving 1/4 cup to add if necessary) and mix on low speed for 1 minute. Add the salt and continue to mix for another 3 minutes, adding reserved water if the dough seems dry. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, then mix again on medium-low speed until the dough no longer sticks to the side of the bowl, about 2 minutes. The dough should still be tacky to the touch, but not too wet and sticky that it does not hold its shape. If the dough is still too dry, slowly add water 1 tablespoon at a time. If it is too wet, gradually mix in flour by the tablespoon until you reach the desired consistency. Do not overmix the dough. Transfer the dough to a well-floured counter and begin to gently roll the dough into a ball. Using a sharp knife, cut 6- or 9-ounce pieces and form into a tight ball (6-ounce dough ball for a 10-inch crust and 9-ounce dough ball for a 12-inch crust). Place the dough balls on a baking sheet covered in olive oil or cooking spray to prevent them from sticking to the sheet. Brush the dough balls with additional olive oil. Cover the dough balls in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then place the dough balls in the refrigerator and let them rest 24 hours. The next day, remove the dough balls and let sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours prior to making pizzas. Push out the dough by hand or use a rolling pin until you reach the desired shape. Place the crust onto a well-floured pizza peel and top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 6400,&quot;Stuffed Crab Claws 1 pound shrimp, shelled, deveined, and chopped 5 ounces bamboo shoots, chopped 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder 1 teaspoon sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon pepper 8 teaspoons cornstarch 10 cocktail crab claws 3/4 cup bread crumbs 6 cups frying oil Instructions: In a large bowl, mix the chopped shrimp, bamboo shoots, salt, chicken bouillon powder, sugar, sesame oil, pepper, and cornstarch into a thick shrimp paste. Form the shrimp paste into 10 oval shaped balls. Open one end of the ball to stuff in the crab claw. Make sure the shrimp ball only covers the meat part of the claw and a small part of the shell so that the claw shell will stick out of the shrimp ball like a drumstick. Roll the stuffed shrimp ball in the bread crumbs. Deep fry in 350 degree oil for 5 minutes or until golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6401,&quot;Vegetable Sushi 1 1/4 pounds sushi rice (2 3/4 cups) 3 cups water 1/4 cup mirin, plus additional for moistening nori 5 sheets nori (1 package) 4 teaspoons wasabi powder, mixed with 2 teaspoons water 1/2 cup small-diced red onion 1 carrot, julienned 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1 yellow bell pepper, julienned 1 scallion, julienned (green part only) 1 hothouse cucumber, seeded and julienned 1 (10-ounce) jar pickled ginger 1/2 teaspoon wasabi powder 1/4 teaspoon water 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 teaspoon minced pickled ginger 1 teaspoon minced scallion (green part only) 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 3 tablespoons good soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon dark sesame oil Instructions: Place the rice in a strainer and rinse under cold running water until the water is fairly clear, about 5 minutes. Shake the water out and allow the rice to dry in the strainer for 15 minutes. Put the rice in a pot with exactly 3 cups of water and cook covered over high heat until it starts to foam, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and sprinkle with 1/4 cup mirin. Replace the lid and allow the rice to steam for 15 minutes. Place in a bowl and cool to room temperature. To prepare the sushi, place a bamboo sushi roller flat on a table with the bamboo reeds horizontal to you. Sprinkle lightly with water. Place 1 nori sheet on top, smooth side down, and moisten lightly with mirin. With damp hands, press 1 1/4 cups rice flat on top of the nori, leaving 1 1/2-inch edges on the top and bottom, but pressing all the way to the sides. Make sure the rice is pressed even and smooth. Spread 1/4 teaspoon of wasabi paste in a horizontal stripe near the lower edge of the rice. Over the wasabi, lightly sprinkle the red onions in a horizontal stripe. Place strips of carrots in a horizontal stripe, on top of the wasabi and onions, and follow by piling the red and yellow peppers, scallions, and cucumbers on top, making a tight, straight bundle of vegetables. Place 1 layer of pickled ginger slices on top. To roll the sushi, pick up the near edge of the bamboo roller and hold it with the nori, then pull them up and over the vegetable bundle until the nori reaches the rice on the other side. Press the roller to make a round bundle, then roll the bundle to the far edge of the nori and press again to make a round bundle. (The nori should totally enclose the rice and vegetables in a round tube, but the ends will have rice and vegetables sticking out.) Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients. Keep the rolls under a damp towel and refrigerate until ready to serve. To serve, slice off the ends with a very sharp knife and slice each roll into 8 equal pieces. Meanwhile, for the sushi dipping sauce, combine the wasabi powder and water to make a paste. Mix in the red pepper flakes, ginger, scallions, vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Serve the sushi at room temperature with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 6402,&quot;Roasted Peanut Milk Chocolate Ganache and Jelly Confection 8 ounces strawberry jam 8 ounces liquid pectin 8 ounces dry roasted peanuts 4 ounces agave syrup 2 ounces heavy cream 1/2 ounce milk chocolate 3/4 ounces heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon sugar Fresh cheese curds, for garnish Vanilla syrup, for drizzling Instructions: For the jelly confection: In a 1-quart saucepan, heat the strawberry jam and liquid pectin together until smooth and lump free.

Place the mixture in a medium bowl, add remaining filling ingredients and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. To make the dough, in a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt and whisk to combine. Add the butter and blend with your fingertips until most of mixture resembles coarse meal. In a medium bowl, beat the egg, milk and vanilla together. Add to the dry mixture and stir to make a rough dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cut the dough into 4 pieces, cover, and refrigerate for 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets. On a lightly floured surface, one at a time, roll out each piece of dough into a 12-inch square. Cut the dough into 4 by 3-inch rectangles. Spoon 2 tablespoons of filling down the center of each rectangle. Fold the long sides of each rectangle inward to the center to enclose the filling; pinch the edges to seal. Turn the cookies seam-sides down and press gently to flatten the seams. With a floured knife, cut the logs crosswise into 1 1/2-inch-wide slices and arrange 1/2-inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Brush with egg wash and decorate with colored sprinkles.

Trim off any dark bits of stem. Submerge the radicchio quarters in ice water for 1 hour to remove some bitterness. Put a plate on top of the radicchio to keep them under water. In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients except the mozzarella. Mix well. Prepare a hot fire in your grill, or heat a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Drain the radicchio and place them on paper towels to absorb remaining water. Open up the leaves and spoon the olive oil mixture inside. Place the radicchio quarters on a baking sheet and pour the remaining marinade mixture. Season generously with salt and pepper. Grill the radicchio until browned on the outside but still raw in the center, 3 to 5 minutes, turning occasionally. Be careful, as the oil mixture may flame up. When the radicchio begins to brown, pull from the grill, open up a section of each portion and place a slice of mozzarella inside. Place quarters back onto the sheet pan and place the pan directly on the grill for 5 minutes to melt the cheese. Drizzle any leftover dressing over the top of the grilled radicchio and serve warm. If making radicchio in advance: Before the party, have the radicchio drained and marinated in the vinaigrette in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6405,&quot;Jerk Plantain Chips 3 green plantains Coconut oil spray 1 tablespoon jerk seasoning<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Fill a high-sided pot with a lid with 3 gallons water, then mix in 1 cup of the salt and bring to a rolling boil. Place the lobsters in the boiling water and cover the pot with the lid. Cook the lobsters for 8 minutes, and then remove them from the water and cool down the lobsters in the prepared ice bath. To remove the meat, pull the tail off of the body and break off the rear tail fins. Pull the tail meat out of the body-end of the tail using a fork. (The tail meat may not be totally opaque white like the claw meat will be. That is OK, it is properly cooked and in order for the tail to be tender it needs to be slightly less cooked than the claw meat). Cut the lobster tail into large chunks. Next, pull the bottom part of each claw directly down detaching it from the claw; if done correctly this will remove the cartilage from the claws. Then crack the claws and remove the meat. To remove the knuckle pieces, separate the sections and use a lobster pick to remove the pieces. Finally, remove the legs and line them up with the claws facing you. Cover with plastic wrap and use a rolling pin to push the leg meat out starting at the claws and rolling away from you. Repeat for the remaining lobsters. Heat a griddle or saute pan over high heat until it begins to smoke and then turn the heat down to medium-high. Spread some butter on both sides of each hot dog bun. Toast the buns on the hot griddle until golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Once toasted, remove from the heat and split the buns open, and then hold for plating. In a bowl, combine the lobster, mayonnaise, remaining teaspoon of salt, the pepper and lemon juice, and gently mix to coat the lobster but not break up the meat. To plate the lobster roll, place one piece of the hot dog bun on the plate with a lettuce leaf on top. Spoon 4 1/2 ounces of lobster salad on top of the lettuce leaf and then top with the other side of the hot dog roll. Repeat for the remaining rolls, and serve each with a lemon wedge. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6418,&quot;Creamy Escarole and White Bean Dip 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 3 cloves garlic, very thinly sliced 1 medium head escarole (about 12 ounces), hand-torn into large pieces 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 15-ounce can cannellini beans (do not drain) Kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary Fresh lemon juice, to taste Crackers and/or crudites, for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large high-sided saute pan over low heat. Add the garlic and cook until just starting to soften, about 1 minute. Increase the heat to medium; add the escarole and cook until just wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the white wine, 1/2 cup water, the cannellini beans (with the liquid from the can) and a large pinch of salt. Bring to a strong boil over medium-high heat and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the rosemary and cook until there is only a light coating of liquid at the bottom of the pan, about 5 more minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool at least 15 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and blend until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed (the mixture should look similar to the texture of spinach dip). Spoon into a medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 2 hours. Before serving, season the dip with lemon juice and more salt to taste. Drizzle with olive oil. Serve with crackers and/or crudites. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 6419,&quot;Healthy Grilled Summer Vegetable Spaghetti Foil Pack 2 medium juicy tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch chunks 1 small Japanese eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch chunks 1 small zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch chunks 1/4 cup sundried tomato pesto 12 oil-cured olives, pitted and roughly chopped 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper Kosher salt 1 cup dry white wine 8 ounces whole-wheat spaghetti, broken into thirds 8 tablespoons grated Parmesan 1 large handful fresh basil leaves, roughly torn Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium heat. Toss together the tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, pesto, olives, garlic, olive oil, crushed red pepper and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Combine the wine with 2 cups water in a large measuring cup or bowl. Tear four 16-inch pieces of 18-inch-wide heavy duty foil and arrange on a work surface. Evenly divide the spaghetti among the 4 pieces of foil, placing it in the center of each piece and leaving plenty of room on the short ends. Evenly divide the vegetable mixture among the foil, spooning it on top of the spaghetti. Fold up the sides and ends of each piece of foil to make a canoe shape. Pour 3/4 cup of the wine mixture into each packet. Keeping the folded sides up, tightly crimp the edges together so the packets remain canoe-shaped. This will prevent leaking and allow for space at the top of each packet. Put the packets on the grill, close the grill lid and cook 24 minutes, changing the position of the packets on the grill about halfway through. Remove from the grill and let rest for 10 minutes. Carefully open each packet. The pasta should be al dente and the vegetable mixture saucy. Stir 2 tablespoons Parmesan into each serving. Transfer the pasta and sauce to 4 serving bowls and top with the basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6420,&quot;Grilled Giardiniera Salad Vegetable oil, for oiling the grill grates 2 cups white wine vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1 teaspoon whole peppercorns<br> 4 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 3 cups mini rainbow peppers<br> 4 medium carrots, peeled<br> 4 serrano peppers<br> 1 small head cauliflower, cut into 1-inch-thick steaks<br> 2 stalks celery, leaves reserved<br> 3/4 cup olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 cup ricotta salata, grated<br> 1 cup pitted black olives, halved<br> Grilled Italian sausage and hoagie rolls for serving, optional<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill for cooking on high heat. Clean and oil the grates with vegetable oil. Combine the vinegar, salt, sugar, oregano, peppercorns, garlic and 1 cup water in a small pot. Bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally, to make sure the sugar and salt are dissolved. Let cool completely. Place the rainbow peppers, carrots, serrano peppers and cauliflower steaks directly on the grill (do not grill the celery; keep it raw!). Grill until charred with grill marks, about 5 minutes a side. Set aside to cool on a wire-racked sheet pan. Once cooled, it&#39;s time to chop! Slice the carrots and celery 1/2-inch-thick on a sharp 45-degree angle bias. Keep the rainbow peppers and serranos whole. Cut the cauliflower florets off the woody stems and trim into individual 1-inch florets. Place the chopped veggies into a 1-gallon resealable bag or container. Pour the vinegar mixture directly on the veggies. Stir around and let sit in the fridge at least 3 hours, but ideally overnight. Drain the veggies from the brine and place on a paper towel-lined sheet pan. Reserve the brine. Arrange the pickled veggies in groups on a large, long platter, in other words, carrots, then peppers, then celery. Whisk together 3/4 cup of the brine with the olive oil and Dijon in a bowl until combined. Season to taste. Drizzle the vinaigrette over the veggies and top with the ricotta salata, celery leaves and olives.

Meanwhile, gently toss together the chuck and sirloin in a large bowl, making sure not to overwork the mixture. Combine the paprika, coriander, cumin, garlic, mint, brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle the spice mixture over the beef; add the crumbled feta and fold gently to combine. Form the beef into four 3/4-inch-thick patties, each about 4 inches in diameter. Sprinkle both sides generously with salt and a few grinds of pepper. Place the patties in the hot skillet; do not press down with a spatula. When the patties are seared and browned on one side, flip and cook on the other side until browned, about 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Assemble the burgers using your favorite buns, toppings and condiments. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 6458,&quot;Peach Salsa 12 cloves garlic 6 red onions<br> 6 jalapenos<br> 6 red bell peppers<br> 3 teaspoons chili powder<br> 3 teaspoons kosher salt 3 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 12 limes<br> Three #10 cans (106 ounces each) peaches in syrup, drained (retain the syrup in case needed) 12 cups fresh cilantro, chopped Instructions: Divide the ingredients (except for the peaches and cilantro) into 3 batches so they will fit into a food processor. For each batch, halve or quarter 4 cloves garlic, 2 onions, 2 jalapenos and 2 bell peppers and throw into a food processor. Add 1 teaspoon each chili powder, salt and pepper. Squeeze in the juice from 4 limes and pulse. Pour the salsa into a very large container and repeat with the remaining 2 batches. Cut the peaches into small chunks, add to the salsa and mix. Mix in the cilantro. If your salsa is a little thick, loosen it with some of the syrup from the peaches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 6459,&quot;Double-Fried French Fries 4 (4 to 5-inches long) russet potatoes (about 2 pounds) 2 quarts canola oil 1 tablespoons fine-grain sea salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Peel potatoes on the sides, leaving the ends with the skin on. Cut the potatoes into 1/3-inch slices and then slice into 1/3-inch sticks. Fill a large bowl with water and soak potatoes, submerged, for at least 30 minutes up to 24 hours. This will help remove the excess starch from the potatoes and keep them from oxidizing. Heat a heavy stock pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer with oil to 325 degrees F. Remove potatoes from the water, and pat dry to remove excess water. Add 2 handfuls of potatoes to hot oil. There should be at least 1-inch of oil above the potatoes. Par cook until potatoes are light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove potatoes, gently shaking off excess oil and let drain on rack. Repeat until all of the potatoes are par cooked. Raise heat of oil to 350 degrees F. Cook potatoes again, 2 handfuls at a time, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from oil, shake off excess oil, and season lightly in a bowl with salt and pepper. Repeat until all potatoes are cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6460,&quot;Taffy Pull 1 1/2 cups sugar 3/4 cup light corn syrup 2/3 cup water 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon vegetable glycerin (sold at most party or natural food stores) 2 tablespoons butter 2 teaspoons lemon juice Instructions: In a large saucepan, stir together the sugar, corn syrup, water, salt, and glycerin with a wooden spoon. Cook over medium heat, stirring now and then until a candy thermometer reads 255 degrees F. Stir in the butter. Pour the mixture onto a greased flat pan and fold over the edges with a spatula to keep them from hardening. When the candy is cool enough to handle, brush with lemon juice. Kids grease their hands with butter, take a lump of taffy, and pull and stretch it until it is light and slightly firm. The longer they stretch, pull, and twist the candy, the more air it will have and the closer to beach taffy it will get. The lump can then be cut with scissors into bite-size pieces. When cool, wrap in waxed paper. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 6461,&quot;Smoked Paprika and Bacon Popcorn 4 cups air-popped popcorn 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 4 strips bacon, cooked crisp and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, plus 2 tablespoons bacon fat<br> Sea salt Instructions: Place the popcorn in a large bowl.

Brush 4 to 6 individual souffle dishes (or a 7-cup souffle dish) well with melted butter. Put the sugar inside one dish and toss to coat, then tip the excess sugar into the next dish and repeat. Place the dishes in the refrigerator to chill. Reserving 1/3 cup of the milk, place the remaining 1 cup in a large saucepan. Add the vanilla bean and heat just to a boil, then turn off the heat and set aside to let the vanilla bean infuse for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk the 1/3 cup granulated sugar, the flour, and the reserved 1/3 cup milk. Add a little of the hot milk and whisk to combine, then add the flour mixture to the hot milk mixture in the saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally. Simmer just until thickened, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat. Add the butter, stir, cover, and set aside 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and whisk in the egg yolks. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg whites in a clean dry bowl until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar and continue whipping until stiff and glossy. Fold into the milk mixture. Pour the mixture into the prepared dishes, filling them 3/4 full. Run your thumb around the inside rim of each dish, making a shallow \\moat\\ around the edge of the batter. This will help the souffles to rise straight up. Dust the surfaces with confectioners&#39; sugar. (The souffles can stand at this point for up to 30 minutes.) Bake in the center of the oven until puffed and light golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Do not open the oven door unless absolutely necessary. Satin Chocolate Sauce: Combine the 2 chocolates over simmering water in the top half of a double boiler. Stir constantly until melted, then whisk in the syrup and water without removing the double boiler from the heat. Whisk until smooth and shiny. (The sauce can be made up to 48 hours in advance and refrigerated. To rewarm, stir over low heat or heat in a microwave.) At the table, serve the hot souffles by poking a hole in each one and pouring chocolate sauce into the hole, then drizzling sauce over the tops. For a large souffle, spoon onto dessert plates and drizzle sauce on each serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 6466,&quot;Tomato Cucumber and Papaya Salad 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 1/2 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 large ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges 2 English cucumbers, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch thick slices 1 papaya, peeled, diced large and seeds reserved Instructions: In a mixing bowl whisk vinegar while slowly adding olive oil.

In a flat dish, crack eggs and add milk, vanilla extract and cinnamon. Whisk until well combined then lay challah slices in mixture to coat and absorb it all, turning occasionally. Set a 10-inch skillet, seasoned cast iron if you have, over medium heat. Add the butter and 1 cup sugar and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar has melted and caramelized, about 8 minutes. While the sugar is melting, peel apples, core and cut into halves. Remove from heat and gently whisk in the heavy cream. Sprinkle in the pecans, dried cranberries and gently press in the apple halves so there is a flat surface. Lay soaked slices of challah over the top so it is completely covered - you should be able to arrange the large slices and small slices so there are no gaps. Sprinkle the top with some brown sugar and place into the preheated oven. Bake in the middle of the oven for 40 to 45 minutes until the top is golden and puffy. When done, allow to cool for 2 to 3 minutes then invert onto a large plate.

For the dough: In a cup, add 1/4 cup cold water and the sazon. Stir to dissolve and set aside. In a food processor, add the flour, butter and salt. Then pulse until the butter is in small pebbles throughout the flour. Slowly add the seasoned water in a stream while pulsing until dough comes together. Remove the dough from the processor, form in to a ball and flatten it into a disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator while you make the filling.<br> For the filling: In a pot, add the chicken, half of the thyme, the smashed garlic cloves and fill the pot with enough water to cover the chicken by an inch. Sprinkle with a nice pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Then lower to a simmer and cook until the chicken reaches internal temperature of 165 degrees F, or juices run clear when punctured, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the chicken parts from the water and rest on a plate to cool. Reserve 1/4 cup of the poaching liquid.<br> Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, add the butter, oil, sliced garlic, serrano pepper, the remaining thyme, sazon, cumin, and season with a pinch of salt and few grinds of pepper. Saute while stirring until the pan is fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the frozen blend and reserved poaching liquid. Turn up the heat to create steam and continue stirring until the vegetable blend is cooked, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the flour in sprinkles and stir to combine. Then add the milk. Allow to simmer and thicken about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Meanwhile, remove the dough from the refrigerator and sprinkle a flat surface with flour. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough into a circle about 1/8-inch thick. Using a knife or pizza wheel, trim the edges. Center the dough in a 8 or 9-inch pie dish, allowing the excess dough to drape over the edges.<br> Remove the skin from the poached chicken, pull the meat from the bones and shred or chop. Stir into the pot along with the crema. Pour the filling into the dough. Flap the excess edges over the top of the pie, making sure to not overlap too much dough at the joints. This amount of dough leaves a hole in the center to vent. In a small bowl, whisk the egg and a splash of water. Brush the egg wash gently on the top of the pie dough.<br> Bake until the crust is golden brown and the insides are bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 6473,&quot;Grilled Strawberry-Lime Mezcal Margarita 4 limes, halved, plus fresh lime juice for rimming, optional 10 strawberries, stems removed, skewered<br> Kosher salt, optional<br> 2 ounces triple sec, plus more for rimming, optional 1/4 cup agave syrup<br> 4 ounces mezcal<br> Garnish: 2 fresh strawberries or lime wedges or wheels Instructions: Preheat a grill to high.

Whisk together eggs and hot sauce in a bowl. Add flour to a separate bowl. Add chicken pieces first to egg mixture, then transfer to flour, coating every nook and cranny. Remove any excess flour from chicken and transfer to a sheet tray. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 300 degrees F. Add chicken thigh and breast and let cook 3 minutes, then add the wing and drumstick. Let cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of each piece (not touching bone) registers 160 degrees F, about 9 minutes more. Let cool. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) For General&#39;s sauce: Heat soy oil in a wok (or medium saucepot) and add ginger. Cook until water from ginger is evaporated, then add garlic and cook until aromatic. Add sugar little by little, stirring continuously, and cook over medium heat until a caramel color is reached, about 20 minutes. Add Shaoxing wine and allow the alcohol to evaporate. Add vinegar and arbol cl. Turn down heat and let simmer while making slurry. For the slurry: Add soy sauce and mushroom seasoning to a small bowl and very slowly whisk in cornstarch. If the mixture seems too thick, add a bit of white vinegar to dilute. Slowly, whisk slurry mixture into wok, and cook until slurry has thickened the sauce like a proper maple syrup and the cornstarch chalkiness has left completely. Bring the oil in the deep-fryer back to 350 degrees F. Fry all chicken pieces together again until skin is golden brown, crispy, and delicious.

Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 6483,&quot;Raspberry Baked Alaska 1 (1-pound) store-bought pound cake 1 pint good raspberry sorbet, such as Ciao Bella<br> 1 pint good vanilla ice cream, such as Haagen-Dazs<br> 8 extra-large egg whites 1 1/2 cups sugar<br> 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Fresh Raspberry Sauce, recipe follows 1 (6-ounce) package fresh raspberries 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1 cup (12 ounces) seedless raspberry jam, such as Tiptree<br> 1 tablespoon framboise liqueur<br> Instructions: Slice the cake into six 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cut six (2 1/2-inch) circles--one from each slice--with an unfluted round cookie cutter, discarding the scraps. (You can also use a small knife.) Place the cake rounds 2 inches apart on a flat dish that will fit in your freezer. Soften the sorbet and ice cream just enough to be able to scoop them with a standard 2 1/4-inch-diameter ice cream scoop (15 to 30 seconds in the microwave works). Fill half the scoop with raspberry sorbet and the rest of the scoop with vanilla ice cream and place an ice cream ball, flat side down, in the middle of each cake round. Freeze for at least 30 minutes, until the ice cream is very hard. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. To make the Swiss meringue, place the egg whites and sugar in a heat-proof glass bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk the mixture almost constantly, until it reaches 120 degrees F on a candy thermometer and the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add the vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt and beat on medium speed for one minute, then on high speed for 5 minutes, until the egg whites form stiff, glossy peaks. Transfer the cake rounds and ice cream to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Working quickly, spread the meringue with a spoon or small spatula, making lots of peaks all over with the back of the spoon. (You can also use a pastry bag fitted with a large fluted tip and pipe the meringue thickly around each ball of ice cream and cake.) Be sure all of the ice cream is covered with meringue. Bake for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, until the edges of the meringues are browned, turning the pan once to brown evenly. Transfer to dessert plates, drizzle Fresh Raspberry Sauce around each baked Alaska, and serve immediately. Place the raspberries, sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 4 minutes. Pour the cooked raspberries, the jam, and the framboise into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until smooth. Pour into a container and chill. The sauce can be refrigerated for up to one week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 6484,&quot;Linzer Heart Sandwich Cookies 2 2 1/2 sticks lightly salted butter 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional flour for rolling the cookies 1/2 cup slivered almonds, ground 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 cup seedless raspberry jam Powdered sugar, optional Instructions: For the cookie batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the butter until smooth. Add the sugar and continue mixing until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, 5 to 8 minutes.<br> In another bowl, combine and mix the flour, almonds, cinnamon and nutmeg.<br> Mix and roll the cookies: Because this dough has a good amount of butter, it needs resting time and needs to be rolled fairly quickly. Lay 3 large pieces of wax paper in a single layer on a flat surface. Sprinkle each one with a light coating of flour. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using a rubber spatula, blend the flour mixture in with the butter. When the ingredients are fully integrated, place one-third of the batter on each of the pieces of wax paper. Coat with another light layer of flour and top with another piece of wax paper of the same length to make 3 dough \\sandwiches.\\ Press these wax paper and dough sandwiches down with your hands until the dough is fairly thin. This will save a lot of time on rolling later on. Place 2 of them in the refrigerator and work with them one at a time. Roll the first batch into as neat a shape as possible. What matters most is avoiding creases or cracks and getting it to about 1/8 inch in thickness. When the first is rolled, refrigerate it and repeat the same process for the other 2. Let them chill at least 10 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Make the cookie bottoms: Remove the first rolled sheet from the refrigerator and cut as many 1 1/2-inch hearts (or rounds) as you can. Reserve the scraps in the refrigerator. Arrange the hearts neatly in a single layer on a greased baking sheet. Repeat with the other 2 sheets, reserving any scraps.<br> Make the cookie tops: Cut a heart, with the smaller cutter, out of the center of half of all the cookies. Roll the scraps in between 2 of the pieces of wax paper and cut additional hearts, if desired.<br> Bake and assemble the cookie sandwiches: Bake the cookies until they are lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the trays from the oven and allow them to cool slightly on the tray for a few minutes before gently transferring them to a flat surface.<br> Place the raspberry jam in a small pot and bring it to a light simmer. Remove from the heat to cool slightly as well. Spoon 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon raspberry jam on each bottom and place a top heart on squarely on each. Dust with powdered sugar if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6485,&quot;Six Layers and a Chip Dip 2 cloves garlic 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed 1 (15-ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed 2 teaspoons chili powder 2 tablespoons water 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups low-fat shredded Cheddar 2 ripe avocados, preferably Hass 1 jalapeno, stemmed, finely chopped, (with seeds for more heat) 2 cups chopped romaine lettuce 1 1/2 cups nonfat yogurt, preferably Greek 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, leaves and some stems, roughly chopped, plus more for garnish 3 ripe medium tomatoes, diced 5 scallions (white and green), thinly sliced Baked tortilla chips, for dipping Instructions: On a cutting board, smash the garlic cloves, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the salt, and, with the flat side of a large knife, mash and smear the mixture to a coarse paste. Put the garlic, beans, chili powder, water, and olive oil in the bowl of a food processor and blend until smooth. Spread in the bottom of a 2-quart casserole or gratin dish, or in individual sized dishes, as desired. Scatter the cheese over the beans. Halve and seed the avocados, then mash with the jalapeno and another teaspoon of salt in a small bowl. Spread a layer of the avocado over the cheese, and then scatter the lettuce on top. Mix the yogurt with the cilantro and then spread over the lettuce. Add a layer of tomatoes and, finally, scatter the scallions on top. Chill until ready to serve. Garnish with a few cilantro sprigs and serve with baked chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 6486,&quot;Shrimp N&#39; Grits 1 cup whole milk 1 cup chicken stock<br> 1/2 cup yellow stone-ground grits<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1/8 cup heavy cream<br> 1 ounce unsalted butter<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 1/2 ounces country ham, julienned 2 ounces julienned red onions 8 shrimp<br> 1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning<br> Small pinch salt Small pinch ground black pepper 2 ounces beer (cheap draft)<br> 2 ounces rich veal stock<br> 1 ounce fresh cherry tomatoes<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> Big pinch chopped green onions Instructions: For the grits: Bring the milk and stock just to a simmer in a heavy saucepan. Meanwhile, cover the grits with water in a large bowl and whisk vigorously. Let stand 30 seconds, then skim off any chaff that has floated to surface with a fine-mesh sieve. Drain the grits well in a fine-mesh sieve and whisk into the simmering milk mixture. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the grits, partially covered, stirring often with a heatproof rubber spatula, until tender and thickened to the consistency of loose oatmeal, about 1 hour (stir more towards the end of cooking to avoid scorching). Season with the salt and pepper. If the grits become too thick before they are tender and creamy, thin with milk or cream. Stir in the cream and butter. Remove from the heat and keep warm. For the shrimp: Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat and render the country ham until crispy and lightly browned. Add the onions and cook for another minute. Turn the heat to high, add the shrimp and saute quickly, giving color to the shrimp. Season with the steak seasoning, salt and pepper. Pour in the beer and let burn off until reduced by half, 30 to 45 seconds. Add the veal stock and tomatoes and cook for another minute. As soon as the shrimp are cooked, remove from the heat immediately to keep from over-cooking and stir in the butter to richen the broth. Place a large dollop of grits in the center of a plate and top with the shrimp and everything in the pan. Top with the green onions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 6487,&quot;Tom&#39;s Mellow Melon Margarita 1-1/2 oz.

Position the sheet about 1-inch from the edge of the mat closest to you and leave some of the bamboo mat exposed on either side of the nori sheet. Wet your hands in cool water and take a handful of sushi rice. Place the rice in the center of the nori and use your fingers to spread the rice evenly over the nori. Be sure to leave a 3/4-inch strip of nori uncovered on the far side. Place tuna strips and some julienne vegetable, cucumber or avocado along the center of the rice. Be careful not to overfill the nori. Place your fingertips over the fillings to hold them in place. Then, use your thumbs to lift up the edge of the bamboo rolling mat closest to you. Begin rolling the mat away from you, while applying pressure to the fillings to keep the roll firm. Roll the mat over slowly until it covers the rice and the near and far sides of rice join, still leaving the 3/4-inch strip of nori, rice-free, exposed. While holding the bamboo mat in position, apply pressure to the roll with your fingers to make the roll firm. Slice the roll in half, then cut both rolls twice to make 6 equal sized pieces. Repeat this process with the salmon and various fillings, nori and rice. Rinse the rice in cold water while stirring briskly to remove any dirt. Drain the rice completely. Place the rice and the 6 cups of water in a medium sized saucepan and cover it with a tight fitting lid. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Allow the water to boil for 3 minutes and then reduce the heat to low and continue cooking 15 minutes without removing the lid. Remove the rice from the heat and remove the lid (the water should no longer be visible). Turn the rice out evenly on a well-greased cookie sheet using a spatula or rice paddle. Sprinkle the rice with the vinegar, sugar, and salt while mixing with a spatula or rice paddle until the rice reaches body temperature. Keep the rice covered with damp paper towels or napkin until the rice is ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 6490,&quot;Spicy Chicken Empanadas with Orange Salsa Verde 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium yellow onion, finely diced 1 can diced green chiles 1/2 jalapeno, seeded and finely diced, optional 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1 rotisserie chicken, picked and finely chopped 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves 2 cups grated pepper jack cheese Salt and freshly ground black pepper Prepared pie dough 1 egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash Peanut oil, for fryer Orange Salsa Verde dipping sauce, recipe follows 1 jar prepared salsa verde 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper or 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco) Instructions: Heat vegetable oil in a medium saute pan, add onions, green chiles, jalapenos, garlic and cumin and saute until onions are translucent.

Lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch metal baking pan. Whisk together the half-and-half, vanilla, 4 eggs, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large mixing bowl.<br> Lay 7 slices of bread in a single layer on a cutting board. Sprinkle 2 heaping tablespoons Gruyere on top of each slice. Top each with 2 slices of ham, folding the ham as needed to fit. Place the remaining 7 slices bread on top to form 7 sandwiches. Cut each sandwich in half diagonally. Dip both sides of each sandwich half into the custard mixture and transfer to the prepared baking pan, arranging in 2 long shingled rows. Pour any remaining custard over the sandwiches and sprinkle the remaining Gruyere on top.<br> Spray a large piece of foil with nonstick spray. Place the foil sprayed-side down on top of the baking pan, crimping the sides of the foil around the pan to seal. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the custard is set but still slightly jiggly, about 10 minutes more. Switch the oven to broil and broil until the top is light golden brown, another 3 to 5 minutes. Allow to rest for 5 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, heat the butter in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Crack 3 eggs into the pan (it&#39;s okay if they run together) and lightly sprinkle with salt. Cook until the whites start to set, 1 to 2 minutes, then cover and continue cooking until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining 3 eggs.<br> Divide the casserole among 6 plates, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar, top with the maple syrup or jam if using and finish with a fried egg on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</li></ol><p>&quot; 6501,&quot;Spinach-Artichoke Ravioli-Lasagna 1 (10-ounce) packages chopped frozen spinach 1/4 stick butter 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 quart milk Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste Salt and pepper 3 cups ricotta cheese 1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest 4 cloves garlic, minced 4 packages large fresh ravioli cheese, wild mushroom or spinach stuffed varieties 2 (15-ounce) cans artichoke hearts in water, drained and thinly sliced 1 1/2 cups grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil for pasta. Place oven rack in middle of oven and preheat broiler or oven to 425 degrees F. Defrost the spinach in the microwave for 10 minutes on high. While spinach defrosts, heat a medium sauce pot over medium heat. Cut butter into small pieces and melt. Whisk in flour and cook a minute or 2 then whisk in milk. Bring sauce to a bubble, as it begins to thicken, drop heat to low and season it with nutmeg, salt and pepper, to your taste. Combine ricotta cheese, a little salt and pepper, lemon zest and garlic in a bowl. Cook pasta to al dente, 5 to 6 minutes in salted water. Remove spinach from the microwave and wring it completely dry in a kitchen towel. Open the towel and separate the spinach with your fingers. Pile up the sliced artichokes on your cutting board. Drain pasta well. Ladle just enough white sauce in the bottom of a lasagna dish to lightly coat it. Top with 1/3 of the pasta. Top the pasta with a layer of half of the ricotta cheese dotted with half of the spinach and artichokes. Thinly cover the veggies with more white sauce then top liberally with grated cheese. Repeat these layers then top your lasagna with the remaining 1/3 of the cooked ravioli, the last of the white sauce and some grated cheese.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and pearl onions and cook until the beans are bright green, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the vegetables, then plunge into an ice bath to stop the cooking. Drain, then remove the skins from the pearl onions. Combine the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and shallot and cook, stirring, until the shallot is caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add the bay leaves, then the mushrooms. Stir to combine, then add the thyme and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the mixture with the flour to tighten it up. Add the milk and boil 3 minutes to thicken; remove the bay leaves. Place the green beans and pearl onions in a 3-quart casserole dish. Pour the \\mushroom soup\\ over the vegetables and toss to make sure they are well coated.

If the frozen yogurt is rock hard, refrigerate it briefly until softened slightly; it must be scoopable but still very firm. (Note that frozen yogurt melts much more quickly than ice cream, so it must be very firm when you begin to work with it.) Distribute scoops of yogurt all over the pan. Working quickly and leaving about 4 inches at one end of the pan uncovered, spread the yogurt evenly in the pan by mashing the scoops with the back of a large spoon and pushing them together. Cover with foil and freeze at least several hours or until needed.<br> Make the cocoa souffle sheet: Position the rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line the bottom of the second pan with a piece of parchment or wax paper.<br> In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with vanilla and 1/2 cup of the sugar until pale and thick. Set aside.<br> In a separate mixing bowl, with clean dry beater, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in the remaining sugar, continue to beat at high speed until stiff but not dry. Mix a quarter of the egg whites into the yolk mixture to lighten it. Scrape the remaining whites into the bowl and sift the cocoa over them. Fold until completely incorporated.<br> Spread the batter evenly in the pan and bake until the pastry springs back when gently pressed with fingertips, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool completely, in the pan on a wire rack.<br> Sprinkle a large sheet of foil with cocoa. Run a small knife or metal spatula around the edges of the cocoa pastry to detach it from the pan. Invert the cocoa pastry onto the foil sheet. Remove the pan and peel the paper pan liner from the cocoa pastry.<br> Assemble the roll: Remove the sheet of frozen yogurt from the freezer and remove the foil covering. Center and invert the yogurt sheet on top of the cocoa souffle sheet. Remove the pan and the foil. The long edges should be lined up and but there should be 2 inches of cocoa souffle exposed at each end.<br> Fold the exposed pastry over the yogurt at one end of the sheet. Continue to roll the pastry and yogurt up together, using the foil underneath as an aid as necessary. Do not worry if there is some initial cracking as you roll, however, if the yogurt is much too stiff to roll, wait a few minutes until it is pliable. Wrap the roll in foil and return to the freezer overnight or until hard. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Make the meringue topping: Bring 1-inch of water to a simmer in a large saucepan. Combine the water, cream of tartar and sugar in a 6 to 8 cup stainless bowl. Whisk in the egg whites. Place thermometer near stove in a mug of very hot tap water. Set bowl in saucepan. Stir mixture briskly and constantly with a rubber spatula, scraping the sides and bottom often to avoid scrambling the egg white. After 1 1/2 minutes, remove the bowl from the skillet. Quickly insert thermometer, tilting bowl to cover stem by at least 2 inches. If less than 160 degrees F, rinse thermometer in simmering skillet water and return it to mug. Replace the bowl in skillet. Stir as before until temperature reaches 160 degrees F when bowl is removed. Beat on high speed until cool and stiff. Set aside.<br> Remove the frozen roll from the freezer and unwrap it. Place the roll on the foil wrapped cardboard. Use a metal spatula to cover the roll completely with a thick coating of meringue topping. Leave no cake exposed and be sure that the meringue touches the foiled cardboard all along the base of the roll. Use a fork to texture the meringue to resemble tree bark. Transfer the buche on its foiled base to a baking sheet. Sieve powdered sugar over the buche. Bake just until golden, 4 to 6 minutes, watching carefully. Slide a wide spatula or pancake turner under the foiled cardboard and transfer the buche to a serving platter. Serve immediately with Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce, if desired. Combine the sugar and cocoa in a heavy bottomed medium saucepan. Whisk in just enough buttermilk to form a smooth paste. Whisk in the remaining buttermilk. Cook over medium heat until the mixture simmers and begins to boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, scraping the sides and bottom of the pan. Boil gently for 3 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Cool. Serve at room temperature or slightly warm. Sauce may be stored in the refrigerator up to one week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 6509,&quot;Grilled Swordfish with Potato-Chorizo Salad For the fish: 4 cloves garlic, smashed 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling Juice of 1/2 orange 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar 1 teaspoon honey 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 6 6-to-8-ounce skin-on swordfish steaks (about 1/2 inch thick) Vegetable oil, for brushing For the potato salad: 1 1/2 pounds small red-skinned potatoes, thinly sliced Kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, chopped 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 ounces dried chorizo, diced 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley and/or chives 3 stalks celery (with leaves), sliced 1/4 cup piquillo peppers, sliced Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Prepare the fish: Whisk the garlic, olive oil, orange juice, vinegar, honey, thyme, cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl. Add the fish and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the potato salad: Put the potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water; season with salt. Bring to a boil and cook over medium-high heat until tender, about 20 minutes; drain. Toast the cumin seeds in a medium skillet over medium heat, about1 minute; transfer to a large bowl. Add the olive oil and chorizo to the skillet and cook until the chorizo just begins to sizzle, about 3 minutes. Remove the chorizo with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Remove the skillet from the heat; reserve the drippings. Add the vinegar and herbs to the bowl with the cumin, then whisk in the chorizo drippings. Add the celery, piquillo peppers, potatoes and chorizo; toss. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat a grill to high; brush the grates lightly with vegetable oil. Place the swordfish on the grill and brush with some of the marinade from the bowl. Grill until marked on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue grilling until just cooked through, about 4 more minutes. Divide among plates and drizzle with olive oil.

Remove the bacon and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon grease. Return the pot to the heat, add the stock and bring it to a boil, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the grits and cook, stirring, until thick, 4 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a nonstick skillet. Add the eggs and fry until the whites are set but the yolks are still soft, 3 to 5 minutes, or longer, depending how you like your eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Once the grits are thick, fold in 1/2 cup of the Cheddar cheese. Stir to allow the cheese to melt into the grits, then season to taste with salt, pepper and hot sauce. Divide the grits between 2 bowls and divide the remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar between them as well. Top each with 2 fried eggs and half of the chopped bacon. Finish with the sliced green onions.

Remove from heat and whisk in butter to melt, allow to cool 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook. Bloom the yeast by sprinkling it over the warm milk and butter. Add the sugar and stir gently to dissolve. Let stand 10 minutes until foam appears, this indicates the yeast is active. Turn mixer on low and add the egg yolks then gradually add the flour. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and add the salt. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Mix just until the dough is supple and elastic, about 5 minutes. Once smooth, turn dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead gently for 2 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat all sides. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. If you have time, let rise in the refrigerator for several hours because chilling will make the dough easier to roll out. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to about 1/2-inch thick and cut with a floured biscuit cutter or water glass, about 3-inches in diameter. Transfer to a greased baking sheet, and allow to rise again for 30 minutes. Heat 3-inches of vegetable oil or shortening to 375 degrees F in an electric fryer or deep saucepan. Slip doughnuts in the hot oil, top-risen side down, and fry doughnuts until golden, about 4 minutes each side. To keep the oil temperature constant, fry 3 at a time. Drain on paper towels. Fit a pastry bag with a small tip and fill with jam. Poke a small hole in the side of the doughnut and pipe the jam inside.

Immerse sausages in water and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove sausage and dry the pan. Return to the heat and add the olive oil on medium heat. When hot return the sausage to the pan with garlic cloves and saute until medium brown all over. Remove garlic to a bowl. Remove sausage to a plate to cool. Use a fork to mash the garlic with salt and pepper. Stir in mustard and set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut each piece of dough into 2 and roll out until 1/4-inch thick. Cut 6 pieces of dough about 3 inches wide and 1/2-inch shorter then the length of sausage, just enough to wrap around sausage with the ends peeking out. Spread bottom of each dough with a tablespoon of garlic/mustard paste. Set sausage on top, moisten 1 dough edge with a wet finger so it sticks together and roll. Press the seam firmly and set them on a lightly floured sheet pan, seam side down. Brush with olive oil. Bake until brown all around. Remove and let cool for 5 minutes. Cut into 3/4-inch long pieces and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 6524,&quot;Grandma&#39;s Plum and Almond Skillet Jam 2 pounds ripe plums (about 8 to 10) 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon almond extract or Amaretto 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Instructions: Halve the plums, remove the pits and coarsely chop into 1/2-inch pieces (leave unpeeled). Combine the plums, sugar, almond extract and lemon juice in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer and cook, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until the plums are thick and jammy, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Heat the oil in a heavy saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook until translucent and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until the liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add the spinach and wilt for 4 minutes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Let cool. Dust a flat working surface with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll out the sheets of puff pastry into 1/4-inch thickness (each 12 by 12 inches). Put the pastry sheets side-by-side so they overlap slightly, by about 1/2 inch. Brush the overlapping strip with the beaten egg, stick both sheets together at the strip and seal with a fork. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Spoon the cooled mushroom-spinach mixture over one side of the puff pastry rectangle. To make an even rectangle out of the salmon fillet, you can cut the top portion off of the belly and add it to the tail part. Place the fillet over the mushroom-spinach mixture. Season the salmon heavily with salt and pepper. Fold the other side of the rectangle over the filling and seal by brushing the edge with egg wash and crimping as you would a pie crust (you can use a fork; I crimped like a pie crust with my fingers). Fold the remaining 2 open edges of pastry under the salmon fillet. Brush everything with the egg wash. Bake until the puff pastry is crisp and golden in color, 25 minutes. Let stand for about 8 minutes before slicing. For the dill sauce: Put the clam juice in a heavy saucepot and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and reduce to 1/2 cup. Add the Mexican crema and heavy cream and reduce to 1 cup. Add the flour and whisk while boiling until thickened. Add the dill and season with salt and pepper. Slice the salmon into 1 1/4 to 1 1/2-inch slices.

Then stir in the flour, stirring through the process, until light brown and smooth. Next, add the milk, again stir and allow the roux to absorb the milk. Then season with the salt and white pepper and add the parsley. This process should take 4 to 5 minutes. Hold the sauce warm. For the steaks: Preheat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. With a meat tenderizer, pound the steaks until double in size and 1/4-inch thick. Add the salt and black pepper to the flour. Then dredge a steak in the flour, then the egg wash and finally again in the flour. Repeat the process with all the steaks. Then drop them in the fryer and cook for 1 1/2 minutes.

Preheat a broiler. In an ungreased skillet over medium heat, toast the chiles, stirring for 1 minute, until they are very aromatic (some will have slightly darkened spots on them). Transfer to a bowl, cover with hot water and rehydrate for 30 minutes. In the same skillet, roast the garlic, turning regularly, until soft and blotchy-dark in places, about 15 minutes. Cool and slip off the papery skin. Roast the tomatillos on a baking sheet 4 inches below a very hot broiler until soft, even blackened in spots, about 5 minutes on each side. Cool, then transfer the contents of the baking sheet (including any juices) to a blender or a food processor. Finishing the salsa: Drain the chiles and add to the tomatillos along with the garlic. Puree, then scrape into a serving dish. Stir in enough water to give a spoonable consistency, usually about 1/4 cup. Season with salt, usually 1 teaspoon, and the optional sugar. Refrigerated, the salsa keeps for several days. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 6535,&quot;Roast Rack of Lamb with Rosemary and Membrillo Aioli and Rustic Roast Potatoes 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary, plus sprigs, for garnish 8 fluid ounces/1 cup (225 milliliters) oil (sunflower, olive oil, or a mixture) 2 egg yolks, preferably free range and organic Pinch of English mustard or 1/4 teaspoon French mustard 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 dessertspoon white wine vinegar 1 clove garlic, crushed 1 1/2 to 2 ounces (35 to 50 grams) membrillo (quince paste)* 4 racks of lamb or 1 leg of spring lamb 3 sprigs fresh rosemary, optional 1 to 2 cloves garlic, optional Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: I love this recipe, my good friend the Australian cook, Maggie Beer from the Barossa Valley, made this Membrillo Aioli when she stayed at the Cookery School a few years ago. For the aioli: Put the chopped rosemary into a little saucepan with 3 tablespoons of oil and warm gently for 2 or 3 minutes, careful not to burn. Keep aside. Put the egg yolks into a bowl with the mustard, salt, and the white wine vinegar and add the crushed garlic. Put the oil into a measuring cup. Take a whisk in one hand and the oil in the other and drip the oil onto the egg yolks, drop by drop, whisking at the same time. Within a minute you will notice that the mixture is beginning to thicken. When this happens you can add the oil a little faster, but don&#39;t get too cheeky or it will suddenly curdle because the egg yolks can only absorb the oil at a certain pace. Taste and add a little more seasoning and vinegar, if necessary. If the mayonnaise curdles it will suddenly become quite thin, and if left sitting the oil will start to float to the top of the sauce. If this happens you can quite easily rectify the situation by putting another egg yolk or 1 to 2 tablespoons plus 1 to 2 teaspoons of boiling water into a clean bowl. Then whisk in the curdled mayonnaise, a half teaspoon at a time, until it emulsifies again. Chop the membrillo and warm gently in a little saucepan until it melts. Cool and add to the mayonnaise with the rosemary and oil. Taste and correct seasoning. For the lamb: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F/220 degrees C/gas mark 7. Score the skin of the lamb, you may like to insert a few tiny sprigs of rosemary and slivers of garlic here and there on the skin side. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, depending on the age of the lamb and the degree of doneness required. Allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Carve, allowing 2 to 3 cutlets per person, depending on size. Garnish with a sprig of rosemary and serve with the Rosemary and Membrillo Aioli. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 6536,&quot;Cheesy Dijon-Balsamic Sheet Pan Meatloaf 3/4 cup breadcrumbs 1/4 cup milk 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped, plus more for topping 2 large eggs<br> 3/4 cup Food Network Kitchen?

Sprinkle with salt and saute until both are slightly tender. Remove the casing from the chorizo and add it to the pot. Using a wooden spoon or a potato masher, break up the links until they resemble ground meat. Saute until the orange-colored oil is released and the chorizo begins to slightly crisp about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, oregano, chili powder, thyme, paprika, red pepper flakes, tomatoes, and tomato paste. Stir all ingredients well and cook until the tomato skins begin to peel back and everything is a dark reddish-brown color, about 10 minutes. Add the turkey and gravy flavoring, then using a spoon or masher, break the ground turkey apart stirring frequently while cooking. Cook until the turkey is heated through, then add chicken stock, hot sauce, cinnamon stick, and salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the cornmeal, lower to a simmer and cover. Cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to release the chili from the bottom of the pot.

Divide the beef into four 6-ounce portions. Gather each into a ball, then gently flatten into a 4 1/2-inch-wide patty about 3/4 inch thick (be careful not to overwork the meat). Press your thumb into the center of each patty to make a 1/2-inch-deep indentation (this prevents the patties from bulging as they cook). Season the patties with salt and pepper. Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the patties indentation-side up until they are marked and release easily from the grill, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until slightly firm, 3 more minutes for medium doneness.

(If you would like a more country feel, you can wait and break them up in the pan later with a wooden spoon.) In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the onion and saute 5 to 6 minutes, or until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until you see the color start changing. If you?d like to make the sauce spicy, add the red pepper flakes. Add the tomatoes and season with kosher salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for about 30 minutes. (If you did not puree the tomatoes, use a wooden spoon to break them into pieces while they cook.) Strive for balance in the consistency of the sauce. It has to be fluid, but it should not look overly wet. Add the torn basil and remove from the heat. Meanwhile, fry the eggplant: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pour 2 inches of canola oil into a large heavy-bottomed pot or high-sided skillet. Heat over high heat until a deep-fry thermometer reads 360 degrees F. (You can also test by adding a small piece of bread to the oil. If it fries and browns, the oil is ready.) In a shallow dish, whisk together the flour, 1 teaspoon sea salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Working in batches of approximately 8 slices each, dredge the eggplant slices in the flour mixture and add them to the hot oil. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes each, until browned. Using tongs, transfer the eggplant to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to let cool. In two 9-by-13-inch baking dishes, place 1 layer of eggplant slices. Brush each with a thin layer of sauce, top with a layer of mozzarella, 2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano and a sprinkle of basil leaves. Repeat the layering two more times. Make a final layer of sauce, mozzarella and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until bubbling and golden on top. Garnish with a final sprinkling of basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano and a small drizzle of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 6563,&quot;Herb Encrusted Sea Bass with Sundried Tomato Chardonnay Sauce 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed finely 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 (8 ounce fillets) fresh sea bass 1/4 cup Cognac or brandy 1/3 cup fish stock Salt and pepper 1 bunch asparagus, blanched and refreshed Sundried Tomato-Chardonnay Sauce, recipe follows 2 basil buds, for garnish 1 tomato, peeled seeded and small diced (1 tomato concassed), for garnish 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons black peppercorns 2 tablespoons shallots 3 cups Chardonnay 1 fresh bay leaf 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 1 large sun-dried tomato, chopped 1/2 pound butter, cut into small cubes Salt Instructions: In a flat plate, mix the basil, thyme, peppercorns, and garlic.

Line a 9-by-13-inch broiler-proof baking dish with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on both sides. Butter the foil. Pulse 14 of the graham crackers into fine crumbs in a food processor. Combine the melted butter and graham cracker crumbs in a medium bowl with your hands (the mixture should hold together when squeezed). Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and press it into the bottom in an even layer, using the bottom of a measuring cup to help. Pour the sweetened condensed milk over the crumbs. Then sprinkle the chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and peanuts over the condensed milk. Break the remaining 4 graham crackers into chunks and sprinkle evenly over the top. Bake until the sides are golden brown and begin to pull away from the baking dish, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven, and turn the broiler on. Scatter the marshmallows over the top of the bars and put the dish under the broiler until the marshmallows are dark golden and toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool completely then refrigerate to set, about 1 hour. Using the foil liner as handles, pull the bars out of the baking dish; remove the foil. Cut the bars into 2-inch squares. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]</p><p>&quot; 6591,&quot;Throwdown&#39;s Matzo Ball Soup 6 tablespoons chicken fat 3 tablespoons finely chopped chives 4 large eggs 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh dill 2 tablespoons seltzer water 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 cup unsalted matzo meal 2 large yellow onions, quartered 3 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces 3 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch pieces 2 bay leaves 1 teaspoon white peppercorns 1 small bunch parsley 10 sprigs fresh thyme 1 (3-pound) chicken 3 lbs chicken bones, neck included Water 2 jalapeno peppers, roasted and slit Salt and freshly ground black pepper Chopped fresh dill leaves Instructions: For the matzo balls: Heat the chicken fat over medium heat in a small pan. Add the chives and cook for 30 seconds. Set aside to cool slightly. In a large bowl, add the eggs, dill, seltzer, sugar, and salt and pepper and whisk until combined. Add the matzo meal and the chicken fat/chive mixture and stir to combine. Cover well and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Form the matzo mixture into 8 equal size balls, about 1 3/4 ounces each, add to the water, reduce the heat to simmer, cover and cook until very tender, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to the pot with the chicken stock and cook for 5 minutes before serving. Ladle the soup into individual bowls and serve. For the chicken stock: Combine all ingredients in a large stockpot and add enough cold water to cover by 2-inches. Bring to a boil, over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, skimming the scum from the stock with a ladle, every 15 minutes, for 3 hours. Strain into a large bowl and discard the solids. Transfer to a large saucepan and cook until reduced by half. Add the roasted jalapenos for the last 10 minutes or of simmering, then remove.

Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until creamy but not melted, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract and the crushed candy canes and beat until just incorporated, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a small metal baking dish or loaf pan, cover and freeze until firm, 1 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a bowl or cake pan as a guide, trace an 8-inch circle onto the parchment with a pencil, then flip the parchment over (the circle should still be visible); set aside. Make the meringue: Fill a medium saucepan with 1 to 2 inches of water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; remove from the heat. Combine the egg whites, sugar and salt in a large heatproof bowl and set over the hot water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Whisk until the egg whites are foamy and hot, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan and beat with a mixer on medium speed until stiff and shiny, about 10 minutes. Beat in the remaining 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract until combined. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch round tip. Pipe in a tight spiral onto the prepared parchment-lined baking sheet, starting in the middle of the circle and working toward the outer edge. Pipe more meringue around the outer edge of the circle to build up the side about 2 inches high. Dip a small paintbrush or toothpick in the food coloring, then drag it around the meringue spiral to create streaks. Repeat several times. Bake until the meringue is just firm but not brown, about 1 hour. (If it starts browning, reduce the oven temperature to 275 degrees F.) Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. (The meringue will continue to harden as it cools.) Carefully invert the meringue onto a platter and gently peel off the parchment. Invert again and set on the platter. Top with scoops of the prepared peppermint ice cream and sprinkle with more crushed candy canes. Freeze until ready to serve, up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 6593,&quot;Baked Ricotta Bowls with Chicken and Parmesan and a Mixed Green Salad with Tomato-Basil Vinaigrette 1 9-inch refrigerated pie crust 2 chicken breast halves, cooked and diced 1 cup ricotta cheese 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 2 eggs, lightly beaten 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley leaves 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained 1/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 2 teaspoons olive oil 4 to 6 cups mixed lettuce greens Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Take the pan off the heat and immediately add the ouzo and light it. Let the flame subside. Season the shrimp with salt, and pepper, and set aside. Garnish each portion of the risotto with grilled shrimp, parsley, lemon zest, and feta cheese. To make veal stock: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Remove meat from bones where possible and cut into 1-inch pieces. If using breast bones, cut apart. In roasting pan, arrange bones and meat in 1 layer, drizzle with oil, season with salt, and pepper and roast in lower part of the oven, stirring half way in between until bones are golden brown, 40 minutes to 1 hour depending on the size of the bones. Add the tomato paste by spooning it over the bones. Add the vegetables and put it in the oven for an additional hour. Into a large stockpot, add bones, meat, roasted vegetables, herbs, and 16 cups (4 L) water. Discard fat from roasting pan. Place tray back onto the stovetop. Heat on medium for about 1 minute then remove. Immediately add 1/2 cup to 1 cup water to the pan, scraping up brown bits, put the tray back on heat and then add the deglazed liquid to the stockpot. Bring liquid to a tremble, about 190 degrees F, and cook at 190 degrees F (skim froth frequently during first hour of cooking) for 8 hours. Pour stock in batches through a large fine sieve and discard solids. Skim off fat. (Alternatively, cool stock, uncovered, and chill, covered. Scrape congealed fat from chilled stock.) Gently simmer stock, skimming froth occasionally, until reduced to about 4 cups (1 L), about 1 hour. Cool stock, uncovered, and chill, covered. Stock keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week or, frozen in airtight containers, 3 months. If desired, pour cooled stock into ice-cube trays with 1-ounce cups and freeze. Frozen cubes keep in heavy-duty sealable plastic bags 3 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 6632,&quot;Curry Powder Blend 2 tablespoons whole cumin seeds, toasted 2 tablespoons whole cardamom seeds, toasted 2 tablespoons whole coriander seeds, toasted 1/4 cup ground turmeric 1 tablespoon dry mustard 1 teaspoon cayenne Instructions: Place all ingredients in a container with an airtight lid.

Mix on low speed, scrape down the sides and mix again. Add the 1 cup of flour in three additions on low speed. Do not overmix. Dust a clean work surface with flour. Dust a sheet tray with flour. Turn out the dough onto the floured work surface and dust your hands with some flour. Roll the dough into long cylinders, about 18 inches in length. With a bench scraper, cut the dough into 1-inch pieces and place onto the sheet tray dusted with flour. Sprinkle the gnocchi with more flour to avoid sticking. Heat a large saute pan with some olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the maitakes and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the oyster mushrooms and cook until browned, another 4 to 5 minutes. Add the shallots, garlic and thyme sprigs and cook for a few minutes until fragrant and softened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the heavy cream and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until thickened and reduced by a little more than half, 2 to 4 minutes. Set up a pot of boiling water and season liberally with kosher salt. Drop the gnocchi into the water. Once they float to the top, they are done, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the gnocchi and add them directly into the mushroom cream sauce and toss to combine over a low simmer. If the sauce has gotten too thick, thin it out with a little bit of pasta water. Garnish with the chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 6636,&quot;Wild Mushroom and Venison Stroganoff for Two Lucky People 7 ounces white rice Extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium red onion, peeled and finely chopped 1 clove garlic, peeled and finely sliced 11 ounces venison loin, fat and sinews removed, trimmed and sliced into finger-sized pieces Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon paprika 9 ounces mixed exciting, robust mushrooms, wiped clean, torn into bite-sized pieces Small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked and roughly chopped, stalks finely chopped Knob of butter Good splash brandy 1 lemon, zested 2/3 cup creme fraiche or sour cream Few little gherkins, sliced Instructions: Cook the rice according to the package instructions until it&#39;s just undercooked and drain in a colander. Put the rice back in the pan, cover with aluminum foil and set aside to steam - this will give you incredibly light and fluffy rice. Heat a large frying pan on a medium heat and pour in a glug of extra-virgin olive oil. Add the onions and garlic and cook for about 10 minutes until softened and golden. Remove from the heat and spoon the onions and garlic out of the pan onto a plate. Set aside. Season the meat well with salt, pepper and the paprika. Rub and massage these flavorings into the meat. Place the frying pan back on a high heat and pour in some more olive oil. Add the mushrooms and fry for a few minutes until they start to brown. Then add the meat and fry for a minute or 2 before adding the parsley stalks (you can do this in 2 pans or in batches if your pan is not big enough) and the cooked onion and garlic. Toss and add the butter and brandy. You don&#39;t have to light the hot brandy, but flaming does give an interesting flavor so I always like to do this. Once the flames die down, or after a couple of minutes of simmering, stir in the lemon zest and all but 1 tablespoon of the creme fraiche and season, to taste. Continue simmering for a few minutes. Any longer than this and the meat will toughen up - it doesn&#39;t need long, as it&#39;s been cut up so small. Serve your fluffy rice on 1 big plate and your stroganoff on another. Simply spoon the remaining creme fraiche over the stroganoff, then sprinkle over the sliced gherkins and the parsley leaves.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cake flour, sugar, baking powder, fennel and salt; whisk to combine. Add the cold butter to the flour mixture. Press and work the butter into the flour with your hands until the mixture has a shaggy texture and the butter pieces are no larger than peas. In a small bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, orange zest and egg yolk. Pour the liquid into the dry ingredients and fold together with a rubber spatula. Continue to gently fold the dough until it just comes together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, making sure to scrape out all the contents of the bowl. Lightly knead the dough together until the ingredients are evenly incorporated and the dough is smooth. Using your hands, press the dough into an 18-by-3 3/4-inch rectangle. Cut the dough in half lengthwise using a bench scraper, so you have 2 long rectangles. Next, cut the dough every 3 inches crosswise, creating 12 small rectangles. Cut each small rectangle in half diagonally. This will give you 24 scones in the shape of a triangle. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2 inches between each. Brush the tops with the egg white. Bake, rotating the baking sheets halfway through cooking, until the tops and bottoms are golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Let cool about 5 minutes.

Slash the fat side of the lamb all over with a sharp knife. Lay half the sprigs of rosemary and half the garlic cloves on the bottom of a high-sided roasting pan, rub the lamb all over with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place it in the pan on top of the rosemary and garlic, and put the rest of the rosemary and garlic on top of the lamb. Tightly cover the tray with aluminum foil and place in the oven. Turn the oven down immediately to 325 degrees F and cook for 4 hours - it&#39;s done if you can pull the meat apart easily with 2 forks. For the vegetables: When the lamb is nearly cooked, put thepotatoes, carrots and rutabaga into a large pot of boiling salted water and boil hard for 20 minutes or so until you can slide a knife into the rutabaga easily. Drain and allow to steam dry, then smash them up in the pan with most of the butter. If you prefer a smooth texture, add some cooking water. Spoon into a bowl, cover with foil and keep warm over a pan of simmering water.; For the sauce: Remove the lamb from the oven and place it on a chopping board. Cover it with foil, then a kitchen towel, and leave it to rest. Put a large pan of salted water on to boil for the greens. Pour away most of the fat from the roasting pan, discarding any bits of rosemary. Put the pan on the stovetop over medium heat and mix in the flour. Add the stock, stirring and scraping all the sticky goodness off the bottom of the pan. You won&#39;t need gallons of gravy, just a couple of flavorsome spoonfuls for each serving. Add the capers, turn the heat down and simmer for a few minutes. Finely chop the mint and add it to the sauce with the red wine vinegar at the last minute then pour into a pitcher. Add the greens and stalks to the pan of fast-boiling salted water and cook for 4 to 5 minutes to just soften them. Drain and toss with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper. Place everything in the middle of the table, and shred the lamb in front of your guests.

Drain the bacon on a paper towel. Pour out most of the grease from the skillet and add the butter. Add the onions and cook over medium-low heat until soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove them to a plate. Add the mushrooms and stir, then add the wine and some salt and pepper. Turn the heat to medium high and cook until most of the wine has evaporated and the mushrooms are soft, for several minutes. Set aside. Add the olive oil, vinegar, thyme and some salt and pepper to a mason jar and shake it to combine. Remove the kale leaves from the stalks, then roll them up in batches and slice very thinly. Place the kale in a bowl. Add half the dressing and toss. Then add the mushrooms, onions and bacon and toss again. Finally, add the goat cheese and more dressing if needed and toss. (Reserve any extra dressing for another use.) Serve it up and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 6661,&quot;Braised Baby Artichokes 3 lemons 24 baby artichokes Extra-virgin olive oil 6 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped 3 anchovy fillets (optional, but highly recommended!) Pinch of red pepper flakes 1 cup dry white wine 1 bunch thyme, tied with kitchen twine Kosher salt 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley Parmigiano-reggiano cheese, for shaving Instructions: Fill a large bowl with water. Halve 1 lemon, squeeze the juice into the water and drop both halves into the bowl. Cut off the top quarter of the artichokes with a serrated knife. Peel the tough dark green skin from the stems using a paring knife and remove the tough outer leaves until the tender inner green leaves are revealed; it should be only a couple of layers. Cut the artichokes in half lengthwise and toss into the lemon water.<br> Zest and juice the remaining 2 lemons and reserve. Coat a large straight-sided skillet generously with olive oil and add the garlic, anchovies and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until the garlic is very aromatic and the anchovies have dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> Remove the artichokes from the water and add them to the pan along with the reserved lemon zest and juice, the white wine and thyme. Season with salt and add just enough water to cover the artichokes. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover the pan and cook until the artichokes are very soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the lid and let the liquid reduce until it comes less than halfway up the sides of the arties, about 10 minutes. Remove the thyme and toss in the parsley. Swirl and stir to combine. Taste for seasoning and adjust if you need to (you probably will). Put the artichokes on a rimmed serving platter or in a bowl. Use a vegetable peeler to shave the parmigiano on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 6662,&quot;Tyler Florence&#39;s Fried Chicken One 3-to 4-pound chicken, cut up into 10 pieces Kosher salt 3 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons garlic powder 2 tablespoons onion powder 2 tablespoons sweet paprika 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper Freshly ground black pepper 4 cups buttermilk 2 tablespoons hot chili sauce, such as Sriracha Peanut oil, for frying 1/2 head garlic, smashed, husk still attached 1/4 bunch fresh sage 1/4 bunch fresh thyme 3 big sprigs fresh rosemary Lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: Put the chicken pieces into a large bowl. Cover the chicken with water by 1 inch; add 1 tablespoon of salt for every quart of water. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight. In a large shallow platter, mix the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and cayenne until well blended; season generously with salt and black pepper. In another platter combine the buttermilk and chili sauce with a fork and season with salt and black pepper. Drain the chicken and pat it dry. Dredge the pieces, a few at a time, in the buttermilk and then dip them in the seasoned flour. Let the chicken rest while you prepare the oil. Fill a large deep pot about three-quarters full with the oil. Add the garlic, sage, thyme and rosemary to the cool oil and heat over medium-high heat until the oil registers 350 to 365 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. (The herbs and garlic will perfume the oil with their flavor as the oil comes up to temperature.) Working in batches of 3 to 4 pieces at a time, carefully add the chicken to the pot and fry, turning once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 12 minutes. Remove the chicken and herbs from the pot with a big skimmer, shaking off as much oil as you can, and put them on a tea towel or brown paper bag to soak up the oil. Sprinkle all over with salt and a dusting of black pepper. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. Scatter the fried herbs and garlic over the chicken. Serve hot with lemon wedges.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 6663,&quot;Linguine With Sausage and Mushrooms Kosher salt 12 ounces linguine 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed 1 small onion, chopped 1 stalk celery, thinly sliced 1/2 pound sliced mixed mushrooms 2 cloves garlic, chopped 4 plum tomatoes, chopped 1/2 cup dry white wine or low-sodium chicken broth 2/3 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil; add the pasta and cook as the label directs.

The slow-fry method: Melt the lard in a large (4-quart), heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. When it has melted but is not yet very hot, add the pork, water and lime zest. Cook with the lard at a gentle simmer, turning the pork occasionally, for about 40 minutes, until it is barely tender. Raise the heat to medium-high. If all of the water hasn&#39;t yet evaporated, the lard will come to a rolling boil, which will eventually diminish into small bubbles as the water evaporates. After the change occurs, the carnitas will need about 10 minutes to brown. Watch them carefully and remove when they are a light golden brown. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. The boil-then-fry method: Place the meat in a single layer in a wide, heavy saucepan, add enough water to cover the meat by 1/2-inch, measure in the salt, and set over medium heat. Simmer, partially covered, turning the pork occasionally, until the meat is barely tender, about 40 minutes. Uncover, raise the heat to medium-high, and quickly boil away the liquid. When you hear the meat begin to fry in its own rendered lard (once the water is gone), turn the heat down to between medium and medium-low. Let the pork fry, turning frequently, until evenly browned, about 30 minutes. Remove the ribs from the pan, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with a little salt. While the meat is cooking, prepare the guacamole, scoop it into a serving bowl and garnish. Serve the crispy ribs on a warm serving platter and pass the guacamole to eat along with them. Or cut the meat off the bones and roll with the guacamole into tacos. 1/2 small onion, very finely chopped 2 to 3 serranos or 1 to 2 jalapenos, stemmed, seeded and very finely chopped 1 ripe, medium-large tomato, cored and very finely chopped, optional 1 clove garlic, peeled and very finely chopped, optional 10 sprigs fresh cilantro, chopped, optional 3 ripe, medium-size avocados Salt, about 1/2 teaspoon 1/2 lime, juiced, optional Additional chopped onion, fresh cilantro, radish slices or roses, and/or a little crumbled Mexican queso fresco or other fresh cheese like feta or farmer&#39;s cheese, for garnish In a medium-size bowl, mix the finely chopped onion and chiles with the optional tomato, garlic, and cilantro. Close to the time you are going to serve, halve the avocados lengthwise by cutting from the stem to flower ends, around the pits. Twist the avocado halves in opposite directions to loosen the meat from pits, then scoop out the pits, and reserve. Scrape the avocado pulp from the skins and add it to the bowl. Using your hand or a spoon, roughly mash the avocado while mixing in the other ingredients, making a course, thick mass. Flavor with salt, then enough lime juice to add a little zing, if you wish. Return the pits to the guacamole and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface of the mixture. Set aside for a few minutes to let the flavors blend. The guacamole is very attractive in a pottery bowl or Mexican mortar, sprinkle with chopped onion, cilantro, radish slices and/or queso fresco (cheese); radish roses really dress it up. Yield: about 3 cups, serving 6 as an appetizer, 12 to 15 as a dip &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 6668,&quot;Warm Garlic Pitas 4 medium-size whole wheat pitas 4 medium-size white pitas 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 cloves garlic, minced 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley 1/4 cup grated Parmesan Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the pitas into 6 wedges.<br> In a medium saucepan, add the butter and garlic. Set over medium heat and warm through until the butter melts and the garlic becomes fragrant, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the parsley and mix well. Place the pita wedges in a large bowl and pour the garlic butter over the top. Toss well to combine and coat everything evenly. Spread the pita wedges out evenly on a sheet tray and dust with the grated Parmesan. Bake in the oven until golden and crispy, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and taste. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 6669,&quot;Green Spears and Ham 1 bunch jumbo asparagus, ends trimmed (10 to 12 spears) 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup mascarpone cheese, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon orange zest (from half an orange) 10 to 12 thin slices honey ham or prosciutto cotto if available, patted dry<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. On a small, rimmed baking sheet, toss the asparagus with the Parmesan, oil and 1/8 teaspoon of the salt. Bake until the stalks are easily pierced with the tip of a knife, 8 to 10 minutes.

Now stir in the remaining vinegar mixture and the milk mixture will continue to curdle. Stir for a few minutes. Pour this entire mixture into the prepared colander in the sink. Let drain until the desired texture, about 15 minutes for soft ricotta, 20 minutes for firm and creamy and 30 minutes for firm and slightly dry. For soft ricotta, serve warm or chilled in a small decorative bowl. For firm ricottas, gather the excess cheesecloth and shape the ricotta into a ball or disc and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour. Serve the ricotta with your favorite things, like a drizzle of honey and cracked black pepper, fresh or dried fruit, fruit preserves, crackers or fresh bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 6703,&quot;Cheese Blintzes 1 cup milk 4 eggs<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon powdered sugar<br> Butter, for cooking the crepes 2 1/2 pounds ricotta 3/4 pound brick cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 2 eggs<br> 1 cup powdered sugar<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract Butter, for cooking rolled crepes Serving suggestions: sour cream and fruit preserves Instructions: For the crepe: Beat milk, eggs and 1 cup water in a bowl.

Pour the lemon juice all over both sides of the lamb; this will help tenderize it.<br> To a roasting pan, add the carrots, celery and onions.<br> Place the garlic in a food processor and process until well chopped. Remove just under half of the garlic (about 4 cloves worth) and set aside for garlic butter. Add the rosemary and thyme leaves to the food processor and chop up well. Add the olive oil, salt and pepper. Pour the marinade over both sides of the lamb and massage it into the meat. Tie the lamb into a nice even shape with kitchen twine, and then place on the roasting pan on top of the vegetables.<br> Place in the oven and roast until desired point of doneness (internal temperature should reach 125 degrees F for medium-rare), 3 to 4 hours. When done, let rest for 12 to 15 minutes before carving into slices (against the grain) for sandwiches. Season the slices with salt before serving. To make the jus, place the roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add the reserved thyme and rosemary stems and stir. Pour in the white wine, scraping up the brown bits at the bottom of the pan, and bring to a quick boil. Stir in the chicken stock and simmer for a couple of minutes while the lamb rests. Strain the liquid into a saucepan and keep warm until serving.<br> To make the garlic butter, place the reserved garlic in a small saute pan and set over medium heat. Add the butter and warm through. Cook the garlic until fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes, and keep warm until just before serving.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Cut the sourdough loaf into 1-inch-thick slices and smear each slice of bread with the garlic butter. Place in the oven until toasted, about 10 minutes.<br> To assemble the sandwiches, smear each slice of bread with a little Fresno Chili Mayo on both sides then layer with a good heaping of sliced roast lamb. Top with a scoop of Fennel Brussels Sprouts Slaw and place top slice of bread on to form a sandwich. To serve, dip the sandwich in the jus. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> Spread the garlic and peppers on a small roasting dish and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place in the oven and roast the chiles until the skin blisters, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven, place in a bowl and cover with plastic so the chiles sweat. Allow to sit for 5 minutes, and then carefully peel the skins off and remove the stems and seeds.<br> In a blender, place the roasted chiles and garlic. Blend until smooth, and then add the egg yolks, lemon juice, sugar and some salt. With the blender running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the mixture emulsifies. Refrigerate the cl mayo until ready to use.<br> Remove the core from the fennel bulb and finely slice with a sharp knife or a mandoline. Repeat the process for the red cabbage. Finely slice the onion and the Brussels sprouts. In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, vinegar, sugar and lemon juice. Whisk together and season with salt and pepper. Fold in the shredded fennel, chopped fennel fronds and shredded Brussels sprouts. Mix together well, and then cover and place in the refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes before serving so the vegetables soften and absorb the vinaigrette.

For the pepper relish: Grill the Fresno and bell peppers until they are BLACK on the outside. Put in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. Uncover the bowl and allow the peppers to cool. Remove the black char from the outside of the peppers and remove the seeds. Coarsely chop all the peppers and place in a medium bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and combine. Let sit for at least 1 hour before using.*Tip: This is great do ahead thing, or make a big batch and keep it, indefinitely, in the refrigerator. For the sandwich assembly: Cut the ciabatta rolls in half lengthwise, leaving 1 long side intact. Scoop out the inside and discard. Combine the vinegar and olive oil in a small bowl and brush on the inside of each roll. Be sure to evenly and thoroughly cover all parts of the bread, (don&#39;t miss any corners.) You may have some vinegar-olive oil leftover. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lay 4 pieces of provolone cheese inside each roll. Spread an even layer of the pepper relish on 1 side of each roll. Again, make sure it is an even layer, every bite needs to be the same! Crinkle 2 pieces of ham and gently lay them in a fluffy even layer on the pepper relish. Repeat this process with the mortadella. It is very important that the meat is crinkled and NOT folded in a flat piece. A folded hunk of meat results in a thick dense sandwich that is difficult to eat. Also be sure that the ham and mortadella are evenly distributed throughout the sandwich. Close the sandwich and give a little press to secure. Wrap the sandwich in foil. To finish the sandwich: Bake the sandwich in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the sandwich is hot all the way through. A panino press is also a great way to heat this up. Serve on individual plates and enjoy.

Cut each pound of mozzarella and smoked mozzarella into 16 cubes. Set up a breading station: flour, 2 eggs beaten with 1/3 cup milk, Italian bread crumbs mixed with a couple of handfuls of grated cheese. Reserve the chopped parsley. Roll fresh plain mozzarella in flour, dip in egg, then coat in bread crumbs. Bread all the plain mozzarella, then add chopped parsley to the bread crumbs. Coat the cubed smoked mozzarella in flour, egg, then Italian bread crumbs mixed with parsley. The chopped parsley will allow you to distinguish between the fresh and fresh smoked cheese once fried. Place herbs into hot oil and fry 30 to 45 seconds. Be careful not to stand over pan, the oil will spatter a little because of the water content in herbs. Remove herbs with a slotted kitchen tool and transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Season immediately with fine salt. Fry the mozzarella bites in batches in a single layer. Cook until evenly deep golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and cool mozzarella bites on a paper towel-lined surface. Let stand and cool a few minutes so that the cheese will not be too runny when bitten into. For dipping sauce, heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Add extra-virgin olive oil, garlic and crushed pepper flakes. Saute garlic and hot pepper 2 or 3 minutes, and add tomatoes. Season with salt. To assemble your serving plate, pile mozzarella bites, alternating them with fried herbs.

Place a 10-inch cast iron skillet in the center of the grill and heat thoroughly. Meanwhile, make cake batter: Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt together; set aside. With a mixer, cream together the butter, sugar, and egg yolks. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients to creamed mixture, alternating with the milk. Add vanilla extract. In a separate mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form and then fold them into the batter. Set batter aside. Place the 1/2 stick butter and the brown sugar in the skillet and let the mixture melt and begin to caramelize. When lightly caramelized, place pineapples and enough cherries to cover on top, in a decorative pattern. Then pour the cake batter over, filling to within 1/2-inch of the top of the skillet. Transfer the skillet to a large foil pan and cover with foil; be careful handling the skillet as the handle will also be very hot. Return to the grill and pierce the foil in the corners to allow steam to escape during the cooking process. Grill cake at 350 degrees F until cake is golden brown and springs back when lightly touched with your finger, about 45 minutes.

Melt the butter; add the crushed garlic and Italian seasonings. Using a cake pan or cookie sheet with edges, place the caps, gill side up and without the stem (reserve the stem for making veggie broth). Equally divide the butter mixture between caps. Bake for about 20 minutes. Caps should be cooked but not shriveled. They should be firm to touch and just a little light color left. (Do not over cook.) While caps are cooking, start your poached egg water. Add a teaspoon of white vinegar to help bind the eggs. When the caps are done, remove them and cover them with foil to keep them warm. Turn the oven up to broil. Drop your eggs into hot water. In another large frying pan, saute/steam your spinach in just a touch of olive oil and a little water. Keep stirring the spinach. When the eggs are almost ready (about 4 minutes). Arrange the spinach on 4 oven safe plates. Place 1 cap on each bed of spinach; place 2 eggs on each cap. Drizzle heavy cream over the whole plate. Sprinkle with Parmesan and flash under broiler, just enough to melt cheese a little.

Place the bowl of white melts over the top and melt until smooth.<br> Pour a small amount of the white chocolate into a 6- to 7-inch plastic chocolate dome mold and swirl the mold to coat the inside completely in a thin layer. Place in the refrigerator for 1 minute. Remove and spoon 1/4 cup more white chocolate into the mold. Using the back of the spoon, smooth the white chocolate all around the inside to create a thicker layer; refrigerate for 1 to 2 minutes.\\u202fRepeat this process 2 more times, so that you have a solid white chocolate layer in the mold. Leave in the refrigerator while you finish assembling the cake. Place any leftover melted chocolate in a disposable pastry bag or resealable plastic bag.\\u202f<br> To make the penguins, form a ball of black gum paste about the size of a golf ball. Using the insides of your palms or the tabletop, gently roll one end to form the ball into a egg shape. Orienting the pointier side of the egg up, make a small snip with a sharp pair of scissors on one side of the egg, close to the bottom, and use your finger to lift the snip up to form a wing. Repeat directly across from this snip on the other side to make the second wing.\\u202fRepeat the making egg shapes and snips 3 times for 3 more penguins.<br> Take a small amount of white gum paste and roll it out thinly, dusting with cornstarch so it doesn&#39;t stick to your surface. Cut out 4 small teardrops with a cutter or very sharp paring knife. Trim a small V-shaped notch from the tip of each white teardrop.

Repeat with the remaining penguins.\\u202f<br> Split the orange melting candies in half, then gently press the body of the penguin onto 2 of the orange melt halves to position them for feet. Lift the penguin off and brush the foot indents with vodka, then press the penguin gently back on top of the orange melts to adhere. Repeat with the remaining penguins. Cut the sour belts in half lengthwise, then cut into 6-inch strips. Tie one in a loose knot and drape around a penguin&#39;s head; tighten as needed, then trim to the desired length. Repeat with the remaining penguins. Press an orange chocolate-covered sunflower seed into each head to create a beak on each penguin. Use edible markers to draw eyes on each.\\u202f<br> Level both cake layers using a serrated knife. Flip one round upside down and secure to a 12-inch round silver cake board set on a cake turntable with a dollop of Frosting. Spread an even layer of Frosting (about 1/2 cup) over the top of the cake layer. Flip the second cake layer upside down and place atop the Frosting. Frost the entire cake with a thin even coat of Frosting. If your Frosting has picked up a lot of crumbs, refrigerate the cake 30 minutes. Generously frost the cake with a second layer of Frosting, using an offset spatula to create swirls and snow drifts.\\u202f<br> Remove the chocolate mold from the refrigerator and invert onto a clean work surface, using the edges of the mold to lift it off. Use a sharp paring knife to cut a broken-looking hole into the front of the igloo. Place the chocolate dome on top of the cake, positioning it close to one edge. Snip a very small bit of the tip off the end of the pastry bag with the white chocolate. Create &#39;ice bricks&#39; on the igloo by piping horizontal lines at 1-inch intervals around the dome (put the pastry bag back in the microwave for a couple of seconds if it gets too hard to pipe). Then pipe in staggered vertical lines to create the bricks.<br> Add more Frosting where you wish to make snow drifts against the igloo and around the bottom of the cake.

Set aside. Place the pancetta in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Cook gently until the pancetta releases its juices and browns, about 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve. To the rendered fat in the pan, add the olive oil and, when hot, the onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook until soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook just until it releases its fragrance, about 1 minute. Add the red pepper flakes and oregano, cook for a minute or two, and then add the red wine. Cook until the wine is almost evaporated, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Return the pancetta to the pan, along with the tomatoes and their juices, the carrots, and the basil. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer gently, stirring frequently, until thickened and reduced by one-half to two-thirds, about 5 hours. When the sauce has thickened and reduced, remove the carrots and basil, and puree to the desired smoothness using an immersion blender. Stir in the parsley. For the meatballs: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Spray a wire rack with nonstick cooking spray and place over a parchment-lined baking sheet. Combine the panko and buttermilk in a large bowl and let sit, mashing occasionally with fork, until a smooth paste forms, about 10 minutes. Add the eggs, ground beef, ground pork, prosciutto, Parmesan, parsley, garlic, pepper and salt. Gently mix with your hands until thoroughly combined, then lightly form into golf ball-size meatballs (approximately 24). Place the meatballs, evenly spaced, on the prepared rack and roast until browned, about 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. When the sauce is ready, gently add the meatballs to the pot and simmer, covered, over low heat until the meatballs are fully cooked and firm, about 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of well-salted water a boil--the water should taste salty like the ocean. Add the pasta and cook until just al dente. Drain and rinse under cold water, then return the pasta to the pot. Ladle approximately half of the sauce into the pasta and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, to let the pasta absorb some of the sauce. Using tongs, portion the pasta into individual pasta bowls. Top with 3 to 4 meatballs per serving and finish with more sauce. Serve extra Parmesan separately at the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barolo, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 6744,&quot;Perfectly Grilled Shrimp 1 pound large shrimp (21 to 24), peeled and deveined 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat your grill to high.

Turn the shrimp over and continue grilling until just cooked through, 45 seconds to 1 minute longer. Remove the shrimp to a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 6745,&quot;Seared Porterhouse with Oozing Maitre d&#39; Butter 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus 8 additional tablespoons, softened 1 cup minced shallots Coarse sea salt 2 teaspoons green peppercorns 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plus a \\few grates\\ lemon zest 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves 2 porterhouse steak, about 2 1/2 pounds and about 2 1/2 inches thick Instructions: Make the butter: In a medium saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat, then add the shallots. Season with salt, to taste, and cook until they are translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the shallots to a medium bowl. Add the green peppercorns, mustard, lemon juice, lemon zest and Worcestershire sauce. Whisk to blend so all of the flavors start to meld together. Use a fork to blend in the other 8 tablespoons of butter. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and stir in the parsley. Roll the butter into a cylinder (like cookie dough) in plastic wrap or parchment pepper and refrigerate until ready to use. Cook the steak: Heat a cast iron skillet large enough to hold the steak until it begins to visibly smoke. Use a kitchen towel to \\blot\\ any excess moisture from both sides of the steak and season with salt and pepper. Shut the heat off underneath the skillet and use a pair of tongs to put the steak squarely in the pan. Raise the heat high and brown on the first side, 3 to 5 minutes. Resist the temptation to move it as it cooks. Lower the heat and cook for an additional 8 to 10 minutes. Turn it on its second side and brown for 3 to 5 minutes. Lower the heat and cook for an additional 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the steak on the edge with the fat \\cap\\ and brown that for 3 to 5 minutes. Lower the heat and allow the steak to cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Slice the maitre d&#39; butter into1/2-inch rounds and set aside. Testing for doneness: The simplest way to check for doneness is to make a small incision by the center bone in the thickest part of the steak. It should be a little less cooked than you would like to allow for \\carry over\\ cooking and the \\finishing\\ touch of running the steak under the broiler. For rare, a 2 1/2-inch porterhouse steak should take around 30 to 35 minutes to cook. Add about 4 minutes for medium-rare and 4 additional for medium. If using an instant-read thermometer, rare registers between 125 and 130 degrees F. For medium-rare, 130 to 135 degrees F and between 135 and 140 degrees F for medium. Remove the steak from the pan to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut into slices and transfer the whole thing to a heatproof platter with the meat still arranged around each side of the center bone. Top the steak with a single layer of the butter slices, put it under the broiler until the butter softens, about 30 to 45 seconds. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 6746,&quot;Chipotle Mustard Dipping Sauce 1 cup chipotle salsa 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup honey 1 1/2 ounces dried chipotle chiles, stemmed or 1 cup canned chipotle chiles, stemmed 3 ripe Italian Roma tomatoes, cored 4 garlic cloves, peeled 3 cups water 2 teaspoons salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: With a whisk, mix all ingredients together well and serve. Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, about 20 minutes. The liquid should be reduced by one-third and the tomato skins should be falling off. Set aside to cool. Pour the mixture into a blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade. Puree until smooth and then pass through a strainer. Serve chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 6747,&quot;Hot Pastrami Sandwich 1 tablespoon butter 2 slices caraway rye bread<br> 1 slice provolone 1 slice Swiss cheese<br> 4 ounces hot pastrami<br> 2 to 3 ounces sauerkraut<br> 2 to 4 tablespoons mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon yellow mustard<br> Instructions: Heat a flattop grill or pan on medium heat. Butter one side of each slice of bread. Set the buttered side of bread on the flattop. Add provolone to one slice and Swiss to the other slice. Grill until bread is toasted and cheese has melted, approximately 5 minutes, then remove from the flattop. Meanwhile, place pastrami on the flattop in a pile and the sauerkraut on the flattop in a separate pile. Grill both until warm, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, then flip and warm the other side. Add mayonnaise to both pieces of bread, then add mustard to one half. Place half the pastrami on one slice and the other half on the other slice. Add sauerkraut to one half and flip the other slice on top. Cut sandwich in half and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 6748,&quot;Grilled Avocados 6 firm avocados Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/4 cup packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, plus a few small sprigs for garnish 3 garlic cloves, lightly crushed with the side of a knife blade and quartered 3/4 cup olive oil Instructions: Preheat the grill. Quarter the avocados and remove the seed. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and brush with grapeseed oil. Grill the avocado slices over indirect heat, leaving undisturbed for the first 2 to 4 minutes or so to let the seasonings integrate into the surface and to allow the caramelization process to begin. Then, flip the avocados, remove from grill and let rest. Through the feed opening of a running blender add, 1 at a time, the vinegar, salt, black pepper, mustard, parsley, and garlic. Leaving the blender running add the olive oil through the feed opening in a slow thin stream. Serve the grilled avocado with enough of the dressing to coat and garnish with fresh parsley sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6749,&quot;cl Rubbed Rare Ostrich with Black Bean-Corn Succotash Ginger-Orange Syrup 1 tablespoon ancho cl powder (may substitute with other cl powders) 1 tablespoon coarse ground black pepper 1 tablespoon sugar 1 ostrich tenderloin, trimmed, left whole Salt, to taste Canola oil, to cook 2 slices minced bacon 1 cup soaked black beans, drained (save bean water) 1 large onion, small dice 1 large carrot, small dice 1 large rib celery, small dice 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 tablespoon washed, minced fermented black beans Salt and black pepper, to taste Bean water, to cover 2 cups shucked corn (or frozen) 1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar or balsamic 2 cups fresh orange juice 2 large slices peeled ginger 2 oranges, zested Instructions: Prepare a hot, cleaned and oiled grill. On a plate, mix together the cl powder, black pepper and sugar. Season the tenderloin with salt and roll in the spice mix. Place tenderloin on the grill and cook on all sides for a total cooking time of only 5 to 7 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing. We want the meat rare and warm on the inside. In a heavy saucepan, coat with oil and saute bacon until brown. Add the beans, onion, carrot, celery, garlic and fermented beans. Saute for 3 minutes. Season and cover with bean water. Check for seasoning. Cook on low heat until beans are soft but still intact, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add corn and vinegar and cook 5 minutes more. Check again for seasoning. In a non-reactive pan, bring juice and ginger to a simmer. Reduce by 80 percent until syrupy. PLATING Family Style: on large oval, place a mound of the succotash in the middle.

WINE: Chilled Gamay from Beaujolais (Fleurie or Chiroubles) &quot;,&quot;[Gamay, Fleurie, Chiroubles]</p><p>&quot; 6750,&quot;Boston Cream Doughnuts Topped with Cacao Nibs 1 cup warm water (110 to 120 degrees F) 1 tablespoon plus 2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting 1 1/4 sticks (10 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 3 large eggs, at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3 1/2 cups bread flour Neutral oil, for oiling the bowl 1 quart frying oil 2 1/4 cups heavy cream 1 cup sugar<br> 1/2 vanilla bean, split and scraped<br> 3 large eggs<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 1 cup dark chocolate chunks 1 tablespoon corn syrup 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/4 cup cocoa nibs Instructions: For the dough: Put the warm water in a medium bowl and whisk in the yeast. Set aside to proof until you see bubbles on the surface, about 10 minutes. (If there is nothing at all, start again with fresher yeast.) Stir in the all-purpose flour, then cover with plastic and set aside in a warm place, at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cream together the butter and sugar in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until light and fluffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Do not skimp on or rush the creaming time. Add the eggs with the mixer on low speed, one by one, followed by the vanilla and salt. If the mixture seems to separate, slightly increase the speed and keep going; it will come back together. Add the bread flour and mix on low speed until fully incorporated. Pour in the yeast mixture and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Put the dough in an oiled bowl and proof again in a warm place for about 1 1/2 hours. For the pastry cream: Put 2 cups of the heavy cream, 1/2 cup of the sugar and the vanilla bean seeds and pod in a saucepan and whisk to combine. Bring to a boil over low heat. Meanwhile, combine the eggs and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in one bowl and the cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup heavy cream in a second bowl. Beat both with a whisk to a homogeneous mixture. Set aside.<br> When the cream comes to a boil, whisk half of the cream into the egg-sugar mixture and then IMMEDIATELY whisk it back into the pan with the hot cream. (This is called tempering and will allow you to combine boiling cream and eggs without making scrambled eggs.)<br> Return the pan to medium heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch-milk mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. (It is necessary to bring this mixture to a boil to cook the starch; otherwise the pastry cream will feel starchy and gritty.) Cook until thickened to the consistency of vanilla pudding, 3 to 5 minutes. Strain into a bowl and chill until firm, about 2 hours (chilling can be done really quickly over an ice bath).<br> Prepare the frying oil: Heat the oil in a medium heavy-bottomed pot fitted with a deep-frying thermometer until it reaches 350 degrees F. Fit a cooling rack into a sheet pan for landing finished doughnuts. Roll and cut the dough: Lightly sprinkle a cool surface with an even layer of flour and dust a baking sheet with flour. Lightly flour a rolling pin and a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, being careful not to use too much. Turn the dough out onto the surface and use the rolling pin to first gently flatten, then roll the dough out to 1/2- to 1-inch thick. Cut rounds of dough with the cookie cutter and turn them onto the floured baking sheet to rest in a warm place, 20 to 30 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). You cannot re-roll or use scraps unless you fry them \\as is,\\ so cut your doughnut rounds very close together to maximize yield. Fry the doughnuts: When the oil reaches 350 degrees F, drop 2 to 3 doughnuts into the hot fat and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove them with a slotted spoon or fish spatula and set on the cooling rack. Continue with the remaining doughnuts and set aside to cool. For the glaze and topping: Melt the dark chocolate chunks over a double boiler until smooth. Remove from the heat and add the corn syrup. Stir to combine and set aside. If the chocolate begins to seize, adjust with a splash of hot water. Melt the butter in a small pan over low heat. Add the cacao nibs and toast for about 1 minute. Transfer the cocoa nibs to a paper towel to dry. Fill the doughnuts: Transfer the cooled pastry cream to a pastry bag fitted with a pastry tip. Poke the pastry tip into the side of each doughnut to inject cream into the center of each. Finish the doughnuts: Dip the tops of the filled doughnuts into the melted chocolate and sprinkle with the toasted cacao nibs. Place on a rack and let set, 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 6751,&quot;Sesame-Orange Beef 4 teaspoons cornstarch 2 teaspoons soy sauce 3/4 pound beef tri-tip, thinly sliced across the grain 1/4 cup fresh orange juice 2 tablespoons oyster-flavored sauce 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon sesame seeds 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon minced ginger 2 oranges, segmented 1/2 cup pineapple chunks Instructions: To make the marinade, combine 2 teaspoons of the cornstarch and soy sauce in a bowl and mix well. Add the beef and stir to coat evenly. Let stand for 10 minutes. To make the sauce, combine the orange juice, oyster sauce, honey and remaining 2 teaspoons cornstarch in a small bowl and stir until honey dissolves. Set aside. In a small frying pan, toast the sesame seeds over medium heat, shaking the pan frequently, until lightly colored, 3 to 4 minutes. Immediately pour onto a plate to cool. Place a stir-fry pan over high heat until hot. Add the oil, swirling to coat on all sides. Add the ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add the beef and stir-fry until caramelized on the edges and still slightly pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the sauce and cook, stirring, until the sauce boils and thickens slightly, about 20 seconds. Stir in the orange segments and pineapple chunks and cook for 30 seconds to heat through. Transfer to a serving plate, sprinkle with the sesame seeds and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 6752,&quot;Goat Cheese Gnocchi with Bacon, Dates and Kentucky Wine Sauce 12 ounces fresh goat cheese, at room temperature 4 ounces fresh goat milk ricotta, or cow milk ricotta if that is all that is available<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1/2 to 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Kosher salt 6 ounces slab bacon, small diced 8 to 10 large dates, pitted and small diced (about 1/3 cup)<br> 1/2 cup white wine<br> 1/2 cup vegetable stock<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley<br> Instructions: Combine the goat cheese, ricotta and eggs in a large bowl and mix until smooth and homogenous. Add 1/2 cup of flour and stir until combined. Being careful not to overwork the dough, add more flour, 2 tablespoons at a time, until the dough is smooth and supple (not sticky). If you add too much flour or stir too much you will have very dense little gnocchi and this is not what you want. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile put on a large pot of water to boil. On a lightly dusted surface, press and shape the dough into an 8-by-14-by-1/2-inch rectangle. With a floured sharp knife, cut the rectangle into 1-by-1/2-inch pieces. Using a fork on a dusted surface, shape the gnocchi by pressing a piece of the dough into the back of the fork slightly to create ridges, then roll it down the fork toward the work surface to form it into a dumpling. If the dough begins to stick, flour the fork and your fingers. Place the finished gnocchi on a floured cookie sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. When the water comes to a boil, prepare an ice bath. Season the boiling water with salt. Cooking in batches, place the gnocchi in the water with a slotted spoon and give them a quick stir to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Cook until all the gnocchi rise to the surface, then cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes to cook through--the timing will depend on how long they take to rise, about 4 minutes total. Immediately remove the gnocchi with the slotted spoon and put in the ice bath to stop the cooking. When they are cool, drain. They are now ready to be sauteed. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi. Heat a nonstick saute pan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp (the fat will start to foam when this happens). Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon. Add the gnocchi to the pan and sear in the warm bacon fat, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the gnocchi to a plate. Add the dates to the pan. Whisk in the wine and vegetable stock and simmer until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in the butter. Add the gnocchi, bacon and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the parsley and toss to combine. Serve on a platter and sprinkle with the remaining parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 6753,&quot;Summer Watermelon Situation 8 cups diced watermelon (about 1/2 of a small watermelon), plus slices for garnish 8 ounces lemon vodka, chilled 7 ounces simple syrup, recipe follows 1 (17.5-ounce) can coconut juice 1 lemon 1 cup sugar 1 cup water Instructions: Chill watermelon in the freezer for 30 minutes. Put all the ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lemon. Serve very cold in a chilled glass, and garnish with watermelon or lemon slices.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large saute pan set over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the curry powder and toast until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the potato and onion and stir to coat with the curry oil. Cover and cook until the vegetables start to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and cl and cook for 1 more minute. Stir in the peas and season with salt and pepper.<br> In a small bowl, whisk the egg with 2 teaspoons water to make an egg wash.<br> On a floured work surface, gently roll out the puff pastry sheets, removing any fold marks but keeping the same general size and shape of the sheets. Using a medium (3-inch) circular biscuit cutter or cookie cutter, cut out 9 large rounds per sheet, 18 all together between the 2 sheets of pastry.<br> On the bottom half of each of the rounds, spoon a heaping tablespoon of the curry mixture. Brush the edges of each round with some egg wash. Fold the pastry over the filling, seal the edges with your fingers and then crimp them with the tines of a fork. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling. Brush each one with some of the remaining egg wash and transfer the puffs to the prepared baking sheets.<br> Bake the curry puffs until they have puffed and are golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Line 2 heavy large baking sheets with parchment paper. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a large bowl until fluffy. Beat in the egg. Add the flour and mix just until a dough forms. Fit a pastry bag with a large star tip, and fill the pastry bag with the cookie dough. Pipe the dough onto the prepared baking sheets into stars, spacing 1-inch apart. If desired, press about 4 miniature chocolate chips into the center of each star at this point. Bake the cookies until they are pale golden around the edges and on the bottom, about 15 minutes. Cool the cookies for 5 minutes. Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to a rack and cool completely. When the cookies have cooled, spoon approximately 1/4 teaspoon of preserves atop the flat side of 1 cookie. Press a second cookie onto the preserves. Repeat with the remaining cookies and preserves. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Store between sheets of waxed paper in an airtight container at room temperature.) Cook&#39;s Notes: Alternately, the cookies can be made into thumbprint cookies. To do so, refrigerate the dough until it is cold, about 2 hours. Roll 2 teaspoons of dough for each cookie into 1-inch-diameter ball. Place the cookies on the baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Make a deep indentation in the center of each cookie by pressing the back of a teaspoon into the cookies. Fill each indentation with 1/2 teaspoon of strawberry or raspberry preserves or chocolate chips, and bake as directed. A chilled chocolate ganache may be used in place of the preserves to fill the indentations in these cookies. To do this, do not fill the indentations before baking the cookies. While the cookies bake, make the ganache by mixing equal parts of warm cream and chocolate until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth, then chill the ganache. Once the cookies have baked and cooled, and the chocolate ganache is cold and firm but still spreadable, spoon or pipe the chilled ganache into the empty indentations on the cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 6757,&quot;BBQ Pulled Jackfruit Sandwiches One 8-ounce bag coleslaw mix 4 teaspoons apple cider vinegar<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Two 20-ounce cans jackfruit in brine, rinsed and patted dry 2 teaspoon chili powder 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 3/4 cup barbecue sauce<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons light brown sugar, optional 8 large potato buns<br> Instructions: Combine the coleslaw mix, cider vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl.

Bring the pot to a medium-high heat and cook the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onions, season generously with salt and stir to coat with olive oil. Cook the onions for 6 to 7 minutes stirring frequently. The onions should become very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes stirring frequently. Pass the tomatoes through the food mill. Be sure to pass all of the pulp through the holes leaving only the stems and the seeds, and be sure to scrape the pulp off of the bottom of the food mill. That&#39;s all of the big money stuff! Add the tomatoes to the pot and rinse out 1 of the empty tomato cans with water and add that water to the pot (about 2 to 3 cups). Season generously with salt and TASTE IT!!!! Tomatoes take a lot of salt. Season in baby steps and taste every step of the way. Cook the sauce for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally and tasting frequently. Use the sauce right away on pasta or for any other tomato sauce need.

Butter a 2-quart baking dish. Scatter the bread cubes on a baking sheet. Drizzle with the melted butter and toss to coat. Bake, stirring halfway through, until the bread is golden brown and crunchy, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, follow the package directions for microwaving and salting the pretzels (don&#39;t use all the salt). Quarter each pretzel.<br> Whisk together the milk, cream, sugar, vanilla, whole eggs and yolks in a medium bowl. Scatter the bread cubes in the prepared baking dish. Top with the pretzel pieces (turning some over to show off the nicely browned bottoms) and then nestle in the caramel candy halves. Pour the custard over the mixture. Cover with foil and set aside at room temperature for 20 minutes.<br> Bake until the bread pudding is set with a slight jiggle in the center, 45 to 55 minutes. Let rest for at least 15 minutes before serving.<br> For the caramel sauce: Meanwhile, combine the caramels, butter and cream in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, stirring halfway through, until the caramels and butter melt together, about 2 minutes. Whisk until smooth and thick. (The caramel sauce can be made ahead of time and then reheated to loosen up for serving.) Drizzle the bread pudding with the caramel sauce and sprinkle with some pretzel salt before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 6765,&quot;Ballpark Pretzels 1 1/2 cups warm water (110 to 115 degrees F) 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons active dry yeast 3 cups flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons melted butter Vegetable oil 2/3 cup baking soda 2 egg yolks beaten with 1 tablespoon water Coarse sea salt Super Cheesy Sauce, recipe follows 1 bottle beer 2 cups grated orange sharp Cheddar cheese 1 tablespoon flour 1 cup cream cheese, diced and softened 1 clove garlic, minced 1/2 jalapeno, minced Salt and pepper Instructions: Chuck Hughes&#39; yummy Ballpark Pretzels are just as much fun to bake as they are to eat! Combine the warm water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the dry yeast on top. Let sit until the mixture begins to foam, about 5 minutes. Add the flour and butter. Next, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until it&#39;s well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes. (Kneading the dough can also be done by hand.)<br> Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil with vegetable oil. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.<br> Line a baking tray with parchment paper and lightly brush with vegetable oil. Set aside.<br> When the dough is ready, lightly flour your working surface and divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope and, holding the ends, cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place the pretzels on the baking tray and leave it at room temperature for 1 hour. This dries out the surface and makes them easier to handle.<br> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> In an 8-quart saucepan or roasting pan, bring 10 cups water to a boil. Cut the heat and slowly add the baking soda to prevent from overflowing. Bring it back to a boil and add the pretzels to the boiling water, 1 by 1, for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula and put it back on the baking tray. This step will create a shiny, brown crunchy pretzel shell.<br> Beat the egg yolk s with 1 tablespoons water and brush the top of each pretzel. Sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake until dark golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving with the Super Cheesy Sauce. For the cheesy sauce, in a saucepan over medium heat, bring the beer to a simmer. In a bowl, mix the cheese with the flour. Add the cheese mixture to the beer with the remaining ingredients. Stir until all the cheese has melted and the texture is smooth, about 5 minutes. Keep warm until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 6766,&quot;Funked Out Grilled Cheese 8 ounces fresh mozzarella, sliced 10 to 12 basil leaves, torn 4 slices bread Pinch salt Pinch cracked black pepper 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat a grill over medium-high heat.

Let stand for a few minutes. In a mixer, combine the flour and salt. With the mixer running on low speed (with a paddle attachment), drizzle in the olive oil until combined with the flour. Next, pour in the yeast/water mixture and mix until just combined and the dough comes together. (The dough will be sticky.) Form the dough into a ball. Coat a separate mixing bowl with a light drizzle of olive oil and toss the dough in the olive oil to coat. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set it aside for 1 hour to rise. Then put it in the fridge to chill for 2 hours or longer. (The dough is much easier to work with when very cold.) For the mushroom version: Add the olive oil to a pan with the heat on medium and saute the garlic and onions for about a minute. Add the mushrooms and thyme and saute for 3 minutes. Add the white wine and reduce for a couple of minutes until most of the liquid is gone. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool to room temperature. For the meat version: Crumble the Italian sausage into a skillet with some olive oil and brown until cooked through, 5 minutes. Let cool. When you are ready to make the pizza pockets, take half the dough and roll it out into a large rectangle. Cut into 18 rectangles with a rectangular cutter. Put 9 of the rectangles onto a baking sheet and top them with the fillings for the meat version: some marinara sauce, mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni and Canadian bacon. Lay the other 9 rectangles on top and crimp the edges with a fork. Brush with the beaten egg. Put into the freezer to flash-freeze for 30 minutes. Repeat with the other half of the dough and the fillings for the mushroom version: some mozzarella, goat cheese and the sauteed mushrooms. When the pockets have been flash-frozen, transfer to ziptop bags and store in the freezer. When ready to cook, place on a baking sheet and bake at 450 degrees F for 10 to 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 6772,&quot;Gluten-Free Dark Chocolate and Blueberry Panna Cotta Nonstick cooking spray 3 tablespoons whole milk 2 1/2 teaspoons unflavored powdered gelatin 2 cups heavy cream 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 cup dark chocolate chips 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups blueberries 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice Instructions: For the panna cotta: Place ten foil cupcake liners in a muffin pan.

Chop the hazelnuts and place them on a sheet pan. Roast them in the oven for 10 minutes. (If the hazelnuts have skin on them, roast them for 25 minutes.) Set aside to cool. Chop the chocolates finely and place in a bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it boils. Immediately pour the hot cream through a fine-meshed sieve into the bowl with the chocolates. With a wire whisk, slowly stir the cream and chocolates together until the chocolate is completely melted. (If the chocolate doesn&#39;t melt completely, place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir for a few minutes just until it melts.) Whisk in the hazelnut liqueur, coffee, and vanilla. Cover and chill for 45 minutes to 1 hour until pliable but firm enough to scoop. With 2 teaspoons or a 1 1/4-inch ice cream scoop, make dollops of the chocolate mixture and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes, until firm enough to roll into rough spheres. Roll the chocolate in the chopped hazelnuts and chill again. Truffles are best when they&#39;re allowed to set overnight in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 6790,&quot;Crab and Tomato Quiche One 9-inch frozen pie shell 1/4 cup minced fresh chives 1/2 cup jumbo lump crabmeat, picked through for shells 1/2 cup quartered cherry tomatoes 1 cup shredded mozzarella 1 1/4 cups half-and-half 3 large eggs 1/8 teaspoon cayenne Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Par-bake the crust according to package directions.

Put the apples in the fridge while preparing the chocolate; they&#39;ll coat better if they&#39;re cold. Slowly melt the chocolate in a double boiler over hot water or in a microwave set on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through the heating time to smooth it out. Remove from the heat and stir until completely melted and warm, not hot. Dunk each apple into the chocolate, allowing the excess to drip back into the bowl. Roll the apples around in the chocolate, turning with the stick, so it&#39;s coated all the way up to the top. Use a spoon to baste any hard to get spots. Put the desired coating in a separate bowl and roll the dipped apple around so it is completely covered. Set the chocolate dipped apples on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper. Refrigerate until the chocolate is set. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 6792,&quot;Buttermilk Pecan Chicken 2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts 1 cup buttermilk 1 cup toasted pecans 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs 1/3 cup vegetable oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place each chicken breast between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and gently flatten with a meat mallet or heavy flat object to an even 1/3-inch thick.

Pulse once or twice to evenly incorporate. Add the butter and lard and pulse until the fat is broken down into pea-size pieces, 5 to 6 pulses. Add the cider vinegar and 1 tablespoon of the cold water and pulse to combine. Continue adding a tablespoon of water at a time and pulsing after each addition until the dough just comes together (you may not need the full 1/3 cup water). Remove the dough from the food processor and form a third of the dough (about 9 ounces) into a disk. Form the remaining two-thirds of the dough (about 1 pound) into another disk. Wrap the disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Remove the dough disks from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 10 to 20 minutes to take the chill off. For the filling: Combine the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, salt, ginger and nutmeg in a small bowl. Set aside. Put the apple slices in a large bowl and stir in the sugar mixture and orange juice. Mix to combine. Dust a clean work surface with flour and roll out the larger disk of dough into a 13-inch round. Transfer to a 10-inch pie dish. Pour the apple filling into the shell and then evenly distribute the butter pieces over the apples. Roll out the second disk of dough into an approximately 11-by-10-inch rectangle. Cut the dough into six strips, about 11 inches long by 1 1/4 inches thick. Form a lattice top by laying 3 parallel dough strips vertically across the pie. Fold the middle strip of dough in half back over itself and lay one piece of dough horizontally across the middle of the pie, perpendicular to the other dough strips. Fold the original strip of dough back down. Next, lift the other two strips of dough and fold them back over themselves. Lay another strip of dough perpendicular to the folded-over dough pieces. Fold those pieces back down and repeat on the other side with the remaining piece of dough. Trim the dough around the edges of the pie dish so there is no more than a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the bottom crust up and over the edges of the lattice top and crimp the edges together between your forefingers and thumbs. Place the pie on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and cover the edges with foil or a pie crust shield.

Heat the olive oil together with the butter in a saute pan with straight sides (sauteuse) over medium heat. Add the poussin, without crowding, to the saute pan skin side down and cook slowly to brown the chickens to a golden brown color. Turn the chickens to brown the other side, add the pearl onions to caramelize with the chicken, and place a lid on the pan. Allow the chicken and onions to simmer together for 5 to 7 minutes. Add the dry sherry to the saute pan and cook down to reduce the liquid until almost evaporated. Add the hot stock together with the spices tied in cheesecloth into an herb bouquet garni. Let this simmer slowly over low heat for 30 to 35 minutes. After 20 minutes has gone by add the morels to the pan and continue to simmer all together for the remaining 15 minutes cooking time. Remove the chicken carefully from the pan, add the peas and asparagus to the stock and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the creme fraiche and cook together for 2 more minutes before spooning the vegetables around the chicken and pouring the excess sauce into a sauceboat.

Line a muffin pan with 24 cupcake liners.<br> In a very large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the milk, shortening, Champagne and vanilla. Beat on low to medium speed for about 30 seconds, or until just combined. Scraping the bowl constantly, beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add the egg whites and beat for 2 minutes. Fill the cupcake liners half full with batter and bake until the center springs back when touched, about 12 minutes. Cool before frosting.<br> For the buttercream: Put the egg whites in the large mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Put 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup water in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium to high heat. Bring to a soft ball stage (240 degrees F), 4 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, whip the egg whites at high speed until soft peaks form. With the motor running, gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, continuing to whip until medium peaks form.<br> When the sugar water reaches 240 degrees F, raise the speed to high and gradually add in the sugar water to the egg whites in a thin stream to avoid cooking the egg whites. Leave the mixer on high for 2 minutes, and then reduce the speed to medium until the mixture has cooled to room temperature, 5 to 8 minutes.<br> Once cooled, add the butter in increments, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.

Just as the water reaches a simmer, remove and discard the kombu and add the bonito flakes. Heat to just shy of a boil, remove from the heat and set aside to steep for a few minutes. Strain into a bowl and discard the bonito flakes. For the ramen broth: Wipe out the pot, add the oil and set over medium-high heat. Add the reserved shrimp shells and scallion whites. Cook, stirring, until the shells are brown all over, 4 to 5 minutes; the shells should make a crackling sound as they toast and brown. Add the dashi and shiitakes and bring to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, then strain the broth, reserving the shiitakes. Return the broth to the pot, stir in the mirin and seafood seasoning and set over low heat until ready to serve. You should have about 3 cups of broth. Stem and slice the shitakes and set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse the noodles with cold water to remove surface starch and stop the cooking. Leave to drain. Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour half of the bacon fat from the pan into a small container to save for frying the noodles. Raise the heat to medium-high, add the shrimp and corn to the remaining bacon fat in the skillet and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Saute until the shrimp are cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove the shrimp and corn to a plate, then add the reserved bacon fat to the skillet. Let the skillet get good and hot before adding the ramen noodles. Cook, stirring minimally, until the noodles are crispy and charred in places, about 3 minutes. Divide the noodles among four bowls. Top with shrimp, corn, bacon, sliced shiitakes, scallion greens and shredded nori. Ladle ramen broth into the bowls and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 6818,&quot;Texas Sunrise (nonalcoholic) 8 oz. fresh orange juice 3/4 oz. maraschino syrup lime wedge cherry<br> Instructions: Start by filling a glass with ice and pouring in 8 oz. fresh-squeezed orange juice.

Add the cabbage to a pan, cover with chicken stock and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until tender, about 1 hour. Drizzle the squash halves with the oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and put on a baking sheet cut-side up. Roast until tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Set aside to cool. Put the potatoes in a pot and add enough salted water to cover. Cover the pot, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain the potatoes and mash with a fork or potato masher. For the steaks: In a bowl, mix together the parsley, salt, pepper and lemon and lime juice. In a shallow bowl, cover the steaks with the sauce and marinate for 30 minutes. Measure out 2 cups of the mashed potatoes, 1 cup of the cooked cabbage and 1 cup of the roasted squash into a large bowl (save the remaining vegetables for another use). Add the egg and some salt and pepper and mix well. Form into four equal cakes, each about 1 inch thick. To cook the cakes, heat a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add some butter and then the cakes and cook until golden brown on one side. Flip and cook on the second side until golden brown. Keep warm. For the poached eggs: Heat 8 cups water and the vinegar in a pot until simmering. Carefully crack the eggs into the water and cook for 3 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and place on a plate or into soup cups until plating. To cook the steaks, heat a thick-bottom pan over high heat until smoking. Remove the steaks from the marinade. Reduce the heat to medium, add the oil and steaks and cook for 3 minutes on each side. Set the steaks aside on a plate to rest for 2 minutes. Add the Sriracha to the pan and stir to create a pan sauce. Slice the steaks on the bias. Place a bubble and squeak cake on each plate followed by some sliced steak. Top with a poached egg and finish with the pan sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 6820,&quot;Butter-Basted Turkey and Gravy One 14-to-16-pound turkey, innards for stuffing, neck reserved for gravy Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Stuffing, optional 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 6 large cloves garlic 2 medium carrots, sliced 3 medium yellow onions, sliced 8 cups low-sodium chicken stock 1/2 cup dry sherry 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Stuff the turkey: Place the turkey on a flat surface, season with salt and pepper on the inside and out and stuff the cavity with stuffing if using. Tie the legs closed with a strong piece of kitchen twine or string by wrapping them around and around the drumsticks and pulling them closed like you&#39;re tying a shoe. Prepare the turkey: Soak 1 large double-layered piece of cheesecloth in the butter. Brush any remaining butter on top of the bird and cover the breast meat with the cheesecloth to keep it moist for the first part of cooking, tucking it into the natural crevices of the bird to keep it in place. Arrange the garlic, carrots and onions in the bottom of a roasting pan and arrange the turkey on the roasting pan right above them. Place the pan in the center of the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Lower the oven to 350 degrees F and count about 12 minutes per pound of the turkey weight. After about 2 hours, take the turkey out, gently remove the cheesecloth from the top of the breasts, baste the turkey with any pan juices, rotate the pan halfway and return to the oven. Place the turkey neck and the chicken stock in a medium pot and simmer gently on the stove as the turkey finishes cooking. Reduce the stock by about half. How do you know when the turkey is done? The temperature of the thigh meat (where the meat is thickest and takes the longest time to cook) should register 160 to 165 degrees F when tested with a thermometer. The thigh juices should also be clear, not pink. When done, remove the bird from the oven, transfer to a flat surface and allow it to rest, breast side down, for 30 minutes. Why rest the turkey breast side down after cooking it breast side up? So the juices flow back through the meat as it sits. Make the gravy: Place the roasting pan over the burners of the stove, whisk in the sherry and mustard to the pan and warm it over low heat. Scrape the bottom to get the drippings and tasty bits off the bottom of the pan as the sherry reduces almost completely. Strain the neck out from the stock and add the stock to the roasting pan. Simmer over medium heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce further until the mixture starts to thicken. Puree half of the gravy (with the cooked vegetables) in a blender until smooth, and then stir back into the gravy. The vegetables are a natural thickener that is healthier and lighter than the classic cornstarch or flour! Stir in the vinegar. Taste for seasoning. Carve the turkey and serve with the gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 6821,&quot;Chicken with Peruvian cl Sauce Vegetable oil cooking spray 1 (4 to 5 pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 slice whole wheat sandwich bread, crust removed, cut or torn into 1/2-inch pieces 3/4 cup half-and-half 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 large or 2 small shallots, sliced 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 2 cups (6 ounces) crumbled queso fresco or mild feta cheese 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, plus 1/3 cup toasted (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 tablespoon Aji Amarillo paste (found in Latin markets or the Hispanic section of grocery stores) 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 4 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro or flat-leaf parsley leaves Instructions: For the chicken: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven.

Arrange the chicken pieces in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each piece of chicken registers 160 degrees F, 35 to 45 minutes. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes. For the sauce: Place the bread and half-and-half in the bowl of a food processor. Allow the bread to soak up the liquid, about 10 minutes. In a 10-inch nonstick skillet heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Cool slightly and add to the food processor with the soaked bread. Add the broth, cheeses, 1/2 cup walnuts, Aji Amarillo paste, and turmeric. Blend until smooth. Pour the sauce back into the skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.

Spoon about 1 1/4 cups of the chicken salad onto each bottom half. Replace the top half. Place onto the press and crisp until the bread is golden on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes. If using skillets, place the sandwich into the bottom pan, place the second skillet bottom on top of the sandwich and crisp, flipping halfway through the cooking process. To serve: Remove the sandwiches from the press or oven to a prep surface. Cut in half diagonally with a sharp serrated knife and arrange on serving plates. Enjoy immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 6832,&quot;Branzino with Rock Shrimp, Calamari, Wilted Frisee and Gem Lettuce and Haricots Verts 2 large egg yolks</p>",107)]))}const m=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
