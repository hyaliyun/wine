Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles and wipe them clean with a dry cloth. Place them on the comal and toast them, just until their aroma is released, 30 to 60 seconds. Be careful not to burn them. Place the chiles in a bowl and cover them with boiling water. Let them soak until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain the chiles and discard the liquid. Place the chiles, oregano, garlic, and the 2 cups of water in a blender and blend to a smooth puree. Add more water if the sauce is too thick. Place the oil in a medium size saucepan. Heat the oil over medium high heat until it is rippling. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden. Add the cl puree and salt to the pan and reduce the heat to low. It may splatter as you pour it in, so be careful. Cook, stirring often, until the raw taste is gone and the flavor of the chiles has mellowed, about 10 minutes. Finish the sauce with the sugar and vinegar.

Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil.<br> Prepare the brine.<br> Add vinegar, water, salt and garlic and peppercorns or honey (if using), to a medium saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to keep at a simmer.<br> Prepare the jalapenos.<br> Wearing latex or plastic gloves, slice the jalapenos into 1/4-inch rings. Add the rings to the brine and bring back to the boil.<br> Fill and close the jars.<br> Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the jalapenos in the saucepan. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the jalapenos into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2 inch of headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight.<br> Seal the jars.<br> Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch of water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 5 minutes.<br> Remove and cool.<br> Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly onto cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately.<br> Label and store.<br> Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening. Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years. Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 27512,&quot;Zucchine Trifolati 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 red onion, chopped 6 small zucchini (very young zucchini with few seeds), sliced into half-moons Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet.

Preheat the grill for high direct and indirect heat. Whisk together the honey, Dijon mustard, whole grain mustard and lemon juice in a small bowl and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Mix together the cheese, herbs and olive oil in a bowl until combined and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use. Brush the steaks with canola oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Grill over direct heat until slightly charred, about 5 minutes. Flip the steaks and move it away from the coals, close the cover and grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135 degrees F, about 10 minutes. Remove from the grill to a cutting board. Top the steaks with the goat cheese and drizzle with the vinaigrette. Scatter the watercress over the tops, and then finish with a good drizzle of olive oil. Garnish the platter with the grilled lemon halves. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 27514,&quot;Honeycrisp Apple, Cheddar, Bacon and Dandelion Crostini Extra-virgin olive oil 8 strips thick-cut bacon 4 slices French boule 2 Honeycrisp apples, sliced thin on a mandoline 1 cup grated sharp artisanal Cheddar, such as Tillamook 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 2 cups dandelion greens, sliced into 1/2-inch ribbons Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add about 1 tablespoon olive oil to a large saute pan. Lay the bacon strips in the pan and bring the pan to a medium heat. Cook the bacon until browned and crisp. Drain the bacon on paper towels. DO NOT ditch the bacon fat. Reserve it for finishing the crostini. Toast the bread slices lightly on both sides in the oven. Remove the toast from the oven and arrange a thin layer of the sliced apples on each toast. Top the apples with the cheese and return the toasts to the oven. Bake the crostini until the cheese starts to melt and get bubbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Place 2 bacon strips on each crostino and return to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes. While the crostini are doing their final toast, ditch about half the bacon fat. Heat the remaining bacon fat in the pan and whisk in the vinegar. Turn the heat off and toss in the dandelion greens, season with salt and stir to coat the greens with the vinaigrette. Remove the crostini from the oven, cut the bread in half and then top with the wilted dandelion greens. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 27515,&quot;Sicilian Penne with Swordfish and Eggplant 1 pound penne pasta 1/3 cup olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons 3 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes (plus more to taste) 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus 1/3 cup 4 Japanese eggplants, ends trimmed, thinly sliced lengthwise, then cut into squares 1 pound swordfish steaks, skin removed, cut into 1-inch cubes 1/3 cup white wine 2 cups halved teardrop or cherry tomatoes (red, yellow or a blend) Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta. Meanwhile, place a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the 1/3 cup olive oil, garlic, red chili flakes, and 1/4 cup parsley. Stir and cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggplant and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove the eggplant from the pan and set aside. Season the swordfish cubes with salt and pepper.

Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. Preheat a grill to medium low. Brush the grill grates with vegetable oil. Place the breadcrumbs in a shallow dish, then add the chicken, turning to thoroughly coat. Grill the chicken, turning once, until golden brown and cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes per side. Meanwhile, brush the tomatoes with vegetable oil and season with salt and black pepper. Place cut-side down on the grill and cook until marked, about 4 minutes per side. Serve with the chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27518,&quot;Linguine with Garlic Oil and Pancetta 2 tablespoons garlic-infused olive oil 8 ounces pancetta 8 ounces linguine Parsley leaves, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Fill a large saucepan with water and bring to a boil. While it&#39;s heating up, put the garlic olive oil in an ovenproof dish; I use an enamel Le Creuset one, measuring 12 by 8-inches. Remove the rind from pancetta and put it in the dish (to render down: you want as much bacony juices as possible), then dice the rest of the pancetta and add these cubes to the oil, smooshing them about with your fingers to make sure they&#39;re equally, if lightly, coated. When the water&#39;s boiling, put the dish of garlic-oiled pancetta in the oven, then salt the boiling water and add the linguine; these should need about 10 minutes to cook. When the pasta&#39;s ready, drain it, reserving a scant cupful of the cooking water and take the pancetta dish out of the oven. Tip the drained linguine into the dish and toss well, adding some of the pasta, cooking water, drop by cautious drop, for lubrication as you need it. And that&#39;s it: I like this without Parmesan, but a sprinkling of roughly scissored parsley, should you feel inclined, is always a good idea. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 27519,&quot;Peanut Butter and Jelly Pancake Stack 1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 cup cornstarch 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/4 cups milk 3 tablespoons melted butter 2 large eggs 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup jam or jelly, preferably blueberry, grape or strawberry 1/2 cup peanut butter, preferably chunky 1/2 cup maple syrup 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: For the pancakes: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with two kitchen towels stacked on top of each other and place in the oven. This will keep your cooked pancakes warm. Whisk the flour, cornstarch, confectioners&#39; sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the milk, butter, eggs and vanilla together in a medium bowl. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and whisk until they form a thick batter (do not try to whisk out all the small lumps). Let the batter rest for 5 minutes.<br> Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Ladle a heaping 1/2 cup of the batter into the skillet, spreading it into a 6-inch round. Cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancake, and the underside is golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip the pancake and cook until lightly golden and cooked through, about 45 seconds more. Transfer the pancake to the baking sheet in the oven, tucking it between the two kitchen towels. Repeat with the remaining batter to make 5 more pancakes.<br> For the glaze: Combine the peanut butter, maple syrup and salt in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave until hot, about 1 minute. Whisk vigorously until well-combined and smooth but still pourable. To assemble: Place 1 pancake on a plate and spread evenly with 3 tablespoons jelly or jam. Top with another pancake, pressing down gently to flatten out the top and evenly distribute the jam. Spread 3 tablespoons of jam over the second pancake and top with a third. Repeat with the remaining pancakes and jam to make 1 large stack of 6 pancakes. Cut into quarters and serve immediately with the warm peanut butter syrup drizzled over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 27520,&quot;Shrimp and Cilantro Pesto Quesadilla 4 large shrimp, shelled and deveined Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon 3 (6-inch) tortillas or 8-inch tortillas cut to size 1/4 cup grated Monterey Jack 1/4 cup grated white cheddar 3 tablespoons Cilantro Pesto, recipe follows 1 teaspoon ancho cl powder 2 teaspoons sour cream, or to taste 2 cups firmly packed cilantro leaves 2 cloves garlic 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 5 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Let stand for a few minutes. In a mixer with a paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. With the mixer running on low speed, drizzle in the olive oil and mix until combined. Next, pour in the yeast/water mixture, add the pressed garlic and mix until just combined and the dough comes together in a sticky mass. Divide the dough into 2 balls and put each one in a separate ziptop bag. Set the dough aside for 1 to 2 hours, or store in the fridge until you need it. For the chicken: Heat the olive oil in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and sear it on both sides until the skin is golden brown. Remove the chicken from the pot and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the grease. Add the onions and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Pour in the barbecue sauce and return the chicken to the pot. Cover and cook over medium-low heat until the chicken is falling off the bone, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside until cool enough to handle. When cool, use 2 forks to shred the meat from the bones, discarding the skin and bones. Skim off the excess fat from the top of the sauce and reserve. For the slaw: While the chicken is cooking, combine the shredded cabbage and sliced jalapeno in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the milk, mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, cayenne and salt. Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate. For the pizza: When you are ready to make the pizza, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Oil a baking sheet or pizza pan with olive oil. Grab one of the balls of pizza dough (the recipe makes 2 crusts, so you can refrigerate or freeze the other ball of dough for another recipe) and squeeze the dough toward the bottom to form a nice, tight, pulled ball. You can roll out the pizza with a rolling pin if you&#39;d like, but sometimes it&#39;s just as easy to throw it around and pull and stretch until it feels right. When the crust is nice and thin, lay it on the oiled baking sheet. Drizzle a little olive oil on the dough and spread it with your fingers. Very lightly sprinkle some salt on top. Spread the reserved barbecue sauce and onion mixture over the crust, then cover with the mozzarella slices followed by the shredded chicken.

Squeeze the juice of the lemon with the lemon half sitting upright. This will help prevent the seeds from falling into the bowl. The lemon juice will spill down over the sides of the lemon and the seeds will remain with the fruit. Squeeze the juice evenly over the salad. If the lemon is under-ripe, microwave it for 10 seconds before you cut into it. Next, sprinkle a tablespoon of vinegar over the salad -- just eyeball it. Drizzle the extra-virgin olive oil over the salad, add the salt, pepper and cumin. Toss again.

Prepare all vegetables and place in a large bowl. Cover generously with olive oil and Fennel Spice Rub. Cover and toss well to combine. Heat a very large ovenproof skillet over high heat. Add 1/4 cup of the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the carrots and cook for about 1 minute, then add the onions and cook, turning occasionally with tongs, until the vegetables are nicely browned, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat if needed to keep them from burning. Add the fennel bulb, zucchini, additional Fennel Spice Rub or crushed fennel seed, and salt, to taste. Toss well to distribute the seasonings. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and toss again. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the vegetables are deeply caramelized, 20 to 25 minutes, stirring them occasionally so they cook evenly. Serve immediately. Put the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a heavy pan over medium heat. Watch carefully, tossing frequently so the seeds toast evenly. When light brown and fragrant, pour the seeds onto a plate to cool. They must be cool before grinding, or they will gum up the blades. Pour the seeds into a blender and add the salt.

Meanwhile, whisk together the flour and salt in a large bowl to break up any lumps. When the yeast is ready, add the flour mixture and olive oil and mix, using dough hook, on the lowest speed until the dough looks shredded, about 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and continue to mix until the dough is smooth and very elastic, (you should be able to stretch it 2 to 3 inches without breaking), about 6 to 10 minutes. Turn the dough out of the mixer, form it into a ball, and put into a large, oiled mixing bowl. Turn to coat the dough in the oil then cover with a clean, damp dishtowel, and let rest in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 30 to 45 minutes. (Alternatively, refrigerate the dough and let rise 12 to 24 hours before using.) Punch the dough down and shape as desired. For the zucchini: Heat the grill to medium-high (about 375 degrees F) and rub the grate with a towel dipped in oil. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and the zucchini to a large bowl and toss to coat. Grill the zucchini, covered, turning rarely, until tender and charred, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the cooked zucchini to a bowl and add the red wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes. Season with the salt and pepper, to taste, and toss to coat. Set aside until ready to use. For the pizza: Heat the grill to medium-high (about 375 degrees F) and rub the grate with a towel dipped in oil. Oil your hands, put half of the dough (about 1 pound) on a piece of parchment paper, and press the dough into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Drizzle the dough with oil. Lay the dough, oiled side down, on the grill and remove the parchment paper. Grill the dough until golden brown, toasted, and grill marks form on the bottom, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the dough, brush with 1 tablespoon oil and top with half of the mozzarella. Cover with half of the zucchini and half of the goat cheese. Close the grill, checking and rotating as needed to avoid burning, until dough is lightly charred and cheese is melted, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board, top with half of the basil leaves, and half of the sun-dried tomatoes, and serve.

Neck skin should be intact with only a tiny hole made about 2 inches above the base of the neck. Remove cavity fat and discard. Rinse the duck and massage the entire body by rubbing the skin back and forth, loosening it from the meat. Make sure skin is not punctured. Insert a bicycle pump hose into the neck hole. Keep cavity closed as you pump air into the duck -- inflating it until the skin is taut, rubbing and rolling the skin as it is being inflated to distribute air evenly. Insert a meat hook through the neck bone and hang to dry, in a cool place, for 1 hour. In a wok combine the boiling water, honey, rice wine, white vinegar, and cornstarch slurry, and stir until lightly thickened. Hold the duck by the hook and dip it in and out of the boiling water, turning it from side to side, while ladling water over the skin. Do this until the skin is well coated, about 1 minute. Then hang duck up to dry for at least 12 hours or overnight in a draft near a window or other breezy place, spreading paper on floor to catch drippings. If no cool area is available, hang duck from back of a chair and blow a fan on it for several hours. (Alternatively, set duck, unwrapped, on a rack with a pan underneath to catch drippings. Refrigerate, turning occasionally.) If your oven is large and tall, remove all racks except the top one. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cover a large pan with aluminum foil to reflect heat and to catch drippings and place the pan in the bottom of the oven. Hook the duck vertically over the top rack in the center of the oven over the drip pan. Roast for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 and roast for 1 1/4 hours. (Alternatively, use a vertical roasting rack set in a roasting pan and roast as above. Or place the duck on a rack over the roasting pan in the middle of the oven and roast at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Turn breast side down and roast another 15 minutes. Turn again, reduce heat to 350 and roast for 3/4 hour. For the pancakes: Mix the flour with the boiling water until combined, and add 1 tablespoon cold water to mixture. Knead the dough for 4 minutes, or until soft and smooth. Let it rest for 30 minutes, covered with a bowl. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions and knead it until smooth. Roll one portion into a 16-inch log and divide it into 16 pieces. Repeat with the remaining dough. Take each piece and stand it upright on the heel of your hand, round off the dough and then flatten it with your other hand into a circle 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Paint surface of half of the pieces with pastry brush dipped in sesame oil; place remaining pieces on the oiled pieces, making 16 pairs. Using rolling pin roll the pairs into thin pancakes about 6 to 6 1/4 inches in diameter, rotating circles frequently to insure even thickness. Heat an unoiled frying pan until hot. Add 1 pair of cakes and fry 1 minute or until light brown spots appear underneath. Lift up the edges to check for spots. Turn them over and allow them to puff up, indicating they are done. Separate each pair into 2 pancakes. Repeat with remaining pancakes. Transfer the pancakes to a steamer and steam them for 5 to 10 minutes. To finish the duck: Put the duck in a wok with 4 to 6-inches of oil, heated to 375 degrees.. Ladle the oil over duck. Cook the duck in this fashion for 2 1/2 minutes per side to crisp the skin. Put the duck on a cutting board. Disjoint the wings and drumsticks and place them apart at either end of serving platter, outlining the form of a whole duck. With a razor sharp knife carve the skin on the duck with a very thin layer of meat, trying to make slices as large as possible. Transfer them to the platter. Remove all the meat from the carcass and cut it into strips about 1 * inches long. Arrange the meat strips in center of platter and then cut the strips of skin crosswise into comparable pieces. Lay these over meat. To eat: put a pancake on a plate, smear on some Hoisin sauce (with scallion brush if desired) and top with 1 or 2 pieces of skin, either on their own or with meat as well. Add a scallion brush and roll up the pancake.

I like to use a hot-air popper but you can pop it any way you like. To make the caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until light golden brown. We use a large pan so that there will be room to add the popcorn. Use a wooden spoon to stir the popcorn into the caramel until it is evenly coated. Pour the caramelized popcorn onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet and allow it to cool. When cool, use your hands to break up any clumps. Place the cool popcorn in a large bowl. Use a ladle to drizzle the chocolate over the popcorn, stirring with a wooden spoon as you go. Keep adding chocolate until the popcorn is evenly coated. Pour the chocolate-coated popcorn onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet and allow it to cool. When it is cool, place it in decorative bags to give as gifts. Tip: You can also use milk chocolate and/or white chocolate to coat the popcorn. The process is always the same. Be careful when you work with the caramel. It is very hot and can burn! As always, when working with caramel, have a bowl of ice-cold water next to you in case you get caramel on your hands. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 27562,&quot;Cream of Tomato Soup with Mint 5 tablespoons olive oil 1/3 cup chopped shallots 1 yellow onion, chopped 5 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup dry white wine 4 cups chicken stock 1 (35ounce) can plum tomatoes 3 sprigs fresh thyme 2 bay leaves 3 ripe medium tomatoes (red and yellow if available), seeded and chopped 2 teaspoons sugar Juice of 1 lime 2 cups heavy cream Coarse salt Freshly ground pepper to taste 1/2 bunch chopped fresh mint 3 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped Freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional) Instructions: Heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium high heat.

Set aside. Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat together the eggs and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners&#39; sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed. Once incorporated, increase the speed to medium and beat until slightly creamy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br> Reduce the speed to low again and slowly pour in the egg mixture; beat until combined. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, increasing the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning, and scraping down the sides of the bowl and the beaters themselves as needed. Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide into 3 even pieces (about 13 ounces each) and place the pieces into separate medium bowls. Add the red food coloring to one bowl and mix to combine. Add the white food coloring to another bowl and mix to combine. Add the blue food coloring to the third bowl and mix to combine. Cut each dough ball into 6 equal pieces.<br> Press one piece of red dough into the bottom of the prepared loaf pan. Press a white piece of dough on top of the red and then a blue piece of dough on top of the white, gently pressing each so that the dough conforms to the shape of the pan. Repeat this process and order until all of the dough is in the loaf pan. The dough will come about 2 inches above the top of the pan, and that is okay. (You want the loaf of dough to be about 5 inches tall.) Freeze the dough until hard, about 2 hours.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using the parchment overhang, remove the dough from the loaf pan. With a sharp knife, cut the dough crosswise into twenty 1/8-inch thick slices and arrange on a baking sheet. Freeze until hardened, about 15 minutes. Line 2 baking sheets with silicone liners. With a 3-inch star cookie cutter, cut a star shape out of each slice and arrange on the lined baking sheets. Cut another star shape out of the center of the big stars with a 1 1/2-inch star cookie cutter. Arrange the small stars on the lined baking sheets. Freeze until hardened, about 15 minutes.<br> Fill the center of the larger cookies with the crushed candies (don&#39;t worry about filling completely, since the candies will melt and naturally fill in the window). Bake the filled cookies and smaller star cookies until the candies have melted and the cookies are firm, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, divide the scraps in half and place each half between two pieces of parchment and reroll to 1/8-inch thick. Place them in the freezer until hardened, about 30 minutes. Cut out 10 stars using the large cookie cutter and arrange them on the lined baking sheets. Cut out smaller stars from the middles of the larger stars and arrange on the lined baking sheets. Freeze until hard, 15 minutes. Bake until the cookies are firm, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> For the royal icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 5 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water, if needed, about 2 minutes. Transfer the icing to a resealable plastic bag and seal. Cut a small piece out of one of the corners of the bag.<br> Flip the candy-filled cookies over and pipe the icing around the border. Top 10 of the cookies with one of the unfilled large star cookies. Place a pinch of star sprinkles in the center of the cookies. Press the remaining 10 candy-filled cookies on top, sandwiching the icing inside. Let the icing harden, about 10 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27566,&quot;Ten-Minute Chilaquiles 1 cup salsa (preferably medium hot) 2 cups tomato sauce 1/2 cup water 1 (4-ounce) can chopped green chiles, undrained 1 (14-ounce) can pinto or kidney beans, rinsed well in a strainer 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 (11-ounce) bag corn chips (about 8 cups) 1 cup sour cream 2 cups grated Monterey Jack 2 tablespoons minced cilantro, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine all the sauce ingredients in a large bowl. Pour half the sauce into a shallow 2 1/2-quart (12 by 7 by 2-inch) baking dish, and top with half the corn chips. You can crumble the chips slightly to make an even layer. Drop little spoonfuls of half the sour cream all over the chips, then sprinkle on half the cheese. Top with the remaining chips, sauce, sour cream, and cheese. Bake 35 minutes, or until hot and bubbly around the edges. Sprinkle the top of the casserole with the cilantro and serve. You can cut it into squares and serve using a spatula, or use a large spoon to scoop out the chilaquiles. Cook&#39;s Note: Some packaged corn chips are very salty. Look on the back of the bag for the sodium content and choose a brand that has no more than 110 milligrams of sodium per serving. These will be the most flavorful corn chips and won&#39;t be overly salty to eat or use in the casserole. For advance preparation: Make the sauce up to a few hours ahead and lay out all the other ingredients. Don&#39;t assemble chilaquiles, however, until the last minute so the corn chips retain a tiny bit of texture when baked. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 27567,&quot;Shrimp Siu Mai (Dumplings) 1 egg white 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon arrowroot 1/2 red bell pepper, cored, seeded and diced into 1/4-inch pieces 1 medium carrot, peeled and diced into 1/4-inch pieces 1/4 cup frozen petite peas, thawed 1/4 cup chopped chives 1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 pound large shrimp, peeled, deveined and cut into 1/4-inch pieces 4 egg roll wrappers Vegetable oil cooking spray 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons honey 3/4 teaspoon hot sauce (recommended: Sriracha) 1 garlic clove, minced Instructions: Dumplings: In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg white, sesame oil and arrowroot until frothy. Stir in the bell pepper, carrot, peas, chives, ginger, salt, and shrimp. Put 1/2 of the mixture in a food processor. Blend until the mixture forms a chunky paste. Return the paste to the bowl and combine it with the remaining vegetable mixture. Cut each egg roll wrapper into 4 equal-sized squares. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the mixture into the center of each piece of dough. Gather the sides of the egg roll wrapper around the filling leaving the top of the filling uncovered. If necessary, use a little water to help secure the wrapper in place. Spray the bottom of a bamboo or stainless steel steamer with vegetable oil cooking spray. Working in batches, stand the dumplings, uncovered filling side up, in the steamer and cover. Steam until the shrimp turn pink and are cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes. Dipping sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, honey, hot sauce and garlic. Arrange the dumplings on a platter and serve the dipping sauce alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27568,&quot;Oatmeal-Fennel Seed Cookies 1/2 cup golden raisins 4 ounces bourbon<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup old-fashioned oats<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground clove<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened<br> 3/4 cup light brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 cup sliced almonds<br> Honey, for drizzling<br> Flaky sea salt, for topping<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Transfer to a bowl. Heat a 6 to 7-inch skillet over moderately high heat until hot. Brush the skillet with about 1 teaspoon of the olive oil to coat well and heat the oil until hot. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the center of the skillet and lift and tilt the pan to coat the bottom with a thin layer. Cook until the batter is set and the underside is golden, about 1 minute more, and invert onto a plate. Make additional crepes with the remaining batter in the same manner. Crepes may be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Freeze for up to 1 month. Defrost in the refrigerator before using.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil a large shallow baking dish. To make the filling, in a bowl combine all of the ingredients, except for the sauce. To assemble, lay each crepe on a work surface, attractive side down, spoon 3 tablespoons of the filling down the center, and fold in the edges to enclose the filling. Fill the remaining crepes in the same manner. Spoon 1 to 1 1/2 cups of marinara sauce into the flameproof baking dish in an even layer. Arrange the crepes, seam side down, in the dish and spoon on enough of the remaining sauce to coat the crepes. (The dish may be assembled several hours or 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Allow longer baking time if refrigerated.) Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crepes are heated through and their edges are slightly crisp. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan to taste and put the crepes under the broiler, about 3 to 4 inches from the heat, for 2 minutes, or until the top is golden. In a deep skillet set over moderate heat, heat the olive oil until hot. Add the garlic and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until they&#39;re pale golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have reduced and separated from the oil, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the red pepper to taste, if desired and simmer for 2 minutes more.

Chimichurri Salad 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 3 ounces red wine vinegar 8 ounces olive oil Salt 1/2 pound white mushrooms, cleaned and quartered 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 2 bunches watercress, washed and stems trimmed 1 carrot, julienned 1 red bell pepper, julienned 1 small jicama, peeled and julienned 2 (8-ounce) beef tenderloin fillets 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 2 eggs 1 tablespoon butter Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, red chili flakes, parsley, red wine vinegar, salt and olive oil. In a small hot skillet, saute the mushrooms in olive oil. Add the chopped garlic and deglaze the pan with red wine vinegar. Remove from heat and cool. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix together the washed watercress, carrots, red bell peppers, jicama and the cooled mushrooms. To flatten the steaks, coat 4 (15 by 12-inch) sheets of plastic or parchment paper with 1/2 teaspoon each of the oil. Sandwich each tenderloin, with the grain running vertically, between 2 sheets (with the oiled side facing the meat). Flatten each piece with the flat side of a heavy cleaver or mallet, using steady, even sweeping strokes from the center out as you would roll pie dough, until the steak is a thin oval of about 14 by 10 inches. It should be thin like a blanket, hence the name sabana. (It takes about 5 minutes per steak.) Preheat a lightly oiled very large nonstick skillet or cast iron pan. Peel the paper off the steaks and brush both sides with Chimichurri Dressing. Sear, 1 at a time, in the hot pan, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Melt butter in a small hot skillet. Crack the eggs in the pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook eggs sunny side up. To serve, put a steak on a large serving plate. Toss salad to coat with the remaining Chimichurri dressing and place over the steak. Slide a fried egg on top of each and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 27583,&quot;Chipotle Shrimp with Avocado Cream 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined 1 red onion, chopped<br> 1 bunch cilantro, chopped 1 can chipotles in adobe sauce 2 tablespoons coconut oil<br> 1 tablespoon garlic powder Salt and pepper Salt and pepper<br> Honey<br> 3 avocados, diced<br> 3 limes, juiced 1/2 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon adobo powder 3 jalapenos, diced<br> Vegetable oil, for pan Instructions: In a bowl, combine the shrimp with half of the red onions, a handful of chopped cilantro, 2 teaspoons adobo sauce, and the coconut oil, garlic powder, some salt and pepper, and a drizzle of honey.

Add the cognac, onions and thyme and cook until the onions are soft and caramelized. Add the stock and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes total. Remove the thyme sprigs and set the mixture aside. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Using a whisk, whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour does not have a raw flavor, about 2 minutes. The mixture will bubble a bit; do not let it brown. Whisk in the milk, making sure the mixture is smooth and there are no lumps. Continue to cook and stir as the sauce thickens. Whisk in 8 ounces of the cheese until melted and bring the mixture to a boil. Add salt and white pepper to taste, lower the heat and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the heat and set aside. (To cool this sauce for later use, cover it with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming on the top of the sauce.) Pile up the remaining 12 ounces grated cheese on some wax paper and mold the cheese back together with your hands. Roll the cheese out as if you were rolling dough. With a 4-inch ring, cut out 6 rounds. Set aside. Using the same ring, mold out 6 burgers with the ground beef, each around 3/4 inch high. Heat a grill pan over high heat. Lightly brush the pan with olive oil. Brush both sides of the burgers with olive oil. Sprinkle on a generous amount of salt and some brown sugar. Cook the burgers on the grill pan for 5 to 6 minutes on the first side.

Using a wooden spoon and stirring in one direction, stir in the whole wheat flour about a cup at a time; then stir 100 times or until the mixture look smooth and silky. This is the sponge and it needs to rest, covered with plastic wrap, for at least 30 minutes, although it is best if it can rest for as long as 8 hours in a cool place, a rest that will give fuller flavor. Sprinkle the slat over the sponge and then stir in the olive oil, mixing well, again stirring in the same direction. Add the flour about a cup at a time, mixing until the dough is too stiff to stir with a spoon. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it mixing until it is smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. The dough will be moderately firm and have a slight sheen. Clean the mixing bowl, dry it, and coat it lightly with oil. Transfer the dough to the bowl, turn the dough around to oil its surface, and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours, or until it doubles in bulk. Turn the dough onto the work surface. Divide it in half and keep one half under plastic or cloth while you work with the other. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces and, with lightly floured cupped hands, form the pieces into tight balls; keep the balls under plastic as you work on the other. On a well-floured surface, flatten the balls of dough with you fingertips and then, using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a circle 8 to 9 inches in diameter and less than 1/4-inch thick. Cover but do stack the rolled out breads. Preheat the griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and lightly oil the griddle. Bake 1 rolled-out circle at a time on the griddle, putting the pita top side down on the griddle and cooking for 15 to 20 seconds before turning the bread over gently. Cook for another minute or until big bubbles appear. Turn the bread again and cook until it balloons fully. Pressing a towel on those areas where bubbles have formed will push air into the flat areas. The breads should bake for no more than 3 minutes. Oil the griddle after every 4 to 5 breads. Pita is best the day it is made, but it can be wrapped airtight and frozen for 1 month &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 27629,&quot;Grilled Baby Octopus 22 ounces baby octopus Salt and pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano<br> Pinch red pepper flakes<br> 8 cloves garlic, sliced thin<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley<br> 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar<br> Baby greens, for plating Instructions: Boil octopus in salted water until cooked through (check inside with a paring knife), 15 to 20 minutes.

Set aside. For the cake batter: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F; line a cupcake pan with 12 paper liners. Sift together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt in a large bowl and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer or using a hand mixer, mix the granulated sugar and vegan butter together on medium-low speed until fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes; scrape down the bowl. Slowly mix in the soy milk, applesauce and vanilla, scraping down the bowl a couple of times to make sure everything is fully mixed. Slowly add the flour mixture and mix to combine. Fold in the vinegar and garlic paste by hand, being sure not to over-mix. Divide the batter among the liners and sprinkle some white chocolate chips on top. Bake until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely before frosting. For the honey black garlic brittle: Add the granulated sugar and corn syrup to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for 2 minutes; the mixture should be amber or honey-colored. (Or heat until it reaches 300 degrees F on a candy thermometer.) Add the vegan butter and garlic paste and microwave for another minute and a half. Add the baking soda and vanilla and whisk together. Immediately pour the mixture onto a nonstick pan (or a pan lined with aluminum foil). Freeze for 10 to 15 minutes. For the cardamom frosting: Using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, blend the vegan shortening and butter until fully incorporated and mixed well, scraping down the bowl a few times, about 5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups of the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 tablespoon of the soy milk and the cardamom and mix for 2 more minutes. Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar and 1 tablespoon soy milk, and whip for another minute. If the mixture is too thick, add a splash more of soy milk. If too thin, add 1/4 cup more sugar. To assemble, pipe some cardamom frosting on each cupcake. Place a shard of the garlic brittle through each fondant heart and place on the cupcakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 27634,&quot;Florida Grouper with Cucumber Slaw and Key Lime Butter Sauce Cucumber Slaw: 1 cup julienned cucumber 1/2 cup julienned red bell pepper 1/2 cup julienned carrot<br> 2 tablespoons rice vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons freshly-squeezed lime juice<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 tablespoon soy sauce<br> 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil Key Lime Butter Sauce: 6 ounces white wine 2 shallots, minced<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 4 cups heavy cream<br> Zest and juice of 2 Key limes 4 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 1/2 cup water<br> 2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cubed<br> For the Grouper: Four 7-ounce fresh skinless grouper filets 2 ounces blended oil (half olive oil, half vegetable oil)<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the slaw: Toss together the cucumber, bell pepper, carrot, rice vinegar, lime juice, cilantro, sugar, soy sauce and sesame oil. Refrigerate until ready to serve. For the key lime butter sauce: Bring the wine, shallots and bay leaves to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat.

Mix together, then drizzle some olive oil on top and garnish with a sprig of dill. For the collards: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and have a bowl of ice water ready. Boil the collard leaves until bright green and pliable, about 1 1/3 minutes. Transfer to the ice water to cool. Gently squeeze the leaves dry. Lay out the leaves one at a time on a paper towel to blot, and use a sharp knife to cut out the thick center stems, cutting about three-quarters of the way to the top and making sure to leave 2 to 3 inches uncut at the top. Set the trimmed leaves aside. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add the rice, raisins and allspice and cook, stirring, until the rice is well coated, about 1 minute. Add 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and remove from the heat. Stir in the dill, parsley, mint and lemon zest. Lay out one collard leaf with the intact end pointing towards you and the trimmed stem end pointing away. Spoon 2 level tablespoons of the rice filling in the center of the side facing you. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll the leaf up tightly away from you like a burrito, starting from the bottom and finishing seam-side down. Repeat with the remaining leaves and rice filling. (Some of the larger leaves may need to be trimmed slightly if they appear too bulky when rolled up.) Add a splash of the remaining 3 tablespoons oil to a medium saucepan. Arrange the collard rolls in a single layer on the bottom of the pan. Top with enough water to just cover the rolls, then drizzle in the remaining olive oil and the lemon juice. Cover the rolls directly with a round of parchment paper. Bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a low simmer and cook, covered with a lid, for 1 hour. Remove the rolls from the liquid, drain on a paper towel-lined plate and let cool to room temperature. Serve with lemon wedges and the lemon yogurt sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 27636,&quot;Red Yam Flan 1 recipe caramel sauce 1 large yam or sweet potato (about 18 ounces) or 1 cup canned pureed yams or sweet potatoes Vegetable oil 3/4 cup packed brown sugar 1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 1/2 teaspoon allspice 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 2 cups half-and-half 2 cups Homemade Condensed Milk 6 large eggs 6 large egg yolks 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 tablespoons dark rum Instructions: Prepare the caramel and coat a 9-inch round cake pan, reserving the extra caramel sauce in the refrigerator as directed above. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Rub the yam with vegetable oil, place on a baking tray and bake 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a knife easily pierces the potato at its thickest part. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then peel and mash with a fork (the mashed potato should measure about 1 cup). Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees. Prepare the caramel and coat a 9-inch round cake pan, reserving the extra sauce in the refrigerator as directed. In a large bowl combine all remaining ingredients. Mix thoroughly. Pass through a strainer, pressing with a spatula, into the caramel coated cake pan. Place the cake in a water bath. Bake for about 1 hour and 10 minutes or until the center just feels firm when pressed. Set aside to cool in the water bath. Remove from the water bath, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours, or overnight. To serve cut in wedges and top with cold caramel sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 27637,&quot;Pumpkin Roulade with Ginger Buttercream 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 yeaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup canned pumpkin (not pie filling) 1/4 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, plus extra for dusting 12 ounces Italian mascarpone cheese 1 1/4 cups sifted confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1/4 cup minced dried crystallized ginger (not in syrup) Pinch kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 13 by 18 by 1-inch sheet pan. Line the pan with parchment paper and grease and flour the paper. In a small bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt and stir to combine. Place the eggs and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed for 3 minutes, until light yellow and thickened. With the mixer on low, add the pumpkin, then slowly add the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Finish mixing the batter by hand with a rubber spatula. Pour into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake the cake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the top springs back when gently touched. While the cake is baking, lay out a clean, thin cotton dish towel on a flat surface and sift the entire 1/4 cup of confectioners&#39; sugar evenly over it. (This will prevent the cake from sticking to the towel.) As soon as you remove the cake from the oven, loosen it around the edges and invert it squarely onto the prepared towel. Peel away the parchment paper. With a light touch, roll the warm cake and the towel together (don&#39;t press!) starting at the short end of the cake. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack. Meanwhile, make the filling. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the mascarpone, confectioners&#39; sugar, and cream together for about a minute, until light and fluffy. Stir in the crystallized ginger, and salt. To assemble, carefully unroll the cake onto a board with the towel underneath. Spread the cake evenly with the filling. Reroll the cake in a spiral using the towel as a guide. Remove the towel and trim the ends to make a neat edge. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve sliced. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 27638,&quot;Lobster with Mixed Vegetables, Honey Coriander Sauce, and Basil Olive Oil Sauce 1 gallon seafood stock 4 carrots, peeled and cubed 2 onions, peeled and cubed 4 celery stalks, cubed Salt and pepper Four 1 1/4-pound live lobsters 4 cups water 1/2 pound carrots, peeled and sliced 1 fennel bulb, sliced 1/4 pound radish, sliced 1/4 pound baby onions 1 pint cherry tomatoes 1 bunch asparagus 1/4 pound lima beans 1/4 pound green beans 1/2 pound zucchini, sliced 1/4 fresh peas 1/2 pound chanterelle mushrooms, sliced 16 ounces olive oil 1 pound fresh basil 1/2 pound pignoli nuts Salt and pepper 16 ounces olive oil 1 pound coriander seeds 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon tomato paste 2 tablespoons ketchup 1 tablespoon honey 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup lemon juice Instructions: To make the lobster: In a large stockpot, combine the stock, carrots, onions, and celery. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Add the lobsters and cook until bright orange or red, about 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the lobsters from the pot and set aside. Discard the stock liquid. To make the vegetable mixture: In a large skillet, combine the water and the vegetables that take the longest to cook, the carrots, fennel, radish, onions. Cook for 3 minutes. Add the remaining vegetables and cook the mixture until all of the vegetables are still bright in color, but are fork tender. Drain the liquid and set the vegetables aside. To make the basil sauce, simply combine the olive oil, basil, and pignoli nuts into a blender. Once the mixture is well combined, season with salt and pepper. Place the sauce in a squirt bottle and set aside. To prepare the coriander sauce, combine the olive oil and the coriander seeds in a small pot. Over medium heat, bring the oil to 150 degrees F. Remove the mixture from the heat, and set aside so the coriander seeds can infuse into the oil. Once the oil is cooled, use a strainer and remove the seeds from the oil. In a separate bowl, combine the vinegar, salt, and pepper, and mix until salt is dissolved. Add the tomato paste and stir until combined. Once the tomato paste is combined, add the ketchup, honey, orange juice, lemon juice, and mix well until all ingredients are incorporated. Using a hand-held blender, slowly add the infused oil to the mixture. The mixture should start to emulsify and become thick. Once all of the oil has been added, continue to blend until well combined. Place sauce in a squeeze bottle and set aside. To plate the lobsters, crack the lobster shells and remove the meat from the tails and claws. In a separate skillet, heat the vegetables slightly and place in the center of the plate. Add the lobster tail and claws on top of the vegetables and drizzle some of the basil and coriander sauce around the plate. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 27639,&quot;Chocolate Covered Turtles 4 tablespoons butter, cut up, plus more for pans 3/4 pound pecan halves (about 3 1/2 cups), toasted 1 cup evaporated milk 1 cup light corn syrup 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/2 pound semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening (recommended: Crisco) Instructions: Generously butter 2 baking sheets. On the baking sheets, arrange the pecan halves in snowflake-shaped clusters of 5 pecans each, overlapping the nuts in the center, leaving 2 inches of space between each. In a medium saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of the evaporated milk, the corn syrup, and sugar and bring to a boil. Add the remaining 1/2 cup evaporated milk and the 4 tablespoons butter, and cook, stirring constantly, until it reaches the soft ball stage, 240 degrees F. Stir in the vanilla and remove from the heat. Let cool to 200 degrees F. Using a tablespoon, spoon caramel on top of each nut cluster and let harden. (If the caramel becomes too stiff to pour, return to low heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until it returns to the proper consistency.) To make the chocolate coating, in the top of a double boiler or in a metal bowl set over barely simmering water, combine 6 ounces of the chocolate and the shortening. Melt over low heat, stirring, until it reaches 116 to 118 degrees F, or feels fairly warm but not hot to the touch. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 2 ounces of chocolate. Continue stirring until the chocolate reaches 80 degrees F or feels cool to the touch. Return to low heat and cook, stirring, until the temperature rises to 85 to 87 degrees F, or feels barely cool. Remove from the heat. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of tempered chocolate over each cluster. Set aside in a cool place to harden. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks, with waxed paper separating the layers to prevent sticking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 27640,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Easy Grilled Cauliflower in Pop Pop Sauce Olive oil, for brushing 2 whole heads cauliflower, greens and stems trimmed<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Hot Hungarian paprika, for dusting (optional)<br> 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup Thai cl sauce<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> 1 tablespoon sriracha<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 scallions, chopped<br> Lemon wedges, for spritzing<br> Instructions: For the cauliflower: Preheat the oven or a grill for cooking over indirect heat to 400 degrees F. Lightly brush the oil on the cauliflower. (If roasting, cut into florets and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.) Sprinkle with salt, a few grinds of pepper and paprika, if using. Place the cauliflower stem-side down over the indirect heat and grill until golden and tender when pierced with a fork or the tip of a knife, about 40 minutes. (If roasting, roast until the cauliflower is golden in parts, 20 to 25 minutes.) Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a medium bowl, add the mayonnaise, cl sauce, honey and sriracha and whisk until smooth. Taste and season with salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cut the cauliflower unto large florets and add to a large bowl. Drizzle the sauce over the cauliflower and toss to coat evenly. Transfer to a platter. Sprinkle with the scallions, spritz with lemon wedges, and serve hot, warm or chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 27641,&quot;Black Sticky Gingerbread 1 cup unsalted butter 1/2 cup water 3/4 cup unsulphured dark molasses 3/4 cup flavorful honey, such as a dark wildflower, berry or chestnut 1 cup tightly packed brown sugar 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons ground ginger 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon allspice 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves 3 large eggs, at room temperature 1/2 cup partly skimmed milk (2 percent) 1 packed tablespoon grated fresh ginger root Lightly sweetened whipped cream, to serve Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325. Lightly grease a 9 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan and line the bottom with a piece of parchment paper that has been cut to hang over two opposite edges by a couple of inches. This overhang will make removing the cake from the pan clean and simple. Combine the butter, water, molasses, honey and brown sugar in a medium non-reactive saucepan and place over low heat. Stir the mixture frequently until the butter is melted, and all of the ingredients are well blended. Remove from the heat, pour into a large bowl and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice and cloves, and set aside. When the molasses mixture feels just warm to the touch, add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the milk and stir to combine. Fold the dry ingredients into the batter in four additions, using big, long strokes. Don&#39;t be concerned if you can&#39;t get all the lumps out--settle for most of them! Stir in the grated ginger. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in the center of the oven for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the top of the cake springs back when touched and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow to cool for 15 minutes, then, using the overhang of parchment, lift the cake out of the pan and cool completely on a wire rack before cutting. Well-wrapped in plastic, this gingerbread actually improves with age. If stored at room temperature, it will have a sponge-cakey texture and will keep for about 4 days. Refrigerated, it becomes stickier, denser, and wonderfully chewy and will last at least a week. Allow the cake to return to room temperature before serving. This cake is fabulous warm, and the only adornment it needs is mounds of softly whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 27642,&quot;Lemon-Lime Tuna Fish on Wheat 2 slices thick-cut wheat bread 1 can albacore tuna (w/o oil) 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup sour cream 1 lemon 1 lime scallions, chopped 2 hard-boiled eggs (yolks removed), chopped lettuce leaves Instructions: Mix all ingredients into a small bowl, quarter a lemon and a lime and squeeze juice into mixture.

Line a baking sheet with foil. Put the tomatoes, onion, serrano cl and garlic cloves on the prepared baking sheet. Broil until the vegetables begin to blacken on one side, about 4 minutes. Flip the vegetables and cook until blackened on the second side, about 4 minutes more. (You may need to remove the serrano and tomatoes before the onion is finished.) Set aside to cool. Turn off the broiler and heat the oven to 400 degrees F. While the vegetables are cooling, put the bacon in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the bacon slowly, turning occasionally, until rendered and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate. Leave the bacon fat in the pan. Roughly chop the cooled tomatoes, onion and cl. Peel the garlic cloves and put all the roasted vegetables into a blender with 1 tablespoon kosher salt and 1 cup water. Blend until smooth. Meanwhile, peel the sweet potatoes and cut into 1-inch pieces. Place in a medium microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons water. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and microwave until just tender, about 10 minutes. Carefully remove the plastic and drain remaining liquid from the bowl. Heat the pan containing the bacon fat over medium heat. Add the peppers and the white and light-green scallions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the paprika, chili powder and oregano over the vegetables and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the cooked sweet potatoes and cover with the blended sauce.

Make a well in the flour. Add the cold water and make a paste using your fingertips, make a paste. Add the melted butter and work into the paste until a rough dough has been created; form it into a square block. With a sharp knife, cut an X on the top and about half way through the block, this help to cut the gluten strands so that they can relax more quickly. Cover the dough with plastic film and refrigerate. When the detrempe has rested at least 30 minutes, take the butter (beurrage) out of refrigerator. Plate it between 2 sheets of plastic film and beat it to flatten with a rolling pin. The butter should become pliable without any lumps to it, but should still be very cool. Form it into a square block. Take out detrempe, which should be the same consistency of beurrage. Roll the detrempe slightly to make a square, large enough so that it will able to enclose the butter. From this point on, be sure to use sufficient flour when rolling and turning the dough; it must not stick to work surface. Place the butter over the detrempe, so that it looks like a diamond inside a square. Fold the edges of the dough over the butter to enclose it and pinch it lightly to seal. Press the dough with a rolling pin 4 to 5 times along its length until it gets to approximately 9 inches. Then, using flour to dust the work surface, roll it to 22 inches long Brush off any excess flour and fold the dough into third. Repeat step 6. The dough now has 2 turns, wrap it with plastic film and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Take it out, do another 2 turns, mark the dough to 4 turns, wrap it and refrigerate for another 20 minutes. Take the dough and make the last 2 turns, refrigerate to rest before use, or freeze it for future use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27679,&quot;Carnitas with Pineapple and Pickled Jalapenos 1/3 cup fresh lime juice 1/3 cup red wine vinegar 1/3 cup sugar 1 tablespoon kosher salt 3 jalapenos, seeded and cut into rings 1 (3-pound) boneless pork shoulder (butt), trimmed of excess fat Juice of 4 limes 1 cup orange juice 4 garlic cloves, smashed 3 tablespoons chili powder 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon kosher salt 16 (6-inch) corn tortillas, warmed 2 cups 1/2-inch diced fresh pineapple Fresh cilantro sprigs, for serving Shredded red cabbage, for serving Cotija cheese, for serving Lime wedges, for serving Kosher salt Guacamole, for serving, optional Pico de gallo, for serving, optional Instructions: For the pickled jalapenos: In a small saucepan, combine the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, salt, and jalapenos.

Carefully lay the paneer into the pan and cook until golden brown on one side, 1 or 2 minutes (don&#39;t be too hasty to flip it though). If it doesn&#39;t release from the pan easily, then wait another 30 seconds because it hasn&#39;t browned enough. When the paneer is browned on both sides, remove it to a plate. Add the shallot and garlic; saute until the shallots are soft. Add the dates, chicken stock, cinnamon stick and red pepper flakes. Stir together, and then return the paneer to the pan. Make sure the liquid is at a gentle simmer. Cover and cook about 5 minutes. Check for seasoning. Depending on the chicken stock you used, you may or may not need to add salt and pepper. Remove the paneer to a plate and pour the sauce over top. Sprinkle with lemon zest, lemon juice, parsley and almonds. Serve immediately with a big chunk of naan or bread! Line a large colander with a large double layer of cheesecloth, and set it in your sink. In a large wide pot, bring the milk to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid burning the bottom (a nonstick pot works really well for this purpose). This will take a little while so be patient! Add the lemon juice and turn the heat down to low. Stirring gently, you should almost immediately see the curds (white milk solids) and whey (the greenish liquid) separate. Don&#39;t fret, this is perfect! Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour the contents into the cheesecloth-lined colander. Gently rinse with cool water to get rid of the lemon flavor. At this point, you could squeeze out some of the liquid, and serve with some honey and some nuts, almost like a fresh ricotta! Grab the ends of the cheesecloth and twist the ball of cheese to squeeze out the excess whey. Tie the cheesecloth to your kitchen faucet and allow the cheese to drain for about 5 minutes. Twisting the ball to compact the cheese into a block, place it on a plate with the twisted part of the cheesecloth on the side (this will ensure your block of cheese is nice and smooth!) and set another plate on top. Weigh the second plate down with cans of beans or a heavy pot. Move to the refrigerator and let it sit about 20 minutes.

Grease and flour a 9-by-9-inch baking pan. Begin by pouring 1/3 cup evaporated milk into a bowl with the cake mix. Add the melted butter and the chopped pecans. Mix the ingredients together; it&#39;ll be pretty thick! Divide the dough in half down the middle. Press half of it into the bottom of the prepared pan to make the first brownie layer. Bake until slightly set, 8 to 10 minutes. Then remove from the oven and set aside. While the brownie layer is baking, in a double boiler (or glass bowl set over a bowl of simmering water) combine the caramels and the remaining 1/2 cup evaporated milk. Stir occasionally until the caramels are totally melted and the mixture is smooth. Pour the caramel mixture over the first baked layer, spreading so it&#39;s evenly distributed. Sprinkle the chocolate chips all over the top. Next, on a clean surface or a sheet of waxed paper, press the remaining dough into a square shape slightly smaller than the baking pan. Carefully set it on top of the chocolate chips. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and let the brownies cool to room temperature. Cover the pan and refrigerate the brownies for several hours to allow them to set. When you&#39;re ready to serve them (or give them to someone you love!) sprinkle generously with the powdered sugar and cut them into large rectangles before removing from the pan. These are absolutely killer, my friends. Make them for someone you really, really love... or someone you want to love you back. It&#39;ll work.

In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) of the butter. Add the onions and celery. Season with salt and pepper. Cook the vegetables, over medium heat, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the contents to a bowl. Set aside. Arrange the bread slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast until light brown. Alternatively, brown them in a toaster. While the bread is still hot, lightly butter both sides of each piece. Cut into 1-inch squares and transfer them to a large bowl. Toss with salt, pepper, the thyme, sage and rosemary. Mix to blend. Set aside. Heat a tablespoon of the butter and, in a small skillet, quickly saute the heart and gizzard pieces, 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and add it to the bowl of celery and onions. Stir to blend. Heat a large skillet, add another tablespoon of the butter and saute the pepperoni pieces over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel. Combine the celery and onion mixture, the cooked breakfast sausage, the mozzarella and the pepperoni in the bowl containing the toasted bread. Mix to blend and add the cup of chicken stock to moisten all of the ingredients. Place the turkey on a flat surface, season with salt and pepper on the inside and out, and stuff the cavity with the stuffing. Truss turkey or, alternatively, tie the legs closed with a strong piece of kitchen twine to assure the stuffing doesn&#39;t fall out as the turkey roasts. Wrap any remaining stuffing in tinfoil and keep the tinfoil fairly flat, like a large envelope. Transfer the turkey to a roasting pan, fitted with a roasting rack if desired, and soak the cheesecloth in the butter. Brush any remaining butter on top of the bird and cover the breasts with the cheesecloth to prevent the top skin from burning before the turkey is cooked. Lower the oven to 350 degrees F and place the roasting pan in the center of the oven. Cook the turkey for about 12 minutes per pound. After about 2 hours cooking, remove the roasting pan and place the tinfoil package containing the stuffing in the bottom of the pan. Remove the cheesecloth from the top of the breasts and return the turkey to the oven. Place the neck and the chicken stock for the gravy in a pot and simmer gently on top of the stove as the turkey finishes cooking. The stock should reduce by about half. Season with salt and pepper, if desired. How do you know when it&#39;s done? The temperature of the thigh meat (where the meat is thickest and takes the longest time to cook) should register 165 degrees F when tested with an instant-read thermometer. When done, remove the bird from the oven, transfer it to a flat surface (or serving platter) and allow it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes before removing the stuffing and carving the meat. Make the gravy: Unless the bottom of the roasting pan is burned, you can make delicious gravy. Place the roasting pan over the burners on the stove, add the mustard and Marsala to the pan and warm it over low heat. Scrape the bottom to get the drippings and tasty bits off the bottom of the pan as the Marsala reduces. Strain the neck out from the stock and pour about 1/2 cup into a small bowl. Whisk the flour into the bowl, taking care there are no lumps. Reduce the Marsala until there is almost no liquid. Add the remaining chicken stock and the flour mixture to the roasting pan. Whisk to blend. Taste for seasoning. Reduce until the mixture thickens. Transfer to a gravy boat! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 27761,&quot;Sugared Fruit Egg whites* or Just Whites Sugar crystals (from baking supply shops)<br> Assorted small fruit Instructions: Place egg whites in shallow bowl.

Bring the water to a boil, shift the lid so that it covers the pan tightly, turn down the heat to very low, and cook for 20 minutes until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Never stir the rice during this time. Don&#39;t even uncover the pot to peek. Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes before serving. Your rice will be proper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27767,&quot;Chocolate Souffle with Espresso Creme Anglaise 2 tablespoons unsalted butter for greasing 1/4 cup sugar, plus more for dusting 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 6 large eggs, separated 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 2 tablespoons hazelnut flavored liqueur (recommended: Frangelico) Pinch salt 1 recipe Espresso Creme Anglaise, recipe follows Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting 1 cup heavy cream 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 4 large egg yolks 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup brewed espresso coffee 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and remove the top oven rack. Prepare 6 (8-ounce) coffee cups or ramekins with straight sides (or a 2-quart souffle dish) by greasing with butter and coating with granulated sugar, pour out any excess. The butter and sugar will keep the souffles from sticking to the sides, which will allow them to rise evenly. The sugar will also give the souffle a crunchy crust, which is a great contrast to the soft interior. To make the pastry cream base for the souffle: Combine the milk and vanilla bean and seeds in a heavy large pot and place over medium-low heat. Bring the mixture to a brief simmer, until bubbles form around the edge of the pot; do not boil. Remove from heat and discard the vanilla bean. The vanilla bean can be rinsed and dried and kept for another use. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, flour, and 1/4 cup of sugar until slightly thickened and lemon-colored. Temper the yolks by gradually whisking in about half of the hot milk mixture (do not add too quickly or the eggs will cook.) Return the pastry cream back to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it is nice and thick, enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 to 10 minutes. Slowly melt the chocolate with the Frangelico in a double boiler over hot water or in a microwave set on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through the heating time to smooth it out. Stir the melted chocolate mixture into the pastry cream; cool to room temperature. In a separate clean bowl, beat the egg whites and salt just until they hold soft peaks. Using a rubber spatula, fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the chocolate pastry cream to lighten it, then gently fold in the rest. Spoon the batter into the prepared coffee cups, 2/3 of the way full, and shake them gently to smooth out the top. Place the coffee cups on a cookie sheet and bake on the middle rack for about 20 minutes. The souffle is done when it has puffed over the rim, the outside is golden and the center is still a bit loose and creamy; take care not to over bake. To serve, have each guest crack open the top of the souffle with a spoon and pour in the Espresso Crme Anglaise. Dust the top with confectioners&#39; sugar. Pour the heavy cream and vanilla bean and seeds into a saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Bring the mixture to a brief simmer, until bubbles form around the edge of the pot; do not boil. Remove from heat. Discard the vanilla bean. The vanilla bean can be rinsed and dried and kept for another use. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, coffee, and espresso powder, until well blended. Temper the yolks by gradually whisking in the hot cream mixture (do not add too quickly or the eggs will cook.) Return the custard back to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately with Chocolate Souffle. (If not serving immediately, press plastic wrap on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 27768,&quot;Cranberry Pie 3 1/2 cups cranberries, chopped 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 1/2 tablespoon flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons water 3 tablespoons melted butter or margarine 1 (9-inch) pie crust and 1 crust for top Orange sherbet Instructions: Mix all ingredients, then add to pie crust.

Line 1 rimmed sheet pan with heavy foil and another with parchment paper. Place a baking rack over the foil-lined sheet pan and arrange the bacon slices across the rack next to each other, but not overlapping. Bake until crispy, 15 to 18 minutes. When cool enough to handle, finely chop and set aside. Reduce the oven temp to 350 degrees F. In a small saucepan over moderate heat, melt 3 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons brown sugar, about 1 minute. Add the pecans and combine until the pecans are coated. Pour out onto another unlined sheet pan and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool. Place the remaining 2 cups brown sugar into a 3-quart heavy saucepan, being careful to not get sugar on the sides of the pan. Add the cream, the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and salt and cook over very low heat (do not let simmer), stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until the sugar is dissolved, 10 to 15 minutes. Wash down any sugar crystals on the side of the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Clamp on a candy thermometer to the saucepan and boil the syrup over moderately-high heat until it registers 236 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat, leaving the thermometer in place, and let cool until the syrup registers 220 degrees F, 1 to 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, stir in the bacon and pecans. Working quickly, drop 1 tablespoon of pralines onto the prepared parchment-lined sheet pan. If the mixture starts to harden, place back on the stove over moderately-low heat and let it melt.

Stir in the canola oil and boiling water. Use your hands to work the dough into a smooth ball. It should be fairly firm. If it isn&#39;t, stir in some additional flour. Turn the dough onto a flat surface and flatten it with the palm of your hand until about 1-inch thick. Wrap in plastic wrap and allow it to rest in the fridge while you make the dressing and heat the oil. For the vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, red wine vinegar, ginger and garlic. Taste for seasoning. To roll the dough: Lightly flour a flat surface and divide the dough into four parts. Use a rolling pin to roll out the first piece. When about 1/4-inch thick, sprinkle with scallions and fold the dough in half so the scallions are hidden inside. Roll thin again and cut into rounds using a glass (or round cookie cutter) about 2 inches in diameter. Transfer the rounds to a baking sheet fitted with parchment paper. To cook and serve: In a large saute pan, heat 1/4-inch canola oil. Prepare a baking sheet fitted with a kitchen towel to drain the pancakes as they cook. When the oil smokes ever so slightly, use a pair of tongs or spoon to lower a few of the rounds into the oil. Fry for a minute on one side and then another on the second side. Use a slotted spoon or metal spatula to remove the pancakes and drain them on the kitchen towel. Sprinkle with remaining scallions and serve with the dressing on the side for dipping. Alternatively, drizzle the dressing over the pancakes.

Work the butter into the flour with a knife, pastry cutter, or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle the ice water onto the crumbly dough and, with your hands, push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together. Transfer to a work surface. Cut the dough in half, place half on top of the other, and press down. Repeat the cutting and pressing steps three or four times until all of the water is incorporated into the dough and it clings together. On a floured surface, gently flatten the ball of dough with a rolling pin. Starting from the center, roll the dough into a circle about an inch larger than the diameter of the pie pan. Lift the dough into the pan. Fold the edges under and crimp with your fingers or a fork. To make in a food processor, cut the butter into 1inch pieces and place them in the bowl of the food processor. Add the flour, salt, and sugar. Process until all of the ingredients are incorporated. With the processor on, add the water a tablespoon at a time until the dough begins to clump but is still crumbly. Continue to drizzle a little water and pulse the food processor, stopping to test the dough with your fingertips to see if it is moist enough to hold together. When you can gather the dough into a ball, remove it from the processor, place it on a lightly floured surface, and roll out and fit into the pan as above. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 27778,&quot;Cherry Clafoutis Nonstick cooking spray 1/2 cup pancake mix 1/2 cup sugar 1 1/2 cups buttermilk 3 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 eggs 1 (12-ounce) package frozen pitted cherries, thawed and drained, juices reserved 1 cup French vanilla ice cream Confectioners&#39; sugar, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the cream cheese, lemon zest and nutmeg in a bowl. Spread over the dough. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons each granulated sugar and sliced almonds, then the blueberries, pressing lightly. Cut into 16 small squares and make 4 stacks of 4 squares each. Place each stack on its side in a buttered 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Gently separate the dough layers so the dough fills the pan. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon each granulated sugar and sliced almonds. Cover the loaf loosely with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the dough rises by half its size, 1 to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350. Bake the loaf until it&#39;s browned and cooked through, 40 to 45 minutes (tent with foil if it&#39;s browning too quickly). Let cool 15 minutes in the pan, then loosen the edges with a knife. Remove to a plate and let cool 30 minutes. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27784,&quot;Warm Lentil Salad with Roasted Beets and Goat Cheese Roasted Beets, recipe follows 1 medium Spanish onion, peeled and quartered 1 carrot, quartered 1 stalk celery, quartered 1 fresh or dried bay leaf 4 sprigs fresh thyme 4 cups chicken stock 1 1/4 cups dried French green lentils Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 pound slab bacon, diced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 small carrot, peeled and finely diced 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar 4 cups frisee or mixed greens Sherry Vinaigrette, recipe follows 4 slices goat cheese French bread, for serving 3 medium beets (red or gold), scrubbed, leaves trimmed Olive oil 1/4 cup sherry vinegar 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup olive oil Instructions: Begin by roasting the beets.

Place corn meal in a bowl and pour boiling water over. Stir to mix well. Let sit for fifteen minutes. Mix in one-half cup of all purpose flour. Turn this mixture out onto a bread board spread with 1/4 cup of flour. Knead for 2 to 3 minutes, incorporating the 1/4 cup of flour into the dough (and if necessary, use a little more). The dough will be soft but not at all strong. Return the dough to the bowl and cover. Let rest for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into eight pieces. Between well-floured palms, make flat round patties out of each of the eight and set aside. Heat your griddle over medium high heat, making sure that it is hot before you cook the first tortilla. On a well-floured surface (as the dough is quite sticky), carefully roll out a tortilla until it is approximately 7 to 8 inches in diameter. (We find it easiest to first pat out the dough with our fingers or between our palms, and then to roll out the tortilla at the very last just to make it uniform in thickness). Cook the tortilla as you would a wheat tortilla, approximately one minute on each side. The tortillas will be flecked with brown on both sides. When cooked, remove and wrap in a kitchen towel.

Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Cut in the butter, cheese, green onions, and pepper with a pastry blender or fork, and work just until it starts to form lumps and come together. Add the bacon. Add 1 cup of the cream and work just until it becomes a sticky dough, being careful not to overwork. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and pat until it comes together. Form into 2 large circles, about 7 inches in diameter and 3/4 inch thick and cut each into 8 wedges with a sharp knife. Transfer to baking sheet with a spatula, leaving 1/2-inch space between each wedge.

Add a couple of drops of water. Press the mixture evenly and firmly onto the bottom of a springform pan (see note below), making a fist and using the back of your hand and fingers. Refrigerate the crust while you make the filling. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Using an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese until smooth. On low speed, add the sour cream and vanilla and set aside. In a clean mixing bowl, using the whisk attachment, combine the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar. Whisk for 4 to 5 minutes until fluffy. Fold in the softened cream cheese mixture. Separate this mixture into two large glass bowls. To one of the bowls, add the raspberry puree, mix well. In another bowl, using an electric mixer with clean, dry beaters, beat the egg whites. Start at low speed and increase the speed as the peaks form. Slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. When the whites are stiff but not dry, scrape them equally into the two bowls of filling and use a spatula to gently fold them in. Don&#39;t over mix the filling. Pour alternating plain mixture and raspberry mixture into the prepared pan until the pan is filled. Bake for approximately 1 hour, until the cake has risen and browned slightly and it just shimmies when you gently move the pan. It&#39;s a good idea to place the springform on a low, flat, pan, such as a pizza pan, to catch any batter that leaks. Turn the heat off and let the cake stand in the oven for 1 hour more. Remove the cake from the oven and cool before serving. You can make this cake a day ahead. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 27803,&quot;Vegetable Ratatouille for Your Summer Cookout 3 large beefsteak tomatoes, halved crosswise 2 medium zucchini 1 large eggplant 1 small red onion, halved lengthwise (through the root end) 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly torn 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, finely chopped Kosher salt Instructions: Prepare a grill for medium heat.

Coat the bottom of another smaller saute pan with olive oil. Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper on both sides. When the large saute pan is screaming hot but not quite smoking, lay the fish fillets in the pan skin-side down. Place the small saute pan directly on top of the fillets; this applies gentle pressure to the fish and forces the skin to have contact with the pan and will create crispy skin. Cook the fish for 2 to 3 minutes, and then remove the top pan. Shake the pan a little to unstick the fish. Use a fish spatula to flip the fillets, and cook until the flesh is opaque. Place a dollop of the Soft Parmesan Polenta on the bottom of each plate, top with some Yellow and Red Pepper Piperade and place a piece of fish on top. Finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. In a medium-size saucepan, bring the milk, 2 cups water and bay leaf to a boil. Season generously with salt, almost to the point of over seasoning. How do you know that you are there? TASTE IT! When it has reached a boil, slowly whisk in the polenta in small sprinkles. Once all of the polenta has been incorporated, reduce the heat to medium and immediately switch over to stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook the polenta until it begins to pull away from the pan, adding water to loosen it up if it becomes too thick. When the polenta is thoroughly cooked, it should look creamy and not feel gritty on your tongue. Remove it from the heat and stir in the Parmesan and mascarpone.

Add 1 tablespoon water; cook, stirring, until absorbed. Add the tofu and scallions to the rice; fluff with a fork. Wrap the tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave 30 seconds. Sprinkle the bottom halves with the cheese; top with the tofu mixture, pico de gallo and lettuce. Fold the bottom edge over the filling, fold in the sides, then roll up tightly. Arrange seam-side down on a large microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave until warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve with hot sauce and sour cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 27866,&quot;Apple Latkes 1 large egg 1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt plus 1/3 cup low-fat milk, or 2/3 cup natural plain yogurt 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons superfine sugar 2 apples (1/2 pound), to make 1 cup grated apples Vegetable oil, for frying Maple syrup (or confectioners&#39; sugar and ground cinnamon), for serving Instructions: Beat the egg with the yogurt and milk (or just the yogurt, if you&#39;re using the plain normal variety) and set aside. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and sugar in a bowl. Peel, quarter and core the apples, then grate them; I use a food processor, but a coarse Microplane or other grater would work easily, I&#39;d imagine. Pour the yogurt mixture into the flour bowl, tip in the grated apples and fold it together. Pour enough oil to come about 1/4 inch up in a skillet and put on the stove to heat. Dollop spoonfuls -- I use a round soup spoon -- of the apple batter into the sizzling oil; a rubber spatula (the one you used to fold the batter together) will help you scrape the batter off the spoon and press down on the little latkes in the pan. Don&#39;t worry about making perfect round pancakes; I like these a bit raggedy and skew-whiff. Fry for a minute or two, until the latkes are a golden brown on the undersides; you can see from the top as they start firming up underneath. Flip them with 2 metal spatulas and fry for another minute on the uncooked side. Remove to a tray lined with paper towels to blot the excess oil and continue cooking until you&#39;ve used up all the batter. Top with maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 27867,&quot;One-Skillet Cajun Shrimp and Rice 1 cup brown rice 1 pound shrimp, deveined<br> 3 teaspoons Cajun seasoning Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more as needed 2 celery ribs, finely sliced<br> 1 green bell pepper, diced<br> 2 links andouille sausage, sliced 1/4 inch thick 1/2 cup chicken broth<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch<br> Juice from 1/2 lemon<br> Chopped fresh parsley and lemon wedges, for garnish<br> Instructions: Place the rice in a rice cooker along with 2 cups water; set it and forget it. Arrange the shrimp on a plate in a single layer and dust with 2 teaspoons of the Cajun seasoning and a little salt. Add the olive oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Add the celery and green bell pepper and saute until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the andouille, scooting the veggies to the side so that the sausage can get a good sear on both sides. Remove the goods from the skillet and reserve in a bowl. There should be enough oil in the skillet, but if it&#39;s on the dry side, add a tiny drizzle of olive oil. Add the shrimp to the skillet in a single layer and sear on both sides, 2 minutes tops. Add the shrimp to the sausage bowl. Add the broth, milk and remaining teaspoon Cajun seasoning to the skillet. Make a cornstarch slurry by combining the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Whisk it with a fork, then slowly pour the slurry into the skillet. Cook the sauce, whisking, until it thickens just a tad. Add the lemon juice and a good pinch of salt. Stir for just a few seconds and taste it. Is the sauce where you want it? Maybe a little black pepper? Little more lemon? Do it. Now, add the reserved veggies and meats to the skillet and toss to combine. It&#39;s seriously so silky and luscious you&#39;ll weep. Serve this over your brown rice, garnished with parsley and lemon wedges, and that&#39;s all she wrote. So eat.

Sift together dry ingredients (flour, cinnamon, ginger, and salt) in a large bowl, set aside. Whip vegetable shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Add light corn syrup and molasses to sugar mixture, slowly, until thoroughly mixed. Add warm water. You can add dry ingredients to mixer and knead with a dough hook, or transfer wet ingredients to large bowl of dry ingredients and knead for 10 minutes. Put dough in a large plastic bag for 1 hour to rest. This dough will keep for a week at room temperature or a month in the refrigerator, although it is best when used same day. Roll dough evenly onto a piece of tin foil (big enough to fit a cookie sheet) to about 1/8 to 1/4-inch thickness. Use copper cutters to make cottage shapes. Peel up the unused dough. Place foil on cookie sheet, being careful not to disturb cut pieces, and bake 15 to 20 minutes until edges are golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool on a flat surface. Once baked, the cottage will last for years if stored in a plastic bag. Construct the house using Royal Frosting. Combine meringue powder and water and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add confectioners&#39; sugar and continue to beat for 7 minutes. Add food coloring to tint. Keep covered when not using since royal frosting will begin to harden when exposed to air. Decorate the gingerbread pieces while laying flat. Gravity will work to your advantage, and you&#39;ll have more control. Assemble the house with heavy frosting by adding more powdered sugar. Use various size tips to create the degree of detail you are looking for. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 27880,&quot;Russian Tea Cakes Half recipe Christmas Cookie dough, at room temperature, recipe follows 1 1/3 cups roasted salted chopped pecans 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 8 cups sifted all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 cups butter (3 sticks) 3 cups sugar 4 eggs 2 teaspoons almond extract 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions: In a large bowl mix together the cookie dough and the pecans. Cover and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Form 1-inch balls from the chilled dough and place them 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Bake until the edges of the cookies start to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes. While the cookies are cooling, line another cookie sheet with wax paper.

Cut the leftover marshmallow into pieces, coat with more of the coating and save for snacking. Let the 2 yellow rounds dry (cure) for 4 hours.<br> For the white marshmallow \\frosting:\\ Grease a 6-by-3-inch round cake pan with cooking spray. Line the edges with a double thickness of parchment paper so that the paper extends 3 inches over the top edge of the pan (for a total height of 6 inches in the pan). Lightly coat the paper with cooking spray.<br> Repeat the instructions for the yellow marshmallow exactly, except use 1 teaspoon vanilla flavor in place of the butter flavor.<br> Pour some of the white marshmallow into the prepared pan, about 2 inches up the side. Press a yellow layer into the white marshmallow until the yellow and white layers are even. Top with more white marshmallow and press in the second yellow layer. Fill with the remaining white marshmallow.<br> Let the marshmallow stand, uncovered, in the pan overnight. When set, pull the marshmallow out of the pan by the parchment paper and dust it with the coating.<br> For the decors: Using a soft-bristle kitchen-dedicated art brush, coat the bottom half of the cake with corn syrup or piping gel.

Using a pastry brush, brush the baked pie shell up to the rim with the melted chocolate. Set aside to cool and harden at room temperature or, uncovered, in the refrigerator. In a large saucepan, bring the milk, cream of coconut, and vanilla bean to a simmer over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg yolks and sugar together until pale yellow and fluffy. With the mixer running at low speed, mix in the cornstarch, then gradually pour in the hot milk mixture. Strain the mixture back into the saucepan to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and stir in the butter. Half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Rest the bowl containing the custard in the ice water and let cool, stirring frequently to cool the mixture. When the custard is cool, whip the cream until stiff. Fold the whipped cream and coconut into the custard. Pour the mixture into the chocolate-coated pie shell and smooth the top. Refrigerate uncovered at least 2 hours. (Or refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 24 hours.) Serve cold. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter. Turn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in 1/2, and shape into 2 round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won&#39;t be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It&#39;s entirely up to you. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don&#39;t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don&#39;t do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11 inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies. Set your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it&#39;s up to you. Either choice will work. To transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan. Don&#39;t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don&#39;t be concerned; we&#39;ll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. Working around the rim, turn the crust under itself (not under the rim of the pan) to make a thick edge, pressing it firmly against the pan to reduce shrinkage. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \\V\\ with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Chill 20 minutes before baking. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don&#39;t turn down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights, rice, or dried beans. (Pie weights are reusable metal or ceramic pellets that hold the crust in place as it bakes. You can buy them at cooking supply stores.) Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \\blond. Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent overbaking, until medium brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 27902,&quot;Caramel Sauce 9 ounces granulated sugar 2.5 ounces water 5.25 ounces heavy cream 1.5 ounces butter Instructions: Combine the sugar and water in a stainless pot. Wash down any crystals from the inner sides of pot with a clean brush, dipped in cold water to prevent crystallization. Bring the mixture to boil and cook until sugar is caramelized. When the syrup is mahogany brown, add the butter and swirl the pan. Carefully pour in the heavy cream and let the mixture return to boil. Strain the caramel sauce into a container over an ice bath. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Port]&quot; 27903,&quot;Flaming Filet Mignon with Chive Butter 1 stick butter, softened Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 bunch chives, left whole 4 (8-ounce) filet mignon steaks 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 ounces brandy Instructions: Place butter into a mixing bowl, season with salt and pepper and stir until blended and soft. Take a 12-inch piece of plastic wrap and lay it on the counter. Spoon the butter out onto the center of the plastic wrap and place the chives in the center on top of the butter. Pull the edge over the butter mixture, and tightly pinch the ends, then holding the plastic wrap tightly at each end, pull the mixture towards you. This should create a tight sausage shape. (or imagine rolling a sushi roll) Chives will be in the center surrounded by butter. Tie a knot on both ends of the butter roll and place into the freezer until you are ready to place it on top of your cooked filet. Season the filets with a little salt and pepper.

Mix on low for 10 seconds using the paddle attachment. Put the water and shortening in microwavable container and heat to 120 to 130 degrees F, approximately 2 minutes. Stir until the shortening is thoroughly melted. Add the water mixture to the dry ingredients and mix on medium speed until well combined, stopping to scrape down the bowl halfway through mixing, about 3 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, uncover and mix on medium speed, using the paddle attachment, for 3 minutes. Position the 8 cans on a half sheet pan and generously spray the rings and pan with nonstick spray. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of oats in the bottom of each ring. Scoop the dough, with a 2-ounce ice cream scoop or disher, into the rings, dividing the dough evenly between the rings. Sprinkle each top with 1/2 teaspoon of oats. Cover with parchment and let sit in a warm place for 60 minutes. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Leave the parchment in place and set a second sheet pan on top. Bake for 20 minutes then remove the top half sheet pan. Continue to bake until the muffins reach an internal temperature of 210 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, and are lightly browned, about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan with the muffins still in the rings, to a cooling rack for 10 minutes. Slide a knife around the perimeter of the ring to loosen. Cool completely before splitting with a fork. To serve, toast under broiler for 3 to 4 minutes. Put 4 (6-ounce) custard cups in a 6-quart deep, straight-sided saute pan or rondeau. Add 4 quarts of water or enough to cover the cups by at least 1/4-inch. Add the vinegar and salt to the water and put the pan over high heat. Heat just until the water begins to boil and the cups clatter against the bottom of the pan, 20 to 25 minutes. Adjust the heat to maintain a water temperature of 205 degrees F outside the cups. Break the eggs, 1 at a time, into another custard cup or ladle. Pour the eggs slowly into each of the cups, timing them about 10 seconds apart. Cook for 5 minutes each. Serve immediately or remove eggs from cups and transfer to an ice bath to stop cooking. Refrigerate for up to 6 hours in the ice bath. To reheat, bring water to a simmer, turn off the heat and add the eggs. Wait 1 to 2 minutes or until warmed through. Whisk together the egg yolks, water, salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the cayenne in a 2 quart saucier for 1 minute. Put the saucier over low heat and whisk vigorously, moving the pan on and off the heat every 10 to 15 seconds, bringing the mixture to 140 to 145 degrees F, on an instant-read thermometer, approximately 3 minutes. Add 1 piece of butter at a time, every 30 seconds, while continually whisking and moving the saucier on and off the heat. Maintain temperature around 120 to 130 degrees F throughout the remainder of the cooking process. Once half of the butter, or 8 pieces, have been added, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Add the remaining 8 pieces of butter, 1 at a time, every 30 seconds, while continuing to move the saucier on and off the heat and maintaining 120 to 130 degrees F. After the last piece of butter has been added, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, the remaining 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, and the sugar and whisk for 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and add more lemon juice, as desired. Move immediately to a short, wide-mouthed thermos to hold for up to 2 hours. Reheat over low heat for 45 seconds. To build Eggs Benedict: Put the julienned Canadian bacon in 10-inch saute pan set over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until heated through and beginning to turn lightly brown around the edges, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, but leave the bacon in the pan to keep warm until serving. For each serving, put 2 small dollops of hollandaise on a plate and set 1/2 an English muffin on top of each dollop. Put a small amount of Canadian bacon on top of each half and top with 1 warm poached egg and drizzle with hollandaise. Repeat with remaining ingredients and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 27908,&quot;Lemon Spritz Cookies 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon packed finely grated lemon zest (from 2 lemons) 1 large egg 1 teaspoon pure lemon extract 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Yellow sanding sugar and/or nonpareils, for decorating Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F.

If you&#39;re buying your ground chicken from the grocery story, ring the bell and ask them if they&#39;ve got what you&#39;re looking for or if they&#39;ll grind some chicken breast for you. You can also grind it yourself in a food processor. Remove all excess fat and cartilage from boneless, skinless chicken breast and tenders, cut into 1-inch cubes and pulse until coarsely chopped. Use fresh bread crumbs. It only takes a few extra minutes. Remove crusts from good bread or don&#39;t remove the crusts, tear into chunks and pulse in a mini chopper or food processor. Make a giant batch and freeze them so next time you can skip this step. Place chicken in a mixing bowl. Using a rubber spatula, fold in milk, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, onion, cayenne, salt and pepper. The mixture will be very wet which means it will be a tiny bit icky forming it into patties but forge ahead. Place remaining 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs on a dinner plate or cookie sheet. Divide chicken meat into 4 or 5 piles (you decide which portion size is best for you) and using your hands, shape into patties. Coat each patty with bread crumbs. Heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat and fry patties until golden and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 27923,&quot;Johnsonville Italian Meatballs 1 package Johnsonville?

(Or put the peppercorns in a large plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin or the back of a small, heavy skillet.) Press the meat into the peppercorns covering both sides completely. (Some will come off in cooking.) Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and then the meat. Cook for 2 to 4 minutes depending on the thickness of the meat and how you want it done. Turn the steaks over and cook another 2 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the brandy. Return the pan to high heat and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 1 to 2 minutes. Take the steaks out of the pan and set them aside. Add the cream and butter to the pan and cook until the cream has reduced to a thick sauce. Return the steaks to the pan, along with any accumulated juices, and warm them through. Serve the steaks on warm plates and cover them with the sauce. Sprinkle on some salt, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 27925,&quot;Ham Rolls with Spicy Pineapple Sauce 1/2 pineapple, cored and cut into chunks 1 Thai bird cl, stemmed<br> 1 clove garlic 1 tablespoon lime juice<br> 1 tablespoon brown sugar<br> 2 teaspoons fish sauce<br> 1/2 teaspoon minced ginger<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch<br> One 12-ounce can cooked ham, such as Spam 3 ounces vermicelli rice noodles<br> One 12-ounce package rice paper wrappers<br> Butter lettuce, sliced red cabbage, fresh cilantro leaves and fresh mint leaves, for filling<br> Instructions: For the spicy pineapple sauce: Add the pineapple chunks, Thai bird cl, garlic, lime juice, brown sugar, fish sauce and ginger to a blender. Blend until combined. Transfer the mixture to a pot. Heat the mixture over medium heat. Combine the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl and mix until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add to the hot pineapple mixture and stir to combine. Simmer until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. For the ham rolls: Cut the ham into 10 slices, then cut each slice into 4 matchsticks. Add the ham to a nonstick pan over medium heat and fry until golden brown. Set aside and let cool. Cook the vermicelli rice noodles according to the package. Rinse with cold water. Toss with 1/4 cup pineapple sauce. Set aside. Line a plate with a damp paper towel or parchment paper. Wet a few paper towel sheets and wring out the water. Have them standing by to cover your finished rolls. Fill a large shallow bowl with warm water. Dunk one rice wrapper in the shallow bowl of water for about 5 seconds to soften. Move to your work surface. Add 1 leaf of butter lettuce, torn in half, in the center, and top with 4 pieces of the ham, a small pile of the vermicelli noodles, red cabbage, cilantro leaves and mint leaves. Gently pull the bottom of the wrapper and roll over the filling, using your hands to tuck the filling in as you roll. Fold in each side and continue to roll tightly. Add the roll to your damp paper towel-lined plate. Cover the roll with a damp paper towel. Continue rolling until you have 10 rolls, covering with damp paper towels and keeping them separated (if the rolls touch, the wrappers will tear). To serve, cut each roll in half on an angle and serve with the spicy pineapple sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 27926,&quot;Sparkling Berry Chiffon 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 3 eggs, whisked<br> 2 cups mixed berries, such as raspberries, blackberries and blueberries 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup moscato sparkling wine<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br> Instructions: Put a strainer over a glass bowl.

Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Financial advisor Linda Croley was inspired by childhood memories of a family treat when she created these peanut butter-date cookies. \\I get a great feeling when I bite into these cookies and think of my family who are around me today, and those whose memories I&#39;ll always cherish,\\ says Croley. Once you try them, you may never make an ordinary peanut butter cookie again. Preheat oven to 375degreesF. Beat brown sugar, butter, peanut butter and cinnamon in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well mixed. Add egg and vanilla; continue beating until well mixed. Reduce speed to low. Add flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; beat until well mixed, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary. Stir in dates and walnuts. Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour before baking. Use a small scoop (1 3/8- to 1 1/2-inch) and drop balls of dough 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet. (If you do not have a scoop, shape the dough by hand into 1- to 1 1/4-inch balls.) Gently press each ball to flatten slightly. Bake the cookies until the edges are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. To decorate: Place white chocolate and oil in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave on Medium, stirring every 30 seconds, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. To drizzle, dip a fork in the chocolate then wave it over a cookie to create a lacy finish (see Variations). Let the chocolate set for at least 1 hour. Variations: Instead of drizzling, dip the top side of the cooled cookies in melted white or dark chocolate and sprinkle with chopped walnuts. Tip: Most brands of white chocolate chips are actually not white chocolate at all; they&#39;re called \\white morsels\\ and contain no chocolate. We like Sunspire (made without partially hydrogenated oil), found in natural-foods stores or online at sunspire.com, and the Albertsons/ Shaw&#39;s store brand, Essensia. Eight ounces chopped pure white chocolate can be used in place of the chips.

Add 1/2 cup water, then stir in the honey. Heat over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a low boil and the blueberries just start to break apart. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons cold water in a small bowl, then add the slurry to the saucepan and bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Turn the heat down and simmer on low heat until the sauce is nicely thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Set aside until ready to serve. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) For the pancakes: Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the ricotta, milk, vanilla, eggs and lemon zest and juice in a separate medium bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F. Heat about a tablespoon each vegetable oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet (I prefer cast-iron) over medium heat. When the butter is foamy, reduce the heat to medium-low and ladle a heaping 1/4 cup pancake batter into the skillet. Repeat to make 2 more pancakes. Cook until bubbles start to form in the batter and the pancakes are golden underneath, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook the other sides until golden, another 3 minutes. Place the finished pancakes on a sheet tray and hold the oven while you finish cooking the remaining batter, adding more oil and butter as necessary.

Add shallot, parsley, eggs, Armagnac, garlic, salt, and pepper. Soak the bread in milk until softened, then remove and gently squeeze to remove excess milk. Add soaked bread to the meat mixture, and mix well. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Season inside of capon well with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity with stuffing and sew closed with butcher&#39;s twine, making sure twine is very tight. (Or, roll stuffing into a log in a double layer of cheesecloth and tie ends closed. Add to bouillon about 1/2 hour before bird is done cooking, and poach until firm.) Add turnips, onions, carrots, celery, and leeks to a large, deep pot. Place stuffed capon on vegetables, add bay leaves, thyme, and garlic. Add a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper and pour in the stock. It should completely cover bird and vegetables. Add a little water, if needed. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer gently until meat is very tender and almost falling off the bone, at least 2 1/2 hours. Cook the cabbage in the bouillon for the last 30 minutes of cooking time. Reserve 1 cup of the bouillon for the Gros Sel Sauce. While the capon cooks, prepare the Gros Sel Sauce. Carefully remove capon and vegetables from the pot with a large, slotted spoon. Place on a platter and lightly tent with foil. Strain broth, return to pot, and bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Taste to adjust seasoning. Add pasta, and cook until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. While pasta cooks, cut capon into serving portions. Remove the stuffing from the cavity and cut into slices (or unwrap and slice). Arrange vegetables around capon and cover with foil. Keep in a warm oven. Ladle the broth with vermicelli into bowls and serve. Don&#39;t forget to pass a bottle of red wine for the chabrot. Following the broth, serve the stuffing, vegetables, and capon, pouring some of the hot broth over them before serving. Garnish with capers, pickled onions, cornichons, and mustard. Serve with Gros Sel Sauce. Combine eggs, mustard, vinegar, and herbs in a bowl. Slowly stir in oil, then add the broth.

Cook the sugar until it caramelizes to a nice amber color. Remove from heat and slowly add the cream. Return to heat and stir until the sugar and cream are completely incorporated and smooth. Add the butter, candied ginger, and chopped nuts and allow the mixture to cool slightly. If the mixture gets too cool, simply reheat it slightly. Next, place the spring roll wrappers down on the table like a diamond, with one point closest to you. Divide the filling evenly between the 4 wrappers. Fold the point over the filling and roll. Fold over the left side and then the right side to seal the ends and continue to roll until a small triangle remains. Brush the edge with water and press to seal the end. Fry in 360 degree F oil, just to brown the skin. To make the ice cream, bring the milk, cream, sugar, and split vanilla bean to a boil. In a separate bowl, combine the egg yolks and corn syrup and stir. Once the milk has boiled, pour half of the milk into the yolks and stir until combined. Add the remaining milk and put back on the heat. Continue to stir until the mixture reaches 180 degrees F. Strain the mixture and cool in an ice bath. Place the mixture in an ice cream machine and freeze according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. To prepare the carambola pickles, combine the vinegar, sugar, ginger, pepper, anise, vanilla, and saffron in a pot and bring to a boil. Remove mixture from heat and add the carambola slices.

Top each ice cream scoop with a couple carambola slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]</p><p>&quot; 27947,&quot;The Legendary Turducken Cornbread 1 1/2 cups warm water, about 110 to 115 degrees F 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for dusting 2 teaspoons active dry yeast 2 cups flour 1 cup corn flour Vegetable oil, for coating the bowl Egg Wash Stuffing 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 pound/450 g Morteau sausage, chopped 2 onions, finely chopped 2 celery stalks, finely chopped 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup veal stuck 1 loaf cornbread, cut in chunks 12 oysters, shucked and liquid reserved 1/4 cup flat leaf parsley, chopped 2 tablespoons smoked paprika 1/4 cup melted butter Salt and pepper Turducken 1 (20 to 25-pound) turkey, deboned 1(4 to 5-pound) duck, deboned 1(3 to 3-1/2 pound) chicken, deboned 1 truffle, optional 1/2 cup smoked paprika 1/2 cup melted butter Salt and freshly ground black pepper Gravy 1/2 cup reserved turducken drippings 4 cups stock 3 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons each flour and butter, blended (beurre manie) Instructions: For the cornbread: Combine the water, sugar, and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, and sprinkle the yeast on top. Allow to sit for 5 minutes or until the mixture begins to foam. Add the flour and mix on low speed until well combined. Increase the speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: Kneading the dough can also be done by hand. Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and sit in a warm place for approximately 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size. Knock the air out for 30 seconds by punching it down. You can now shape the dough into a ball, then place it onto a flour-dusted baking tray lined with parchment paper. Brush the top of the cornbread with egg wash, sprinkle the top with flour and coarse salt. Let it sit in a warm spot for 1 hour. Preheat the oven at 400 degrees F. Bake the cornbread for approximately 30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Cook&#39;s Note: You can tell if it&#39;s cooked by tapping its bottom. If it sounds hollow it&#39;s done, if it doesn&#39;t then pop it back in for a little longer. Once cooked, place the bread on a rack and allow it to cool for about 1 1/2 hours. For the stuffing: Cube up the cooled cornbread and set aside. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the Morteau sausage and cook for about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Add the onions, celery, pepper, and garlic and continue cooking until translucent, about 5 minutes. Deglaze with the veal stock. Add in the cornbread. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the oysters and their liquid, parsley, paprika, and melted butter. Season the stuffing with salt, and pepper, to taste. Reserve the stuffing in the refrigerator until ready to use. To assemble the turducken: Spread the deboned turkey, skin-side down on a flat surface, exposing as much meat as possible. Sprinkle the meat generously and evenly with a total of about 3 tablespoons of the smoked paprika, patting the seasoning in with your hands. Cook&#39;s Note: Be sure to turn the leg, thigh and wing meat to the outside so you can season it too. Season the turkey with salt and pepper. Then stuff some of the stuffing in the leg, thigh and wing cavities until full but not tightly packed. Cook&#39;s Note: If too tightly packed, it may cause the leg and wing to burst open during cooking). Spread an even layer of the stuffing over the remaining exposed meat, about 1/2 to 3/4-inches thick. You should use a total of about 4 cups of stuffing. For the duck: Remove some of the fat and keep aside. Place the duck, skin-side down, on top of the stuffing, arranging the duck evenly over the stuffing. Season the exposed duck meat generously and evenly with smoked paprika, using about 1 tablespoon, and pressing it in with your hands. Season the duck with salt and pepper. Then spread about 1 cup of the stuffing evenly over the exposed duck meat, making the layer slightly less thick, about 1/2-inch thick. Repeat with the chicken and the remaining stuffing. Place an Italian truffle in the center, optional. Enlist someone&#39;s help to close turducken. Fold the sides of the turkey together to close the bird. Have your helper hold the turkey closed while you sew up all the openings, making the stitches about 1-inch apart. When you finish sewing up the turducken on the first side, turn it over in the pan to sew closed any openings on the other side. Then tie the legs together, just above the tip bones. Leave the turducken to cook, breast-side up, in the pan, tucking in the turkey wings. Serving suggestion: Serve with Root Vegetable Mash. With the assistance of your helper, carefully lift the turducken into an ungreased 15 by 11-inch baking pan that is at least 2 1/2-inches deep. Cook&#39;s Note: This pan size is ideal because the turducken fits snugly in the pan and stays in the proper shape while cooking). Place the turducken pan in a slightly larger pan with sides at least 2 1/2-inches deep, so that the larger pan will catch the overflow of drippings during cooking. Season the exposed side of the turducken with the remaining smoked paprika, patting it in with your hands. Brush with melted butter. Bake the turducken at 325 degrees F, about 4 hours, until done, or until a meat thermometer inserted through to the center reads 165 degrees F. When done, remove the turducken from the oven and let rest for about 15 minutes For the gravy: Place the turducken drippings in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the stock, fresh thyme, and beurre manie. Season the gravy with salt, and pepper, to taste. Let the gravy come to a boil. Turn down heat to medium-low and let the gravy simmer for 10 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: Remember there are no bones to support the birds&#39; structure. With strong spatulas inserted underneath the bird, carefully transfer the turducken to a serving platter and present it to your guests before carving. Be sure to make your slices crosswise so that each slice contains the stuffing and all 3 meats. Serve additional bowls of the dressings on the side and serve with the gravy and the Root Vegetable Mash, if desired. Cook&#39;s Notes: Stuffing and assembling the turducken can be done 1 day ahead and kept in the refrigerator. Beurre manie is 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons flour. This is used to help thicken sauces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 27948,&quot;Marlowe&#39;s Black Magic 2 cups onion powder 2 cups garlic powder 1 cup cayenne pepper 1/2 cup white pepper 1/2 cup black pepper 1 cup dried thyme 1 cup dried oregano 2 cups table salt 1 cup paprika 1 cup ground cumin Instructions: Blend well, cover and store. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah/Shiraz]&quot; 27949,&quot;Stir-Fried Chicken and Vegetables 1 tablespoon peanut oil 2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips 1 medium onion, diced 2 cups sliced carrots 1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced into thin strips 2 cups sugar snap peas 1 (15-ounce) can baby corn, drained 2 cups broccoli florets 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce 2 teaspoons cornstarch 1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth Instructions: Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.

Add the sugar, and cook, stirring so it doesn&#39;t burn, until the mixture is loose and runny. Optionally, if you want to remove the seeds, strain the mixture through a strainer and then return it to the pot before proceeding. Stir in the pectin a little at a time, following the instructions on the pectin container, until the jam reaches your desired consistency (remember that the jam will continue to firm as it cools). Let cool completely. Refrigerate the jam in an airtight container for up to 1 month. For the burger: Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, put the patty in the skillet and press it into a flat round burger with a spatula. Sprinkle the burger with salt and pepper and weigh it down with a small plate or empty saucepan; the perfect burger is cooked by placing a weight of some kind on top and only flipping it once during the process. When the burger is halfway done, after 3 to 5 minutes, flip it over, sprinkle with more salt and pepper and cook until desired doneness, another 3 to 5 minutes. Spread the peanut butter on the bottom bun and 2 tablespoons of the blackberry jam on the top bun. Add the finished burger on top of the peanut butter and flip the top bun over allowing the peanut butter to melt and the jam to ooze all over.

Whisk in the egg yolks and then the cream over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it&#39;s thickened and coats the back of a spoon. Add the vanilla and almond extracts, pour into a heatsafe bowl and cover with plastic wrap touching the surface of the pudding. Refrigerate until cooled, about 1 hour or overnight. For the cookies: Combine the flour, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. With the mixer running on low, add the vanilla and almond extracts and then gradually add the butter. Mix until the mixture comes together into a dough, slowly increasing the speed once you&#39;re confident that doing so won&#39;t result in flour flying everywhere. Divide the dough in half, press into discs, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or overnight. (If you&#39;re impatient, fine, skip this step.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to 1/8 inch by 1/4 inch thick. Cut out 2-inch circles with a biscuit cutter and then use a big piping tip to cut out 1/2-inch holes from the center. (Re-roll scraps as needed.) Place the cookies on baking sheets 1 inch apart. Bake until they&#39;re just starting to brown around the edges (start checking for doneness at 12 minutes). Let cool on the pans. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in a double boiler or in a microwave in 30-second increments, stirring after each. Let it cool slightly and then pour into a piping bag. Snip off the tip and then pipe 4 thick chocolate stripes on each cookie. Let the chocolate harden at room temp or in the fridge. For the assembly: In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the cream and confectioners&#39; sugar to stiff peaks. Fold together the whipped cream and pudding in a large bowl. Crush the cookies by hand or in a ziptop bag with a rolling pin or other blunt object (reserving 6 to 8 whole cookies for the topping) and fold them in. Drain and fold in the mandarin slices, reserving some for the topping too. Top with remaining cookies, mandarin slices and sprinkles.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the macaroni according to the package instructions. Reserve 3/4 cup of the cooking water, then drain the macaroni and set aside. Wipe out the pot. Add the butter and melt over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until it begins to toast, about 2 minutes. (The flour will form a thick paste, but that&#39;s okay; just keep it moving in the pot.) Whisk in the milk and the reserved macaroni water and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is thick like gravy, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in the Swiss cheese, sour cream, 2/3 cup of the mozzarella and 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan. Once the cheeses have melted, add the spinach and cook until just wilted, about 1 minute.

Form each portion loosely into a 3/4-inch-thick burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of each burger with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in the pan or griddle over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Cook the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the first side, about 3 minutes for beef and 5 minutes for turkey. Flip over the burgers. Cook beef burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the second side, 4 minutes for medium rare (3 minutes if topping with cheese) or until cooked to desired degree of doneness. Cook turkey burgers until cooked throughout, about 5 minutes on the second side. Add the cheese, if using, to the tops of the burgers during the last minute of cooking and top with a basting cover, close the grill cover, or tent the burgers with aluminum foil to melt the cheese. Combine the mayonnaise and roasted garlic in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spread both sides of each bun with the mayonnaise and the mustard. Place a slice of cheese on each bun bottom, place a burger on top, and then top the burger with a slice of ham, another slice of cheese, and some pickle slices. Cover with the bun tops. Cook the burgers on a sandwich press or wrap the burgers in aluminum foil and cook in a hot skillet over high heat (put a heavy skillet on top of the burgers to press them) until golden brown and the cheese has melted, about 1 1/2 minutes per side.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the sardines or salmon in a single layer on the pan. Season the fillets on both sides with salt and pepper and one quarter of the olive oil. Scatter half the sage, thyme, rosemary, and garlic over the fillets and slide the pan into the oven. Roast the sardines for 7 minutes, or until they&#39;re just cooked through. Remove the sardines from the baking pan, cool, and then chill in the refrigerator. Re-line the baking sheet with clean parchment paper and arrange the eggplant on the sheet. Season the eggplant slices with salt and pepper as well as the remaining oil and herbs. Bake the eggplant for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender. Cool and then transfer to the refrigerator to chill. Line an 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 1/2-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, allowing it to extend over the sides. The terrine will be built with the eggplant, peppers, sardines, and tomatoes in layers, starting with the eggplant. To begin, cut the eggplant slices to fit the terrine and lay a layer of eggplant over the bottom and up the sides of the terrine, allow the slices to overlap a little and overhang the edges. Top with peppers, then sardines, then tomatoes. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, finishing by folding the overhanging eggplant over the top of the terrine and leveling the top with an additional layer of eggplant slices. Cover the top with the plastic wrap that&#39;s hanging over the sides and press another piece of plastic wrap against the top for good measure. Cut a piece of corrugated cardboard to fit inside the top of the terrine and press it down firmly against the plastic wrap. Place a weight, such as a 1-pound can, on top of the cardboard, put the terrine on a parchment-lined tray (to catch any drips that result from the weighting), and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, or overnight. To serve: If you have an electric knife, now&#39;s the time to use it, if not, choose a long thin serrated knife and work with a sawing motion. Remove the weight, the cardboard, and the sheet of plastic wrap. Carefully cut the loaf into slices, each no less than 1-inch thick (thinner slices will fall apart.) If you&#39;d like, serve the terrine with a small green salad dressed with lemon juice and olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 27965,&quot;Chocolate Bread 1 package active dry yeast or 18 grams fresh yeast 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon lukewarm water 4 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 2 teaspoons salt 1 1/4 cups lukewarm water 1 egg yolk 1 tablespoon butter, room temperature 1 cup unsweetened chocolate chips Instructions: Stir the first 3 ingredients in a large mixing bowl; let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.

Add the pork chops and rub to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, up to overnight. For the pickled vegetables: Meanwhile, combine the sugar, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 1/2 cups water in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over high heat. Remove from the heat and stir until the sugar and salt are fully dissolved. Add the vinegar and let cool for 10 minutes. Add the shallots, carrots and daikon to the saucepan and fully submerge, using a small plate to weigh them down if necessary, for at least 1 hour. (The pickled vegetables can be made up to a week in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container.) Heat a 2-burner cast-iron grill pan over medium-high heat until evenly hot, about 10 minutes. Remove the pork chops from the marinade and discard any excess. Grill until dark brown, charred in spots and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. For the sandwich: Slice the boule in half horizontally. Remove some of the fluffy interior from both halves and reserve for breadcrumbs or another use. Spread the cut sides with the mayonnaise and sriracha. Layer the pork chops on the bottom half and sprinkle with the Maggi seasoning. Drain the pickled vegetables and layer them on top of the pork. Top with a layer of cucumbers, then jalape?os, then tomatoes. Fill the top half of the boule with the cilantro, then carefully flip to close the sandwich. Wrap the sandwich tightly in aluminum foil and refrigerate with a cast-iron skillet on top. Add a few jars of whatever is already in your refrigerator to the skillet to help weigh it down. Let sit for at least 2 hours, up to overnight, for the flavors to marry. Unwrap the sandwich and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.

The yeast will be activated and have the appearance of a head of beer. If it does not, it should be discarded and replaced with fresh yeast. (Improper storage temperature will sometimes destroy yeast even if the date on the package indicates it has not yet expired.) Add the flour and nutmeg to a food processor fitted with a dough blade (or the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough hook). Turn on the food processor and through the feed tube, gradually add the yeast mixture. (Or turn on the mixer and gradually add the yeast mixture to the bowl of flour.) Then add the olive oil and eggs. Mix until the dough comes together. Transfer the dough to a large bowl and cover with a clean damp towel. Let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. Punch down the dough and let it rise a second time in the same way. This will make the texture of the dough finer. Please note that the dough will not rise as much the second time. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F. or as directed on the manufacturer&#39;s instructions for similar foods. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled marble slab and knead for a few minutes. Divide the dough into eighths. Divide each eighth into thirds and roll into a cylinder about 1/2-inch in diameter and 8 inches long.

Flatten into a disc shape and set back in bowl and cover with plastic wrap to rest for 30 minutes while you prepare the filling. Set a large, heavy-based pot over medium-high heat and add vegetable oil. Add spices and stir until just fragrant - this lightly toasts the spices and forms the spicy base of the filling mixture. Add ground chicken and saute until slightly coloured. Add onion, garlic, and ginger and sweat. Add chickpeas and spinach then simmer for 10 minutes until liquid has evaporated and all the flavours have come together. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside and allow to cool (you can pour it out onto a flat platter to speed up the cooling process. Return to the dough and divide it up into 4 equal parts. Working with one piece at a time roll into a nice ball then using a rolling pin roll out into discs. Cut in half down the middle to form two half-circles. Working with one half at a time, rub a little water around the edges using your finger. Form a cone by folding along the straight edge overlapping the seam. Gently pinch at the fold to secure. Holding the cone in your hand fill with 2 tablespoons of filling. Seal the top by bringing the edges together and crimping with your fingers or a fork. Do this with the rest to make 8 samosas.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment in the freezer for your filling. For the choux dough: Combine the butter, sugar, salt and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove the pan from the heat and sift the flour directly into the pan. Stir the batter into a paste with a wooden spoon; you will have to beat it hard. Return the pan to medium heat. Stir the batter continuously until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and is slightly shiny, about 3 minutes. Transfer the batter to a stand mixer bowl fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until slightly cooled, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one thoroughly before adding the next. Fit a large pastry bag with tip #808 and fill with the choux dough. Pipe twelve 2-inch circular mounds, about 2 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the batter has a peak, dab it smooth with a wet fingertip. Beat the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon of water and brush the surface of the puffs with the beaten yolk. Bake on the middle rack for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and continue baking until the puffs are golden brown, light, airy and crisp, 30 to 35 minutes more. After you remove the puffs from the oven, flip each over and gently poke the bottom with a paring knife to release the steam. Cool completely on a rack. For the filling: Remove the stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment from the freezer. Add the cream cheese and sugar to the bowl and beat on high speed until completely combined. Add the heavy cream and vanilla and mix on low speed until mostly combined. Increase the speed to high and whip until soft peaks form. Add the huckleberry jam (or your flavoring of choice) and beat until stiff peaks form. For the hard candy topper: Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or foil. Mix the sugar, corn syrup and water together in a heavy-bottomed pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Continue to boil until it reaches the hard crack stage at 300 degrees F. When the candy reaches 300 degrees F stir in a few drops of food coloring. Pour onto the prepared baking sheet. Break the candy into small pieces when it is cool enough to handle. To assemble: Cut the puffs in half with a serrated knife and set the tops aside. Pipe with a large star tip or spoon the whipped cream filling into the bottom halves of the cream puffs. Replace the puff tops. Top each with a hard candy shard.</p><p>&quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 28007,&quot;Orange Currant Polenta Cookies 2 cups dried currants 1/4-cup orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) or water 4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into cubes 2 cups sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 medium oranges, zest finely grated 1 tablespoon coarse polenta or cornmeal Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Transfer the cakes to wire racks to cool in pans 30 minutes; remove from pans to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling.<br> To make the filling: In a medium saucepan, combine 2 1/2 cups water, sugar, corn syrup and cocoa. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring often. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and the remaining 1/2 cup water; stir into cocoa mixture. Return to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, boil 4 minutes or until the mixture is very thick and cornstarch is cooked. Remove from heat; stir in the butter and vanilla. Pour into a bowl and cover the surface directly with plastic wrap; cool completely. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour, before using.<br> To make the frosting: In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter and chocolates; microwave until melted. Stir thoroughly to combine, then set aside. In a medium saucepan, whisk the eggs, sugar, and salt until combined; whisk in water. Cook the egg mixture over medium to medium-high heat until it registers 160 degrees on a candy thermometer, stirring constantly with a whisk (create as little foam as possible). Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl; whisk in the reserved chocolate mixture. Cool completely; refrigerate until stiff enough to spread, about 2 hours and up to overnight.<br> To assemble: Cut the tops off the cake layers to make them flat and even on top. Place the bottom layer with trimmed-side facing up on a serving platter; spread blackout filling on top. Place the top layer with trimmed-side facing down on top of the filling. Coat the cake with the frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 28025,&quot;Garlic Chicken Pasta with Prosciutto 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup minced garlic 5 tomatoes, seeded and chopped 4 ounces prosciutto, cut into small pieces 4 chicken breasts, grilled and cut into strips or cubes 2 pounds 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup fresh basil, sliced into small strips 3/4 pound linguine 1/2 cup grated fresh Parmesan or Romano 5 roasted pasilla chiles, peeled, seeded and cut into strips 2 roasted red peppers, peeled, seeded and cut into strips Fresh basil, chiffonade for garnish Instructions: Heat oil in a large skillet and saute garlic until soft and light brown.

Set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and add the tomatoes, garlic and onions. Stir and cook for a minute or 2. Add 2 teaspoons of the chili powder, 1 teaspoon of the paprika and 1 teaspoon of the cumin. Stir and cook the mixture for another minute or 2 in order to release the flavors. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside. In the same skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add the chicken along with the remaining 2 teaspoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon cumin and some salt and pepper and cook until the chicken is deep golden brown and done in the middle, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water and stir to make a sauce. Allow the sauce to boil until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Stir in the pinto and kidney beans and set aside. To assemble, pour half of the jar of salsa verde (about a cup) in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish or disposable foil baking pan. Layer half of the tortillas on top of the salsa verde, overlapping the edges. Spoon the rice over the tortillas, spread the tomato mixture over the rice then sprinkle the corn over the tomatoes. Next, add the chicken and bean mixture, then sprinkle on half the cheese and pour over half the Enchilada Sauce. Next, add the remaining tortillas in a layer, pour on the rest of the salsa verde and Enchilada Sauce and sprinkle on the rest of the cheese.<br> Cover the casserole with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until hot and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow the casserole to sit for a few minutes before serving up to ensure it holds together. Serve with sour cream and cilantro for topping. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the peppers, onions and garlic and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, cayenne, bouillon cube and some salt and pepper and cook until the spices darken and their flavors are released, about 2 minutes.

Place raspberries in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse until liquefied, for about 1 minute. Strain the raspberries through a fine strainer, into a 5-quart bowl, using a rubber spatula to press down on the seeds to extract as much puree as possible (about 3/4-cup puree). Discard the seeds. Set the puree aside until needed. In a sifter, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Sift onto a large piece of waxed paper and set aside until needed. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place the white chocolate and 4 ounces of butter in the top half. Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate and butter until completely melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer the melted white chocolate and butter into an empty 5 quart bowl and set aside until needed. Again, heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place the semisweet chocolate and the remaining 8 ounces of butter in the top half of the double boiler. Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate and butter until completely melted and smooth, about 7 minutes. Transfer the melted semisweet chocolate and butter to an empty 5-quart bowl and set aside until needed. Place the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with a balloon whip. Whisk on high for 2 minutes until soft. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl, then whisk on high for 4 minutes until slightly thickened and lemon colored. Operate the mixer on low while gradually adding the sifted dry ingredients until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and add the sour cream. Use a rubber spatula to mix the ingredients until thoroughly combined. Portion 2 cups of the batter into the bowl containing the pureed raspberries and stir until smooth. Portion 1 cup of the batter into the bowl containing the melted white chocolate mixture and stir until smooth. Portion the remaining 2 cups of batter into the bowl containing the melted semisweet chocolate mixture and stir until smooth. Pour the dark chocolate batter into a 9 by 13 by 2 inch nonstick baking pan and spread evenly over the bottom. Pour the white chocolate batter onto the top of the dark chocolate batter in swirls. Pour the raspberry batter over the other 2 batters in the same manner. Use the blade of a paring knife to swirl the batters together in a fanciful pattern (you should have fun doing this). Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Remove the brownies from the oven and allow to cool in the pan at room temperature for 1 hour. Use a serrated knife with rounded tip to cut the brownies into 24 2-inch squares.; Tip: To cut brownies well, use a serrated knife, with rounded tip. To make sure you get a clean cut, heat the blade of the knife under hot running water, and wipe the blade dry before making each cut. Tip: To decorate plates - in inexpensive, plastic squeeze bottles (like people use for ketchup), place flavored sauces - i.e. chocolate, butterscotch...whatever you like.

Make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Bring the water to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring constantly as the chocolate melts. Once the chocolate reaches 115 degrees F. on a candy thermometer, remove the bowl of melted chocolate from the double boiler and stir in the remaining chocolate to reduce the temperature. Keep stirring until the temperature reaches 85 degrees F., then pick out any chunks of unmelted chocolate. Put the chocolate back over the simmering water and stir until the temperature reaches 90 degrees. Keep the chocolate at 90 degrees F. while you decorate the truffles.<br> Decorate each truffle ball as described below and return to the wax paper. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.

Remove the mixture from heat and cool over an ice bath. Stir in the lime juice, and then process in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. For the dressing, combine the mango puree, asafetida, salt, and sugar in a bowl and whisk together until mixed. While whisking slowly drizzle in the oil, and continuing to whisk until an emulsification is reached. For the salad, slice the mango thinly or use a peeler and peel the flesh into long strips. Toss the mango strips, mache, pistachios, and crystallized ginger with the dressing, and then arrange in a small mound on the plate. On top, set a scoop of the lime sherbet. Begin by gently peeling the skin from two lobes of ginger. Using a knife or peeler tends to remove too much flesh; a less wasteful method is to use the edge of a spoon. Slice both lobes lengthwise into thin pieces, using a mandoline or knife. Add 2 cups water and 2 cups of the sugar to a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat, add the ginger, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until they are soft. Remove the ginger pieces using a strainer and cool briefly. Spread the remaining 4 cups of sugar on a baking sheet and dredge the ginger pieces in the sugar until both sides are entirely covered. Transfer the ginger to another baking sheet and air dry for several hours, until crisp. Cut into short, 2-inch sticks. Place in an airtight container.

Brush a shallow 3-quart baking dish with olive oil. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until very al dente; you still want it to retain a little bite. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water. Drain well. Meanwhile, in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the sausage and cook and crumble with a wooden spoon until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Add the onion and fennel; cook until softened, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and add the cream. If the sauce is too thick, add a little water from the pasta. Turn up the heat to medium high and simmer rapidly to thicken the sauce and blend the flavors, about 10 minutes. Add the rigatoni and basil and toss to coat the pasta with the sauce. Remove from the heat and stir in half each of the mozzarella and parmesan. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and parmesan. Bake until browned and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 28122,&quot;Golden Beet Carpaccio Salad 1 large golden beet, or 3 medium red beets (about 12 ounces), trimmed 1/3 cup olive oil 1 red jalapeno cl, stemmed, seeded, and minced 1 tablespoon distilled vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup gorgonzola cheese, crumbled 1 cup baby arugula Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Wrap the beet tightly in foil. Roast the beet directly on the oven rack for 40 minutes, or until just tender when pierced with a knife. Unwrap, cool to room temperature, and then refrigerate until completely chilled. (The beet can be made 1 day ahead. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate.) For the cl oil: In a small saucepan, combine the oil and minced cl, and set over medium-high heat. As soon as the cl begins to sizzle and turns orange in color, turn off the heat. Transfer the cl oil to a small bowl and cool completely. (The cl oil can be made 1 day ahead. Keep covered at room temperature.) Carefully peel the beet. Using a mandolin, set at 1/8-inch thickness, or a very sharp knife, cut the beet into paper-thin rounds. Arrange the beet slices overlapping on a large platter. Sprinkle the vinegar all over. Drizzle some of the cl oil (with the minced cl) all over the beets. Season the beet slices generously with salt and pepper. Sprinkle all over with the Gorgonzola cheese. Garnish with the arugula and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 28123,&quot;Apricot-Dark Chocolate Trail Mix 12 ounces high-quality dark chocolate, cut into chunks (about 3 cups) 2/3 cup dried cranberries 1 cup dried apricots, quartered 12 pieces candied ginger, coarsely chopped 1 cup lightly toasted pecans or walnuts Instructions: Mix the ingredients together. Divide among 6 jars or footed cellophane bags. Seal with a ribbon and sticker or a gift tag. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 28124,&quot;Caramel Sauce 2 cups sugar 1 cup water 3/4 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier) Instructions: In a saucepan combine sugar and water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium and simmer until the mixture turns deep amber in color, about 6 to 8 minutes. Watch very carefully as this mixture turns color very quickly. Carefully add the cream. The mixture will bubble and spit when the cream is added. Remove from the heat, stir, and add the liqueur. Cool slightly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling Wine]&quot; 28125,&quot;Smoked Adobo Marinated Brisket Tortas with Horseradish Crema and Caramelized Onion-Tomato Relish 12 cloves garlic, chopped<br> 6 plum tomatoes, halved and grilled<br> Zest of 1 orange plus 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice<br> 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves<br> 1/4 cup canola oil, plus more for grilling rolls<br> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons ancho cl powder<br> 3 tablespoons pasilla cl powder<br> 2 tablespoons chipotle puree<br> 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar<br> One 6- to 7-pound whole brisket, with 1/4-inch layer of fat on top<br> 4 cups apple juice<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 to 12 soft white rolls, Mexican bolillos or teleras<br> Horseradish Crema, recipe follows<br> Caramelized Onion-Tomato Relish, recipe follows<br> 1 head iceberg lettuce, finely shredded 1/4 cup prepared horseradish, drained<br> 2 cups Mexican crema<br> 1/2 cup queso fresco<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons canola oil<br> 2 large Spanish onions, halved and thinly sliced<br> 1 pint grape tomatoes, cored<br> 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 1 jalapeno, finely diced<br> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br> Sugar<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine the garlic, grilled tomatoes, orange zest and juice, cilantro, oil, vinegar, cl powders, chipotle puree and sugar in a food processor and process until smooth. Place the brisket in a large disposable pan, add the marinade and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove the brisket from the marinade 1 hour before putting on the smoker. Prepare the ceramic cooker: Remove the grill grate and ceramic plate from the cooker. Add the hot hardwood charcoal and scatter the soaked wood chips over the top. Adjust the cooker to maintain a temperature of 225 to 250 degrees F. This temperature should be maintained throughout the entire smoke. Put on the ceramic plate. Put a pan with some of the apple juice on the plate, and then put on the grill grate. Sprinkle the brisket on both sides with salt and pepper. Place the brisket, fat-side up, on your smoker grate and close it up for the long smoke. Open your barbecue smoker every hour or two and spray the brisket liberally with apple juice to help keep the meat from drying out. Once the internal temperature reaches 165 to 170 degrees F on a meat thermometer, after about 7 hours at the lower temperature range, the meat starts to get tender. At this point, wrap the brisket in foil ? this little trick is a big help in getting the meat tender, especially for beginners. Continue to cook until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 190 degrees F, 1 to 2 more hours. Remove and let rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Remove the foil from the brisket over a large pan or disposable pan and reserve the liquid. Slice or shred the brisket. Toss in the reserved liquid. To make the sandwiches: Split the rolls in half, oil the cut sides lightly, season with salt and pepper and grill, cut-side down, until lightly toasted. Spread some Horseradish Crema on the bun tops and bottoms. Top the bottoms with some of the meat, then some Caramelized Onion-Tomato Relish, then some lettuce. Top with the bun top and serve. Whisk together the crema, queso fresco and horseradish in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and slowly cook until caramelized, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the tomatoes and cook until they just begin to break down. Add the garlic and jalapeno and cook for 1 minute. Add the vinegar and a pinch of sugar and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the onions to a bowl and add the cilantro. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 28126,&quot;The Original Treats TM 3 tablespoons butter or margarine 1 package (10 oz., about 40) regular marshmallows 6 cups RICE KRISPIES? cereal</p><ul><li>OR - 4 cups miniature marshmallows Instructions: In large saucepan melt butter over low heat.

Microwave cooking times may vary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot]&quot; 28127,&quot;Fresh Pizza Dough 2 packages active dry yeast 2 teaspoons sugar 2 cups warm water (100 to 110 degrees F.) 2 tablespoons kosher salt 6 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for bowl Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes. If you&#39;re using a stand mixer, combine the salt and flour to the bowl and pulse a few times to mix. Add the yeast mixture, at the lowest speed, until the flour incorporates. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough gathers into a ball. This should take about 2 minutes. Add the olive oil and pulse a few more times. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough as you&#39;re making it by squeezing a small amount together between your thumb and fingers. If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water, if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times, kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. If you&#39;re making the dough by hand, add the yeast mixture to a large bowl and stir in the salt and the 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then begin stirring in the flour. When the mixture becomes too stiff to stir with a spoon, knead in the rest of the flour by hand, adding just enough so that the dough is soft but not too sticky. As you work, squeeze a small amount of dough together between your thumb and fingers. If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water; if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Form the dough into a round and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat the dough entirely with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e., over a gas pilot light) until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 28128,&quot;Marinated Beet and Stilton Salad 5 to 6 medium beets (about 1 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 teaspoons lemon zest plus 1/4 cup lemon juice<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (about 1/2 bunch) 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed and chopped<br> 2 green onions, green parts only, sliced<br> 2 ounces Stilton blue cheese, crumbled<br> 1 bunch watercress, leaves and thin stems only Instructions: Put the beets in a large pot of water, season heavily with salt and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the beets from the water, cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the lemon zest and juice, parsley, olive oil, thyme and green onions in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Using the same kitchen towel, remove the skins of the beets. Cut the beets into 1/2-inch-thick half-moon pieces and add to the dressing. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. When ready to serve, add the marinated beets to each individual plate. Top with some crumbled blue cheese and watercress. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 28129,&quot;Peanut Butter Cheesecake 2 pounds cream cheese 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 4 large eggs 1 cup creamy peanut butter 1 tablespoon all purpose flour 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Powdered sugar or mint Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine cream cheese and peanut butter in a large bowl. Beat the mixture in an electric mixer (using a wire whip) until smooth. Gradually add sugar and flour. Beat on medium speed until sugar and flour are incorporated well into cheese and peanut butter mixture. Scrape ingredients from side of bowl before adding eggs. Add eggs gradually and continue to beat on medium speed for two or three minutes until mixture is smooth. Mix in the vanilla extract. Be careful not to over-mix. Remove bowl from mixer. Pour mixture into prepared peanut butter cookie crust. Place cheesecake in oven on center rack. Bake cheesecake in a water bath for approximately 2 hours in 350 degree oven or until tip of a knife comes out clean when inserted in center of cake.

Add the vinegar and reduce the heat until the water in the pan has no more bubbles. Crack the eggs very close to the surface of the water and gently drop them in. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs to a bowl of cold water. Reserve the eggs in the cold water and reserve the poaching liquid to reheat the eggs. (Obviously, if you&#39;re poaching the eggs a day ahead, you can reheat the eggs in new water!) Coat a large saute pan lightly with olive oil and heat to medium. Add the Canadian bacon slices and cook on both sides until hot but not brown. Toast the English muffins. Place 1 slice of Canadian bacon on each English muffin half. Warm up the egg poaching liquid (or a pot of new water if you&#39;re poached ahead) and place the eggs in the water for 1 minute, or until the eggs are warm but not cooking any further. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon, blot with a paper towel or tea towel, and place on the English muffin halves. Top with Hollandaise Sauce. Toss the mesclun with lemon juice, big fat finishing oil and salt. Garnish each plate with the dressed greens. Melt the butter over medium heat in a small saucepan. While the butter is melting, skim off the froth that accumulates on the surface. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, then gently ladle the clear butterfat into a measuring cup or small pitcher with a spout; this is clarified butter. Be sure to leave the milk solids in the bottom of the pan. Combine the vinegar and peppercorns in a small saute pan and cook over a medium heat until almost all the vinegar has evaporated. Remove the pan from the heat, toss in a couple of ice cubes and let sit until melted. Whisk the egg yolks in a medium metal bowl until frothy and fluffy. Strain the peppercorn liquid into the egg mixture. Fill a medium saucepan with 1 inch of water and bring to a simmer. Place the metal bowl on top of the saucepan and gently cook the eggs for 2 to 3 minutes, whisking frequently. Very slowly begin to whisk in the clarified butter. Start with 2 or 3 drops and continue with a couple more drops after the butter is incorporated. Continue adding the butter a little at a time until all of it is incorporated and the sauce is fluffy and foamy. If the eggs seem to be cooking too quickly, pull the bowl from the saucepan and lower the heat. If the eggs start to curdle, immediately toss in an ice cube to cool them down. Once all the butter is combined, add the lemon juice and season the sauce with cayenne and salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 28131,&quot;Grilled Lasagna 1 1-pound ball fresh mozzarella, halved and thinly sliced 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese<br> Pinch of red pepper flakes Kosher salt 2 cloves garlic, grated 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 3 large tomatoes (2 thinly sliced, 1 grated) 12 no-boil lasagna noodles 8 cups baby spinach (about 5 ounces) 1/3 cup low-fat ricotta cheese 1/3 cup chopped fresh herbs (basil, mint and/or parsley) Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium. Combine the mozzarella, parmesan, red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and all but 1/4 teaspoon garlic in a bowl; drizzle with olive oil and toss. Season the sliced tomatoes with salt. Lay out 4 double-layer sheets of nonstick foil. Drizzle each with olive oil, top with 1 noodle and sprinkle each noodle with 1 tablespoon water. Divide half each of the spinach, sliced tomatoes and mozzarella mixture among the noodles. Repeat to make another layer of noodles, water, spinach, tomatoes and mozzarella mixture. Finish each stack with a noodle, 1 tablespoon water and a drizzle of olive oil. Bring the foil together and crimp tightly closed to make 4 flat packets. Grill the packets, covered, until tender, about 10 minutes per side. Let rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the grated tomatoes, a pinch of salt, the reserved 1/4 teaspoon garlic and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl. Open the packets and cut the lasagna in half, if desired. Top with the tomato mixture, ricotta and herbs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 28132,&quot;Fried Organic Chicken Tamales with Red cl and Cotija 6 whole chicken legs (drumstick and thigh connected) Salt and pepper<br> 2 pounds masa 1 pound duck fat, melted<br> Salt and pepper 12 tomatillos 10 cloves garlic<br> 4 jalapenos<br> 1 bunch fresh cilantro<br> 1 onion, quartered<br> 3 tablespoons ground coriander<br> 3 tablespoons ground cumin<br> Salt and pepper<br> Red cl Sauce, recipe follows Duck fat, for frying<br> Cotija, finely grated<br> 3 pounds dried red chiles 10 garlic cloves<br> 1 onion, quartered<br> 3 tablespoons ground coriander<br> 3 tablespoons ground cumin<br> Salt and pepper<br> Instructions: For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
