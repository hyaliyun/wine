In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until browned and the fat is rendered, about 10 minutes, breaking up the chunks of sausage with the back of a wooden spoon. Remove the sausage to a bowl and set aside. Add 2 cups of the milk and 2 cups water to the skillet and bring to a boil. Whisk in the grits slowly until smooth and no lumps remain. Reduce the heat and continue to cook, whisking, until very thick, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in about half of the grated cheese. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs with the hot sauce and remaining 1 cup milk. Slowly stream the egg mixture into the skillet with the grits while continuously whisking. Fold in the cooked sausage, scallions and jalapeno and season with salt and pepper.

To make the taco pizza, we start with stretching a portion of Pizza dough over a 12-inch pizza pan. Make sure to dust your pan with semolina to keep it from sticking. Stretch the dough slightly larger than the pan to allow yourself an edge to roll your crust. Then apply 1/2 cup of the Salsa and spread evenly. Sprinkle the mozzarella and 1 ounce of the Cheddar-Jack evenly across the salsa. (Keep the cheese within the pan so that you can roll your crust.) Roll the border of un-topped dough into a crust and place in the oven. Spin the pizza frequently to insure even cooking; it should take 5 to 6 minutes to cook. Once the crust is golden brown, gently slide it off the pan and onto the stone to brown the bottom. This should take about 30 seconds to a minute. Remove from the oven and place back on the pizza pan. Cut the pizza into 6 slices. Then top in this order: crushed tortillas, taco beef, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, remaining 1 ounce Cheddar-Jack cheese, jalape?os, cilantro. Start by placing the flour, brown sugar, yeast and salt in a stand mixer and mix for approximately 3 minutes. You then slowly add the water around the edges, then the oil. Mix for 16 to 18 minutes. Once everything is mixed remove the dough, divide into 12-ounce portions, loosely cover and store in the fridge for 48 hours to allow to rise properly. Combine the garlic, jalape?os, bell pepper, white onion, cilantro, water, chili powder, granulated garlic, red pepper flakes, cumin, black pepper, salt and lime juice in a food processor and run until has a slightly chunky consistency. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 38706,&quot;Sonhos de Peixe (Fish Puffs - Goa) 1 pound boneless white fish fillets 3/4 pound white potatoes, peeled 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium onion, minced 6 large garlic cloves, minced 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 2 chili peppers, seeded and chopped 1 teaspoon turmeric 2 teaspoons ground coriander 1 teaspoon garam masala 1 teaspoon chili powder 1/3 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup flour 1 medium egg, beaten 1 cup soft white breadcrumbs Vegetable oil for frying Instructions: Cut fish into small pieces and grind fish and potatoes in a meat grinder on small grind. If grinder is not available use a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Heat the oil over medium heat and fry the onion until soft. Add the garlic, ginger, chilies, turmeric, coriander, garam masala, and chili powder. Stir and cook for 3 minutes. Add the cilantro and salt. Mix well and remove from heat. Place the potato and fish mixture in a large bowl and fold in the onion mixture until well mixed. Cover the mixture and chill overnight. To make patties, use 1/3 cup mixture and shape into round shapes. For croquettes, use 2 tablespoons to form dough into croquettes. Roll cakes or croquettes in flour, then dip in beaten egg and roll in breadcrumbs. Heat oil in deep skillet and fry cakes until golden on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38707,&quot;Cinnamon-Pecan Pancake Breakfast Casserole 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as necessary and for greasing the baking dish 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 6 tablespoons sugar Kosher salt 1 3/4 cups buttermilk 7 large eggs 2 cups half-and-half 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1 cup pure maple syrup, plus more for serving 1/2 cup pecans, roughly chopped Instructions: Butter an 8-inch-square baking dish; set aside. Put 3 tablespoons of the butter in a microwave-safe small bowl or liquid measure; microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute to melt the butter. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, 3 tablespoons of the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, 2 of the eggs and the melted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Melt a little of the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the pan. Working in batches, pour the batter by 1/4 cupfuls into the skillet and cook until the bottoms are golden brown and small bubbles appear on the tops, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other sides, about 2 minutes. If the pancakes brown too quickly, reduce the heat to medium-low. Transfer the pancakes to a plate as finished. Repeat until all the batter is used, adding more butter to the skillet as necessary. (You should have at least 12 pancakes.) Whisk together the half-and-half, vanilla, the remaining 5 eggs, the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Shingle the pancakes in the prepared baking dish. Pour the egg mixture evenly over the pancakes. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours up to overnight to allow the pancakes to soak in the custard. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap from the casserole and bake until the custard is set and the center feels firm but springy, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes before serving. Meanwhile, put the maple syrup and pecans in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook until the syrup has reduced and thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm. Pour the pecan-maple syrup over the casserole. Serve with extra maple syrup on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38708,&quot;Fig Bran Muffins Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup chopped dried figs, plus 3 whole dried figs 1 1/2 cups bran cereal (recommended: All-Bran) 1 cup lowfat milk 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup natural applesauce 1/2 cup honey 1/3 cup canola oil 2 tablespoons unsulfured molasses 1 large egg, beaten Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Fill a large saucepan two-thirds of the way with water. Add the white vinegar and bring to a boil. Holding the tip and stem of each asparagus spear, snap the asparagus where it will naturally break. Discard the ends. Toss the asparagus with about 1 tablespoon olive oil and some salt. Place the asparagus in the oven and roast for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat on the water until the bubbles in the water have subsided. Gently crack and drop the eggs into the water. Cook the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes. When done, the whites will be cooked through and the yolks will be warm but still liquid. Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the eggs from the saucepan and blot the bottom of the spoon on a paper towel before plating the egg. Remove the asparagus from the oven. Divide the roasted asparagus spears on plates and top each set of asparagus with a poached egg. Sprinkle with the grated Parmigiano and a couple flakes crushed red pepper. Sprinkle with a few drops olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 38717,&quot;Roasted Cauliflower Taco 1 head cauliflower (purple, orange, white or green) 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> Generous teaspoon of whole cumin seeds<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 warm, fresh Homemade Corn Tortilla, recipe follows 1 tablespoon crumbled feta cheese<br> Drizzle of plain Greek yogurt mixed with chipotles in adobo<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint<br> Micro-greens, for garnish<br> 2 cups masa Pinch kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 cups water<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Cut the cauliflower into bite-size florets, but for this vegetable, no need to make them all even in size. The smaller ones get more blistery, the bigger ones retain more texture. Put the florets in a bowl and toss with the olive oil, cumin seeds and salt. Generously coat, no need to skimp on flavor! Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, turning once, until the cauliflower is tender and it&#39;s edges are golden brown. To serve, fill a tortilla with approximately 1/3 cup of the roasted cauliflower. Top with crumbled feta, a drizzle of Greek yogurt mixed with chipotles in adobo and a sprinkle of chopped mint. Garnish with a small handful of micro-greens. Reserve the remaining ingredients for additional tacos. In a large bowl, combine the masa, salt and olive oil. Whilst mixing by hand, slowly pour in the water in a thin stream, adding only enough water to bring the dough together. It should be neither too dry nor too sticky. Roll the dough into 2-inch balls and cover with a damp towel until ready to press. Place a ball of dough in between 2 sheets of wax paper or use a sandwich-size freezer bag (with scissors, evenly cut the closure edge and the 2 side edges, so that the bag is only attached on one edge) and place in a tortilla press. Press the dough into a flat, round tortilla. Keep the tortillas covered with a damp towel until ready to cook. When ready to cook, heat a cast-iron skillet to high heat. Cook the tortillas in the dry pan for 30 seconds per side until golden and even browned or blackened in places. Put your hot tortillas in a basket wrapped in a kitchen towel to keep them warm and tender. Corn tortillas can be made 2 hours in advance, wrapped and reheated in a 350 degree F oven for about 12 minutes or in the microwave for 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 38718,&quot;Ginger Sea Bass over Wilted Greens 6 cups fresh baby spinach leaves 4 (5-ounce) sea bass fillets 4 teaspoons peeled and minced fresh ginger 2 teaspoons minced garlic 1/2 cup dry Marsala wine 8 teaspoons soy sauce 2 teaspoons sesame oil 1 lime, quartered 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves Instructions: Cut 4 (12-inch-square pieces) of aluminum foil. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Working with 1 foil sheet at a time, place the foil sheets on the work surface. Place 1 1/2 cups of spinach in the center of each foil sheet. Top with a sea bass fillet. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic, then drizzle 2 tablespoons of Marsala, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil over the fish and spinach. Gather the foil sheets over the fish. Fold in the foil edges and pinch tightly to seal. Place the foil packages on a heavy large baking sheet. Bake until the spinach wilts and the fish is just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer the packages to wide shallow bowls. Cool 5 minutes. Open package and fold down to reveal fish, being careful of hot steam. Squeeze the lime juice over the fish. Sprinkle the basil over and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38719,&quot;Churrasco Steak with Chimichurri 1/3 cup grapeseed oil 15 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 1 cup thinly sliced onions 2 teaspoons dried oregano<br> 1 cup orange juice<br> One 2-pound skirt steak, cut into four 8-ounce steaks 8 cloves garlic, minced 3 limes, zested and juiced 1 1/2 cups chopped fresh cilantro 1 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/3 cup chopped fresh oregano 1/3 cup red wine vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons cl flakes<br> 1/3 cup olive oil<br> Kosher salt and black pepper 1 tablespoon butter<br> Juice of 1/2 lime<br> 4 cups cooked white rice, for serving Instructions: For the marinade: In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the grapeseed oil, garlic, onions, oregano and orange juice. Add the steaks and marinate for 24 hours in the refrigerator to flavor and tenderize the meat. For the chimichurri: In a bowl, combine the garlic, lime zest and juice, cilantro, parsley, oregano, vinegar, cl flakes, olive oil and some salt and pepper.

Cover with water, bring to a boil and then reduce the heat and simmer for 6 hours, skimming off scum. Strain and reserve the chicken and stock, discarding the veggies and aromatics. Using tongs, pick the meat from the chicken and reserve. (An alternative to making the chicken stock from scratch is to use 1 quart prepared chicken stock and a rotisserie chicken.) Measure out 1 cup of the stock and put it in an 8-by-8-by-2-inch baking dish. Add the gelatin and allow it to bloom for 5 minutes. Measure out 3 more cups of stock and bring to a simmer in a saucepan. Add this to the baking dish and whisk gently to dissolve the gelatin. Add the pulled chicken meat, Parmesan, garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, red pepper flakes and eggs to the broth and gelatin mixture. Arrange the eggs, parsley and pepper flakes in a pretty fashion. Chill at least 8 hours, or overnight. Also chill a rimmed baking sheet slightly larger than the baking dish. Turn out the aspic by submerging the baking dish in warm water, placing the chilled baking sheet on top and inverting. Use a pizza cutter to cut the aspic into pretty 2-by-2-inch cubes. Refrigerate until ready to use. For the grilled croutons and romaine: Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat until very hot. Slice the baguette thinly on the bias. You will need eight 1/8-inch-thick slices. Reserve the remaining baguette for another use. Put the bread slices in a large bowl and toss with a few drizzles of olive oil, a few sprinkles of grated Parmesan and the minced garlic. Set aside. Rub the romaine pieces with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the romaine for about 4 minutes on each side; the outside should be wilted and charred, the inside steamed but crisp. Grill the bread slices until toasted on each side. Transfer the romaine and croutons to a large plate or cutting board and re-season with a little olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and salt and pepper. Using tongs and a knife, slice the romaine.

Preheat the grill. Debone the rabbit into separate breasts and legs, reserving the fat. Set aside the bones, meat, meat scraps, and fat in 3 separate piles. In a small pot, combine the bones, celery, carrot, onion, rosemary, and thyme. Cover with water and bring to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes to make the rabbit jus. Strain and set aside. In a food processor, combine the meat scraps, heavy cream, and egg whites to make a mousse for the quenelles. Slightly crush the pistachios and fold into the quenelle mixture. Form the quenelles with two teaspoons. Grill the liver, kidneys, and fat. Cook the legs separately in the oven for 20 minutes. Saute the rest of the rabbit in a heavy skillet. Remove and set aside. Add the quenelles to the same pan and cook. Remove the rabbit quenelles and set aside and add the bacon and cook until crisp. Once the bacon is crisp, remove from the pan, and cut into small pieces to make bacon chips. Set all aside and keep warm. Mashed potatoes: In a small pot over low heat, combine the olive oil and vegetable broth. Add the steamed potatoes, and whisk until smooth. Add the salt and pepper, and the rosemary-infused olive oil. Parsley Foam: Blanch the garlic cloves by boiling them in water 3 times for 20 seconds each time. Bring the milk to a boil in a separate pot. Dry the garlic cloves and add them to the boiling milk and cook until very tender and smooth. Blanch the parsley in boiling water and put it in the food processor to obtain a liquid juice. Add the garlic and make a puree. Add the gelatin. Strain the mixture and allow to cool. Balsamic vinegar film: Heat the vinegar in a small saucepan, and add the agar-agar. When the mixture is smooth, pour it on a cookie sheet, and let cool. Cut into pieces. To serve the rabbit, make a quenelle of mashed potatoes out of tablespoons and place on plate. Place all the rabbit parts and the rabbit quenelle in different positions on the plate. Add the bacon chips, the foam, and the vinegar film to give volume to the dish. Finish with rabbit juice, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barolo, Riesling]</li></ol><p>&quot; 38750,&quot;Classic Meatballs 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 10 cloves garlic (8 thinly sliced, 2 finely grated) 3 28-ounce cans whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 2 pounds ground beef 1 cup grated parmesan cheese 1/2 cup breadcrumbs 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley 1/2 cup milk 2 large eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Season fleshy side of the brisket with kosher salt. Sear the fleshy side of brisket on the grill, close to the coals for about 10 to 15 minutes. Flip the brisket and lightly sear the fatty side until a red-orange crust is formed. Raise the brisket to a higher level of the grill and continue to cook over indirect heat until fork tender. Transfer the brisket to a cutting board. Separate the flat and the point with a sharp butchers knife. Remove the point while still hot and put the point and the flat back on the grill, taking care not to scorch the meat. Continue cooking until most of the fat has rendered or liquefied, about 15 minutes. Remove it from the grill and trim off the fat and any burned portions. The grain in the point runs in several different directions so care needs to be taken when slicing. Slice the meat on an angle, between 3/8 to 1/2-inch thick, until the entire point is sliced. Begin chopping those slices at a 90 degree angle to attain the desired size chunks of the points. Put the chunks into a pan and add about 6 ounces of Woodyard Original Sauce, per pound of meat, then put the pan back on grill. Leave uncovered to allow it to smoke until a glaze is formed on the surface. Remove the pan from the grill and allow meat to rest and set, about 20 to 30 minutes. Ready to add to the Three Bean Chili. Put the beef into a large roasting pan and put it on the smoker. Smoke the meat until a firm crust forms, roughly 40 minutes. Remove it from the grill and add it to your favorite skillet over medium heat to begin browning. In another large skillet over medium heat add the diced onions. Add the chili powder, cumin, cayenne and paprika. Cook until the mixture is well blended, then add the smoked ground beef. Brown the mixture until fully cooked. Add the black beans, red beans and red kidney beans with diced tomatoes and crushed tomatoes to a large stock pot and mix well. Add the ground beef mixture and stir until combined. Cover and simmer for roughly 1 hour. Ready to serve up! Serve the chili as a base with the desired amount of burnt ends on top and add your favorite fixin&#39;s, such as corn chips, sour cream, jalapenos, red onions and/or shredded cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 38764,&quot;Grilled New York Strip Steak with Beer and Molasses Steak Sauce 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 medium onion, finely diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 cups ketchup 1/2 cup molasses 1/2 cup apple cider 1/4 cup sugar 3/4 cup lager-style beer 1 tablespoon yellow mustard 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon paprika 3 (1 pound each and 1/2-inch thick) prime-aged New York Strip Steaks Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Instructions: For the sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.

Add 2 egg whites and process until smooth. Cook&#39;s Note: the texture will be similar to almond paste. Add the food coloring and continue processing until the color is all blended in. You can add a few more drops just until you get the color you want. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and put aside. In a stockpot, bring the water and sugar to a boil and cook for about 15 minutes, until reduced by 1/2 and syrup is coating the back of a spoon when dropped in cold water or until a candy thermometer reads 230 degrees F. Using a stand or hand mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Slowly add 1/2 of the hot syrup and continue beating until firm peaks form and the meringue has cooled. With a spatula, gently fold in 1/4 of the meringue into the almond mixture. Continue folding the meringue until completely incorporated. The mixture will be shiny and smooth. Fit a piping bag with a 3/8-inch/1 cm round tip. Pipe the batter onto the baking sheets. Tap the underside of the baking sheet to remove air bubbles. Let dry at room temperature for 1 hour to allow skins to form. For the butter cream: Bring the water and sugar to a boil and cook it until it reaches 242 degrees F on a candy thermometer, approximately 4 minutes. Using a stand or hand mixer, pour in egg yolks and crack in one extra egg. While beating, gradually pour the remaining hot syrup on the egg yolks. Beat until cooled, light and fluffy, approximately 10 minutes. Add the butter and continue beating until smooth. Add the vanilla. Put aside. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Bake the macarons for 20 minutes. Rotate the baking sheet after 10 minutes for even baking. Remove the macarons from the oven and transfer parchment to a cooling rack. Pair the macarons of similar size, and pipe about 1/2 teaspoon filling onto one of the macarons. Top with the other macaron to sandwich the filling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 38766,&quot;Fried Chicken 6 cups all-purpose flour 5 tablespoons salt 4 tablespoons ground black pepper 2 tablespoons garlic powder 2 whole free-range, organic chickens Vegetable oil of choice, for frying the chicken 1 tablespoon onion powder 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 2 cups buttermilk Instructions: Cut the whole chickens into 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 legs and 4 wings and set aside. Preheat your oil, in either a heavy pan on the stove or a deep-fryer, to 325 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne pepper until thoroughly mixed. Set aside. Pour the buttermilk into another bowl large enough for the chicken to be immersed in the buttermilk. Prepare your dredging station. Place your chicken in a bowl. Next to that, your bowl of buttermilk, and next to that, your dry mixture. Take your breasts, lightly dust them with your flour mixture, then dip them in the buttermilk until they are coated, and then place them in the flour mixture. Take the breasts that are in the flour mixture and aggressively push the flour mixture into the wet chicken. Make sure that the chicken in very thoroughly coated, or you will not achieve the crust and crunch you are looking for. Gently place the breasts in your hot oil. Next, repeat the dredging steps with your other pieces of chicken in this order: thigh, leg then wing. When you place the last wing into the fryer, you should have 16 pieces of chicken in the oil. Set a timer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, take a probe thermometer and check the temperature of a breast. If it reads 180 degrees F, all of your chicken is done. (Keep in mind that it will continue to cook after it has been removed from the fryer.) Remove the chicken from the oil and let it drain for 5 minutes. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 38767,&quot;All-American Double Patty Cheeseburgers with Nancy&#39;s Special Sauce 1 tablespoon butter 2 potato burger buns 1/2 pound ground beef Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil, for the skillet 4 slices deli-style yellow American cheese Nancy&#39;s Special Sauce, recipe follows 2 thin slices red onion 8 pickle chips 2 slices beefsteak tomato 1 large leaf iceberg lettuce, torn in half 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 tablespoon ketchup 1 teaspoon yellow mustard 1 teaspoon pickle relish 1 teaspoon Sriracha 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar Instructions: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter. When it foams, add the bread, cut-side down, and toast until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer the bread to a platter. Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper and mix it in, using your hands. Shape the ground beef into four patties. Flatten the patties between sheets of wax paper to a 3/8-inch thickness. (The patties will be 1 1/2 times larger than your palms; it&#39;s ok if the edges look ragged, since the burgers shrink up a bit while cooking.) Wipe the skillet lightly with vegetable oil using a paper towel. Add the patties to the skillet and cook on the first side for 3 minutes. Flip, season again, and cook for 2 minutes. Top each patty with a slice of American cheese and cook 1 minute more. Smear the toasted buns on both sides with some of Nancy&#39;s Special Sauce.

Let sit at least 1 hour to marinate. Preheat the grill. Grill the vegetables over hot coals (or cook in a hot dry skillet) until tender, turning occasionally to avoid charring. To assemble, warm the tortillas briefly on the grill to render them pliable, and spread them out on a counter. Divide the vegetables and place in a strip down the center of each tortilla. Top with the Avocado Corn Relish and drizzle with some of the Tomatillo Salsa (being careful not to over sauce, or the burritos will be soggy). Fold the bottom quarter of each tortilla up and then roll from the side into a cylinder. Serve immediately, with the remaining salsa on the side. Place the flour, salt and shortening in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer. Beat with the paddle until crumbly, 3 to 5 minutes. With the mixer running, gradually add the warm water and continue mixing until the dough is smooth, about 3 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each into a ball and place on a baking tray or board. Cover with a towel and let rest at room temperature at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour. Cut out eight 12-inch squares of waxed or parchment paper for stacking the tortillas. On a lightly floured board, roll each ball into a 10-inch circle, and transfer to a paper square. Stack on a baking tray or platter and refrigerate until cooking time. Uncooked tortillas can be kept in the refrigerator, well wrapped with paper squares between the layers, up to 2 days. To cook, heat a dry griddle or 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat. Carefully peel off the paper and cook the tortillas, one at a time, until puffy and slightly brown, 30 to 45 seconds per side. Set aside to cool slightly on a towel-lined platter. Bring to the table wrapped in a towel for warmth, or wrap well and refrigerate or freeze for quesadillas or other dishes. Yield: 8 large tortillas Method for Tomatillo Sauce (Green Salsa): In blender place tomatillos, jalapenos and water. Puree until just chunky. Add remaining ingredients and puree about 2 minutes more, or until no large chunks remain. This salsa keeps in the refrigerator, in a covered container, about 3 days. Heat 1/2 cup of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute the corn with the salt and pepper, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside to cool. Cut the avocados, bell pepper and roasted poblanos into 1/4-inch dice. Add to the Sauteed corn along with the scallions, red wine vinegar and the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Mix well and let sit 20 to 30 minutes to blend the flavors. Serve at room temperature. Corn relish can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator up to a day. To make 2 to 3 days in advance, mix all the ingredients except the avocado and store in the refrigerator. Add the avocado shortly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 38812,&quot;Fresh Langoustines (or Shrimp) Tossed with Blood Oranges in Green Leek Sauce 1 cup of chopped green leeks (packed tightly) 2 ounces shrimp stock 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cold cubed butter 1 ounce ice cubes 6 large blood oranges 30 fresh Langoustines or Shrimp, medium to large size 1 ounce extra virgin olive oil Sturdy toothpicks (if using shrimp) Instructions: In a medium saucepan bring the shrimp stock to a boil.

Stir in the cheese, beef and pork. Using 1 1/2 teaspoons for each, shape the meat mixture into 1-inch-diameter meatballs. Place on a baking sheet. To make the soup: Bring the broth to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and curly endive and simmer until the meatballs are cooked through and the curly endive is tender, about 8 minutes. Whisk the eggs and cheese in a medium bowl to blend. Stir the soup in a circular motion. Gradually drizzle the egg mixture into the moving broth, stirring gently with a fork to form thin stands of egg, about 1 minute. Season the soup to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve.

Put the hazelnuts on a small baking sheet and toast in the oven until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool. Transfer the hazelnuts to a cup and line the baking sheet with wax paper. Meanwhile, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, rice cereal and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped, about 20 times. Add the chocolate-hazelnut spread and melted butter. Pulse until the mixture comes together in clumps, about 15 times; the mixture should be dry to the touch but hold together when pressed. Roll the mixture into teaspoon-size balls and place on the prepared baking sheet. Press a hazelnut into each ball and then press the dough back into a ball shape, leaving part of the hazelnut exposed at the top. Freeze the balls at least 20 minutes to let them firm up. Put the chocolate chips, shortening and a pinch of salt in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until the chips on the bottom start to melt, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Stir until the mixture is melted and smooth. Gently stick a toothpick into the upper half of a ball, avoiding the hazelnut, and dip into the melted chocolate, leaving the top half uncoated. Allow the excess chocolate to drip off and return the ball to the baking sheet. Smooth over the hole from the toothpick with your fingertip. Repeat with the rest of the balls. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes. You can store the balls covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 38835,&quot;Blueberry Croissant Bread Pudding 2 extra large croissants 1/2 cup Smucker&#39;s?

Clean and trim the asparagus by breaking off 1 asparagus end at its natural breaking point and lining up the tip end next to the remaining stalks. Trim them to the broken asparagus&#39; length. Compost the woody ends. Lay the asparagus out on a rimmed sheet pan. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place them in the preheated oven and cook for 15 minutes or until tips are browned and starting to crisp. In a small cup, crack each egg. Add each egg to a mixing bowl, stir in the milk, and season with salt and pepper. Beat the egg mixture with a whisk, in a figure 8 pattern until the ingredients are completely blended together.

Add the garlic and cook, stirring for about 3 minutes, or until the aroma is released. Add the flaked cod and stir vigorously for about 1 minute, until it is well broken up. Add the mashed potato and cream and continue stirring energetically. Stir in the lemon juice and the pepper (taste for salt but, since the cod is salty to begin with, it will probably not need any more). Work the mixture until it a very fluffy consistency. Keep the brandade warm in the top of a double boiler, covered, over slightly simmering water while you make the blinis. To make the blinis: In a medium saucepan full of boiling water, cook the corn for 2 minutes. Drain well and dry on paper towels. In a large heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring, until it is softened and slightly golden. Add the corn, cover and cook for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the corn is tender. Add the cream and bring to the boil. Cook until the mixture is almost dry, about 5 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a blender and puree until very smooth, scraping down the sides of the container as necessary. Press the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on the solids to extract all the flavor and juices. Discard the solids. In the clean blender, combine the egg, egg yolk, salt, white pepper, and flour. Blend until smooth, add the milk and the corn puree and blend again. Transfer the batter to a large measuring cup and stir in the parsley. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil over medium heat until very hot. Make the blini by pouring about 2 tablespoons of batter into the pan for each one, and cook for about 1 minute on each side (they should each be 4 inches in diameter; you will probably only be able to fit 2 in the pan each time). Transfer the blini to a plate in a warm oven as they are done and continue making blini, adding a teaspoon of oil to the pan for each batch, until you have used all the batter. Place one or two blini on each of 6 warm plates and place a large dollop of brandade on one side of each. Fold over the other side to cover. Drizzle the crepes with some of the crema and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38842,&quot;Peach Horchata 8 cups water 1 cup white rice 1 cinnamon stick 1 peach, pitted and quartered (use frozen if fresh unavailable) 3/4 cup sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Ground cinnamon, for garnish Instructions: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine 6 cups water, rice, cinnamon, peach slices, sugar, and vanilla.

Make sure to remove only the orange peel, leaving behind as much white pith as possible. Cut each sprig of rosemary into 4-inch pieces. Remove the leaves from the bottom 1/2 inch of the rosemary sprigs, exposing the stems. Roll up each strip of orange peel from one end to the other, peel-side out, to resemble a rose. Pierce the exposed end of the rosemary sprig through the rolled orange peel, ensuring the rosemary holds together both ends of the orange rose. Divide the champagne among 8 flutes (about 4 ounces per glass). Top each with a splash of Campari (about 1/4 ounce). Drop a rosemary orange garnish into each flute. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 38858,&quot;Fondue Bourguignonne 4 cups vegetable oil, or mix of vegetable and olive oils 8 ounces beef tenderloin, cut into small cubes or strips<br> 8 ounces chicken breast, boneless and skinless, cut into small cubes or strips 1 tablespoon olive oil Salt and pepper 3/4 cup ground pork 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon minced shallots 1 egg yolk 1 teaspoon mustard 4 small red-skinned potatoes, quartered and cooked until tender 1/2 cup each of 3 sauces (such as Aioli, barbecue sauce, Bearnaise and/or horseradish cream) Instructions: Heat oil in a fondue pot or 2-quart saucepan until very hot (375 degrees).

Butter a 9 by 9-inch baking dish and line it with plastic wrap going up the walls of the pan. Cut up the croissants into 1-inch cubes and place them on a sheet pan. Place in oven and toast for 10 to 15 minutes until slightly crisp, then place them in a bowl. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, heat the half-and-half, cream, salt, and vanilla bean over medium heat, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat. Set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar together. Whisking constantly, gradually add the hot cream mixture. Strain over the croissant cubes to remove the vanilla bean, and let soak 15 minutes, gently turning the cubes over once. Empty the mixture into the baking dish. Let soak another 30 minutes, or overnight, in the refrigerator. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the baking dish in a hot water bath. Bake until just set and very light golden brown on top, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool, then chill in the refrigerator 4 hours or overnight. The next day, turn out the pudding and cut round 3-inch plugs from the pudding, place them on a microwave-proof pan and cover with plastic wrap. To serve, warm maple syrup in a saucepan and keep warm. Warm the plugs of bread pudding in the microwave and serve topped with hot maple syrup.

Add the dry tofu and red pepper and toss gently with a rubber spatula to coat evenly. Let marinate 30 minutes or up to 8 hours. Refrigerate if longer than 1 hour. Prepare the grill or preheat the oven to 450 degrees. To make the sauce, place all the sauce ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth. Pour into a decorative serving bowl. Remove about 1/3 cup of the sauce and drizzle it over the tofu. Use the rubber spatula to toss the tofu gently with the sauce. If you are grilling the satay, thread the tofu and red peppers on skewers. (Bamboo skewers must be soaked for 30 minutes.) If you are roasting the tofu in the oven, place it in 1 layer in a large, shallow baking dish such as a 9 x 13-inch lasagna pan. Use 2 pans if one pan isn&#39;t large enough. Cook the tofu on the hot grill at least 20 minutes, turning it occasionally, or roast in the oven for 25 minutes. The tofu is done when it is a deep golden brown. Let the tofu cool to room temperature before serving. Serve alongside a bowl of sauce for dipping. Tip: Canned coconut milk sometimes separates so that there is a thick, pasty mass at the top of the can and thin liquid on the bottom. Also, if the can has been kept in a cool cupboard, the milk will appear solid rather than liquid. In either case, stir the coconut milk before measuring it. Once heated, the coconut milk will thin out. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 38867,&quot;Almond and Lemon Biscotti Dipped in White Chocolate 2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup cornmeal 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup sugar 3 large eggs 3 tablespoons grated lemon zest (from about 3 to 4 lemons) 3/4 cup coarsely chopped whole almonds 18 ounces white chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. In another large bowl, beat the sugar and eggs with an electric mixture until pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Mix in the lemon zest and then the flour mixture, and beat until just blended. (The dough will be sticky). Stir in the almonds. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Divide the dough evenly into 2 equal mounds and place on the prepared baking sheet. With moist hands, space the dough evenly apart and form into 2 (9 by-3-inch) logs. Bake for 35 minutes until lightly browned. Cool for 5 minutes. Using a serrated knife, cut the logs crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick diagonal slices. Arrange the biscotti cut side down on the same baking sheet. Bake until the cookies are pale golden, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely. Place the chocolate chips in a medium bowl. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the pan does not touch the water. Stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Dip the end of each biscotti in the chocolate. Transfer the dipped biscotti to a wire rack, set over a baking sheet, until the chocolate has hardened.

Place the clams on a sheet tray and put them in the preheated oven for 2 to 3 minutes or until the clams just begin to open. We don&#39;t want to cook the clams, we just want them to open a little. Using a butter knife pry the clams open and remove the top shell and discard. Completely pull the clam away from the bottom shell and place it back in the bottom shell. This will allow for easy eating. Preheat the broiler and adjust the rack to the top shelf. In a bowl, combine the bread crumbs, garlic, parsley, oregano, crushed red pepper and some salt. Add the olive oil and stir until well combined. Add chicken stock until the mixture is quite wet. Taste to check the seasoning, add more salt if needed.

From each branch, remove most of the rosemary leaves, leaving 1 1/2 to 2 inches of 1 end covered in leaves. Place a bread slice on the work surface, and put a piece of mozzarella on it, followed by a fresh bay leaf, optional. Repeat 1 more time, ending with a slice of bread. You should have a stack that has 3 slices of bread and 2 slices of cheese. Continue with the remaining ingredients, to make 4 stacks total. (If you can&#39;t find large rosemary branches, substitute wooden skewers. Soak the wooden skewers in cold water for 20 minutes. As you&#39;re assembling, put a few sprigs of fresh rosemary throughout.) Using the leafless end of a rosemary sprig, skewer 1 of the stacks through the center, leaving the rosemary leaves exposed on the other end. Turn the stack on its side and, entering from the opposite end, insert another rosemary sprig, leaving the leaves sticking out of the other end. Brush the entire skewer lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle it with a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue in the same manner with the remaining stacks. To grill: Place the skewers on the hottest part of a charcoal or gas grill and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, turning frequently, until the cheese just begins to soften and the bread begins to brown. To bake: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the skewers on a baking sheet and cook about 5 minutes. Carefully transfer the skewers to a plate and drizzle with a generous amount of the bagna cauda. Scatter with parsley leaves. Using a mortar and pestle, pulverize the garlic and anchovies into a smooth paste. Transfer the paste to a small saucepan. Add the butter and olive oil and bring to a simmer over low heat. Continue simmering for about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lemon zest and lemon juice. Season with salt, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 38876,&quot;Tomato Tart Tatin with Thyme Whipped Goat Cheese 1 cup goat cheese 3 tablespoons heavy cream 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 pints cherry tomatoes, halved 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 4 teaspoons sugar 8 sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped 8 ounces frozen puff pastry, defrosted Instructions: For the goat cheese: Using a food processor, add the goat cheese, cream and thyme leaves and pulse until smooth.

Remove and discard the orange halves, thyme bundle and bay leaves and puree the soup with an immersion blender or a blender. If using a blender, cool the mixture for about 5 minutes and carefully add it to the blender. It should be very smooth and velvety. Check the consistency. If it is too thick add water to thin it. In a saucepan heat about 1-inch of the oil over medium heat. Slice the shallots into thin rings. Just before frying, toss the shallots in the flour. Fry the shallots until they are crispy and brown. Remove to a paper towel and sprinkle immediately with salt. Whip the cream in a large bowl until it holds its shape in soft peaks, then whip in the cinnamon. Ladle the soup into serving bowls and top with a dollop of the cinnamon whipped cream and fried shallots.

Increase the heat, bring to a full boil and boil for 5 to 6 minutes; be careful to not let it boil over. Remove from the heat, add the vanilla and stir in the nuts. Let cool to room temperature, then chill overnight. This will help thicken up the caramel.<br> For the cinnamon filling: Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and cayenne if using. Set aside.<br> For the cookies: Unfold each piece of puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Roll the pastry ever so slightly to 10-by-10 inches. Brush off any excess flour from each side.<br> Divide the cinnamon sugar filling between the two squares of dough, spreading it to three of the edges and leaving 1/4 inch at the top edge (for sealing the dough). Lightly roll over the sugar to ensure an even layer. Begin rolling up the pastry from the edge closest to you, toward the top of the dough. Make sure the roll is very tight, especially the first part-it needs to be compact. Paint the top edge with the egg white to seal the roll. Once sealed, gently roll the log to make it perfectly round. The diameter should be 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches. Freeze the rolls until firm, 1 hour or overnight. (Properly wrapped, the rolls can be kept frozen for 2 to 3 weeks.)<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. You&#39;ll need three sheet pans lined with parchment and a cooling rack that fits the pan. Remove both logs (or bake only one) from the freezer. Cut each log into 1/2-inch disks. You should get 20 to 21 slices from each roll. Arrange the slices on the prepared sheet pans spaced 2 inches apart (they will spread). Lay a sheet of parchment over the cookies and place the cooling rack (feet side up) on top. We want the contact to force the cookies to bake flat; we&#39;re denying the puff pastry to puff.<br> Bake one sheet pan of cookies at a time (keep the other sheet pans in the refrigerator until baking). Check after 10 minutes: The cookies should be beginning to evenly brown on the tops and bottoms. Rotate the pan and continue to bake until golden brown, another 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully lift off the rack and the parchment. Let cool before removing the cookies from the pan. Continue baking the remaining cookies. Trim the sugar from around the edges.<br> Once the cookies are cool, arrange them on a cooling rack with a parchment-lined sheet pan underneath to catch drips. Remove the pecan topping from the refrigerator and stir until well incorporated. Place 1 small spoonful of the pecan topping on top of each cookie. These are best eaten right away. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 38904,&quot;Grilled Leg of Lamb with Rosemary, Roasted Pears, and Black Pepper Polenta 1 head garlic, cloves removed and peeled 2 fresh rosemary sprigs, needles stripped from stem, plus 8 sprigs Extra-virgin olive oil Salt and fresh ground black pepper 5 to 7 pound leg of lamb, boned butterflied and surface fat removed Salt and pepper 8 red-skinned pears 4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 8 fresh rosemary sprigs Black Pepper Polenta, recipe follows 2 quarts chicken stock 1 teaspoon salt 2 cups polenta or yellow cornmeal 1/3 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a blender, combine the garlic, rosemary, and 3/4 cup of oil; season with salt and pepper. Puree until everything comes together to form a paste; set aside for a few minutes to let the flavors marry. Lay the lamb out flat, open like a book. Score the surface lightly with a paring knife. Rub the lamb with the garlic paste, being sure to get in the incisions. Roll up the lamb and tie with butcher&#39;s twine to hold the roast together. Prepare an outdoor gas or charcoal grill. Season the lamb generously with salt and pepper, and then place it on the hot grill (put it on the top rack if you are using a gas grill). Sear the outside of the meat, turning, until brown all around, but do not char. Close the grill cover and roast for 30 minutes. The lamb is done when the center is still pink and the internal temperature reads 135 degrees F. Allow the lamb to stand 10 minutes to let the juices settle before cutting off the twine and slicing. To prepare the pears, halve the pears lengthwise and cut out the cores. Place the pears face down on a baking pan. Drizzle with 4 tablespoons of oil, toss the 8 rosemary sprigs on top, and season with salt and pepper. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the pears are fork tender. To serve, spoon some polenta on the base of the plate and lay a few slices of the lamb on top; drizzle with a little oil and season with salt and pepper. Put a pear on each plate, face up, and drizzle them with balsamic vinegar. Garnish with a rosemary sprig. In a large pot, bring the chicken stock and salt to a boil. Gradually whisk in the cornmeal in a slow steady stream. The liquid will be absorbed and the cornmeal will lock up; don&#39;t freak, just whisk through it. Lower the heat and continue to whisk until the polenta is thick and smooth, about 20 minutes. Add the cream and butter; continue to stir until incorporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, fold in the Parmesan and black pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 38905,&quot;Almond Camo Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> One 8-ounce block cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 3 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup almond flour<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> Gel food coloring in neon green, black, leaf green and dark brown 2 ounces cream cheese, softened 1 teaspoon maple extract<br> 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Line with parchment paper, leaving excess on the long sides of the pan for easy removal of the cake. Add the granulated sugar, butter and cream cheese to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Cream on medium speed until the mixture is smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition, until incorporated. Pour in the almond and vanilla extracts and whip until combined. Sift together the flours, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Add half of the flour mixture and half of the milk to the batter and beat on low speed just until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the remainder of the flour mixture and milk and beat on low speed until the batter is smooth and homogenous. Divide the batter equally among 4 small mixing bowls. Use the gel food coloring to create 4 colors: Light green (3 drops neon green plus 1 drop black); dark green (3 drops leaf green plus 1 drop black); gray (2 drops black); and dark brown (3 drops dark brown). Use small (2-tablespoon) ice cream scoops to drop dollops of the colored batters in random order into the prepared loaf pan. (The dollops should be small to create a camouflage pattern.) Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour 25 minutes. Allow to cool completely before removing from the pan. For the maple cream sauce: Add the cream cheese, maple extract and 2 tablespoons water to a small saucepan over medium heat and let melt until combined (add more water if too thick). Remove from heat, then stir in confectioners&#39; sugar until it has a nice creamy consistency. Drizzle over top of the cake and slice to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 38906,&quot;Panino with Porchetta 10 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 (2-pound) boneless pork shoulder 1 herbed focaccia bread, 12 by 12 inches, cut into 8 even pieces 1/3 cup Dijon mustard 1/3 cup apricot preserves 8 slices provolone cheese, (about 4 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Mix lightly with your fingertips until the dough forms grape-sized pieces. You should be able to see chunks of fat. Stir in the iced water. Lightly knead, handling the dough as little as possible, until the dough forms a ball. Add a little more iced water if necessary. Transfer to a plastic bag and shape into a log. Seal the bag, pressing out any air, and chill for as little as 1 hour or as long as 3 days. The pie dough can be frozen for as long as a week. Butter and flour a 9-inch glass pie plate. On a lightly floured surface roll the dough to a 12-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. Line the pie plate, being sure to press the dough into the bottom and up the sides without stretching. Chill 30 minutes. Roughly chop the apples into small pieces, about the size of lima beans. (The apples should measure about 9 cups chopped.) Combine with the sugar, tapioca, cinnamon, salt and lemon juice in a large bowl. Set aside until the juices begin to run, about 10 - 15 minutes. Beat together the cream and egg to make a glaze and brush over the edges and bottom of the crust. Mound the apple filling in the pie shell. It will be quite full. Roll out the remaining dough to a large round about 1/8&#39;&#39; thick. Place over the filling a seal the edges together by gently pressing together. Trim any excess dough with scissors and flute the edges. Brush the top with the remaining egg glaze. Using a paring knife, cut out and remove a circle the size of a quarter from the center of the top crust.

Process 30 seconds more to knead it. Remove the dough from the processor and let it rest, covered with an inverted bowl, at room temperature for 1 hour. Set the smooth rollers of a pasta machine at the highest number. (The rollers will be wide apart.) Divide the dough into 4 pieces, flatten 1 piece into a rectangle, and cover the remaining pieces with an inverted bowl. Dust the rectangle with flour and feed it through the rollers. Fold the rectangle in half and feed it through the rollers 6-8 more times, folding in half each time and dusting with flour if necessary to keep it from sticking. Turn the dial down one notch and feed the dough through the rollers without folding. Continue to feed the dough through the rollers without folding, turning the dial lower one notch each time, until the lowest notch is reached. Roll the remaining pieces of pasta dough in the same manner. Use the blades of a pasta machine that will cut 1/4-inch wide strips. Feed one end of a sheet of pasta dough through the blades, holding the other end straight up from the machine. Catch the strips from underneath the machine before the sheet goes completely through the rollers and put the cut strips lightly across floured jelly-roll pans or let them hang over the top of straight-backed chairs or on hangars.

Pedro Ximenez sherry or other dessert wine such as tawny Port, Muscat de Beaumes de Venise or Australian dessert Tokay, optional diced mango, fresh berries or other fresh seasonal fruit, optional<br> Instructions: Run a knife around edges of angel cake and turn it out onto a work surface. With a large serrated knife, cut cake horizontally into three equal layers, reserving top layer for another use or slicing it to grill along with panini. Place middle cake layer on a piece of foil large enough to hold it. Peel bananas, leaving them lying in peel for ease of handling and slice thinly on bias. Pick up one banana with both hands, holding slices together, and place on cake, spreading slices to cover half of cake ring. Repeat with other banana so you have a cake ring topped with a ring of bananas. Sprinkle with dessert wine, if using, and top with bottom cake layer. Use foil to cover the outside of a very heavy skillet, such as cast iron or enameled cast iron with a heat-proof handle. This will protect it from soot. Place skillet on grill and allow to heat on medium-high. When it&#39;s hot, add two tablespoons of the butter, spreading it with a spatula to coat skillet as it melts. Using your hands or two spatulas, carefully lift banana-filled panini into skillet. Use spatula to press edges firmly to give panini a uniform edge and re-adhere ragged pieces. Put a second heavy, heat-proof skillet on top of cake and press firmly to compact panini. Close grill and let panini toast on medium to medium-high until golden brown and crisp. Check periodically by lifting the edge with a spatula. Depending on how hot your grill is and how heavy the skillet, the butter can start to burn. With two spatulas, remove panini to foil piece and melt the rest of the butter in skillet, spreading it around with spatula to coat skillet evenly. Turn untoasted side of panini into skillet and return heavy skillet to the top, pressing again to compact. Toast until crisp and golden and bananas are soft - about another 10 minutes. Remove panini to a serving plate and serve in slices or on a bed of fresh seasonal fruit, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 38916,&quot;Crostini with Tuna Tapenade 10 to 12 ounces canned or jarred Italian tuna packed in olive oil 2 teaspoons anchovy paste 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus extra for garnish 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 2 teaspoons minced garlic (2 cloves) 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 3 tablespoons good olive oil, plus extra for brushing bread 1/3 cup Italian mascarpone cheese 1/4 cup pitted and chopped kalamata olives 1 tablespoon drained capers 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 36 slices French bread, cut diagonally Instructions: Drain all but a tablespoon of olive oil from the tuna and then flake the fish into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.

Heat oil over medium heat in a saute pan, dust the veal cutlets with flour and shake off any excess. Sear the veal on both sides quickly, just to brown coating. Be careful not to overcook veal. Remove cutlets to a baking sheet and allow to cool. (You want the cooking process to stop.) To the same pan add the butter and garlic, allowing butter to melt and sizzle for a short while. Deglaze the pan with the white wine, then add the demi-glace and allow this sauce to reduce by half. Set 1 of the racks in the oven to the topmost level and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Top each of the veal cutlets with some spinach, sage leaves, a slice of prosciutto, and Swiss cheese. Place into the oven on the top rack only long enough to melt cheese and warm. Do not leave in too long. You do not want the veal to cook any further. To finish sauce, remove from heat and whisk in cubed butter. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Spoon sauce onto serving plate and top with veal cutlet. Serve with buttered noodles or steamed julienned vegetables as an accompaniment. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 38922,&quot;Diner-Style Strawberry Shortcake Nonstick vegetable spray, for coating the pans 1 1/2 cups cake flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup milk 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon lemon extract 3 large eggs 1 1/4 cups sugar 2 pints fresh strawberries 1 recipe whipped cream frosting 1 teaspoon gelatin 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees with a rack in the middle of the oven. Lightly coat 2 (9-inch) cake pans with nonstick vegetable spray. Line the bottoms with a circle of baking parchment. Into a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and salt together, 3 times. In a small saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a boil. Remove from the heat and add the vanilla and lemon extracts. In separate mixing bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until pale yellow, and fluffy, and doubled in volume. While still beating, drizzle in the hot milk mixture. Fold in the flour mixture. Spread the batter in the prepared pans and bake for 15 minutes, or until golden, the center springs back when lightly pressed, and a cake tester comes out clean. Set the pans on a rack to cool. Run the tip of a knife around the edges of the cakes to loosen them, and turn them out of the pans. Whipped Cream Frosting: In a medium bowl, mix together the gelatin and 1/4 cup of the cream. Let rest for 5 minutes to soften, then place the bowl over barely simmering water until the gelatin has completely dissolved. Remove the bowl from the heat and let cool to tepid. In the meantime, in a mixing bowl, whip the cream until slightly thickened. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla and whip to the consistency of shaving cream. Fold 1/2 cup of the whipped cream into the gelatin mixture, then fold in the rest. Wash and dry the strawberries. Pick out the 12 best. Stem and slice the rest. Lay the sliced berries over 1 cake, then spread a 1/2-inch layer of whipped cream on top. Place the second cake over the first. Frost the entire cake with the remaining whipped cream.

Cover and bring to simmer over medium heat. Uncover, raise heat and stir occasionally. Cook only a few minutes or until about three-fourths of the berries are burst, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Press mixture through a medium-fine strainer or food mill along with the raspberry preserves. Discard tough dry pulp and raspberry seeds. Cool the puree completely before using. Puree may be made and refrigerated up to 1 week in advance. Assemble and Freeze the Jelly Roll: Reverse the Hot Milk Sponge sheet onto a piece of foil; peel off the parchment. Turn sponge carefully over again (use a cookie sheet to aid you if sponge is delicate) so that brown side faces up. Spread all of Cranberry-Raspberry Puree evenly over sponge. Roll up as tightly as possible to form a 16 by 17-inch long thin jelly roll. Wrap tightly in foil and freeze at least several hours or overnight--or up to 1 month in advance of using. Line the Bombe with Jelly Roll Slices: Remove frozen jelly roll from freezer and unwrap. Trim ragged ends if necessary. Use a sharp serrated knife to cut slices 1/4-inch thick. Line the mold with the slices by placing one slice in the center of the bottom of the mold. Next fit 7 (or more) slices around the center pushing and fitting so that no space is left between the slices. Fit the next 9 (or more) around the bowl starting up the sides.<br> Finish by fitting about 10 slices to completely line the mold , pushing and fitting so that no space is left Trim slices even with the rim of mold if necessary, or just push them so they are flush with the rim. Reserve trimmings and remaining slices and return them to freezer until needed. Set lined mold aside.<br> Fill the Mold: Make the White Chocolate Mousse with Kirsch. Turn it immediately into the lined mold. Level and smooth the surface of the mousse. Remove the remaining slices of jelly roll and trimmings from the freezer. Set aside just enough slices to completely cover the mousse if placed tightly together - But do not put them in place, yet. Dice the remaining slices and any trimmings with a sharp knife. Scatter the diced pieces all over the mousse, and then fit the reserved slices closely together over the scattered dice to form the bottom layer of the dessert Place the corregated cake circle (or a small plate) inside the mold and press firmly to level and compact the bombe. Wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours before unmolding and serving. Bombe may be completed to this point up the 24 hours in advance of serving, or frozen up to 2 months.<br> Unmold, Finish and Serve: Invert the mold and rap the edge sharply on counter to release dessert. Simmer strained apricot preserves in a small saucepan for 2-3 minutes to make a glaze. Use a pastry brush to paint the entire dessert with glaze. Touch bottom edge of bombe with minced pistachios. Refrigerate until serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 38938,&quot;Corn-Mushroom Risotto 5 ounces bacon, diced 3 ears corn, husked 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 medium shallots, chopped 1 1/4 cups arborio rice 1 cup dry white wine 1/2 to 3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives Instructions: Cook the bacon in large saucepan until crisp.

Place the prunes in a small saucepan. Cover them with water. Bring to a low boil and cook until soft and mashable, about 8 minutes. Drain the water and mash the prunes on a plate. It&#39;s okay to leave little chunks behind. Set the prunes aside and make the cake. Sift together the flour, baking soda, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Mmmm... smells like the holidays. In a separate bowl, mix together the oil, sugar, vanilla and eggs. Combine the wet and dry ingredients and splash in the buttermilk. Stir until just combined. The mixture will be slightly lumpy. Now throw in the mashed prunes. And if your honey walks in as you&#39;re completing this step, shield the bowl with your body and stir quickly. What he doesn&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt him. Pour into the prepared baking pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Grandma Iny was adamant: do not over bake the cake. You want it to be nice and moist. When the cake has about 5 minutes left to bake, make the icing: Combine the sugar, buttermilk, butter, corn syrup, baking soda and vanilla in a medium saucepan. Stir to combine. Bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat. No need to stir. Continue boiling until the icing turns a light caramel color, 5 to 7 minutes. Important: The icing should be the color of caramel, but not yet firm and sticky. It needs to be pourable. Pull the cake out of the oven. Try not to faint, as it smells absolutely divine. While the cake is very warm, pour the icing evenly over the top. Work fast, as it will quickly start to soak into the cake. Spread the coat evenly ... then please, do yourself a favor: lick the spatula. It&#39;ll make you smile. Serve immediately, or feel free to let the cake sit on the counter for a while before serving. It only gets better with age. Helpful hint: serve without revealing the fact that the cake contains prunes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 38947,&quot;Root Vegetable Au Gratin Nonstick cooking spray 2 1/2 cups milk 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1/4 cup flour 1 cup grated Cheddar 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice Salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 large carrots, peeled, sliced on the bias 1/4-inch thick 5 parsnips, peeled, sliced on the bias 1/4-inch thick 1 cup breadcrumbs 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the wafers and 1 tablespoon sugar. Process until the wafers are fine crumbs. Melt 3 ounces of the butter and drizzle into the crumb mixture. Pulse to combine. Press this mixture into the bottom, up the sides and just over the lip of a 9-inch metal pie pan. Place in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely. After the crust has cooled, place the peanut butter and remaining 2 ounces of butter into the bowl of the food processor. Process for 1 minute. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla and process for another 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or until smooth. Carefully spread the mixture into the pie shell and return to the oven to bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool while preparing the topping. Place the heavy cream into a heat-proof bowl and microwave on high just until simmering, approximately 30 seconds. Remove the cream from the microwave and add the chocolate. Make sure the chocolate is completely submersed in the cream. Allow to sit for 2 minutes. Gently whisk until the chocolate is melted and combined with the cream, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Spread the chocolate mixture over the pie and chill in the refrigerator for 1 1/2 hours before serving. Place the peanuts, salt and honey into the bowl of a food processor. Process for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Place the lid back on and continue to process while slowly drizzling in the oil and process until the mixture is smooth, approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Place the peanut butter in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months. Yield: approximately 1 1/2 cups *Cooks note: If eating peanuts roasted right out of the shell, use Virginia or Valencia peanuts. If utilizing roasted peanuts to make peanut butter, use Spanish peanuts as they have a higher oil content. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse the peanuts under cool water to remove excess dirt. Pat dry and place in a large bowl and toss with the peanut oil and salt until well coated. Place on 2 half sheet pans, making sure to spread them out into a single layer. Roast in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through cooking. Once you remove the peanuts from the oven, let them cool slightly before eating. They will continue to \\cook\\ and become crunchy as they cool. If using peanuts to make peanut butter, remove shells and discard. Remove the skin by rubbing the peanuts together in your hands held over a salad spinner, allowing the peanuts and skins to fall into the bowl. Once the skin has been loosened from all of the peanuts close the salad spinner and spin until all of the skin has been separated from the peanuts. Yield: approximately 2 pounds roasted peanuts in shell &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>Note: The wine pairing suggestions are based on general guidelines and may not be suitable for everyone&#39;s taste preferences.

If the stock is gelatinous heat it slightly to bring it to a more watery consistency. Once the gelatin is dissolved place the bowl over a pot with simmering water in it and heat the mixture until it becomes clear. Mix in the apple cider vinegar and salt, to taste. Refrigerate until needed. Note: Depending on the richness of the stock used, the vinegar to stock ratio may need to be adjusted. The important thing is to keep the liquid (vinegar and stock) to gelatin ratio the same as it is in this recipe. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat a nonstick saute pan over medium heat and lay in the duck breasts, skin side down. Reduce the heat to low once the fat starts to melt and cook the breast very slowly for about 30 minutes to render as much of the fat as possible. Increase the heat if needed so that the final product is a rendered duck breast with a golden brown skin side. Flip the breasts over in the pan and roast for 3 to 8 minutes (depending on the size of the breast) until medium rare. Let the breasts cool at room temperature and then refrigerate. Increase the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel the apples and slice them thin (about 1/8 inch) on a mandolin. Line 2 half-sheet pans with parchment paper. Toss the apple slices with oil and salt and pepper. Spread out on the sheet pans and roast until the apples are barely cooked through ? still slightly crispy on the inside. Let cool at room temperature. Cut the stems off the beet greens so that only leaves remain. Boil a small pot of salted water. Prepare an ice bath in a medium size bowl. Blanch the beet greens in the boiling water by submerging them completely for about 10 to 15 seconds. Spoon them out and plunge them in the ice bath. Set the greens out individually on paper towels to dry. Layer the towels several times if necessary. When the duck breasts have fully cooled slice them lengthwise into thin slices ? less than 1/8-inch thick. Soak the slices in the orange juice. Warm the aspic in the mixing bowl over simmering water. Line 2 small triangular terrine molds with plastic wrap. Layer beet greens over the plastic wrap to cover the inside of the terrine mold completely and leave overhang on the edges to fold over the top. Brush the greens liberally with aspic. Layer the sliced apples and brush liberally with aspic. Put down another layer of beet greens and brush with aspic. Set in a layer of sliced duck. Layer as much as needed so that the terrine molds are full. Be very liberal with the aspic. It is the glue that holds the terrine together. When the mold is full fold the plastic over the top and put on the lid ? pressing down to work out any air pockets. Use cans or anything else you have around the kitchen to put weight on the terrines while refrigerating. When the terrines are fully chilled remove them from the refrigerator. Turn them out onto a cutting board, using the plastic to pull it carefully from the mold without breaking them. Carefully slice each terrine into 8 portions. Lay them out on a sheet pan.

Set a baking rack over a baking sheet. For the pancakes: Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the buttermilk. Add the cream cheese and mix until combined (the mixture will look broken). Stir in the melted butter, orange zest and vanilla. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir to combine. Whisk the egg whites in another bowl until soft peaks form, then gently fold into the batter. Heat a griddle or cast-iron pan over medium heat until a drop of water sizzles; brush with melted butter or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Drop the batter into the pan by 1/3 cupfuls, leaving space between each pancake. (This batter is thicker than regular pancake batter and will take a bit longer to cook and won&#39;t bubble as much.) Cook until golden brown on the bottom and just starting to dry a bit on top, adjusting the heat as necessary so the pancakes don&#39;t get too brown, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until the reverse side is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the finished pancakes to the baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. For the syrup: Heat the cherries, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla bean and seeds in a large high-sided pan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, until the cherries soften and the sugar dissolves, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and add the kirsch; return to the heat and ignite with a match. Using a spoon, baste the cherries with the liqueur and juices until the flame dies out. Spoon over the pancakes to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 39003,&quot;Turkey Patty Melt 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 large onion, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 4 (4-ounce) turkey patties 8 slices multi-grain bread 8 slices Monterey Jack or American cheese 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened Serving suggestion: Cranberry Sauce Instructions: Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat.

Toss in the carrots and cucumbers and let stand for 15 minutes for the flavors to meld. Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Prepare the noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse the noodles with cold running water. Toss the noodles with the vegetables and dressing and refrigerate until serving.<br> For the flank steak: Prepare a grill for direct and indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the side burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) If your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling. Set the flank steak on a cutting board. Starting at the thin, narrow end of the steak, slice it in half horizontally to within 2 inches of the opposite wide end. Open it up like a book so you have 1 long piece. Pound the steak with a mallet to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. Cover the steak with the curry paste and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Sprinkle with the peanuts, leaving a 1-inch border along the edges. Arrange half of the cilantro and scallion greens in a line, followed by half of the tomatoes and then half of the scallion whites. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Roll up the steak like a jelly roll, starting at the short end. Tie the roll closed around the circumference with butcher&#39;s twine at 2-inch intervals. Tie one more piece of twine lengthwise around the meat. Sprinkle the outside of the meat with salt and pepper.<br> Put the steak on direct heat and cook, turning, to brown all 4 sides, about 2 minutes per side. Move the steak to indirect heat, cover and cook, turning occasionally, until the very center reads 115 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer for a steak that is well done on the outside and medium rare in the center, 25 to 30 minutes more. (Test frequently; the time will vary based on the temperature of your grill.) Let the steak rest 5 to 6 minutes. Untie the steak and cut it into thin slices. Garnish the noodles with chopped nuts and cilantro leaves.

Bring the heavy cream and butter to a simmer in a small saucepan. Pour the cream mixture over the chocolate, completely covering it, and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir with a spatula until the chocolate is completely melted, smooth and glossy. (If the chocolate doesn&#39;t melt completely, microwave the mixture on high in 15-second increments, stirring in between, until fully melted.) Fold in the bourbon and peppermint extract until they are incorporated. The mixture will look separated at first, but keep stirring until it is uniform. Set the bowl over a larger bowl of ice water, and let the mixture chill for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it has thickened a bit and become homogeneous. Pour the mixture into a shallow 2-quart baking dish or 9-inch pie plate. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until set, about 3 hours. Meanwhile, process the sugar and mint in a food processor for 1 minute until the mint is finely chopped and dispersed, scraping down the bowl with a spatula halfway through.

Add the onions, leeks, swedes, and turnips to the pot, season with salt and pepper, and brown lightly in the fat. Add the vegetables to the casserole. Pour the stock into the pan, bring to a boil, and stir to dissolve the caramelized bits. Pour into the casserole. Lay the potatoes over the vegetables in the casserole, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil over the stove. Cover the casserole, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the lamb is tender and vegetables are cooked, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. When stew is cooked, pour off cooking liquid into a clean saucepan. Skim off any excess fat and bring liquid to a simmer. In another saucepan, make a roux by melting the butter, then whisking in the flour until it forms a smooth paste. Cook roux over low heat for 2 minutes. Add roux to cooking liquid, whisking until thickened slightly. Add parsley and chives, taste for seasoning, and pour back over casserole. Bring casserole back up to a simmer and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 39019,&quot;Potato-Fennel Pizza with Taleggio 2 medium russet potatoes (about 1 pound), quartered 1 clove garlic 1/2 small bulb fennel, cored and thinly sliced, plus 2 tablespoons chopped fronds Kosher salt 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground pepper For the pizza: 1 Prebaked Pizza Crust, recipe follows 6 ounces taleggio cheese, rind removed, thinly sliced 1/2 small fennel bulb, cored and thinly sliced 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon rapid-rise instant yeast 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl Instructions: Place a pizza stone or inverted rimmed baking sheet on the lower oven rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Make the potatoes: Combine the potatoes, garlic, sliced fennel and fennel fronds in a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium; cook until the potatoes are very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Add the olive oil and mash until almost smooth. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper; set aside. Assemble the pizza: Keep the prebaked crust on the baking sheet. Scatter the taleggio and potato mixture over the crust, spreading the potato mixture slightly. Scatter the sliced fennel on top, sprinkle with the parmesan and drizzle with the olive oil. Transfer the baking sheet to the hot pizza stone and bake until the cheese melts and the crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and season with salt and pepper. Combine the flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Stir in 2 cups warm water (about 105 degrees F) and 2 tablespoons olive oil with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until the dough rises slightly, about 1 hour. Using lightly floured hands, transfer the dough to a generously floured surface and knead several times until it just starts becoming smooth and elastic, about 1 minute (do not over-knead). Transfer to a lightly oiled large bowl. Tightly cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, place a pizza stone or inverted rimmed baking sheet on the lower oven rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Brush two rimmed 13-by-18-inch baking sheets (not nonstick) with 3 tablespoons olive oil each. Place one piece of dough on each baking sheet.

Add the artichoke hearts and reduce the heat to medium high. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, or until the hearts are beginning to brown. Remove to a plate and set aside. To the same pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the butter and the shallots and cook for 1 minute, stirring regularly. Add the rice and salt and stir with a wooden spoon to coat all the kernels with oil. Continue to cook for 3 minutes, or until the rice is sizzling. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until it is almost completely absorbed. Now begin adding the chicken broth, one cup at a time, stirring frequently between additions. After the first cup is almost entirely absorbed, add the next cup. Continue in this way until the rice is cooked through and you have a creamy risotto, about 20 minutes in all. (The risotto should be slightly loose, not dry; it should run off your spoon. If it gets too dry, add a bit more broth.) Stir in the peas, feta, chives, mint and black pepper.

Combine the yeast, sugar, butter, and egg yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the milk. With the mixer on low speed, beat the mixture for about 4 minutes to dissolve the yeast. If the yeast mixture doesn&#39;t begin to foam after a few minutes, it means it&#39;s not active and will have to be replaced. In a separate large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, nutmeg, and lemon zest. Add this mixture to the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed until it lightly comes together, then increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl, forms a ball, and climbs slightly up the dough hook. Remove the dough from the bowl. Coat the dough with vegetable oil. Return the dough to the bowl and turn it to oil all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, set in a warm, draft-free place, and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the cream cheese and 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Mix well. In another small bowl, combine the remaining powdered sugar, lemon juice and milk. Mix well and set aside. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Roll the dough out 30 inches long and 6 inches in diameter. Spread the cream cheese filling across the center of the dough. Bring the two long edges together and seal all sides completely. Using your hands shape the dough into a long cylinder and place on a greased baking sheet, seam side down. Shape the dough into a ring. Place a well-greased 2 pound coffee can or shortening can in the center of the ring to maintain the shape during baking. Press the plastic baby toy into the ring from the bottom so that it is completely hidden by the dough. Cover the ring with a towel and place in a warm, draft free place. Let the dough rise for about 45 minutes or until the dough doubles in size. With a sharp knife, make several slits around the top of the ring. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown. After baking remove the coffee can immediately. Allow the cake to cool. Drizzle the cake with the sugar glaze. Sprinkle the cake with sprinkles, alternating colors. Cut the cake into individual pieces and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 39050,&quot;Gooey Brie Crescent Wrap Two 8-ounce packages refrigerated crescent rolls 1/3 cup cranberry preserves/spread<br> 8 ounces Brie, cut into 1/2-inch cubes<br> 1/2 cup chopped pistachios<br> 1/2 cup dried cranberries<br> 1 large egg, beaten<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary plus a few sprigs, for garnish<br> 1 teaspoon flaky sea salt, optional, plus more for serving 2 tablespoons honey<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise, including the stems. Using a sharp paring knife, scoop out some of the flesh, leaving a shell that is 1/3 inch thick and reserving the scooped-out eggplant. Place the eggplant shells snugly in a single layer in a large (10-by-14-inch) rectangular baking dish. Brush the eggplant all over with 1/4 cup olive oil (use it all!) and sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Pour 1/4 cup water in the baking dish, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake for 30 minutes, until the shells are tender when pierced with a small knife. Remove from the oven, discard the foil, and leave the oven on. Meanwhile, for the lamb filling, in a large (12-inch) skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes, tossing occasionally, until tender. Cut the reserved scooped-out eggplant into 1/2-inch dice (you should have about 2 cups). Add the eggplant to the onion and cook for 5 minutes, adding more oil if it seems dry. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the ground lamb and cook, mashing lightly with a fork, for 5 to 7 minutes, until no longer pink. Add the oregano and cinnamon and cook for one minute. Add the wine, tomatoes, marinara, parsley, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes, until the liquid evaporates. Spoon the filling into the eggplant halves in the baking dish. (You may have a little extra filling.) In a medium bowl, mash the ricotta, goat cheese, egg yolks, mint, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper with a fork. With a spoon, place large dollops of the ricotta mixture on the lamb filling and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the filling is hot and the topping is lightly browned.

Set aside to garnish the soup later. For the pozole chili broth: Heat flat top on medium-high heat; add 2 teaspoons of the oil. Place the tomatillos and tomatoes skin-side down and cook undisturbed until the skin is slightly charred, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside until ready to start the broth. Rinse the pork pones in the sink to wash off any excess blood and set aside until ready to start the broth. Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat; add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Add the pork bones, onions and garlic and let brown for 1 to 2 minutes. Then add the tomatoes and tomatillos. Fill the pot halfway with water. Add the dried chiles, bouillon, oregano, coriander, peppercorns, salt and cumin, Add 4 quarts of water to the pot (or until full), making sure all the peppers are submerged in the water. Cover with a lid and simmer over low-medium heat for 30 to 45 minutes; the dried chiles should be rehydrated. Pull out the pork bones and set aside to use again in the final broth. Using a soup ladle, scoop the broth and vegetables into a blender. Start at low speed and then increase to medium speed to gradually puree. Continue in batches until the pot is empty. Keep the pureed broth in a separate container. Use a medium-mesh sieve to strain the puree into a separate soup pot, then add 4 quarts of water. Add the pork bones back into the pot with the bay leaves, lime leaves and lemongrass. Let it simmer over medium-low heat for 1 hour. Strain the hominy from the can. Scoop 1/4 cup of hominy into a round soup bowl. Top with Asian slaw, soy marinated pork carnitas and then pour 2 cups of the soup broth over the meat and vegetables. Garnish with chopped cilantro, green onions and 6 tortilla chips. Combine the soy sauce, sugar, mirin, oyster sauce, mushroom soy, green onions, star anise, cloves, peppercorn blend, cinnamon sticks and ginger slices in an 18-quart container. With a large whisk, mix the ingredients together. Make sure all the sugar at the bottom is properly stirred into the liquid. Gradually pour the water into the container and continue to stir. Cut the pork butt in 2-inch square pieces. Trim all the hard fat off and leave about a quarter of the soft fat on the meat. Set the pork in a deep cooking pan, and, using a ladle, pour the soy marinade mix over the meat, make sure all the meat is covered in the liquid. (Any extra soy-ginger marinade can be put away and used again on a later date.) Add the dried black mushroom and bay leaves to the liquid, spreading them evenly throughout the pan. Tightly wrap the pan with heavy-duty foil and refrigerate overnight. The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make sure the foil is tightly sealed around the pan and cook until the pork is fork tender, about 3 hours. Take the pan out of the oven and remove the foil. With a fork and tongs pull at the pork.

Set up a bowl of well-salted ice water. Blanch the fresh peas in the medium pot of boiling water until they are cooked but still crunchy and then immediately plunge them into the salted ice water. Remove them from the ice water and reserve. Coat a large saute pan over medium heat with olive oil. Add the smashed garlic cloves and crushed red pepper. Bring the pan to a medium high heat. When the garlic has become golden brown and is very aromatic, remove it and discard. Add the prosciutto and saute until it starts to get crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and season with salt. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes, and TASTE to see if they are delicious (they should be!). Add the peas and chicken stock. Season with salt, TASTE IT (it should be more delicious). Simmer until the stock has reduced by about half. While the stock is reducing, add the gnocchi to the large pot of salted boiling water. Cook the gnocchi until they float and get very puffy. The gnocchi should be really puffy. While the gnocchi is in the boiling water, add the butter to the pan with the mushroom mixture. Cook over low heat and swirl to incorporate. TASTE and adjust seasoning if needed. When the gnocchi are cooked, carefully remove them from the cooking water and add them to the pan with the mushrooms. Toss or stir to combine. Cook the gnocchi with mushroom mixture until it clings to the gnocchi. Add the grated Parmigiano and the chopped chives. Transfer to serving bowls and serve immediately. Call yourself a superstar!

When doing this pay careful attention to keep the potatoes as light and fluffy as possible. This will aid in keeping the gnocchi light. Refrigerate the potatoes on the sheet tray until cold. This is also a very important step. If the potatoes are warm while adding flour they will require more flour which will result in a much heavier finished product. When the potatoes are absolutely cold, transfer to a clean work surface. Beat together the eggs and cheese and pour onto the potatoes. Season with salt. Cover generously with flour. It should look like snow on the mountains. Crumble the potato flour mixture between your fingers. Begin to knead the dough until it is a dry homogeneous mixture. The dough should feel slightly moist, but not tacky. If too tacky, repeat the snow on the mountains stage. Form the dough into a large log. Cut slices off the log and begin to roll into long ropes that are about 1-inch in thickness. Cut the ropes into 1/2-inch lengths. Cover generously with flour. Place the gnocchi in a single layer on a sheet tray dusted with flour. DO NOT PILE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER!! Use or freeze the gnocchi immediately. If freezing, place tray directly into the freezer. Once frozen, the gnocchi can be stored in plastic bags, in the freezer, indefinitely. When cooking gnocchi they can go directly from the freezer into salted boiling water. Note: It is a general practice to take gnocchi out of the water when they float. This is a big mistake. Gnocchi need to be cooked in boiling water until they float and get nice and puffy. Not cooking gnocchi long enough will also result in heavy gnocchi. P.S. These are Chef Anne \\Secrets\\ to great gnocchi, use them and you will be successful every time. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 39059,&quot;Easy Tomato Soup 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 fennel bulb, chopped, about 2 1/2 cups 1/2 large onion, chopped, about 1 cup 4 cloves garlic, crushed Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper 1 teaspoon fennel seed 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, optional 1 (28-ounce) can plum tomatoes, preferably San Marzano 2 cups homemade vegetable broth or low-sodium canned 2 cups tomato juice 6 basil leaves, torn 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Instructions:</p><ol><li>Heat olive oil in a medium sauce pot over medium-high heat.

Add the mai fun noodles and cook until softened, 1 minute. With tongs, lift the noodles out of the water and drain; reserve the hot water for rehydrating the spring roll wrappers. Lightly grease a baking sheet or serving platter with oil to prevent the finished summer rolls from sticking. Clear a large work surface in front of you. Along the far end of the surface, line up the spinach, enoki mushrooms, carrots, tofu, mint and mai fun in that order. Set the spring roll wrappers and reserved hot water to one side of you. Take one spring roll wrapper and dip it into the hot water; it will soften quickly. As soon as the wrapper softens, lift it from the water and lay it flat and smooth on the work surface. Arrange 3 spinach leaves in a horizontal line across the center of the wrapper, leaving a 1 1/2-inch margin on either end. Top with a few pieces each of enoki and carrots. Place 2 or 3 pieces of tofu above the spinach, so the tofu and spinach lie parallel. Place 4 mint leaves above and parallel to the tofu. Top the carrots and mushrooms with about 1/4 cup of the mai fun. Lift the end of the wrapper closest to you up and over the filling, tucking it slightly underneath with your fingertips. Gently shape the roll, giving a gentle tug to keep it taught. Begin rolling toward the back end of the wrapper, then fold the sides in toward the center of the roll to close off the ends. Continue rolling to the end of the wrapper. Place the summer roll on the oiled tray. Repeat to create 12 rolls. For the peanut sauce: Whisk together the peanut butter, hoisin, soy sauce, sriracha, lime juice and garlic in a medium bowl. Whisk in 4 tablespoons water. The sauce should be a thick enough to coat the back of a spoon but still drip off lightly. Add another tablespoon or two of water if the sauce needs thinning. For the nuoc cham: Whisk together the lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, sriracha, garlic and 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use. Serve the summer rolls with the peanut sauce and nuoc cham. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 39061,&quot;White Cheddar Mornay 2 ounces butter 2 ounces all-purpose flour 1 quart whole milk 8 ounces sharp white Cheddar, shredded 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste Instructions: Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat.

Sprinkle in the cocoa powder and whisk to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool for about 5 minutes. Stir the sugar and vanilla into the chocolate mixture until just combined. One at a time, stir in the eggs. Gently stir in the flour until halfway incorporated. Add the chocolate chips and stir just until combined. Sprinkle half of the pretzels in the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Pour the batter (it will be very thick!) in the pan over the pretzels. Spread to even out the top and arrange the remaining pretzels all over the top. Bake for 40 minutes, then check the brownies with a toothpick. If overly gooey/messy, return the pan to the oven for 5 to 10 more minutes, being careful not to burn the edges. Allow to cool completely (important!), then cut into small squares. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo]</li></ol><p>&quot; 39063,&quot;Sweet Potato Chicken Breakfast Hash 1/4 cup diced sweet potatoes 1/2 cup cooked chicken, roughly chopped 1/4 teaspoon paprika Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 egg Suggested toppings: salsa, shredded cheese, diced avocado Instructions: Add the sweet potatoes to a wide mug or small bowl with 1 tablespoon water and microwave until tender, 2 to 5 minutes.

To make the filling: Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl, stirring to incorporate. To make the sauce: Coat a wide saute pan with olive oil and place over medium heat. When the oil gets hazy, add the onions, garlic, and anchovies; cook and stir for 5 minutes until fragrant and soft. Add the olives, capers, and hand torn basil. Carefully add the tomatoes (nothing splashes like tomatoes), cook and stir over low heat, until the liquid is cooked down and the sauce is thick, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Yield: 24 ravioli Pasta Dough for Ravioli: 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon salt 3 large eggs, plus 1 for egg wash 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Cornmeal, for dusting To make the pasta dough: In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook*, combine the flour and salt. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to mix. Drizzle in 1 tablespoons of the olive oil and continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. *Alternatively if you don&#39;t have an electric mixer: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Continue as directed above. Cut the ball of dough in 1/2, cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it.). Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed. Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter and sheet of dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash, which acts as a glue. Drop tablespoons of your favorite filling on 1/2 of the pasta sheet, about 2-inches apart. Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket. With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into squares and crimp the 4 edges with the tins of a fork to make a tight seal. Dust the ravioli and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent the pasta from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest. Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 4 minutes; they&#39;ll float to the top when ready, so be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Bath the ravioli in your favorite sauce to lightly coat and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 39065,&quot;Ham and Bell Pepper Pasta Salad Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 3 tablespoons sour cream 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 8 ounces dried elbow macaroni 1 cup diced ham 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion 2 bell peppers, preferably 1 red and 1 yellow, chopped Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Stir in the yeast and let stand until the mixture is foamy, about 10 minutes. Pour the yeast mixture into the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the sugar, butter and 2 of the eggs and stir until smooth. Add the flour and salt and mix on medium-low speed until the dough comes together. Increase the speed to medium high and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let stand until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a rimless baking sheet with parchment. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Pinch off 1 golf ball-size piece of dough and roll it into a ball for the pompom of Santa&#39;s hat. Pinch off 1 ping pong ball-size piece of dough and roll it into a ball for Santa&#39;s nose. Cut off a 1-inch-wide, 9-inch-long, 1/4-inch-thick strip and roll it into a smooth log for the brim of Santa&#39;s hat. Cut another piece of dough into a roughly 2-inch-wide, 5-inch-long, 1/4-inch-thick strip of dough. Snip evenly from the bottom (but not all the way up) and spread the strips out slightly to form a mustache. Roll out the remaining dough into an elongated diamond with the top triangle of the diamond double the length of the bottom triangle. Position the diamond on the prepared baking sheet with the top of the longer triangle hanging over the edge. Working on the shorter triangle, use scissors or a knife to cut 1/2-inch-wide strips of dough up toward the middle, stopping at the imaginary line where the top and bottom triangles meet. Pick up each strip of the beard and twist it, if you like, lying the twists down next to each other naturally so they look like a beard. Fold over the overhanging corner of dough so that it fits back within the edge of the baking sheet and position it slightly to the right to form the tip of Santa&#39;s hat. Position the dough log across the top triangle where the tip of Santa&#39;s hat ends and tuck the ends under the sides of the triangle; this is the brim of Santa&#39;s hat. Position the golf ball-size ball of dough over the tip and against the brim and press lightly to adhere for the pompom of Santa&#39;s hat. Arrange the mustache at the top of the beard, then position the ping pong ball-size ball of dough above the mustache to make Santa&#39;s nose. Beat the remaining egg with the cream in a bowl to make an egg wash. Using a pastry brush, brush the entire surface of the dough, including the pompom and brim of the hat but not the body of the hat, with the plain egg wash, making sure to get into all the crevices of the shapes. Add the food coloring to the egg wash, stir to combine, then carefully brush the body of the hat with the red egg wash, being careful not to let it stain the pompom or brim. Bake until the bread is golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately set the chocolate chips proportionally on either side and slightly above Santa&#39;s nose to form his eyes. Let the bread cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheet, and then transfer to a wire rack. Using cut pieces of parchment paper or foil to shield Santa&#39;s nose, face and the body of his hat, dust the beard, brim and pompom with confectioners&#39; sugar. Remove the paper and serve the bread while still warm with butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 39068,&quot;Szechwan Crispy Beef 1 pound sirloin steak, rinsed and patted dry Vegetable oil, for frying 1 cup shredded carrots 2 scallions, white part, thinly sliced lengthwise; greens cut on the diagonal, for garnish 1/4 cup stir-fry sauce (recommended: Kikkoman) 1 tablespoon dry sherry 1 tablespoon Vietnamese chili-garlic sauce Instructions: Trim away fat from steak.

Combine the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Starting on low speed, mix in the flour mixture in 3 additions; scrape down the sides of the bowl in between. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into a disk. Refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours, up to overnight. Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Cut the dough in half. Dust your work surface and the dough liberally with flour and roll one piece of dough about 1/4 inch thick. Cut as many ghosts as you can with a 3.5-inch ghost-shape cookie cutter and transfer to the baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining dough. Gather the scraps from both pieces of dough, then flatten, rewrap and refrigerate. Meanwhile, bake the ghosts, switching and rotating positions of the baking sheets halfway through, until golden on the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the refrigerated dough scraps to get about 30 cookies in total.

When the chocolate has set, invert the bowl to release the base from the bowl. Carefully peel the tin foil away from the chocolate. Set aside. Make the rooftops: Make a cone out of a sheet of acetate securing it closed with tape. Use a scissor to trim the edge of the cone so the end is straight. You will need 1 cone for each castle turret. The cones I made were about 9-inches tall and ranged in the opening diameter from 1 to 4 inches. Tip: Determine the size of the turrets you will make so you can coordinate cone rooftops that match the size. Use a ladle to fill the cone with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the cone should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the plastic cone clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge of the cone clean with a paring knife. You can place the cone in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat 3 more times to make 4 rooftops. When the chocolate sets, peel off the acetate. Set aside. Make the turrets: The tallest turrets of my castle are made with tubes of chocolate, each a different size in diameter. Each turret is also made of tubes of 2 different diameters. I made 5 turrets plus an extra large turret. I call the largest turret the main house. It is an irregularly shaped tube but the technique to make it is different from the other turrets. To make the main house, roll a long piece of acetate to determine the size of the tube you would like to make. Use a marker to mark the place on the acetate that indicates the desired diameter. Unroll the acetate and place a piece of parchment at the mark to cover the extra acetate. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate over the exposed sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly then roll the open end toward the parchment line. When the open end meets the parchment, continue to roll the extra acetate and tape it closed. Use a tin can to press this tube into an irregular shape. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Use a hot knife to shape the top edge of this piece. Use a slow sawing motion. If you see smoke, the knife is too hot. Dip the end of this piece into the tempered chocolate and adhere it onto the base. To make the tall turrets, use the following technique to make chocolate tubes. Roll a tube to the desired diameter and secure it closed with tape. The turrets on my castle range from 1 to 5 inches in diameter. Tape 1 end of the tube closed with tape. Set the tube on end and fill with chocolate. When it is full, invert the tube over the bowl of chocolate allowing the excess chocolate to flow back into the bowl. Let set. When the chocolate has set, repeat this step a few more times. You want the tubes sturdy so the castle will be strong. Allow the chocolate tube to set until hard. Remove the acetate. The largest tube gets cut into pieces to make the base of some turrets. Use a hot knife to cut all of the tubes into unequal sizes. To do this, heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \\cut\\ through the chocolate by melting it. To assemble the turrets: Start with the largest diameter planned for each turret and use tempered chocolate to adhere the piece to the base. Combine different size tubes to make the tall turrets. Use tempered chocolate to glue the turret pieces together. Apply the chocolate at the top of the base turret and at the bottom of the tube inserted into that base. Use cold spray or hold it until the chocolate sets. Make a cornet and fill it with tempered dark chocolate. Starting with the tube of greatest diameter, place the next smallest diameter tube piece inside it and use the cornet to \\glue\\ the 2 pieces together. If you have cold spray, it will be helpful to use it here. Continue this process using 2 or 3 different diameter tubes for each turret. Then repeat the process to make a total of 5 turrets. Use a hot cutter to make the windows. Heat the cutter with a blowtorch or hold it under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the cutter against the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press too hard or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the metal to \\cut\\ through the chocolate by melting it. At this stage, you can spray the castle to give it a great texture. The trick is that you have to be able to fit the castle into your freezer. Place the castle in the freezer for about 15 to 20 minutes. The surface of the chocolate must be chilled so the chocolate coating will harden upon contact, giving it the desired texture. Prepare the paint sprayer: Place equal amounts of chocolate and cocoa butter over a double boiler and melt until smooth (no lumps). Remove the presentation from the freezer and place on a parchment paper lined surface. Place the chocolate mixture in a clean paint sprayer and use it to spray the dessert with the chocolate. Tip: Anything that touches the tubes after they have been sprayed will leave a mark. Use tempered chocolate to secure a rooftop to the top of each turret. Make the trees: Make a cornet and fill it with tempered dark chocolate. Draw a tree onto a sheet of parchment paper. Repeat the same technique to make as many trees as you would like. Let your imagination run wild as you draw scary trees. When the chocolate sets, lift it from the parchment paper. If it sticks, you can loosen it with a paring knife. Make the bats: Use a spoon to fill the bat molds with chocolate. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, check to be sure the edges of the mold are clean and if necessary, clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Repeat to make as many bats as you would like. I made mine about 7 inches tall. Make the turret squares: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate over a sheet of textured acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Wait until the chocolate begins to set. Use a rolling cutter or hot sharp chef&#39;s knife to cut rectangles that are 1-inch by 2 inches. When the chocolate has set, carefully peel away the sheet. It should release from the chocolate quite easily. Finishing details: Use tempered chocolate to attach the turret squares to the top of each turret. Glue the trees and bats in place. Use the tip of a metal skewer to poke holes in the base of the castle. Insert the chocolate lollipops into these holes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 39078,&quot;Chicken Pesto Spinach Salad Ingredients: 1 pkg Fresh Express?

Combine the panko and half of the cheese. Set aside. Heat the stock, milk, bay leaf and thyme in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until steaming. Keep warm while you prepare the vegetables. (You can skip infusing the liquid with the herbs if you like, but it does need to be warmed so it doesn&#39;t make lumpy gravy when you add it to the flour.)<br> Heat the butter in a large ovenproof and flame-proof casserole or skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and celery. Cook until the onion is soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper; cook until tender, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 45 to 60 seconds. Add the flour and stir to combine. (The mixture will be dry.) Remove the bay leaf and thyme from the stock mixture. Whisk the stock into the flour and vegetables. Add the remaining cup of cheese and stir until smooth. Add the rice and stir to combine. Add the sour cream, cayenne and nutmeg; stir until smooth. Place the 6 pieces of chicken in the casserole and snuggle them into the rice. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and transfer to the oven. Bake until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, about 40 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, place the broccoli in a microwave-safe bowl with 1/4 cup of water. Cover and microwave until the broccoli is just tender and bright green, about 2 minutes, depending on the strength of your microwave. Drain the broccoli and keep warm.<br> Once the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, remove the casserole from the oven and stir in the broccoli. (It&#39;s easiest if you transfer the chicken to a plate first, then stir in the broccoli, then pop the chicken back on top.) Smooth the top and sprinkle with the reserved panko-cheese mixture. Return to the oven and bake until the topping is golden brown, about 15 minutes longer. Place the casserole on a rack to cool slightly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 39080,&quot;Campfire Banana Boats 8 bananas 1 bag caramel bits or caramels cut into bits 1 bag chocolate chips 1 bag mini marshmallows 1 package original graham crackers, crushed into crumbs Instructions: Split the bananas lengthwise, but don&#39;t cut all the way through. The goal is to create a boat to hold the ingredients. Load the bananas 1/4 cup each of the caramel bits, chocolate chips and mini marshmallows. Crumble 1 whole graham cracker onto each loaded banana. Wrap individually in 8-by-10-inch squares of foil, and then place near the campfire to melt the candies. Open up and eat with a spoon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 39081,&quot;Baked Potato Cake Cooking spray 2 16-to-18-ounce boxes white cake mix (plus required ingredients) 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 tablespoon milk 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder, plus more for dusting 3 to 4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 16-ounce tubs vanilla frosting 3 yellow Starburst candies 2 fresh mint leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat three 9-inch-roundcake pans with cooking spray. Prepare the cake mixes as directed; divide the batter evenly among the pans and bake 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool. Make the \\potato skin\\ frosting: Beat the butter and milk with a mixer until smooth. Beat in the cocoa powder. Beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar, 1 cup at a time, until the mixture is as thick as cookie dough. Form into 2 disks, wrap in plastic and refrigerate. Level the domed tops of 2 cakes with a serrated knife. Stack the flat cakes on a cardboard circle with vanilla frosting between each; use the remaining domed layer on top. Freeze 30 minutes. Trim the cake into a potato shape with a small serrated knife; reserve the trimmings. Cover the cake with a thin layer of vanilla frosting. Dust a sheet of parchment paper with cocoa powder. Remove 1 disk of chocolate frosting from the refrigerator and roll into a 5-by-10-inch oval, dusting with more cocoa. Repeat with the other disk of frosting. Use the parchment to press the frosting sheets against the cake as shown, leaving a few inches on top uncovered. Dust with more cocoa. (Don&#39;t worry about how the bottom of the cake looks-it will be covered with foil.) Gently fold back the frosting on top. Crumble about 1/2 cup of the cake trimmings (use the light inside pieces) and sprinkle them on top of the cake. Unwrap the candies and microwave until soft but not melted, about 12 seconds. Stack the candies, then flatten with your fingers. Set on top of the cake. When ready to serve, snip the mint leaves on top of the cake. Carefully wrap the bottom half of the cake with a large sheet of foil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 39082,&quot;Cupcakes 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon soft butter 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 2 eggs 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 to 3 tablespoons milk Royal Icing, recipe follows *2 large egg whites (or substitute powdered egg whites) 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 teaspoon lemon juice Instructions: Take everything you need out of the fridge in time to get to room temperature - and this makes a huge difference to the lightness of the cupcakes later - and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put all of the ingredients for the cupcakes except for the milk into a food processor and blitz until smooth. Pulse while adding the milk down the funnel, to make a smooth dropping consistency. Divide the mixture between a 12-bun muffin tin lined with muffin papers, and bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. They should have risen and be golden on top. Let them cool a little in their tins on a rack, and then take them carefully out of the tin to cool in their papers, still on the wire rack. Ice with Royal Icing. Combine the egg whites and confectioners&#39; sugar in a medium-size mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium speed until opaque and shiny, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the lemon juice, this will thin out the icing. Beat for another couple of minutes until you reach the right spreading consistency for the cupcakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 39083,&quot;Eggnog-Panettone Bread Pudding 1 loaf panettone, available in Italian specialty stores, cut in half (enough for about 5 cups, diced) 3 whole eggs 3 egg yolks 3/4 cups sugar 2 cups half-and-half 1/4 cup rum 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg Vegetable cooking spray Vanilla ice cream Whipped cream Instructions: Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Place a tea-kettle of water on to boil for a water bath. With a serrated knife, remove the side crusts from the half piece of the panettone. Cut into 3/4 to 1-inch dice. You should have 5 cups. Reserve the cubed panettone in a large mixing bowl. For the eggnog custard, in another bowl thoroughly whisk together the eggs, yolks, sugar, half and half, rum, vanilla extract, and a healthy grating of fresh nutmeg. Pour this over the bread cubes. Spray a 12 hole muffin tin with vegetable cooking spray. Ladle the bread/eggnog mixture gently and evenly into the muffin tins. The big cubes sticking up look nice. Place the filled muffin tin in a tall sided cookie sheet or roasting pan. Transfer to the preheated oven and carefully pour the hot water from kettle onto sheet pan, creating a water bath for the muffin tin to sit in. Bake 15 to 20 minutes until the tops are nicely browned, and a toothpick comes clean from the center. Bread pudding may be served warm or cold. Vanilla Ice cream or whipped cream would be great accompaniments. Alternately place the muffin tin in a roasting pan on the stove. Pour in up to 1-inch of boiling water. Cover and cook over medium-high heat for 15 to 20 minutes. The puddings will puff and a toothpick will come out clean from the center. The tops won&#39;t brown with this method. Perhaps a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar at serving time would be nice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 39084,&quot;Golden Crushed Potatoes 8 small gold creamer potatoes (like Yukon gold), about 1 pound Nonstick cooking spray 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Steam the potatoes, whole, for 20 minutes, until they are still firm yet easily pierced with a fork. Drain. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place a potato on the tray, cut a small cross about 1/4-inch deep into the potato and crush the potato with the back of a wooden spoon to flatten into a patty about 1/2-inch thick. Try to crush it just enough so it stays together with most of its skin intact. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. Brush the tops of the potatoes with the oil, sprinkle with salt and bake until crisp and golden, about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 39085,&quot;Childhood Chocolate Cake Nonstick spray 3 eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br> 3/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon cocoa powder<br> 2 teaspoons instant coffee, optional<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 1/4 cups Hellmann&#39;s Mayonnaise<br> 1 1/3 cups hot water<br> 2 egg whites 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon light corn syrup<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br> 4 ounces dark chocolate, for grating Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 F. Put parchment paper in the bottom of the two cake pans and use nonstick spray (or a little butter) to thoroughly grease the sides and bottoms. Set aside. Make the batter for the cake: In the bowl of the electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine and beat the eggs and sugar on high speed until light, fluffy and lemony-colored, 5 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, (sifted over the other ingredients) coffee (if using) and salt. Mix in the mayonnaise, gently whisk in the hot water and then fold in the egg/sugar mixture until smooth. Mix until all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Pour half of the cake batter into each of the prepared pans. Place the pans in the center of the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Test the cakes to make sure they are cooked in the center. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. For the frosting: Make a stovetop water bath by placing a large (somewhat deep) skillet half-filled with water on the stove. Heat the water until it simmers then shut it off. Meanwhile, put the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar, 5 tablespoons water and corn syrup in a clean metal bowl. Whisk to blend. Place the bowl in the water bath and (with the heat off) whisk the whites by hand or with an electric hand mixer until they fluff up and reach a temperature of 140 degrees F. Whisking the whites constantly is important so just test the temperature of the whites from time to time with the thermometer. Holding a thermometer and whisking at the same time can be difficult. When the whites reach 140 degrees F, remove the bowl from the water bath. Stir in the vanilla extract and whisk for 1 to 2 additional minutes to cool it off a little. Cover with plastic wrap until ready to frost the cake. Assemble the cake: Gently turn the cake rounds out onto a flat surface. Finely grate some chocolate onto the first layer of the cake. Then, use about 1/3 of the total frosting on top of the first layer, letting some of it spill over the top to coat the sides. Place the other layer squarely on top of the first and use the remaining frosting to coat the top and sides of the cake. Grate more chocolate over the cake. This chocolate will create a nice little texture to compliment the soft cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 39086,&quot;Turkey Spaghetti Kosher salt 12 ounces spaghetti 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) salted butter 1/2 cup diced celery 1/2 cup diced carrot 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 small onion, diced 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 cups diced roasted turkey (or substitute rotisserie chicken) One 10.5-ounce can cream of mushroom soup 1 cup leftover gravy (or substitute another can of cream of mushroom soup) 1/2 cup stock or water 1 1/2 cups grated Cheddar cheese Chopped fresh parsley, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the celery, carrot, sage, garlic and onion, then stir. Season with the pepper and a pinch of salt and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to soften the vegetables. Add the turkey, cream of mushroom soup, gravy and stock. Bring to a simmer. Stir in the pasta and half of the Cheddar until well combined. Sprinkle the remaining Cheddar over the top and bake until the cheese is melted and the sides are beginning to brown, 12 to 15 minutes.

Next, wrap 2 pieces of par-cooked bacon strips criss-cross around each piece of chicken, forming an \\x\\ pattern in the center. Sprinkle with the diced onion and place a thick slice of Roma tomato and a couple sprigs of fresh thyme in the center of each breast, tucked in behind the bacon. Arrange chicken a little apart from each other on the sheet pan and bake until the chicken is completely cooked and reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 39088,&quot;Chicken Tacos 1 recipe Achiote Citrus Marinade (recipe follows) 1 1/2 pounds chicken legs and thighs 24 small corn tortillas (recipe follows), or use store-bought 1 recipe Salsa Fresca (recipe follows) 2 avocados, peeled and sliced<br> 1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves only, chopped 2/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 1/4 cup achiote paste 2 to 3 jalapeno chiles stemmed and seeded if desired 7 garlic cloves, peeled 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 1 tablespoon salt 1 bunch cilantro, stems and leaves 4 cups finely ground deep yellow masa harina 2 3/4 cups cold water 1 teaspoon salt 4 medium ripe tomatoes, cored, seeded, and finely diced 1/4 red onion, minced 2 jalapeno chiles, stemmed, seeded and minced 1 bunch cilantro, leaves only chopped 2 tablespoons lime juice 3/4 teaspoon salt Pinch of freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Rub the marinade all over the chicken pieces. Place in a bowl, cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or as long as overnight. Preheat the oven to 350/. Lift the chicken pieces from the marinade and transfer to a roasting pan. Roast for about 40 minutes, or until the meat easily pulls away from the bone. Set the chicken aside to cool and pour the cooking juices from the pan into a bowl or cup. Refrigerate the juices so that the fat rises to the top. When the chicken is cool, remove and discard the skin, if desired, and bones and cut or shred the meat into bitesized pieces. Refrigerate the chicken if you do not plan to use it right away. When you are ready to make the tacos, skim off and discard the fat which has risen from the cooking juices, and use the brown cooking liquid which remains to reheat the chicken in a low oven. Dip a corn tortilla in some water and shake off the excess. Toast one at a time in a nonstick pan over medium heat for about 1 minute on each side. Wrap in a towel to keep warm while you dip and heat the remaining tortillas. For each taco, stack 2 tortillas. Divide the warm chicken and place on top. Top with Salsa Fresca, sliced avocado, and chopped cilantro. Combine 1/3 cup of the orange juice, the achiote paste, jalapenos, garlic, peppercorns and salt in a blender or food processor. Puree until the peppercorns are completely crushed. Add the cilantro and the remaining 1/3 cup orange juice and puree until smooth. In large bowl combine all ingredients and stir until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small piece of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Divide the dough into 24 golf ball size pieces for tacos and 12 large balls for quesadillas. Place on a platter and cover with a damp towel. Line a tortilla press with 2 sheets of plastic cut from a plastic freezer bag or other heavy duty plastic bag. Heat a dry cast iron skillet, or non-stick pan until moderately hot. Flatten each ball of dough in the tortilla press, then remove the plastic from the top and, holding the tortilla with your fingertips, peel off the bottom sheet. Lay the tortillas one by one on the skillet and cook about 30 to 45 seconds per side, pressing the top of each tortilla with your fingertips to make it puff. Place the hot tortillas on a towel. When they are still warm but not hot, stack and wrap in a towel. Serve immediately or let cool, wrap well in plastic or a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator up to a week.

(This results in a controlled 325 to 350 degrees F heat; see Cook&#39;s Note.) Fill a metal loaf pan with about 1 cup water and place it next to the coals for additional moisture. Season the ribs liberally with salt and pepper. Combine the beer, sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, mustard, vinegar, ginger, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic, a small pinch of salt and about 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a medium saucepan and whisk until smooth. Bring to a simmer over direct heat and cook until reduced by a third, about 30 minutes. Place the ribs bone-side down on the grill over indirect heat. Close the grill and cook, brushing the ribs with the glaze every 30 minutes to an hour, until an instant-read thermometer registers 200 degrees F, 3 to 3.5 hours. (Make sure to keep the temperature of the grill between 275 to 350 degrees F.) Take the ribs off the grill, wrap in aluminum foil and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Bring the remaining glaze back to a simmer over direct heat for several minutes. Garnish the ribs with the cilantro and serve with the remaining glaze on the side.

Whisk the gelatin into the hot water until fully dissolved, then turn off the heat. Add the large piece of orange zest and let steep for 5 minutes. Remove the orange zest from the strawberry gelatin mixture. Whisk in the rum, orange liqueur, lime juice and orange juice, then skim off any foam with a spoon. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag and chill in the fridge until the mixture has a slight jiggle, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, trim off the tip of each strawberry to create a steady base so that it can stand up. Gently hull each berry, being careful not to pierce through the sides or bottom, then enlarge this hole slightly. Place the berries into a muffin tin. (If you have a mini muffin tin, sit one berry in each cup; if using a standard tin, try to nestle 2 into each cup.) Trim a small corner from the plastic bag and pipe the mixture into each berry, being careful not to overfill. Refrigerate until the gelatin has fully set and does not stick to your finger if you touch it, about 4 hours. Top each berry with whipped cream and sprinkle with green sanding sugar.

In a large saute pan over medium heat, add the canola oil and heat the oil to a slight smoke. Add 1 sprig of fresh thyme to the saute pan and sear the sea bass skin side down for 3/4 of the cooking time about 7 minutes. This will give the fish a beautiful crisp skin and golden color. While the fish is cooking start the grits. In a 2 quart saucepot add 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 sprig of fresh thyme. When the butter begins to brown, add the mushrooms and saute until golden. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the grits, add the chicken stock, and reduce to a simmer. When the grits begin to thicken finish with heavy cream and 1 tablespoon of butter. Season with salt and pepper, when ready to serve, remove the thyme sprig. Keep the grits warm on a low temperature. Carefully turn the fish over, to finish the other side. Remove the sea bass and hold in a warm place. In the same saute pan, on the same temperature, add the spinach. It will quickly wilt. Finish the spinach with the remaining whole butter and season with salt and pepper. For presentation, serve this dish in a large soup bowl. Using a ladle, scoop a small amount of grits into the bottom of each bowl. Layer a small amount of spinach on the grits and finish with the sea bass.

Turn off the heat and stir in the chopped chocolate. Let stand for 2 minutes then stir well until smooth. Stir in the butter. Pour into the bowl of an electric mixer, and let cool until set. Fit mixer with a paddle and beat the chocolate mixture on medium speed until aerated and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the liqueur and/or other flavorings. Load ganache into a pastry bag fitted with a half inch plain tube. Line several baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper. Pipe the truffle mixture out to form 1/2-inch balls. Place pans in the refrigerator to chill thoroughly. To coat the truffles, set up your counter like this: tray of chilled centers on your left, bowl of melted tempered chocolate in the middle, large pan filled with cocoa powder on your right. (Reverse this if you&#39;re left handed) Pick up a truffle with your left hand. Touch the palm of your right hand lightly onto surface of tempered chocolate. Drop the truffle into your chocolaty right hand and roll it around to coat. Move your right hand over the pan of cocoa powder, turn your hand over, and drop the coated truffle into the cocoa. Repeat the process to coat about 5 truffles, then pick up a fork with your clean left hand and use it to roll the truffles round a bit in the cacao. (A second person can help do this continuously.) Repeat until the cocoa pan is filled with a lot of truffles. Then wash and dry your hands (or enlist your helper to do this); place the truffles in a strainer and shake it over the pan of cocoa powder to dislodge any excess cocoa. Place finished truffles on another paper-lined pan to set completely. Truffles do not need to be refrigerated. Repeat coating processes with remaining centers. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 39193,&quot;Lobster-Stuffed Potatoes 4 medium Yukon gold potatoes (2 1/2 to 3 pounds), scrubbed and dried Two 1 1/2-pound lobsters<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary<br> 1/4 cup finely chopped scallions, plus more for garnish<br> 1 cup creme fraiche or sour cream<br> 1 cup (about 3 3/4 ounces) shredded Gruyere<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F; position an oven rack in the middle of the oven. Poke holes in the potatoes, then place them on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until just soft, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, place the lobsters in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes\\u2014this will put the lobsters to sleep and calm them down so they&#39;re not so acrobatic when you try to finish them off. Fill a large pot with water and add enough salt so the water tastes like seawater, then bring to a boil. Fill a very large bowl with ice and water. Working with one lobster at a time, in one decisive motion, plunge a chef&#39;s knife into and all the way through the lobster&#39;s head so the head is halved vertically\\u2014this kills it quickly. Break down the lobster by removing the claws and the tail. Discard the lobster carcasses or save them to make lobster stock later. Add the lobster tails to the boiling water and cook for 3 minutes, then add the claws and cook for an additional 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the lobster from the boiling water and set aside. Once cool, crack the claws and tails and remove the meat. Quarter the tails lengthwise and chop. Cut the claw meat in half and chop it into pieces the same size as the tail meat. Let the potatoes cool slightly; leave the oven on. Carefully, without breaking the skin, slice the potatoes in half and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Reserve for later. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and cook until the milk solids sink to the bottom of the pan and turn hazelnut brown and the butter starts to smell nutty, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rosemary and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the scallions and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the scooped potato flesh, salt and pepper to the saucepan and stir to combine. Add the chopped lobster, creme fraiche and 3/4 cup of the Gruyere. Mix until thoroughly combined. Spoon the potato-lobster mixture into the potato shells and place them in a 9-by-13-inch baking pan or on a quarter-sheet tray. Sprinkle the potatoes with the remaining 1/4 cup Gruyere and bake until the potatoes are hot and bubbling, 12 to 15 minutes. Top with the scallions, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 39194,&quot;Birthday Cake with Chocolate Frosting Oil for brushing the pans 2 cups cake flour or 1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pans 1/3 cup cornstarch 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 cup milk, at room temperature 3 large eggs, at room temperature 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 1/4 pounds milk chocolate, chopped 12 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 16-ounce container sour cream (2 cups) 1 tablespoon coffee 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: To make the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Brush two 8-inch round cake pans with oil, line the bottoms with circles of parchment paper, lightly brush the paper and pan with oil, and dust with flour. Put the flour, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of a food processor. Add the sugar and orange zest and pulse a few times to combine evenly. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to dry ingredients. Pulse until the mixture looks like coarse sand, with some pea-size bits of butter, about 5 times. Whisk the milk, eggs, and vanilla together in a liquid measuring cup. With the processor running, pour in the wet ingredients and process to make a smooth batter (this takes less than a minute). Divide the batter between the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool the cakes on a rack for 15 minutes. Then run a knife around the edges of the pans, turn the cakes out onto a plate, and peel off the paper. Flip the cakes upright and cool completely on the rack, about 45 minutes. (This is important-icing a warm cake is not a happy thing). When ready to ice the cake, make the frosting: Put the chocolates in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium for a minute, stir, and repeat until chocolate melts, about 3 minutes in all. (Or put chocolates in a heatproof bowl set over an inch or so of water at a very slow simmer; set the bowl on the pan; don&#39;t let the bowl touch the water. Stir occasionally until smooth.) Let chocolate cool slightly. Stir the sour cream, coffee, and vanilla into the chocolates. Beat with a handheld electric mixer until frosting is silky and fluffy. (Spread frosting soon after making it; it firms up at room temperature.) Set a large flat plate on a large inverted bowl or bottom of a salad spinner (of course, if you have a cake stand, use that). Dab a little frosting in the center of the plate and place a cake layer, top side up, on top. With an offset spatula, scoop about one-third of the frosting onto the cake and spread it evenly to the edge of the cake. Place the other layer on top and press down lightly. Spread another third of the frosting around the sides. Spread the remaining frosting on the top of the cake. Lightly touch the frosting with the back of a spoon to make swirly peaks. Serve immediately or set aside at room temperature for up to 2 hours before serving. If refrigerating the cake, bring to room temperature 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 39195,&quot;Old Bay King Crab Legs 3 pounds frozen cooked king crab legs One 6-ounce box seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay, plus additional as needed<br> 2 lemons<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter<br> Instructions: Put the crab legs in the bottom of a large stockpot, then cover with 4 quarts of water and stir in the seafood seasoning (see Cook&#39;s Note).

Saute the celery and onion until soft and translucent, 10 to 12 minutes.<br> In a large bowl, add the celery, onion, cornbread, stuffing mix, and sage. Stir in the chicken stock and eggs and mix until completely combined. Season with a few grinds of black pepper. The mixture should be fairly soupy. Pour into a lightly greased 9 by 13-inch baking dish. Bake, uncovered, until the dressing is set and golden brown, 45 minutes to an hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Grease a large cast-iron skillet and place in the oven to heat while mixing the batter.<br> In a large bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and a few generous grinds of black pepper.<br> In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter together until combined. Pour into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined (it&#39;s okay if it&#39;s a little lumpy). Pour the batter into the hot cast-iron skillet and bake until the top is golden brown, about 25 minutes.<br> Immediately remove the cornbread from the skillet and allow to cool. The cornbread can be made up to 2 days in advance when using for the dressing. Store until needed, then crumble and follow instructions for the dressing.<br> If enjoying the cornbread immediately (not for the dressing recipe), remove the cornbread from the oven, invert it onto a large plate, and then flip it once more so it is right side up.

Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil. Peel and core the tomatoes: Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Have a large bowl of ice water at the ready. Gently lower the tomatoes into the boiling water and blanch them for 60 seconds. Remove with a strainer and transfer them to the ice water. Once cool, slit the skins; they should peel off easily. Remove the cores with a small paring knife. Discard skins and cores. Chop the vegetables: Wearing latex or plastic gloves, chop the jalapenos finely, removing veins and seeds if you wish to reduce the heat. (If you wish to reduce the heat further, replace some with regular green peppers, but do not increase the total weight of peppers in the recipe.) Chop the onion finely. Chop the tomatoes coarsely. Add the peppers, onions, tomatoes, lemon juice and salt to a large saucepan. Cook the salsa: Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for an additional 10 minutes. Fill and close the jars: Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the salsa in the saucepan. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the salsa into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight. Seal the jars: Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 10 minutes. Remove and cool: Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately. Label and store: Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Barbera, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 39214,&quot;Sauteed Shrimps with Tomatoes and Pernod 6 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced 2 tablespoons Pernod 2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon white pepper 2 1/2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold 1/4 pound Chinese snow peas, julienned 1 bunch chervil, stems trimmed, chopped, for garnish Instructions: Puree tomatoes in a blender until smooth.

Spread half of the cure on a sheet of parchment paper, lay the toro on top, and bury it with the remaining cure. Fold the parchment over, refrigerate, and lightly weigh it down (with a carton of milk, for example). Cure for 1 hour. Remove the toro from the cure, rinse it in cold water, and dry well with a paper towel. Place it in a slotted pan. Light 2 pieces of fig wood over a burner, set the smoking branches in a large roasting pan, and place 4 large ring molds or ramekins in four corners of the pan. Set a wire rack on top of the molds, and a bag of ice on the wire rack. Finally, put the slotted pan over the ice and cover it quickly with tinfoil. Let it cold-smoke for 30 minutes. Vacuum-pack the toro and freeze just until it firms. To serve: Shave the onion bulb, and thinly julienne the tops. On a deli slicer, shave the toro thinly, about 1/8-inch thick. Work slice by slice, laying each on a plate as quickly as possible. When all the toro is sliced, garnish each with several small dollops of caviar, small drops of creme fraiche, the onion bottoms and tops, and daikon sprouts.

Add salt until it tastes like mild seawater. Meanwhile, place the cabbage on a flat surface and hold squarely with one hand. Cut (and discard) the core out of the bottom of the cabbage. Peel off about 16 leaves. Set aside. Cut the remaining inner part of the cabbage in half and thinly slice both halves. Set aside. Add the cabbage leaves to the boiling water and cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes (they may take up to 5 minutes depending on how tough they are). Line a baking sheet with a kitchen towel and transfer the leaves to the baking sheet. Heat a braiser or large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil, onions and garlic. Cook until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the coriander seeds, cumin, crushed red pepper flakes, if using, and 2 teaspoons of the curry powder. Cook so the spices bloom, about 2 minutes. Stir in the chickpeas, shredded cabbage, half of the tomatoes and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Season with salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the cabbage is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the ginger and rice. Taste for seasoning and add more salt if needed. Transfer to a bowl and let cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes. (You should have about 4 cups.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In the same skillet, combine the coconut milk, the remaining tomatoes, remaining teaspoon curry powder, remaining tablespoon vinegar and a pinch of salt. Simmer over medium heat, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, wrap the cabbage rolls. Slice off any thick pieces of stem from the bottom of each cabbage leaf. Place 2 cabbage leaves on a flat surface with the bottoms facing each other and overlapping so the two overlapping leaves form a circle. Place 1/2 cup filling in the center. Fold the sides over the stuffing and roll away from you, firmly, like a burrito. Place seam-side down in the coconut-tomato sauce in the pan. Repeat with the remaining cabbage leaves and filling, yielding 8 rolls total. Sprinkle with salt. Spoon the sauce over the top of the cabbage rolls. Cover the pan and bake until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, 25 to 30 minutes. Glaze again with sauce.

Add the kirsch, pistachio paste, chopped pistachios and food color to the almond paste. The amount of green food color that you add is up to you, I usually add 1 to 2 drops. Knead until well combined. Roll the mixture into a 1-inch-thick diameter cylinder. Try to roll it as evenly as possible. Transfer the cylinder to a parchment paper covered baking sheet. Use a pastry brush dipped in the bittersweet chocolate to coat the cylinder. When the chocolate begins to set but has not hardened, turn the cylinders so you can paint the other side. You can make a thicker chocolate coating by repeating this process a few times. For the last coat, I tapped the chocolate filled pastry brush against the outside of the chocolate to give the candy a spiked texture. When the chocolate begins to set but has not hardened, use a sharp paring knife to slice the cylinder into 1-inch-thick slices. Allow the chocolate to set completely. Serve. Jacques&#39; tip: I used a pastry brush to coat the Branches in chocolate because it is a time saver and I like to see the green when the Branches are cut. You could also use a dipping fork and dip them one by one. Place the sugar, honey and water in a saucepan and bring to a strong boil. Place the almonds in the food processor and grind until coarse. Remove the boiling sugar from the heat and pour over the coarse almonds. Blend until smooth. This may take 10 minutes or more, depending on the strength of the food processor. Remember, food processors are not usually strong enough to yield the same consistency as the almond paste that you can buy. If your mixture is too thick and the food processor is straining, you can add a little Kirsch or simple syrup to the processor. Add the liquid slowly and stop when the processor is moving more freely. The quality of almond paste is determined by how smooth the consistency is. Wrap the almond paste in plastic wrap and allow it to cool. When you are ready to use it, knead in the butter. The butter makes it smooth and not so sticky.<br> How to Temper Chocolate From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.<br> Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 39226,&quot;Honey Brined Chicken with Lemon and Sage 1 (3 to 4 pound) whole chicken 4 ounces honey 4 ounces salt 1 quart water 2 bay leaves 2 cloves garlic sliced 6 sage leaves 6 thin slices lemon seeds removed 2 ounces olive oil Instructions: Mix honey, salt, water, bay leaves, and garlic together.

In a large oven-safe skillet add 1/4 cup of the oil and get the pan warm over medium-low heat on the stovetop. Add the diced onion, garlic, and corn kernels. Saute together until the corn feels cooked to the bite. This takes about 5 minutes. Then, set aside. Make sure the potatoes are very dry then, in a large bowl, toss the diced potatoes with the remaining 1/4 cup oil and season them with salt and pepper. It is important that the potatoes get a nice even coating of oil. Place them onto a large roasting tray. Top the potatoes with the sauteed corn and onion mixture and place in the oven to cook. This should take about 30 to 45 minutes (some ovens may need longer than others). Wait until just before serving to mix in the diced tomatoes and chopped chives and crumble in the goat&#39;s cheese. Adjust the seasoning using salt and pepper, as needed. Keep in a warm place until needed. In a large saucepan add the oil, and saute the garlic and shallots over a gentle heat until translucent. (If you have any trimmings of meat, you would add them at this time). Deglaze the pan with the wine, and add the beef stock and the fresh herbs. Allow this mixture to reduce. It could take 20 to 30 minutes (sometimes longer) at a rolling boil, uncovered. You want the liquid to evaporate to about 1/3 of what you started with (in order to intensify the flavor). Remove from the heat and whisk in the whole stick of butter, and allow to rest. Just before plating, strain the sauce through a chinois (a conical strainer) or some cheesecloth - so you can remove all the vegetables and herbs. Season the fillets with salt and pepper. In a mixing bowl, crumble the blue cheese into the bread crumbs and set aside. Heat an oven-safe saute pan on the stovetop, adding just enough oil to coat the bottom. Cook the fillets in the pan for approximately 2 to 3 minutes on 1 side, then turn them and continue the searing process on the other side for another 2 to 3 minutes. Leave the fillets in the same pan and press a 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick layer of the blue cheese mixture on each of them. Place the steaks into the oven for a further 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks. (Only you know your oven and your own preference for doneness). Remove the steaks from the oven and let rest. (Remember, the meat will continue to cook for another 5 minutes while resting). Take the potato hash (now heated and mixed with the tomatoes and cheese) and, using a 3 to 4-inch diameter circular pastry cutter, fill the cutter with hash in the center of each plate. Place a fillet on top, and drizzle with the port sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 39235,&quot;Oscar-Stuffed Beef Tenderloin with Rosemary Potatoes and Bearnaise 2 king crab legs, meat removed 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 bunch chives, finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 lemon, juiced One 1 1/4-pound beef tenderloin, trimmed of silver skin 6 to 8 thin asparagus, ends trimmed Canola oil, for searing Kosher salt 8 ounces Yukon gold potatoes Canola oil, for frying 1/2 bunch rosemary Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup champagne vinegar 1/4 cup dry white wine 2 medium shallots, minced<br> 1 bay leaf 1 bunch tarragon 3 egg yolks 1 stick butter, melted Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the beef: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Chop the crabmeat and place in a bowl. Add the mayonnaise and chives, and mix to combine. Season with salt, pepper and the lemon juice. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. Make a shallow cut lengthwise into the beef and then continue cutting along the curve, until the beef is a flat sheet. Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper. Spread the crab mixture in an even layer on the beef, then place the asparagus lengthwise over the crab with the tips poking out. Roll up the beef to make a pinwheel, then use butchers twine to tie it together in 1-inch increments. Heat an ovenproof saute pan over high heat and add some oil. Sear the beef on all sides, then transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the internal temperature hits 130 degrees F, 30 minutes. Remove the meat from the pan and rest on a cutting board before slicing. For the potatoes: Place the potatoes in a saucepan filled with cool salted water. Cook the potatoes until tender, then drain and cool. Using your thumb or a spoon, smash the potatoes until they break apart slightly. In a straight-sided saute pan add enough oil to come 1-inch up the sides of the pan. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer reads 365 degrees F. Add the rosemary and fry until crispy, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Fry the potatoes until golden brown and crispy, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with the flaky sea salt and pepper, and garnish with the fried rosemary. For the bearnaise: In a small saucepan set over medium-high heat, combine the vinegar, wine, shallots, bay leaf and half of the tarragon. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Pour through a fine mesh sieve to strain out the solids. In the pitcher of a blender, add the yolks and the vinegar reduction. With the blender running, add one-third of the butter in a slow, steady stream. Once it emulsifies, increase the blender speed to high and add the remaining butter. Add the remaining tarragon leaves, then season with salt and pepper and give it one more buzz. Set aside in a warm spot to hold the sauce. Slice the beef into two portions and serve with the potatoes and bearnaise sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 39236,&quot;Cobb Salad 3 slices bacon, cut in half 1 ripe avocado, split, pitted and diced 2 ripe tomatoes, diced 2 hard-cooked eggs, chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 cups mesclun greens 2 cups shredded cooked chicken 1/2 cup Blue Cheese Dressing, homemade, recipe follows 1 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup crumbled Maytag or other blue cheese (about 3 ounces) 1/2 cup half-and-half 2 tablespoons sour cream 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Spread the bacon out on a paper towel on a microwave-safe plate.

Put the steaks into a resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over. Seal the bag and massage the marinade into the steaks to ensure they are totally coated. Marinate, refrigerated, for as long as it takes to roast the chiles and get the other ingredients ready for the quesadillas. For the roasted poblano chiles: Roast the chiles by using metal tongs to hold them one-by-one over the flame of your stovetop until the skin is totally charred. (If you don&#39;t have a gas stove, you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your oven&#39;s broiler.) When totally blackened, place the chiles in a large resealable plastic bag and seal the bag to allow them to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Then use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Slice the chiles in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds and membranes, then slice into strips. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a grill pan over high heat. Remove the steaks from the marinade and turn the heat to medium low. Grill for 5 to 6 minutes each side for medium rare. Let the steaks rest for 5 minutes, then slice. For the quesadillas: Build the quesadillas by laying some cheese on 6 of the tortillas, then some slices of steak and some of the poblano cl strips. Sprinkle with the tomato and onion. Top with a little more grated cheese and then place the remaining tortillas on top. Melt 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a clean skillet over medium heat and lay a quesadilla in the skillet. Cook until golden on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully flip the quesadilla to the other side, adding another 1/2 tablespoon butter to the skillet at the same time. Continue cooking until the second side is golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with the remaining quesadillas.

It should take about 6 strips per ramekin. Fill each mold with apples and some of the caramel from the pan. Fold over the edges to seal it up completely and sprinkle the tops with a little sugar. Bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. If the tops brown too quickly, cover loosely with foil. When done, the bread will have puffed up slightly, the edges will be brown and the sugar on top will have caramelized. Allow to cool slightly, then run a knife around the edges and invert onto individual plates. Serve with cinnamon sabayon. To make sabayon, combine ingredients in a large mixing bowl and set over a pot of boiling water on low heat, i.e. a double boiler. Whisk (you can use an electric whisk to make it easier) until the mixture becomes light and fluffy and the volume almost doubles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 39251,&quot;Zucchini Boats Stuffed with Succotash 4 large zucchini, cut in half lengthwise 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 shallots, minced 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 1/4 cups corn, freshly cut off the cob, or frozen, thawed 1/2 cup frozen baby lima beans, thawed 1/2 cup Panela cheese or Ricotta 1 egg 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into small pieces Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Beat butter and brown sugar together in the bowl of a mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add the eggs, molasses, and water and beat until well combined. Beat half of the flour mixture into the mixer until blended and smooth. Add the remaining flour mixture and then knead the dough until firm and manageable, but not dry. Add more flour if the dough is too wet.<br> Place the dough in a sealable container or zip-top bag in a cool place for up to 2 hours. If you make the dough ahead of time and refrigerate it, bring to room temperature before working the dough.<br> When ready to roll out the dough, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray your cookie sheets with nonstick spray.<br> Cut out desired shapes, working in small batches and keeping the remaining dough in an airtight container so that it does not dry out. Bake for 11 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces. The gingerbread will be light brown when it is done. Let cool before icing. Combine egg white and powdered sugar in a microwaveable bowl and microwave until the mixture reaches 160 degrees F. The best way to do this is to microwave the mixture on high power, stopping every 20 seconds to take the temperature; it will take about 2 minutes and 40 seconds, but cook time will vary based on microwaves. Make sure to use clean utensils each time you check the icing. The other option is to microwave the mixture for 45 seconds on high, but the consistency will not be as good. Beat on high speed until the icing cools and holds a stiff peak, about 2 minutes. If the icing needs to be thicker, add up to 2/3 cup more sugar; you will probably need to add about 1/3 cup more sugar. Food coloring can be added, if desired. Work with the icing in small amounts, keeping the remaining icing in an airtight container, as it will dry quickly. The icing can be re-beaten, if necessary.<br> Beat all ingredients together in the bowl of a mixer until stiff peaks form. Food coloring can be added, if desired.

Blanch the basil leaves for 30 seconds. Remove basil from boiled water, carefully reserving all the blanching liquid, place in an ice water bath and drain the basil leaves. Set aside. Stir the granulated sugar into the blanching water until dissolved. After the sugar has dissolved, transfer the blanching liquid to a deep container, or canister, that can be partly submerged in a deep bowl of cold water with ample ice to bring the temperature of the boiling water down sharply and quickly. Shock the water until it reaches 90 degrees F. Add gelatin. Stir to dissolve. Continue to shock until chilled (about 70 degrees F). When basil is cold, transfer to blender and puree until smooth, adding enough cold infused liquid (leftover from the ice water bath) to facilitate blending into a smooth puree. Strain through a fine strainer so that some flecks of basil are visible in finished product. Combine basil puree and cooled basil-infused water in an ice cream maker. Process sorbet according to manufacturer&#39;s directions. Maintain under refrigeration between filling ice cream cones. For the Tomato Fondue: Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute the shallots and garlic until they are translucent. Add the sprig of thyme. Add the tomatoes and cook on a low flame until almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the thyme sprig and while the mixture is still warm, puree with the butter with either a blender to an immersion blender. Refrigerate. For the Cones: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare several baking sheets by lining with silpat (silicon nonstick mats) or parchment paper. Combine all the ingredients together, adding enough flour to create a uniform, thick and sticky dough. Chill for half an hour. (Dough keeps well if frozen. Pack in airtight container and defrost before using.) Either place in a pastry bag and pipe with a plain tip 1-inch drops, or use a melon baller to make small balls of approximately 3/4 teaspoon each, or shape by hand and smooth by rolling between the palms of your hands. (Keep dough cold while filling baking sheets.) Place them at least 2 to 3 inches apart, onto prepared baking sheets. Cones will spread considerably during baking. Bake the cones for 4 to 5 minutes in preheated oven until beginning to caramelize. Rotate the sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through baking. Watch carefully as the cones spread thin and will continue to brown after removal from oven. Remove from sheets with a metal spatula while still warm. Roll around the base of a cone shaped small paper cup when still warm. To serve: Fill the cones almost to the top with the room temperature tomato fondue, these can sit like this for about 15 minutes. Scoop the basil sorbet onto the top cone of the cone with a small scoop or melon baller.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. On a work surface, roll the puff pastry into a roughly 10 by 16-inch rectangle. With a sharp knife, trim uneven edges to make a perfect rectangle. Evenly cut off the outer 1 inch of each side of the rectangle in strips; put the puff sheet on the baking sheet. Dip your finger in water and run around the top edges of the rectangle and replace the removed strips of pastry along the edges of the sheet, pressing lightly to adhere. With a fork, pierce the interior of the tart shell to prevent rising; do not pierce the adhered edges. Bake until the outer edges have puffed and are golden in color; about 15 minutes. Set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions and thyme sprigs and season well with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to brown. Add the stock, a tablespoon at a time, as the pan gets dry, scraping and stirring the brown bits that are stuck to the bottom oft the pan. When the onions are caramelized to a dark golden color, remove from the heat and discard the leafless thyme sprigs (the leaves fall off while cooking). When ready to serve, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Evenly spread the caramelized onions on the cooked pastry shell and heat in the oven until warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes.

Melt the chocolate and cocoa butter over a double boil. Bring the ingredients for the simple syrup to a boil. Place the corn syrup in a bowl and stir in the hot simple syrup. Pour this over the melted chocolate. Stir until it thickens. Place it in the refrigerator for at least one hour. The modeling chocolate will have the consistency of play dough when you work it with your hands. Divide it into three pieces. Use the food color paste to color one piece pink and one piece green. Work the food color paste into the modeling clay to distribute the color until it is the desired color.<br> To make the ribbon: Take a ball of each color. Use the palms of your hands to roll each ball into a rope about 1/2-inch thick. Place the ropes side by side and gently press together. Use a rolling pin to roll out the ropes to create a tri-colored ribbon. Use cornstarch to \\flour\\ the work surface. The rolled chocolate should be about 1/8-inch thick. Cut a strip about 30 inches long and about 11/2-inches wide and wrap it around the brim of the hat. You may need to trim the ends. To make the leaves and rose petals: Roll out each colored chocolate plastic using cornstarch to \\flour\\ the work surface. The rolled chocolate should be about 1/8-inch thick. To make the flowers, use 2-inch diameter cutter to cut circles from the rolled chocolate. You need to gently thin the top edge of each circle and you can do that with the end of an offset spatula or a hard-boiled egg. Gently press the spatula or egg against the top of the flower to thin the edge (like a real flower petal). Use 11/2 and 2-inch oval cutters to cut out the leaves. You can also do this with a paring knife. Use the back of a paring knife dipped in cornstarch to make the veins of the leaves.<br> To make the center: All flowers have some kind of center.

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Make the pastrami rub by stirring together the salt, pepper, celery seeds, coriander seeds, garlic powder, mustard seeds and paprika in a mixing bowl. Rub both sides of the loins with the mustard, then loosely sprinkle the pastrami rub on the loins (don\\u2019t rub it in). Insert a meat thermometer into the side of 1 loin. Set up a smoker on your stove top by adding the wood chips to the bottom of a foil-lined 4-inch-deep hotel pan. Turn on the heat and allow the wood chips to light, then allow some of the smoke to burn off, about 5 minutes. Place a 2-inch-deep perforated hotel pan on top. Add the loins and cover the pan with foil. Transfer the smoker to the oven and cook until the internal temperature of the loin is 125 degrees F, about 20 minutes. Place a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat and add the 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place the loins in the pan and sear on one side until deeply golden brown and crusty, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and butter. When the butter has melted and starts to foam, baste the loins with it. Flip the loins and sear the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more, continuing to baste with the butter. Transfer the loins to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. To serve, slice the loins and top with the Grilled Rye and Quick Pickle Salad. Spoon some of the extra dressing over the top and finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Place the jalape?os, Fresno chiles and shallots in a glass jar and pack them in tightly. Combine the rice wine vinegar, white wine vinegar, 1/2 cup water, the sugar, peppercorns, garlic, bay leaf and 1 tablespoon salt in a nonreactive saucepan and bring to a gentle boil, whisking until the sugar and salt dissolve. Strain the hot liquid into the glass jar until the jalape?os, Fresno chiles and shallots are completely submerged, then set aside for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Place the rye bread slices on the pan and toast on both sides until slightly charred. Tear the bread into rustic chunks and set aside. Make the dressing by whisking together the olive oil, honey, mustard, lime juice and salt to taste in a small bowl. In a medium bowl, toss together the celery leaves, grilled bread and drained pickled jalape?os, Fresno chiles and shallots. Right before serving, add some of the dressing (reserving the extra) and toss to coat. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 39272,&quot;Pizza alla Napoletana (Neapolitan Pizza) Cornmeal, for sprinkling 1/4 recipe Master Pizza Dough, shaped in 7-inch round (see next recipe) 1/2 cup thinly-sliced cherry tomatoes (4 to 6) 1/4 teaspoon coarse salt 1 heaping tablespoon torn fresh basil leaves 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven with pizza stone to 525 degrees.

In a mixing bowl add the pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Spread the softened unsalted butter over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly over the dough. Starting with the long side, roll up the dough tightly ending with the seam-side down. Cut 10 slices each about 1/2-inch thick. Place in 2 (9 by 13-inch) greased baking dishes and cover with a kitchen towel. Allow the rolls to rise in a warm environment for an additional 15 to 20 minutes. Brush with melted butter before baking Bake at 400 degrees F until the tops are golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush tops with melted butter and cool on cooling rack. Drizzle with prepared cream cheese glaze. To make Cream Cheese Glaze: In a mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar, cream cheese, butter, milk, and vanilla. To make Rapid Rolls: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the instant yeast, and warm water. Let it activate for 5 minutes until bubbly. Stir in the honey. On low speed, add 1/2 cup melted butter, 2 teaspoons salt, and eggs. Slowly add the flour cup-by-cup until fully incorporated and the dough pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl. Add more flour if it is too sticky. Portion the dough into 24 even servings. Form the rolls into desired shape and let rise approximately 20 minutes, or until doubled in size. Place the rolls in a cast iron skillet or on a baking sheet. Brush the rolls with melted butter. Bake for 25 minutes until the tops are golden brown. Remove from the oven and brush with more melted butter, and sprinkle with a little salt.

Pour the eggs into the well and use a fork to gradually flick the flour into the eggs, whisking in thoroughly as you go. Once all of the flour and eggs have been incorporated into a very shaggy dough, form it into a ball with your hands. Knead the dough, dusting with more flour if the dough is too sticky, or moistening your hands with water if the dough is too dry, until it has the texture of smooth leather, about 5 minutes. Wrap it in plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for 25 minutes to rest. Use your pasta machine to roll out the dough and cut fresh linguine, following the pasta machine&#39;s instructions. Dust with flour and cover the freshly-cut noodles with a damp towel while you work, and until ready to cook. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, and season with a handful of salt. For the sauce: Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the butter, and once it melts, add the asparagus, peas, string beans, garlic scapes, onions and a pinch of salt. Cook just until the onions soften and the scapes are fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the cream and chicken stock and cook to reduce, about 3 minutes. Add the fresh pasta to the pot of boiling water, and cook until the pasta is just al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pasta and transfer to the pan with the primavera sauce, then transfer everything to a serving bowl. Toss everything to coat, and taste for seasoning. Garnish with fresh Parmesan and basil and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 39315,&quot;Dutch Oven Apple Crisp 10 cups apples, peeled and sliced 1/4 cup lemon juice 1 tablespoon lemon zest 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup golden raisins 1 1/2 sticks butter 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups light brown sugar 1 1/2 cups oats 2 tablespoons lemon zest 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon ground cardamom Vegetable oil or cooking spray Instructions: Combine all of the ingredients for the apple mixture in a bowl.

Using a very sharp knife, thinly slice the pork crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick pieces. Transfer to a large zip-top freezer bag set inside a large bowl and refrigerate until ready to marinate. In a medium bowl, whisk the lime zest and juice, orange zest and juice, garlic, salt and recado de todo clase. Pour over the pork, seal the bag and squeeze the bag to coat the pork. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 90 minutes. Prepare a gas grill for high heat. Use tongs and an old, clean kitchen towel to brush the grates with oil. (Alternatively, prepare a charcoal grill for high heat.) Remove the pork from the marinade, shaking off any excess; brush off the garlic and zests. Grill the pork, turning once, until charred, for 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut into 2-inch pieces. Grill the onion quarters, turning them occasionally, until charred on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board. Cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces and separate the individual layers of the onion. Arrange the pork on a large platter. Top with the charred onion, radish slices, avocado slices and cilantro.

Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and grease.<br> Toss the cheese and seeds together in a small bowl. Sit a 3 1/2in (9cm) ring or cookie cutter on one of the baking sheets and sprinkle a small handful of the cheese mixture into it, in a thin layer. Carefully lift the ring off to reveal a neat-edged disk of Parmesan and lay a lollipop stick on top, with the tip of the stick touching the middle of the disk. Repeat with the remaining cheese and sticks to make 10 in total (leaving about 1 1/4in/3cm spaces between them to allow for any spreading during cooking).<br> You should have a little Parmesan left over, so use it to cover up the part of the lollipop stick resting on the disk.<br> Bake in the oven for 5 minutes, swapping to a different shelf halfway through. The cheese should be lightly golden and bubbling.<br> Remove from the oven and slide the paper off the baking sheets and onto a rack to help speed up cooling. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes until the lollipops have become crisp. Very carefully remove each one with a spatula.
