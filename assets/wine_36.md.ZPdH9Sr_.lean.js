Defines balance, harmony and style.","designation":"Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"Odd as it may sound, it smells like coconut cream pie with a baked meringue topping, all swimming in apricot pur e. It's sweet but not achingly so, at 7.1% residual sugar, with enough acidity to balance it. It has a luscious, creamy mouthfeel. It seems young and tight despite the opulence; probably it will improve with age in a cool cellar.

In the mouth, the fruit really comes forward; there's impressive depth and body here, and a lushness that's balanced by a long finish with fresh acidity. Should age for up to 5 years maybe more. Only problem? Finding some. There were only 100 cases produced.","designation":"Piner Ranch Vyd"},{"country":"US","description":"Alexander Valley has a rep for soft, forward Cabs of great deliciousness but, perhaps, a lack of complexity.

Match this one with a good seafood risotto.","designation":"Superiore"},{"country":"US","description":"Champagne is the model for this ultraclassy wine. The aromas explode with toast, lees and the most delicately fragrant citrus and raspberry notes. It turns rich and subtle in the mouth. There's a suggestion of fruit, but it's really quite dry.

This is seriously good sparkling wine.","designation":"Millennium Cuv e"},{"country":"fr","description":"Rich and toasty, with tiny bubbles. The bouquet is laced with honey and vanilla scents. The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. There's good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish.

If anything, this bottle will put you in a boisterous mood and keep any party hardy.","designation":"Premier Brut"},{"country":"fr","description":"The extraordinary package, created by fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier, is so over-the-top that it is truly worth owning in and of itself. A hand-stitched, red vinyl body suit, tailored to the bottle's seductive curves, has been laced, from bottom to top, onto the bottle, like an elegant, racy woman's boot.

This is serious Pinot. It comes across deep and powerful in the mouth, suggesting plums, sweet blackberries and a hint of sun-warmed tomato, and finishes with a blast of complex oak and spice. Complex now, it calls for complex dishes the best game birds you can find and will probably be even better with some time in the cellar.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Abel  lays claim to being the third-oldest Champagne house in Reims, and this stylish, sophisticated and thoroughly excellent bottle provides ample evidence that this is an important producer.

Made in the Bordeaux style, with 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc, it's got ripe black-currant and plum aromas and flavors and a solid dose of toasty new French oak. Very balanced and complex. The tannins are soft enough to drink it tonight, but it can also age, if you want.","designation":"Profile"},{"country":"fr","description":"Jacquart makes a full-bodied, ripe style of Champagne, with tiny, effusive bubbles.

The delicate flavors of fresh apple, pear and citrus are further enhanced with pretty cinnamon spice.","designation":"Brut Mosa?que"},{"country":"fr","description":"Sharp, spicy fruit flavors lead into a thick, edgy, crisply defined sparkling wine with plenty of power.

Time should make this an even better bottle.","designation":"Extra Dry"},{"country":"US","description":"If you must open this now, let it breath for a while because it's dumb, as they say, on opening. Airing and swirling reveal more earthy things than fruit. There's a hint of truffles, of bark, and you almost have to close your eyes to imagine the blackberries and cherries buried deep down inside, but they're there. You can taste them in the midpalate, and the finish lasts for a long time.

With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.","designation":""},{"country":"cl","description":"A refreshing wine, with nicely ripened fruit and exceptional balance, that's pleasant in every way and a super value, too.

All the parts come together in this super-enjoyable wine. At this price, it's a great value.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Spicy black fruit, with bell pepper, black pepper and toast adding complexity.

Editors' Choice.","designation":"Maquehua"},{"country":"US","description":"Always a bit herbaceous, this year the underlying leanness shows in rather green fruit, veering into bell pepper, dill, mint and oregano. All the oak in fr and America can't really make the fruit any riper. But the oak does add smoky, creamy, vanilla notes and sweetness, too.

It's also very dry, clean and organized enough to call a good value.","designation":"Blanc de Blancs Brut"},{"country":"it","description":"Seems confected, with sweet Jolly Rancher aromas playing against taut acidity. A light, tart offering best paired with tomato-based sauces fine with spaghetti at your local Italian joint.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Terrale translates as  product of the earth,  and that's about all one can say about this wine. The grapes used are Catarrato, a white variety indigenous to Sicily, and the ubiquitous Trebbiano. A light apple nose starts it off, and the structure is good, with adequate acids. However, the finish is short and lacks flavor.","designation":"Bianco"},{"country":"US","description":"Intense and earthy aromas of perfectly ripe berries, chocolate and a little natural funk in the form of mushroom.

A cinnamon nuance provides an exotic edge to the otherwise straightforward, somewhat tart cherry palate. Buttery oak and more tangy cherries dominate the finish.","designation":"Lewman Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Not from old vines, but cloned from them in the pursuit of complexity. This is a very young, backward Zin, dominated by dusty, earthy notes, like a whiff of south-facing barnboard under a hot summer sun.

Might be more user-friendly with a few years of aging.","designation":"Heritage Clone"},{"country":"US","description":"A very light and flowery nose starts the package rolling, followed by light candied raspberry on the palate. Features a smooth texture throughout, with the slightest notes of cherry cough drops and fruit punch.

If any one thing carries the nose it's some burnt popcorn. The fruity palate is jammy and hard-driving. This one is about robust berry fruit rather than nuance. Give it a couple of years to lose its youthful spunk.","designation":"La Boheme"},{"country":"US","description":"Very deep, lush and welcoming in the nose there's an unmistakable heavy color and look to it. It's a ripe and ready wine that should pick up complexity with bottle age.

Solid tannins and the fine depth of fruit indicate that two or three years cellaring are merited.","designation":"Seven Springs Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Just pop the cork, let it breathe and enjoy it as it does its thing. One of the best Adelsheim wines this taster can remember. Full of red plum, raspberry and currant, with the right acidity for it to rock and roll.

Opens with blueberry, rhubarb, bacon and cedar aromas. From front to back it sits on a light frame, and on the palate it dances. Shows some buttered-toast and wood on the finely etched finish. Classy and lean, not sugary sweet. Elegant, in the Bethel Heights house style.","designation":"Southeast Block Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"One of America's favorite sparkling wine houses proves it's still got the right moves. This brut-style wine, with Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, begins with delicate but assertive aromas of strawberry and lime.

It's got a nice full body to it, with some creaminess in the mouth. Proper acids and a good application of oak keep it balanced.

Unfortunately, the bitterness carries through on the palate, with a rubbery quality in the finish.","designation":"Prestige Cuv e Classe M"},{"country":"es","description":"A simple and slightly sweet sparkler, although it's labeled seco, or dry. Vegetable-herb notes on the nose open to sweet and earthy flavors. The bead is large and the mouthfeel very soft. Useful for a toast with your older aunties who tend to like 'em sweet and fine for mimosas with brunch.","designation":"Seco Reserva"},{"country":"it","description":"The ripasso technique consists of passing the already completed  normal  Valpolicella back over the lees of the Amarone in the spring after vinification of the latter is complete. This results in a minor refermentation, adding extra alcohol and flavor. If the latter occurred in this particular version, it is not very evident. There is a modest amount of dry fruit present, but the mouth-searing acids and mouth-drying tannins hurt this wine.","designation":"Ripasso"},{"country":"pt","description":"The essence of jalape?os may be found in this new-wave Sauvignon Blanc. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all there is. It's a bit simple and even seems a bit hollow or overcropped, with a short finish.","designation":"QM"},{"country":"US","description":"Light in color, almost rusty. Fleshy aromas of chunky, brambly fruit also offer a lot of pepper, both black and green. With good body and texture, you're hopeful for more in the mouth, but the fruit is marred by the essence of veggies, even tasting a bit stewed.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This beery bubbly, with its flinty fruit and mouth-puckering acidity, is fine for parties or using as a mixer.

That's a long time, and American oak has strong aromas and flavors, perhaps too strong. The tannins are pretty and supple, and the fruit that's buried under all that wood seems lovely, but this wine should have been released two years ago.","designation":"Coastal Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Starts out with rough, earthy blackberry and cassis aromas, with deeper notes of plum and chocolate.

At this price, though, you can't expect miracles.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Everything else is okay in this clean, fresh wine, but the meager amount of apple fruit puts it in the lightweight category. Apple orchards abound in the Trentino, and a good dollop of that kind of fruit is what this wine needs to be better and bolder.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This is a very light Pinot Noir.

The flavors are firmly on the peach side. It's clean, but simple, and finishes a little sugary and syrupy.","designation":"Spumante"},{"country":"fr","description":"An assertive, almost fizzy Champagne that shows crisp, even steely flavors before a short finish.

Tasted twice with consistent notes.","designation":"Marchese Di Villamarina"},{"country":"es","description":"Instantly recognizable in its distinctive black bottle, this perennial favorite shouts  Par-tay!  right out of the glass. Beery, tart and tangy, it's fine by itself but even better as a mixer bubbly.","designation":"Cordon Negro Brut"},{"country":"fr","description":"Exhibits superripe Grenache aromas and flavors of apricots and cherries, all in a midweight format.

Grilled lamb would make a fine accompaniment.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a country-style Cab that won't break the bank but offers solid value.

Tannins are soft but fine, and it finishes very dry.","designation":"Coastal"},{"country":"US","description":"Curiously not as satisfying as the regular bottling (reviewed May 2000), the reserve sacrifices prettiness in search of power. Too much alcohol adds heat to the mouthfeel, and a vinegary nose distracts from the good fruit.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"es","description":"A pronounced scent of lilacs marks the nose of this wine, making it distinctive, to say the least.

The underlying aromas are of lime, but there's something strong and earthy that suggests dust, warm tree bark, or acrid honey. That penetrating flavor follows through in the mouth, where it turns a little sweet. But crisp acidity and good bubbles keep things balanced and cheerful.","designation":"Semi-Seco Reserva"},{"country":"fr","description":"There's a distinct and unmistakable scent of rotten eggs in this wine, which usually indicates excessive amounts of sulfur were used during bottling. Apart from that we have a rough and tumble, rustic style with big fruit and a yeasty, chewy finish.","designation":"Chardonnay Premier Cru Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"This has to be one of the last 1996's released, and it shows its age in the bricky-orange color around the rim and the bouquet, which is beginning to be dominated by dried-fruit and cigar-box notes.

Yet it's got some interesting complexities, and fans of mature Pinots will find lots to dwell on.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"It begins with classic brut aromas of citrus, peach and strawberry, with oak, smoke and yeast shadings. But it's surprisingly sweet. Well made and clean, with crisp acidity and nice restraint to the fruit.

Solid winemaking keeps the Pinot Noir character correct here, but the vintage's fruit essentially lacks the desired depth or ripeness.","designation":""},{"country":"es","description":"A pleasant, softly fruity bubbly with a tad more sweetness than you'd think from  Extra Dry.

Big and yet refreshing, sparked by some lively spritz. The finish echoes the anise and blends in some bright lime notes as well.","designation":"Couto de Frades"},{"country":"it","description":"The grapes are Carignan and Merlot. Raim translates as  grape  in the Catalan dialect spoken in some parts of Sardinia. The aromas are light cherry plus some Brettanomyces.

To be released Spring 2001.","designation":"Blanc de Blancs"},{"country":"US","description":"Full-throttle lime, peach and strawberry aromas come through on the nose, with a trace of toast.

Kosher, too.","designation":"Cremant d'Alsace"},{"country":"US","description":"Don't look for Napa-esque depth or richness in South Coast Cabs. The frame is leaner, the flavors more austere.

It could use a bit more acidity to balance out all that sugar.","designation":"Reserve Late Harvest"},{"country":"US","description":"The lightest of the Thornton lineup marches to the beat of a different drummer. Dominated by Muscat Canelli, the aromas suggest ripe pears, buttered cinnamon toast and candied orange peel, but it's not really sweet.

All in all, it's good, unconventional stuff.","designation":"Cuv e de Frontigan"},{"country":"es","description":"Bone-dry and austere, this is a wine for people who feel that fruit and sugar have no place in a sparkling wine.

Winemaker Steve Test has given this one a little French oak but otherwise has chosen to let the vineyard, in Napa's warm northeast corner, express itself.","designation":"Juliana Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"Right away it strikes a fairly harmonious chord it's fresh smelling, with good weight in the mouth. Nice lemon and grapefruit flavors carry a pithy edge, and there's plenty of length to the finish. The steely backpalate is where you get the acidity. As a whole, it's food-friendly and it shouldn't disappoint.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Redolent with aromas of pears, strawberries and kirsch, this is a tasty, forward wine that's more charming than sturdy. Less concentrated than you might expect for the appellation, this should be drunk up quickly for its simply delicious fruit.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A very oaky wine, displaying bright, flashy vanilla spice aromas riding on top of ripe tropical fruit ones.

A well-made Chard from an increasingly well-regarded region of Monterey County.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This has got to be one of the earliest releases of '99 Merlot and it smells young, with grapey, syrupy aromas reminiscent of Beaujolais Nouveau.

Best Buy.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Exuberantly fruity, with dark stone-fruit, milk-chocolate, licorice, and oaky-spicy notes.

Dry, with some elegance, and fully ready for immediate consumption.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"You have to hand it to Rodney Strong for being able to produce 71,000 cases of this wine at such an affordable price. It shares the ripe peach, green-apple, butter, smoke and spice notes of much more expensive Chards, and the crisp acidity, although not the complexity or opulence. But it's a very nice wine, and a good value.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Soft and citrusy, with streaks of lime and mineral and a surprisingly long, Burgundian finish. Clean and steely, with no trace of oak. The fine ripe fruit speaks volumes. Best Buy.","designation":"Les Deux Moulins"},{"country":"US","description":"A plummy and rich nose, but there's also some varnish to it, even some paint thinner. In the field of big, high-priced players, this one doesn't make the starting lineup. It's a tad too hollow, and while good enough, it seems short on dimension.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A pleasant wine with some real complexity.

It's a little light in the midpalate, but so well balanced you hardly notice.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Fresh and lightly spicy, it shows lemon and grapefruit flavors and a deft balance. Some of the fruit comes from the excellent Otis Vineyard.

Those fruits come out on the palate, with a solid dose of spicy oak.

Here is a nicely balanced wine with a bit more heft than the regular Kiona bottling. Lime, citrus and banana flavors dominate.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"A very nice wine due to its good varietal character and clean, refreshing quality. Virtually oakless, its citrus, hay, and melon notes shine through. It's dry and tart enough for oysters or clams, and almost anything with goat cheese.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Aromas of red berries, cherries, cedar and herbs open this reserved offering. Lean and a bit astringent on the palate now, it offers some berry, pepper and chocolate notes on the palate. It never really opens up, and even thins a bit at the end. Regrettably, it fails to impress in this company.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Has a compelling and complex nose offering pepper, cinnamon, and black cherry, with earthy accents. A medium-weight wine, it shows good balance and sweet-and-sour flavors. The buttered black-toast/popcorn element rides a bit heavy on the cherry fruit. Herzog is on the right track; a few years ago a wine of this quality bearing the Kosher label was inconceivable.","designation":"Special Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Has a decent texture on the palate, but some difficult earthy, even horsey aromas are hard to get past. The sweet currant, chocolate, and espresso flavors that follow are pleasant, and the wine finishes dry, with chalky tannins and a bitter cocoa note.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Barrel fermented, with toasty highlights. Despite the new oak, it retains its refreshing green-apple and citrus fruit in the tightly wound, concentrated, tart finish. Needs some time in the bottle to smooth the rough edges.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Is it the lucid rosy color or the exotic flavor that invokes images of a well-made cup of tea? In this unusual rendering of the world's most idiosyncratic grape, it's both. Floral, light, even dainty, it tastes of strawberries, cream and a little woody spice. For an airy, light-bodied Pinot, this one scores points for expression. The finish is lovely.","designation":"Les Tonnelles"},{"country":"au","description":"This dark, rich, earthy wine is notable for its ultrasoft but pleasing tannins. The fruit veers toward plum and blackberry, but it's not superfruity rather, it's more restrained, with notes of sun-dried tomatoes and herbs.

The plum and blackberry fruit is chunky, not stylish. The acids are bold, and the tannins are bulky, which masks what charm might be hidden beneath.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"This very fruity blend has some interesting and complex notes on the nose, with herb, chocolate and sweet spice elements. A choice quaff that is soft on the palate, with lots of sweet fruit, it has a slightly tart, bittersweet chocolate note that provides a pleasingly drier, more serious finish than expected.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"Very fresh and accessible, with bright, fairly sweet fruit.

Will probably open up with age, but needs food to show its best.","designation":""},{"country":"fr","description":"Fresh, tight and properly crisp, there's nothing here to put it in the California-blowsy category. Stone-fruit aromas lead into peach and green-apple flavors. Not much depth, but plenty of refreshing fruit and palate-cleansing verve.

With its high acidity and bright fruit, it's a tangy, food-friendly wine.","designation":"Helmick Hill Vineyard"},{"country":"fr","description":"A Merlot-Cabernet blend that starts out a little awkward and then really finds its legs. This is a perfect  beginner's  Bordeaux, in that it's fruity, clean and precise. The lack of complexity and high-end nuances doesn't hurt it at all. A little overoaked, but with airing out it tastes quite good. And it has the stuffing to match with hearty foods. Best Buy.","designation":"Bordeaux Rouge"},{"country":"US","description":"Usually exuberantly rich and opulent, this wine, from this vintage, is comparatively thin.

The sense of balance and fresh mouthfeel would make it perfect with crab. Best Buy.","designation":"Dry"},{"country":"US","description":"Pretty nose with smoke, cherries and chocolate mixed. Plums and cherries do the fruit dance, creating a balanced, approachable, light-to-medium-weight wine that's drinkable right now.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Smells very earthy and funky, with a strong hit of green pepper.

Tangy, with moderate to high acidity, and a light, but not insubstantial mouthfeel. The juicy red-fruit flavors are offset by a touch of complexity in the form of a mild tarry note.

It's not especially complex, and best drunk young, but this is a style of wine that turns white-wine drinkers into red- wine lovers.","designation":"Arabesque"},{"country":"fr","description":"Features honeyed, overripe melons that carry only a hint of botrytis. Quite sweet and rich, it's forward, showing plenty of charm while lacking the depth and backbone to improve.

All in all an enjoyable and refreshing light Chardonnay, with some complexity and style.","designation":"Les Mures"},{"country":"fr","description":"Opens with mild petrol and light apricot aromas, layered with butter. But before you discard it as over-the-top, notice the fine acids and long soda-cracker finish. It does well with food and leaves a positive overall impression.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This is a dark-colored, dense wine, reeking of aromas fresh from the fermenting tank: juicy blackberry and plum and a strong herbal, earthy streak like mulch and mushrooms.

Cellar for three years before trying.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"Quite full and toasty, with toffee, butterscotch and tropical fruits, this wine offers lots of weight and a long finish with lemon, butter, and big oak flavors.

High-toned and slightly hot in the finish.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"This is the first time Hedges has made Syrah, and it's limited to just 90 cases.

Nice value, too.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Candied red fruits and a weedy note on the nose immediately indicate that this is on a different track.

Drink now.","designation":"Rancho Salina Vyd"},{"country":"US","description":"Dense cedar and toast aromas wrapped around a core of blackberry fruit with nutmeg accents mark the nose and palate of this big, lavishly oaked wine.

Bone dry, this wine offers bracing acidity, a crisp fruity core, good focus, and a hint of vanilla on the finish. Very pretty nose; fine food wine.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"There are some lovely cherry and Asian spice notes on the nose, then heavy toast and earth elements take over.

It's way on the citrus, hay, and gooseberry side of the chart (as it is in every vintage), making for a lean, tart, almost sharp drink that some will find sour despite softening with 6% S millon and lees aging. Others will appreciate the sleek, almost severe elegance. Again, a wine that absolutely demands the right foods.","designation":"To-Kalon Vineyard Reserve"},{"country":"fr","description":"A round and attractive white wine with slightly musky pear and sweet hay aromas that open to melon and mild peach flavors. The pear element returns along with a slight spicy note on the clean finish, which shows good length.","designation":"C?te de Rouffach"},{"country":"fr","description":"From the C?te de Rouffach area, this is a wine that's eminently alive. Apricot, nectarine and mango comprise the all-fruit nose and palate. All in all, it's like a peachy parfait.

A bit of a love-it-or-leave-it wine, as its extreme oaking leaves the impression of espresso and char. The finish is on the short side, and the body a bit hollow given its gigantic proportions.","designation":"Estate Bottled"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine's nose offers cherry and caramel, but also unusual tomato and other vegetable notes, though in an appealing manner.

Tannins are soft and plump.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"If you like oaky, creamy Sauvignon Blanc built along Chardonnay lines, this one's for you.

It's actually from a warm easterly section of Napa, Pope Valley, that seems to coax honeydew and watermelon flavors from the grapes.

Good mouthfeel and a lengthy finish complete the package.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Plummy aromas, black-cherry and oak, and accents of vanilla and cream. It's tight now, fairly begging for time to unfold. Presently the cherry core borders on tart. With time it should soften.","designation":"Founder's Estate"},{"country":"fr","description":"Crisp, with grapefruit aromas and flavors, this is textbook Loire Sauvignon Blanc. A mild smoky, mineral note adds complexity, and the full fruit is clean and ripe, yet not at all sweet. Pulls it all off with lots of class and style. This is still the model the nzers are using in their Sauvignon Blanc efforts.","designation":"Pouilly Fume"},{"country":"US","description":"The bouquet offers intensely jammy prune and black-currant fruit, with tobacco and vanilla shadings making an appearance. Dark blueberry flavors, with some mint and a light orange-citrus note. Full grapey mouthfeel, a long finish, and dusty tannins. Almost drinkable now, but best after 2002 and until 2010.","designation":"Elevage"},{"country":"US","description":"Dark, rich, and ultraripe yet balanced, this wine has plenty of charm.

Not great wine, but completely satisfying, and one that most will find lip-smackingly delicious.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A big mouth-filling offering with lots of oak/cedar and coffee/mocha shadings. Sweet-and-sour stewed berry flavors and black-toast accents play on the fairly large-scaled palate. A tart chocolate note enters on the finish, which displays firm but fine tannins. It's the best Cabernet we've ever tasted from this Kosher winery, and it should improve over the next two to four years.","designation":"Special Edition Warnecke Vyd"},{"country":"US","description":"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred.","designation":"Concept"},{"country":"US","description":"On one level this is a straightforward wine, varietally correct with lemony flavors.

The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak.

It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing.

Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A little reticent and cool at first; patient airing allows it to open up and display raspberry, cola and herbal aromatics, followed by spicy black-cherry fruit.

Probably at its youthful best now.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Lots of inky, jammy aromas of black fruit set up the red-fruit palate that is covered with a blanket of powerful oak.

It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.","designation":"Winners Circle"},{"country":"US","description":"Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish.

The plummy fruit and soft woody elements make their mark without being too forward.","designation":"Cerviolo"},{"country":"US","description":"Anticipation runs high for a wine like this. The aroma is all black currants and oak, with an herbaceous streak. Tastes very young and tight. Tannins are creamy, but considerable. The oak also is considerable. Seems to have the fruity stuffing and balance for the long haul. Still, even in its youth, it's quite an impressive wine, defined by elegance and pedigree.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The third and most expensive of this winery's current Zin releases. A complex, elegant wine, with currant, berry, and spice aromas and flavors. It drinks very dry, and the tannins are sturdy--they kick in on the finish--but it's soft enough to drink now.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A strong briar-patch nose is accented by cola, creamy vanilla, and finely toasted oak. It's much the classic Rutherford big boy, with black-currant, licorice and tobacco notes. Yet it remains cool and light, not heavy or corpulent. Fine tannins close it out, leaving us with a more positive impression than in our original review, which appeared in the July issue.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Unlike a transluscent soda-style P.G., this one has some gray color and immediately shows richness in the nose.

Doug McCrea, like David Lake at Columbia, makes Syrah that is built for aging.","designation":"Boushley Vineyards"},{"country":"US","description":"Vintage after vintage this exciting winery nails it with its Gris, which captures aromas of pear and ripe melon, infuses them with cloves and spice, and freshens the palate with a zesty, leesy texture. Low yields, great soil and long, slow fermentation are the keys to its success.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Zin has gotten increasingly expensive, but the upside is vintners are seeking out old vine examples, and this is a good one.

Only 478 cases produced.","designation":"Arcus Estate"},{"country":"it","description":"What a luscious, sumptuous Barbaresco. Rich black cherries and spice wash over the palate, finishing with hints of black tea. Seductive and elegant; the low acidity and mild tannins suggest it will be best consumed young, say over the next 5--8 years. A wine that's still under the Ceretto umbrella; there's just a different name on the bottle.","designation":"Bricco Asili"},{"country":"US","description":"Very intense, very extracted and very Californian from head to toe. Marvelous fruit potency courses through this muscular blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and a few other red grapes.

A sure bet to partner grilled beef or braised lamb shanks.","designation":"Alexis Red Table Wine"},{"country":"it","description":"In this world of increasingly pumped-up reds, this is a throwback, but with a lot of purity due to the great vintage.

Good, but a bit short and light on the back end.","designation":"Limited Release"},{"country":"au","description":"Very bright, even sharp, this unoaked (Aquercus means without oak) Chardonnay reads very much like a Sauvignon Blanc.

Great zing, but a different thing.","designation":"Aquercus Unwooded"},{"country":"au","description":"A tannic but friendly quaffer that improves with time in the glass.

Nice flavors in this pretty wine.

This one qualifies, with its fine mouthfeel and good intentions. But a strong bell-pepper streak in the nose and palate is too dominant; would be better with bolder, sweeter fruit, because the winemaking seems good.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"Verdelho is a grape from Iberia that the Aussies are increasingly working with. The lime and herb qualities in this offering are attractive, and the mouthfeel is slightly chalky, in a positive manner. Tangy, with a sweet-spicy finish, this is an appealing, somewhat softer alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.","designation":""},{"country":"pt","description":"Shows some of the weakness of the vintage in its rather tart profile and flavors of red fruits and cranberries. A good effort, just short of the usual standard at this estate.","designation":"Vinho Tinto"},{"country":"au","description":"This unusual blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Merlot comes across as the beneficiary of lots of sun.

A little grapey, but spicy and leathery enough to qualify as a good quaffing wine rather than just ponderous grape juice.","designation":"Black Sheep"},{"country":"nz","description":"Smoky aromas mix with scents of green herbs in an offering that's reminiscent of some Chinons. Shows good depth on the palate and admirable complexity, mixing in coffee, black currants, and dark earth components.","designation":"Ararimu"},{"country":"au","description":" Pristine  stands for untouched in this case by wood, an increasingly popular approach to the Chardonnay grape in au. The light citrus aromas, herb and caramel accents, and a dry and lean mouthfeel with almost tart pineapple flavors bring to mind better Maconnais wines from Burgundy. Well-balanced, it closes crisply with mild tropical-fruit notes. Likable, and not a fat, oaky tropical fruit bomb.","designation":"Pristine"},{"country":"US","description":"Estate bottled and barrel fermented, with lots of buttery flavors from full malolactic fermentation. Intensely fruity, it retains some acids, and shows a good clean mouthfeel and a persistent finish.","designation":"Bliss Vineyard Reserve"},{"country":"au","description":"You get the better parts of both worlds here: It's both classy and casual. If it's slightly austere on its own, with sharpness and palate-scrubbing acids, just place some spicy food alongside it and you're home free. Ginger chicken is a particularly good match. The lemon-lime fruit is accented by slate and petrol. It's more of a food wine than a simple sipper.","designation":"Gold Label"},{"country":"nz","description":"Peppy and bright, with green apple and citrus aromas, this Sauvignon Blanc displays nice balance and a rounder mouthfeel than many of its Kiwi brethren.

Toast and butterscotch marry with faint lemon flavors on the finish.","designation":"Sonoma Cask"},{"country":"nz","description":"Oaky at first sniff, with plenty of vanilla and cinnamon aromas over black currants.

One taste and you know it comes from a cool-climate region (though Hawkes Bay is considered warm by NZ standards); the acids are prominent, but should allow the wine to age gracefully once it settles down.

The finish is a bit oaky, with buttered toast and vanilla overtones, but in such a hedonistic wine, a little excess only seems appropriate.","designation":"Judd Estate"},{"country":"US","description":"A show-off wine, with multiple layers of aromatic and flavor complexity. Starts with an herbal, mountain-style fragrance before turning soft and smooth in the mouth, with an undercurrent of beet root, blueberry and wood. An atypical wine; it's unquestionably ripe, and maybe a bit too big for itself. Fans of rustic, hedonistic California experiences will get a charge out of it.","designation":"Erwin Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Features complex aromas of wild berries, stewed tomato, spices, herbs, and rich earth.

A perfect ap ritif wine. Best Buy.","designation":"Scrubby Rise"},{"country":"US","description":"Quite a bit more steely and structured than Fritz's regular Dutton Ranch bottling.

World class.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Deep, rich and spicy, and with a vineyard-driven flavor that shouldn't be taken lightly (it's from the well-regarded Sleepy Hollow and Pisoni vineyards).

The grapes tend to get a little baked this far inland, especially Merlot, which really needs just the right conditions to maintain delicacy and balance.

The tannins, needless to say, are soft, and the acidity is low.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Has slight but clean wildflower and peach aromas, and drinks light but fruity, with apple and peach notes.

Assuming it blows off, the wine has some very nice features, including bulky black fruit and an espresso character.

Displays mineral, earth, and cocoa notes on the long finish.","designation":"Valderiz"},{"country":"es","description":"Smart shoppers should be able to find this for well below the sky-scraping suggested price, and what a fabulous gift it would make. It's inky and tight, with spicy oak atop blackberry fruit. It's the epitome of a tight, young Tempranillo wine, and the finish is downright peppery. The tannins are fairly monstrous now, indicating that it could benefit from five or more years of aging.","designation":"Millennium Reserva"},{"country":"es","description":"Opaque, with aromas of deep, tight fruit and toasty oak, this is a huge and fairly backward wine. However, the mouthfeel is very full even viscous and a rich range of cherry, cassis, toast and leather flavors grace the palate. It packs some intense tannins on the back end, making it a serious wine for the cellar, needing 5 to 8 years to come around. It should last for decades.","designation":"Torre Muga"},{"country":"es","description":"Deep and very complex, with great intensity of cherry fruit and earth-leather accents, this is (as we say) \\"very serious juice.\\" The mouthfeel is full and rich, with good acidity and firm but fine tannins. The engaging aromas carry through on the palate, where interesting mineral, even faintly saline, nuances appear. (Available fall 2000.)","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"es","description":"Dark cherry aromas and beautifully integrated oak with attractive mint-menthol notes grace the complex nose. The flavors are very complex as well, with tart cherry, licorice, balsamic, prune and cocoa notes dancing on the palate. Big in scale but very well balanced, with a long dry finish and firm but not sharp tannins. Truly excellent. (Available in magnums only, fall 2000.)","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"es","description":"A spectacular modern-style wine from an excellent vintage. It's deep as night, almost opaque, with giant blackberry, licorice, coffee and bacon aromas. It offers gorgeous flavors of cassis, blackberry, coffee and tobacco, and then finishes smooth and long, with mouth-coating dusty tannins. It deserves all the superlatives you could throw at it, and in three to five years it will be even better than it is now.","designation":"Crianza"},{"country":"es","description":"Opaque in color, with a splendid, complex bouquet that offers aromas of very dark fruit, coffee and toasty oak. There are rich, deep flavors on the palate, with plum and licorice accents and a full, vibrant mouthfeel. Finishes long and dry, with fine tannins. An estate blend of 100% Tempranillo from an assortment of sites on the property.","designation":"Cuvee El Campanario"},{"country":"es","description":"Made from old Tempranillo vines, this is a stunning wine whose density is matched by its finesse, resulting in an amazing taste and sense experience. Opaque in color, it displays deep cherry, earth and smoke aromas. On the palate, the flavors broaden to include blackberry and tobacco. Superbly balanced despite its heft, it closes with a long mouth-coating finish, with black cherry, tar, mineral and chalk notes. It needs 3 to 5 years, but it's hard to keep your hands off it now.","designation":"Aurus"},{"country":"es","description":"Incredible depth and purity of fruit characterize this bottling. A huge bouquet of black fruits, truffles, cinnamon, licorice and more pulls you right in, and the palate does not disappoint with its cherry, tobacco and cumin notes, and a lovely balance of sweet and sour elements. Full even massive but quite refined at the same time, with great grip, and solid, well-dispersed tannins and handsome, spicy fruit on the long finish. Best cellared a few more years, and it should drink well for decades.","designation":"Gran Reserva"},{"country":"US","description":"Sharp barnyardy fruit flavors, along with doughy new oak. A real disappointment after the excellent 1996.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Pickle-barrel aromas dominate the nose, which downshifts into pure charred oak after a while. Big, chunky flavors yield too little Syrah fruit and too much other stuff. This one lays low in the glass and just never steps into line.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a dark, vegetal wine marked by herbaceous, weedy aromas and flavors, considerable tannins, and sharp acidity. It's very dry and even a bit rasping. You want to find some sweet fruit, but the wine is hard, and the finish indicates little aging possibility.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Pruny and sweet, with aromas of molasses--if it were Amarone you might give it a second thought, but it's not. The fruit is carried by acids but no tannins. Short and heavy.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"If you judge it just by the aroma you may take a pass. Strong gooseberry and sulfur smells are hardly welcoming. It's sweet, like applesauce, with touches of grapefruit to offer some balance. Like the wine above, it contains some Colombard concentrate.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Released after more than four years in barrel, this Bordeaux blend is just beginning to shed its aggressive tannins. Although there's plenty of toasty, charred oak, the fruit seems to have been sacrificed. Smells like a Port: peppery, pruny and alcoholic.","designation":"Platinum Red"},{"country":"US","description":"Rather raisiny and ponderous, this Zin has stewed-fruit and baked-apple aromas, and a green alfalfa or hay-like element. Doesn't really take off, and lacks the varietal character most of the other wines in the range display.

Delicate and a bit light and compact in the mouth, finishing with some mild woody tannins.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Cranberry and crabapples highlight the fruit. There is some good concentration on the palate, but a sweet, seemingly artificial, chalky finish leaves the wine feeling out of whack and over-tinkered with.","designation":"Bacchus Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Medium-ruby color. Pleasant, clean aromas of black cherry, peppermint, white chocolate, anise and vanilla. A strange wine in the mouth. The fruit is forward and nice, but there's a slight tingle on the tongue and a definite sensation of sweetness.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Good color and extraction. Initial canned asparagus and sulfur aromas mask some pretty good fruit. But with breathing, it opens up and loses the off aromas.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Raisins, a touch of tomato, and a deep hickory smoke define an unusual bouquet. Tastes hot and somewhat sour, without much cherry or leather to save it. Barolo from this vintage should be hitting its stride, but this one doesn't seem to have ever had one. It ends with some alcohol burn and barely a finish to speak of.","designation":"Vigna Margheria"},{"country":"it","description":"Meaty and chunky, yet it's still kind of mute. There's a chocolaty barrel-driven note, adequate richness and a fair amount of stuffing. Overall the fruit is solid but unspectacular. The finish starts strong and then weakens.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"This red from the Marche offers some low-intensity, tart cherry fruit, but the aromas and flavors seem rather flat and suppressed. There is a lack of definition here, and a somewhat clumsy woody quality that weighs down the fruit. The finish is rather short, woody and dry.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This soft, supple, friendly Cab is pleasing rather than complex. It's marked by blackberry and currant fruit, although the middle is a bit washed out, and it finishes short. Still, it's a good wine at a not-bad price.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Slightly sweet, but with varietally correct flavors, this soft and supple wine again proves that a simple and inexpensive wine does not have to lack character. Cherry, cocoa and cola flavors, and a supple, plummy texture ensure that it actually tastes like a Merlot. The front-end sweetness yields to a slightly tart finish, but it's clean all the way.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Unfortunately this is not the cleanest-smelling red you will come across, and for that it gets demerits. But it does come forth with bright red fruit, especially cherry. It's also a bit acidic. The definition isn't really here, yet the light oak on the finish is pleasant.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Dark, sweet cherry aromas and flavors predominate here, with slight leather and vanilla accents. There is decent acidity but on the palate the fruit is quite sweet, with an almost candied note. Finishes rather abruptly and tart, with fairly full mouth-coating tannins.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Pear, apple and wet stone aromas give way to grapey green flavors similar to herbs, especially mint. This has been more impressive in past years; this vintage seems mildly cloying and the wine just isn't overly appealing. It's all too bad, because we like Riesling and support America's efforts with the grape.","designation":"Dry"},{"country":"it","description":"This fruity southern Italian red has a berry-and-plum jamminess on the nose. Soft on the palate, it has light-to-medium berry flavors and an interesting tea-like note appears on the finish. A decent quaffing red, best with a light chill.","designation":"Selvato"},{"country":"cl","description":"This lean Chardonnay bows more to the Mac?nnais than to the California style. Light floral, apple and hay aromas open to a lemony, stony palate. Clean, with moderate length, it is good and decidedly not sweet.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This fairly high-acid wine is simple and refreshing. The flavors run to the grassy, citrus and apple side, and it's very dry, with a crisp, tingly mouthfeel that cleanses the palate. Try it for a late-afternoon cocktail with some simple munchies like herbed goat cheese on crackers.","designation":"Special Selection"},{"country":"US","description":"A blend of red-pepper spice and forward, simple blackberry fruit. The finish is tannic and has a certain rusticity to it that's not unattractive.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Starts out difficult and rustic, with aromas of charred meat and baked cherries. Plum flavors go tart and then veer toward coffee and tar. The finish is tight and stilted, with black cherry showing up late. A grapey aftertaste fails to seal the deal.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"The deep-yellow color suggests plenty of charred oak, and sure enough there's plenty of it, with butterscotch and vanilla aromas wafting over apple and spice. Flavors are oaky, and the finish is oaky-sweet. Too oaky for many tasters.","designation":"Monteriolo"},{"country":"US","description":"Dusty, toasty new-oak flavors lead into a wine that is tannic, tight and rough. The fruit is subdued, dark and roasted. Oak dominates, with a bitter, slightly rubbery finish.","designation":"Wahluke Slope Frei's Desert Wi"},{"country":"US","description":"Ponderous aromas of Port, kirsch and cassis waft up from this 15.5% alcohol monster. This isn't Dolcetto in the Piemontese style. Here it's overripe cherries and plums emulating young Port. It goes best with food; on its own it's awkward and overamped.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Rich and somewhat raisiny aromas of soy sauce and leather lead the way, followed by pruny, earthy flavors. Not overly heavy or tannic; drink now.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"An oaky yet lean Chardonnay from northern it, with the emphasis on lean. Toasty, but the almost sharp lemon fruit is where the action is. Very crisp and light; try with vegetable antipasto.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Aromas of pear, apple, melon and citrus. Not hefty, but in every way correct, with a nice mouthfeel and good balance. Clean pear and citrus flavors on the palate continue through the finish. A good entry-level Chardonnay. Best Buy.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"A mix of the Veneto's favorite reds (Corvina and Rondinella) and Merlot. It has a dense chocolate-cake aroma and some pungent black-fruit notes. Spicy and fairly big, it has plenty of size but not much finesse or style. All in all, it's big and clunky, yet the chewy, mouth-filling plummy fruit makes it worth a try.","designation":"Cent'Anni"},{"country":"US","description":"Black cherry and bell pepper, with dill in the finish. New French oak dresses it up, but the fruit is a little thin.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Tight, tannic and slightly stemmy, with dense chocolaty, blueberry fruit buried under a ton of tannin. It may open up with time, but now it's pretty tough.","designation":"Genesis"},{"country":"US","description":"Lemberger is a rustic, oddball grape that has found a home of sorts in Washington, where it more or less stands in for middle-of-the-road Zinfandel. This is a spicy, rustic wine with open, forward, fruity and generous flavors. There's a pleasing gaminess that suggests firing up the grill, and a loose-knit friendliness that promises an easy ride.","designation":"Genesis Blue Franc"},{"country":"it","description":"Similar in style and taste to a declassified Right Bank wine (the blend is 60% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon).

The mix is 67% Lemberger, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"The nose makes this a pretty tough sell: sulfur, brett, even old shoe leather. Surprisingly, it comes around on the palate, where a complex dried-cherry flavor rides high above earthy undertones and a snap of licorice. Not really polished, but dry and smoky enough to warrant a taste.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Lots of toasty, tasty new oak (both French and American) underscores dry herbs and pleasant, ripe red-berry and black-currant fruit.

A solid red with a bit of oak that should please most palates.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"There's a lot of up-front pizzazz in the rich briary nose, with black fruit and plenty of oak scoring points.

Decidedly lean, it is another of the lighter but attractive almost Pinot Grigio-like wines tasted.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Lavishly oaked; grandiose toast meets smokestack lightning on the nose. It calms down on the palate, where it leans toward apple and lemon fruit before moving smoothly into a long, toasty finish.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Modest aromas of pear and vanilla on the nose. The fairly soft palate displays subtle apple fruit with buttery, toasty notes and a touch of earthy complexity. The finish builds nicely with earth and toast. A bit faint of fruit, but nicely built.","designation":"Lolonis Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Peach and vanilla are all over the bouquet, which indicates that the body will be plump and oaky, which it is. The wine is full of heft, but also falls flat, especially on the finish. A very straightforward butterball.","designation":"Jacques De Coninck"},{"country":"US","description":"Quite buttery, with ample apple, melon and citrus fruit.

Finishes with a discordant, metallic quality.","designation":"Estate Bottled"},{"country":"US","description":"The bouquet is all chunky oranges, which is followed by pineapple fruit and a distinct current of mandarin orange flavor. Then it goes rather lemony on its way out. Has plenty of palate-cleansing zip but not much else","designation":"Library Collection"},{"country":"US","description":"Pineapple and pear aromas lead into sweet, clean fruit flavors. The wine is a touch sweet, but it also has an interesting chalkiness in the mouth. Simple clean fruit on the finish. Cleanly made, but not very lively.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Tropical fruit with a pineapply edge to it throughout the nose and on the palate. There's a pleasing, plump assertiveness to the middle, and lingering apple/cinnamon spice through the finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"With this one you never get totally past the sulfuric, heavily buttered-up start. From there it improves a little, showing apples, spice and light pear fruit in the mouth. In the end, however, it is an overdone wine that is heavily oaked and getting old as we speak.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a pleasant, typical Washington Chardonnay, with apple-butter flavors underscored by toasty oak. Straightforward and appealing for near-term drinking.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Buttered toast and mild fruit aromas open to green-apple and butterscotch flavors. Fairly thick and rich, but the flavors are not of scale with the wine's weight. Odd sweet and chalky finish.

Chill it and swill it.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Light poached pear and vanilla aromas on the nose. On the palate the wine comes across as light, even a bit lifeless in both flavor intensity and mouthfeel. Soft pear and stone-fruit flavors. Oak comes way up on the finish, but it has little to build on.","designation":"Barrel Fermented Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"There's a little funkiness in the nose, which otherwise shows some lemon/lime and green-apple notes. The wine is balanced and fruity, simple and approachable.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Melon and pear aromas, but an odd note on the nose detracts. After that it's a stylish wine with a lean, angular profile showing pear and melon fruit and herb accents. Light but well balanced in the mouth. Touch of popcorn on the finish.","designation":"Riva Ranch Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Overtly fruity, with apple and fruit-cocktail aromas. The palate is of medium weight and tangy, with tart orange flavors. Finishes similarly. Not on a par with previous performances from this winery.","designation":"Lavender Hill Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"An overt sweetness marks the nose, and it comes across as fruit cocktail mixed with a whiff of the flower garden. Very much one of those tropical-fruit-dominated Chardonnays, but unfortunately there's something metallic and hollow about the core of the wine.","designation":"Proprietor Grown"},{"country":"US","description":"There's a lively if incongruent nose of buttered popcorn, candle wax and toasty coconut.

At the end it's just not balanced enough to merit higher.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Has some positive apple, earth and toasty aromas, and a fairly plump, full mouthfeel. However, the green-apple fruit seems modest, even bland, and the toasty oak, while appealing, seems to suppress it.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Opens with attractive spice, apple and tangerine notes. Flavors flatten out and don't sing like the aromas. Round and a bit low-acid for its weight.

A pleasant quaff for a hot summer afternoon.","designation":"Rhinefarm Vyds"},{"country":"US","description":"Very citrusty to the nose, with clear hints of tangerine and grapefruit.

Good mouthfeel and slightly tangy finish. Simple but not unappealing.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Good nose of ripe tropical fruit, with citrus, honey and toasty oak. However, it turns a bit sweet and one-dimensional on the palate. A bit ponderous-not light on its feet and without enough layers or complexity to justify its heft.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Faint citrus, herb and green-apple aromas. Creamy in the mouth, with emphasis on lemon and lime flavors. The tart finish is a little short.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Heavy, superripe apple aromas lead you to expect a rich, dense wine, but instead you get a rather restrained, crisp mouthful of Chardonnay.

Pear and pineapple flavors, light to medium bodied. Lemon and oak on the finish. Not complex, but satisfying.","designation":"Estate Select"},{"country":"US","description":"A complex nose of earthy, herb and mineral aromas, with menthol notes. The citrusy fruit is subdued and the wine displays a crispness that is almost sharp. The wine reads bright, but almost piercing. Usually a keeper, so time may smooth its rough edges.","designation":"Les Pierres"},{"country":"US","description":"Springy and almost sharp, with pear, melon and mineral aromas and flavors.

Refreshing.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Camphor on the nose is the only thing standing in this one's way.

Deep pineapple and Bartlett pear fruit is spiced up with vanilla, clove and nutmeg notes.

Fruit mixes on the palate. Low acid, perhaps, but has enough nice aromas, flavors, and a pleasantly spicy finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A very creamy, almost cr me br?l e style to the aromatics.

However, the wine does not follow through as positively, turning slightly woody and lemony.

A bit chunky perhaps, but the bright citrus-fruit character shines through on the tangy finish.","designation":"Estate Grown &amp; Bottled"},{"country":"US","description":"Simple and steady, this is a textbook modern California Chardonnay emphasizing big-time butter and toast in support of appley fruit.

If not, it will come across as too plump and unfocused.","designation":"Barrel Fermented"},{"country":"US","description":"Opens with an engaging, complex nose of apple fruit, spice and earth. Tart apple flavors, but with a certain rustic edge. Not appealing to all tasters. The oak expands on the finish, shadowing the fruit, for an edgy close.","designation":"Whitegate Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Predominately pear flavors are supported by melon, lemon, apple and caramel. Finishes slightly sweet and also with a bitter pithy note, making for an unusual juxtaposition of flavors.","designation":"Oliver's Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Pear, vanilla and floral notes open to a palate of spicy, earthy, lemon-pear flavors. Fairly high acidity keeps the long, butterscotch-tinged finish from becoming cloying, but it's not the most harmonious marriage between sweet and sour.","designation":"Barrel Select Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Pears, green apples and butter from front to back; there's also some cantaloupe and papaya. A little indistinct and modest, it may not bowl you over but it certainly won't offend.

Medium fruit with spicy, candied notes on the palate.","designation":"Yamakawa Vineyards"},{"country":"US","description":"Sweet almost candy-like lemon-pineapple aromas, toasty oak and apple on the nose and in the mouth.

Modest pear fruit and a soft mouthfeel; the creaminess is almost cheesy again too much malo? Redeems itself with a solid finish that nicely displays oak and citrus.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A tough wine to size up: The aromas are heavy, with sizable oak casting a mature note over everything.

Will be at its best in 2C3 years.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"The bouquet is different from the flock, featuring pungent grapefruit and a hint of flowers.

Light orange and peach aromas lead to the same flavors and a touch of cantaloupe. It's a totally competent ros , what you might drink in the summer in fr.

Short, precise and crisp flavors merge into a clipped, cherry-tinged finish. A basic berry-driven quaffer.","designation":"Fontanazza"},{"country":"it","description":"Dark rose in color, with dried-flowers and light cherry aromas. Flavors of dried fruits mark the palate. Fairly high in acidity, so it's lean in the mouth. Seems a bit mature.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Saddle leather and toast aromas indicate that some heavy-handed wood treatment was thrown at this wine. Licorice and coffee flavors ride high, but the undercurrent is all sour cherries, which don't quite mesh with the darker elements.","designation":"Sovrana"},{"country":"it","description":"Creamy oak, toast and berries on the nose.

By the time you get to the last glass, you'll wish the bottle had been a little bigger.","designation":"Sangiacomo Vyd"},{"country":"US","description":"Less famous than this winery's Bosch  Cabernet, the Sycamore is more refined and accessible in youth than its brooding cousin. The '93, the current release (it's held back for five years), is very rich, with pinpointed focus. Extremely fine, a real knockout. Perfect now but will go on for years.","designation":"Sycamore Vineyards"},{"country":"US","description":"From renowned winemaker Heidi Barrett. Napa Cabs don't get much better than this. Aromas of black currant, cassis and oak; quite smoky and elegant. Huge fruit, vibrant and intense, with waves of currant and blackberry and plum. Voluptuous and soft, ultrarefined. Amazing tannins, profound and fine at once.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Try to overlook the wine geek name on the label and pay attention to the wine, which is superb from the first peppery/spicy aromas to the rich, velvety texture of the long finish, where opening fruit flavors loop back to add complexity and depth.","designation":"Clone 4"},{"country":"US","description":"A curious Chardonnay. Has modest aromas of apple, citrus and spice, but seems disjointed in its flavors, which veer from fruity and spicy to rubbery and medicinal. Not the best effort from this kosher winery.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"From Fetzer. Pretty lemon and lime aromas and flavors. Zesty and clean and uncomplicated by oak. Nothing fancy here, but you could buy a case for what some California Chards cost. Serve it to your martini-drinking boss.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"With berry, cedar and minty aromas, here's a light, easy drinking wine. Soft and round and simple. Nothing more, nothing less.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Not sure what \\"Reserve\\" is doing on this label, but what we have is a basic, fruit-forward expression of California Cabernet Sauvignon: bright and cheerful with just a hint of complexity on the finish. Once upon a time this would have been a jug wine; now it's the second label of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Some bright cassis flavor plays off dusty tannins, but the signature of this wine is a distinct fudge-flavored streak through its center. After that it falls off a bit to become a basic, perfectly drinkable Cabernet.","designation":"Grand Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"The second label of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, produced from Monterey and Napa grapes. Tasty with fairly ripe fruit and lively acidity. Not especially oaky or complex, but gets the job done.","designation":"Reserve Vineyard Selection"},{"country":"US","description":"Napa denizens won't lose any sleep over South Coast Cabs, which haven't managed to find the richness and complexity of their northern cousins. This one's dominated by currant, oak and berry notes, and has dry, dusty tannins. Ultimately it's rather simple.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A good-value Chardonnay for everyday drinking. The wine is a blend of coastal grapes and it offers straightforward and lively fruit with a medium finish.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A cheerful sort of Chardonnay with juicy fruit rounded by a touch of oak and a fairly rich, buttery background with good structure The wine was made by Tom Eddy, the Napa winemaker known for big reds. The 1997 is the first national release for Salmon Harbor.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This wine is from a sheltered canyon vineyard, safe from the chilly winds of northern Monterey County. Tasty tropical fruit comes shining through with a touch of peach leading to a long, happy ending.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Ripe, with green apple, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Dry and fruity. A little rough around the edges, with a slightly bitter finish.

Drinks clean and pure, with fruity acidity and little or no oak.","designation":"Santa Barbara County"},{"country":"US","description":"Gives a real jolt of tropical fruit, even banana, in the nose. Drinks ripe and rich, with big Santa Barbara fruit. Yet it seems a little disjointed, as if the parts weren't coming together. Might be better in a year.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Good dark color. Has a youthful Cabernet aroma that's grapey and curranty. Some richness and concentration in the mouth, with currant, berry and anise flavors. A little rough around the edges, but a very decent price.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Pretty apple, peach and pear aromas and flavors. Crisp and spicy, but seems to lack a bit of richness, and finishes a bit short.","designation":"Sonoma County"},{"country":"US","description":"A blend from various coastal counties. Smells juicy and ripe, with tropical fruit, peach and toast. Mingles classic Chardonnay flavors of apple and peach with a nice, creamy texture. But not as full as it could be; a curious hollow thinness, and finishes short.","designation":"Grand Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Well crafted, with tropical fruit flavors. Barrel fermentation adds leesy, creamy notes, and it's oaky and ripe. A big, bold Chard, not shy about itself, that could use a little more finesse. But the price is fair.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"A Bordeaux-style red from this chilly county that historically has not been kind to Cabernet-based wines. Strikes all the right notes, from the classy black-currant aromas to the elegant and balanced fruit flavors and expansive oak notes. But it's too light to really satisfy. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot.","designation":"Sanctuary Estate Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Shooting Star is an auxiliary label for Jed Steele. It's also the first step in his Chardonnay program, and it's better than many top-of-the-line Chards. This is 100% barrel-fermented in French oak. It's perfectly balanced and utterly delicious.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Vanilla, cream and cassis play a harmony in this single-vineyard offering from the reliable Benziger family. Medium-bodied, there are moderate tannins that should subside in a year or two, making it even better. Still, it's good now with rare beef.","designation":"Rancho Salinas Vyd"},{"country":"US","description":"What a pretty wine, and such a nice price.

And, given the price of Napa Cabernet, a bargain to boot.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Rather light in color, there's a floral, perfumey nose. Light on its feet for an Alexander Valley red, with raspberry fruit and subtle oaking. Deepens slightly with aeration. Tasty and elegant, but lacks the richness and concentration expected from a reserve wine.","designation":"Winemaker's Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Another bold, ripe South Coast Chard, with fragrant green apple, citrus, peach and pineapple aromas and flavors. Covers the palate in sweet fruit and spice like a blanket, and is steely and bold. A sure crowd-pleaser.","designation":"Santa Barbara County"},{"country":"US","description":"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Despite being held back three and a half years to let the considerable tannins mellow, it's still fairly tannic and austere, with dark chocolate and cassis, highly polished fruit, and lots of oak. Sharp and edgy; needs time, but could age well.","designation":"Moon Mountain Estate Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Dominated by toasty oak aromas, rich with vanilla and char; also green apple, peach and tropical fruit.

Best to age for a year or so.","designation":"Santa Cruz Mountains"},{"country":"US","description":"An oakier version of the regular bottling, hence richer, spicier and fuller. This wine has weight and style, from the spicy fruit to the classy oak and smoke elements. Young and tight, it can be cellared for a few years.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"Rich and concentrated, with black olives and blackberry fruit; the mouthfeel is ripe and lush, leading to a long, layered finish. A very good wine made even more attractive by the price.

Shows why Santa Barbara has emerged as perhaps the leading Chardonnay region in California.","designation":"Katherine's Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"A firm, deep, very solid Sonoma Cabernet.

Fine length on the finish.","designation":"Blue Rock Vyd"},{"country":"US","description":"When first poured, this Cabernet seems a bit stiff and awkward, but it soon blossoms into a lovely, harmonious wine, with massive fruit tending toward black cherry and dark plum. It should continue to improve for up to eight years in the bottle. Cellar Selection.","designation":"Napa Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Opens with a blast of toasty French oak, mingled with fancy black-currant, blackberry and chocolate aromas. Rich and mouth-filling, with a long finish. The dusty tannins suggest mid- to long-term aging.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Hold onto your hat when you sip this one, which is crafted in a white Burgundy style. A gorgeous aroma of citrus and ripe peach leads to clean, crisp, ultrarefined fruit sensations on the palate. So fine and rich, it really defines cool-climate South Coast Chardonnay.","designation":"Grand Cuv e"},{"country":"US","description":"Byron's priciest Chard, fermented with native yeasts, unfiltered and draped in toasty, charred oak. Bursts with all kinds of citrus and ripe peach flavors. It's young, though, and almost a shame to drink it now. Best to cellar this showy, flashy wine for a year or so.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"US","description":"From 2,000-foot vineyards comes this ripe, intense Cabernet. Very pure cassis aromas and flavors, and lots of oak. Rich and dense in the mouth, with young, flashy fruit. Ripe and polished, and what a long finish. Soft but fine tannins. Can drink now or age.","designation":"Santa Cruz Mountains"},{"country":"US","description":"An unfiltered whopper (15.1% alcohol), it's also unfined.

Because of its harmony and balance, the wine is drinking quite well now, but should be even better with five to eight years of bottle age.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"There is wonderful fruit here, ranging from light citrus through mango, with a shaving of pineapple, fading into butterscotch, and layers upon layers of flavor on the finish.","designation":"Bien Nacido Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"A harmonious wine with bright tropical fruit laid over a rich nutty-apple base, just touched by spice. This is that rare California Chardonnay that will reward three to five years of bottle aging.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a picture-perfect Cabernet with a nose so true and dense that you can barely get inside, but once you do everything is there. Huge, dynamic fruit plays off fine wood notes. Mighty tannins build up and prolong the flavorful, intense finish. A very big, very black wine that is also very, very good. From the family that owns Sutter Home.","designation":"Founders Estate"},{"country":"US","description":"This sweet dessert-style Vidal suffers from a weak nose and low acidity, which makes it seem fat. Still, there's enough sweetness to stand up to desserts and it might be nice for macerating fruit.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Gold color. The floral and spicy nose shows quince and peach-pie notes. Syrupy sweet, with a slight metallic tang - like the canned peaches mom used to pack for school lunch.
