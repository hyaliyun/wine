Brush both sides of each pizza with the oil. Grill until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the grill. Mix together the sugar, cinnamon and star anise in a small bowl. Brush the tops of each pizza with the butter and sprinkle with the sugar mixture. Place back on the grill, close the cover and cook an additional 1 minute. Cut into quarters and drizzle with the warm chocolate sauce. In a large bowl stir together 1/3 cup water, yeast, and sugar and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/3 cup water, 2 tablespoons oil, 1 3/4 cups flour, cornmeal, and salt and blend until the mixture forms a dough. Knead dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour, as necessary, to prevent dough from sticking, until smooth about 5 to 10 minutes. Form the dough into a ball. Lightly oil the sides and bottom of a large bowl with oil, add the dough, turn to coat in the oil, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Gently punch the dough down and divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into a 10-inch circle that is 1/8-inch thick. Brush off excess flour and transfer the dough to a baking sheet, cover each circle of dough with plastic wrap and continue stacking rolled out pieces on top of each other. Wrap well with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to grill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 35606,&quot;Pissaladiere 1 1/3 cups/185 g flour, plus more if needed 1 1/2 teaspoons dry yeast 1/3 cup/75 ml warm water 1 egg 3/4 teaspoon salt A grinding of pepper 1/4 cup/60 ml olive oil 1 1/2 pounds/675 g onions, thinly sliced 2 teaspoons herbes de Provence 1 bay leaf Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 ounces/90 g anchovy fillets, rinsed and drained, then halved lengthwise 1 medium tomato, thinly sliced (optional) About 1/4 cup/25 g nicois olives, pitted Instructions: To make the dough: Make a well in the flour. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and set aside until dissolved and slightly foamy, about 5 minutes. Beat the egg and salt into it, and pour into the well of the flour. Gradually mix with your fingers, drawing the flour in to make the dough. Knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour, if needed. Cover and set in a warm place to double in bulk, about 1 hour. To prepare the topping: Heat the oil in a saute pan and add the onions, herbs, salt, and pepper. Cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft, about 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. When the dough is ready, punch it down and roll it out like pizza dough. Lay on a baking sheet. Top with the onions. Lay on the tomato slices in rows. Arrange a lattice of anchovies, and fill spaces with olives. Grind over pepper. Let sit 15 minutes for the dough to rise up again a bit.

Heat oven to 500 degrees F. Place brisket, fat side down, in a 14 x12 x 2-inch roasting pan. It&#39;s best not to use a shallow pan for this, or later the juices might run over and out. Put the garlic in the pan. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Using your hands, rub oil onto garlic. Put the onion wedges and carrots into a smaller, 12 x 8 x 1 1/2-inch roasting pan. Drizzle with remaining oil. Using your hands, rub oil over all the pieces until they are well coated. Arrange onion wedges on their sides, so that they touch carrots as little as possible. Roast vegetables on center rack of oven for 30 minutes. Turn with a spatula. Roast 15 minutes more. Roast the brisket simultaneously on the bottom rack of the oven for 15 minutes. Turn over so fat side is up. Roast 30 minutes more. Remove both pans from oven. Lower heat to 275 degrees F, leaving the door ajar a minute or two to reduce temperature more quickly. Leave the brisket and garlic in the large pan and add 1/4 cup of the water. The water should bubble up from the heat of the pan; if it does not, put pan on the stove over medium-high heat. With a wooden spoon, scrape around the brisket to scoop up and remove the brown bits from the bottom of pan. Put the onions and carrots into the brisket pan. Put the smaller pan on top of the stove. Add the remaining water and bring contents to a boil while scraping the bottom vigorously with a wooden spoon. Pour liquid into brisket pan. Add roasted plum tomatoes and reserved roasting liquid or, if using canned tomatoes, stick a small knife into the opened can of tomatoes. Run it back and forth through the tomatoes and puree until only small pieces remain. Pour contents over vegetables and around brisket. Put the bay leaf into the liquid. Cover tightly with foil. Roast on center rack of oven for 3 1/2 hours. Remove foil, increase temperature to 500 degrees F, and roast 15 minutes more or until brisket is nicely browned. Remove. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. With the back of a spoon, smush the softened garlic out of each section and into the liquid. Throw the empty papers away. Transfer brisket to a platter and cover brisket with a tent of foil. Use slotted spoon to transfer vegetables to a large serving bowl or plate. Discard the bay leaf. Pour remaining liquid into a measuring cup. Let sit long enough for the fat to rise to the surface, about 15 minutes. Skim fat off surface. To serve, cut brisket against the grain into long thin strips. Arrange 2 to 3 slices on each plate. Spoon on some of the vegetables, and moisten everything with a generous amount of the liquid. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 35608,&quot;Tomato Summer Pudding Fresh plum or vine tomatoes Sea salt Black pepper, freshly ground Sugar Tomato passata (whole tomatoes passed through a food mill) Lemon juice Worchestershire and hot pepper sauces Good stale Italian bread, decrusted and sliced Garlic cloves Virgin olive oil Large bunch fresh basil Cooked quail eggs, olives, peppers, capers, for serving Mayonnaise or sour cream, for passing Instructions: Have enough tomatoes to overfill the pudding basin you will use. Dip into boiling water and peel them. Chop roughly and sprinkle with good sea salt and pepper and a tiny bit of sugar. Pour some passata into a large soup plate and season with lemon juice and Worstershire sauce, and maybe a touch of pepper sauce.

Seal the top with more soaked bread. Place the receptacle on top with weights and leave overnight in the refrigerator. Turn out onto a fine dish and surround with goodies--quail eggs, olives, peppers, capers or what you will. A bowl of sour cream might be passed round with it, or good home-made mayonnaise. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 35609,&quot;Chicken and Tater Tot Casserole 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch thick rounds 2 stalks celery, cut into 1/4-inch half-moons 1 onion, chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups chicken broth 1 cup whole milk 4 cups shredded cooked chicken 3 cups frozen tater tots, thawed 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Usually, we need to be quite delicate with puff pastry, as it needs to puff up a lot, but for palmiers it needs to puff up only a little. Roll the pastry out into a rectangle about 12 by 14in (30 by 35cm) and 1/8in (3mm) thick. Spread the tomatoes over the puff pastry and sprinkle over the rosemary. With the shortest end facing you, take both long edges of the pastry and roll them toward each other to meet in the middle. Brush a little egg down the center to stick the two halves together. Carefully lift onto a large baking sheet, making sure it will fit in your refrigerator first, and put in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to chill and harden. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove the roll from the refrigerator and, using a very sharp knife, slice it into 1/2in (1cm) thick pieces. Lay each piece on the baking sheet and brush well with the beaten egg, then bake in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes until puffed up, crisp, and golden. Remove the palmiers from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet. To serve, pile them high on a plate. These are great little canapes for waiting guests. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 35655,&quot;Cauliflower Stir-Fry with Toasted Peanuts 1 cup jasmine rice 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets 3 tablespoons vegetable oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup salted roasted peanuts 1 cup snow peas (about 4 ounces), trimmed 1 yellow bell pepper, roughly chopped 2 tablespoons chopped peeled fresh ginger 3 scallions (white parts sliced, green parts cut into 2-inch pieces) 1/3 cup sweet Thai chili sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce 1/4 cup fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

(Alternatively, you can use 1 large 9-inch round, 2 1/2-inch tall metal dessert ring.) Cut 12 circles from the chocolate butter sheet cake and put 1 in the bottom of each metal ring. Using a pastry brush, moisten each cake with Raspberry Simple Syrup. Arrange 3 or 4 fresh raspberries inside the rings on top of the cake circles. Melt the chocolate and 7 ounces of the butter in the top of a double boiler, over gently boiling water; upper pan should not touch water. Remove from the double boiler but keep the mixture warm and liquid. Whip the cream until it comes to soft peaks that hold their shape. Refrigerate until needed. Whisk the remaining 2 ounces of butter with the eggs, sugar, and raspberry liqueur in a medium bowl. Place over gently boiling water; the bowl should not touch water. Cook, whisking constantly, for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture reaches 160 degrees F on a thermometer. Immediately remove from the heat and with an electric mixer, whip at high speed for about 5 minutes, until cool to touch. Whisk the egg mixture into the melted chocolate and butter. Fold in the whipped cream, mixing until no streaks of white remain. Using a pastry bag or a large spoon, fill the prepared metal rings with the chocolate mousse, covering the raspberries. With a flat knife, smooth the mousse to make it level with tops of the rings. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours, until firm. To remove from mold, warm the sides of the rings by wrapping briefly with a hot towel, or use propane torch to heat sides so they release. Wrap a chocolate band around each torte, if desired. You can also decorate by arranging fresh raspberries, chocolate truffles, chocolate shards, or chocolate leaves on top. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Brush the sides of a 12 by16-inch sheet pan with melted butter, and dust lightly with flour, or spray with cooking spray. Line the bottom with a rectangle of parchment or waxed paper. Cream the butter in a bowl, using an electric mixer until it is very light and aerated. Add the egg yolks, a few at a time, stopping to scrape the bowl in between additions. Add the melted chocolate, scraping the bowl again, beating until the chocolate is incorporated. Whip the egg whites and cream of tartar in a clean bowl, using an electric mixer. When they are frothy, gradually add the sugar, whipping until soft peaks form. Fold the whites into the yolk mixture. Sift the flour onto the batter and gently fold it in. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is just set and a light crust has formed on the top. Cool. Heat the sugar and water in a small saucepan, gently swirling the pan until the sugar dissolves. Cook just until the syrup is clear: do not boil. Stir in raspberry sauce and the liqueur, if using. In a blender or a food processor, puree the raspberries with the sugar, lemon juice and liqueur. Strain through a fine sieve to remove the seeds. Refrigerate. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]&quot; 35675,&quot;Granny Lawson&#39;s Lunch Dish 1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour, preferably Italian 00 Scant 1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening 6 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter Approximately 4 tablespoons chilled, lightly salted water 1 egg beaten with pinch of salt, for brushing 2 to 3 tomatoes (about 12 ounces) or same amount of drained, chopped, canned ones 2 small onions 2 eggs, hard-boiled 4 ounces pitted black olives 2 tablespoons olive oil, not extra-virgin 9 ounces organic ground beef Fat pinch allspice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Measure the flour into a dish that will fit into the freezer (it doesn&#39;t need to have a lid) and cut the shortening and butter into small - approximately 1/2-inch dice and toss them in the flour. Put in the freezer for 10 minutes. I tend to make pastry in my stand mixer, but a processor&#39;s fine too. In whatever contraption - fitted with the flat paddle in the one, with the double-bladed knife in the other - mix until you have a mixture that resembles coarse uncooked oatmeal. Now, dribble in the chilled salted water, slowly, with the motor still running, until the dough looks as if it&#39;s about to cohere, but stopped short of its actually clumping totally. Turn out of the processor (though you could still do this in the bowl of the mixer) and squidge together with your hands until all the pastry forms a cohesive ball. Dribble in a little more water if you feel it needs it. Divide into 2 pieces of equal size and form it into fat disks. Cover with plastic wrap and leave in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. And this can be done a good day or 2 in advance if it helps. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the tomatoes in a bowl, cover with boiling water from the kettle and leave for 5 minutes. Drain, run under the cold tap, then peel, seed and chop roughly (or use canned tomatoes, chopped and drained). Peel and chop the onions, hard-boiled eggs and olives, too. In a large frying pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Cook the chopped onions until softened and beginning to color, turning the flame down to low if they look as if they&#39;re sticking. Turn the heat back to medium and add the chopped tomatoes and cook, stirring for a minute or so before adding the beef. Stir well, breaking up the clumps of meat with your wooden spoon as you go, then when the meat&#39;s browned, stir in the chopped eggs and olives and season with the allspice and salt and pepper. Cook over gentle heat for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Get a baking sheet out, and flour a surface and rolling pin. Remove the pastry from the refrigerator and roll out 1 of the disks until you have a thin, but not exaggeratedly so, rough square that will fit on the baking sheet, then place it on the baking sheet. Now roll out the second disk and leave it there while you cover the layer on the baking sheet with the ground beef mixture, leaving a margin of about 1-inch all around. With a bit of cold water and your fingers, dampen this edge. Place the second square of pastry on top and press the edges together to seal. Now, roll these edges back on themselves once or twice, then get a fork and press it, the tines curved side down, against this rolled border. Prong the top of the pastry to make air holes and then beat the egg with a generous sprinkling of salt and brush the top and edges of the pie with it to glaze. Put it into the preheated oven for 20 minutes, by which time the pastry will be golden and cooked. Slice it into fat oblongs and eat warm with a vegetable or salad, or cold, wrapped in a napkin and without ceremony or cutlery. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35676,&quot;Cheese and Bread Platter Fig leaves Bunch of green grapes Wedge of English Cheddar Wedge of Tremblay or Brie Wedge of Danish Blue Cheese Fig jam Crisp crackers, of an interesting shape and texture Dried apricots Irish Guinness Brown Bread, sliced (see below for the link) Instructions: Line a large round platter with fig leaves.

Brush 2 (8-inch) or 3 (7-inch) cake pans or sandwich pans with melted butter, and dust with flour. Line the base of each pan with parchment or greaseproof paper.<br> In a bowl, sift the flour with the salt, and baking powder.<br> In a large bowl, or in an electric food mixer, cream the butter until soft. Add the sugar, and vanilla extract, and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolks, and then stir in the chopped walnuts. Fold in a quarter of the flour and milk into the mixture, alternating each, until they are incorporated.<br> In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they are stiff.<br> Stir a quarter of the egg whites into the cake mixture, and then gently fold in the rest. Divide the batter between the tins, making a slight hollow in the center of each so that the cake rises evenly rather than forming a peak.<br> Bake in the oven until firm to the touch or until a skewer inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, about 16 to 20 minutes. Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes, before turning out onto a wire rack to cool. To make the buttercream filling: Cream the butter until very soft, and then beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar, and the vanilla extract. When the cakes are cool, spread the buttercream filling on one layer, and top with the second layer, sandwiching the layers together.<br> Make the American frosting as described below. Spread the American frosting quickly over the cake with a palette knife, regularly dipping the knife into a jug of boiling water to help spread the icing. It sets very quickly at this stage, so speed is essential. Scatter with rose petals, if using, or arrange the walnut halves around the top of the cake, and allow the icing to set until it feels dry on the surface. To make the American Frosting: Ensure your cake is ready before you start, as this icing begins to set very quickly. Bring to the boil a saucepan of water large enough to hold a heatproof bowl. Place the egg whites in the bowl and whisk with a hand-held electric beater until very stiff.<br> In a separate saucepan over a medium-high heat, dissolve the sugar in the water and boil for 5 to 10 minutes until the liquid is thick and syrupy and has reached the &#39;thread&#39; stage - when the last few drops that fall from a metal spoon dipped into the syrup come off in one long, quite thick and syrupy thread.<br> Pour the boiling syrup over the stiffly beaten egg whites, whisking all the time with the hand-held beater. Place the bowl in the saucepan of simmering water. Continue to whisk over the water for 10 to 15 minutes until the icing is snow white, very thick and meringue-like.<br> Spread quickly over the cake with a palette knife, regularly dipping the knife into a jug of boiling water.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the chicken thighs, olive oil, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper and paprika in a medium bowl and toss to coat evenly. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes. If necessary, remove the outer leaves from the head of cauliflower, then cut it into quarters, leaving the inner stem intact so that the florets do not separate. Put the chicken thighs skin-side up on one side of the baking sheet, spacing them evenly. Drizzle any leftover marinade over the chicken. Put the cauliflower on the other side of the baking sheet, with one cut-side down. Brush each cauliflower piece with melted butter and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Put the bacon on the edge of the baking sheet and bake until browned and crisp, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Return the baking sheet to the oven until the chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part not touching the bone, 25 to 30 minutes more. The cauliflower should be lightly browned and cooked through. When the bacon is cool enough to handle, roughly chop it. Before removing the baking sheet from the oven, carefully lay a slice of Cheddar on each cauliflower piece and return to the oven until melted, about 1 minute. For serving, top each cauliflower with 1 tablespoon sour cream and a sprinkle of the bacon and chives.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 35680,&quot;Almond Wild Rice 1 cup pineapple juice 1 cup low sodium chicken broth 1/3 cup orange juice 1 tablespoon butter 1 (6-ounce) box long grain and wild rice mix, with seasoning packet 1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted Instructions: In a saucepan, bring pineapple juice, broth, orange juice and butter to a boil.

Slice the bread into 1/4-inch thick slices, cutting the boule in half first. Lightly brush each piece of bread with olive oil, on both sides, before placing onto a cookie sheet and toasting lightly in the oven. Toast both sides evenly, turning halfway through. Remove from the oven and rub each piece of toast or bruschetta with the garlic, to flavor the bread. Place the bruschetti near the oven to keep warm while you make the livers. Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the cleaned livers to the pan and sear over high heat. Try not to shake the pan too much, but rather allow the livers to caramelize and brown before turning to cook the second side. Cook the livers in batches if necessary, as overcrowding the skillet will result in steamed, and not seared, livers. As the liver is turned on the other side to brown, add the shallots and cook for 2 minutes, being careful not to burn the shallots. Season with salt and pepper, tasting as you go. Add the sugar to the pan and coat the livers evenly, before adding the vinegar carefully, to avoid splattering of the caramelized sugar. Turn the heat down slightly so that the vinegar will reduce to a glossy glaze. Serve the livers immediately on the toasted bruschetti. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35682,&quot;Shrimp Dean Martinis 1 1/2 pounds super-size jumbo shrimp -- precooked or, peeled and deveined, tail on 2 ribs celery, finely chopped 2 rounded spoonfuls prepared horseradish 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 teaspoon hot sauce 1/2 cup chili sauce 1/2 cup ketchup 1/2 cup vegetable juice (recommended: V8) Salt and black pepper 1 lemon, wedged Instructions: If you bought raw shrimp, steam shrimp until pink, about 5 minutes, then cold shock under running water.

Add the garlic, carrots, celery root, turnip, rutabaga, onion, diced fennel and a large pinch of salt; cook until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the wine, 6 cups water, fennel seeds, thyme and bay leaves; bring to a simmer. Add the chicken and simmer for 2 hours. Remove the chicken and let cool. Pick off the meat in shreds; set aside. About 15 minutes before the chicken has finished simmering, prepare the dumplings: Combine the milk, chicken fat, 1 tablespoon tarragon, the nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a medium saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat; add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, to make a thick dough. Bring the soup to a boil. Form the dough into eight dumplings (an ice cream scoop is perfect for this); drop into the soup. Cover and cook until the dumplings float to the surface, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken meat, parsley and the remaining 1 tablespoon tarragon to the soup; stir carefully and divide among warm bowls.

Add onion, carrots, celery, garlic, orange zest, bay leaves, whole white pepper, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, thyme and basil, and simmer for 20 minutes. Salt heavily and add generous amounts of dry white wine and white wine vinegar to taste. Simmer for an additional 20 minutes and strain. (Can be made ahead of time and refrigerated.) To prepare seafood salad, cut off the heads of the octopus and boil the octopus in salt water for 15 minutes to remove impurities. Strain and place in the pot of court bouillon and simmer until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the spot and peel off the skin and trim ends. (The octopus is much easier to peel when it is hot). Cut the legs into small pieces on the bias and reserve in olive oil with some crushed garlic cloves and thyme. Cook shrimp in the court bouillon (approximately 1 minute, depending on size). Remove the shrimp and cool. For the squid, wash very well and cut it into thin tubes. In a separate pot of boiling salted water, add the squid tubes. It is important to use a very large ratio of water to squid because when the squid is added to the pot, the heat is turned off to let the squid slowly cook until it is done. Be careful not to overcook the squid because it will become rubbery. Once cooked, shock the squid in ice water to stop the cooking process. Remove from the water and dry the squid. Cook lobster in a separate pot of boiling salted water for approximately 8 minutes. Once cooked through, remove the lobster meat from the shell, and cut into pieces. To assemble the dish, preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large pan, add all of the seafood ingredients, white beans, olives, tomatoes, lemon juice, lemon, salt and pepper to taste, and extra virgin olive oil. Heat in the oven until warmed through, about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 35702,&quot;Cajun Macaroni Salad 1 small red onion, finely chopped Kosher salt 8 ounces elbow macaroni 1/4 cup milk 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons Creole mustard 1/2 cup chopped pickled okra or pickled green beans, plus 1/4 cup brine 1 teaspoon sugar 1 to 2 teaspoons hot sauce 2 bell peppers (1 red, 1 yellow), chopped 2 stalks celery, chopped, plus 1/2 cup chopped leaves 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Soak the red onion in a bowl of ice water for 15 minutes; drain and pat dry.

Whisk together the sour cream and onion dip mix, 2 teaspoons of the onion powder and 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic powder in a large bowl (large enough to use for dredging). Set aside 2 tablespoons of the seasoning mixture for later. To the mixture in the bowl, stir in 1/4 cup of the flour. Set aside. In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 cup flour, the cornstarch, remaining 2 teaspoons onion powder, the salt, baking powder and remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. Add the seltzer and sour cream and whisk until just smooth. Stir in the chives. The batter should be the consistency of thick paint. Add the onion rings to the seasoned flour and toss to lightly coat. Working in 2 batches, dredge the floured rings in the batter, letting the excess drip back in the bowl, and add to the oil. Fry, flipping occasionally, until very crisp and deep golden, about 4 minutes per batch. Drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. While still hot, season the onion rings with the reserved sour cream and onion seasoning mixture. Serve immediately, with ketchup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 35705,&quot;Chipotle Sour Cream 1 cup sour cream Juice of 1/2 lime 1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine the sour cream, lime juice, chopped chipotle pepper, and salt, and pepper, to taste, in a bowl.

Put the wire racks in the baking sheets and coat each generously with cooking spray. Combine the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large re-sealable plastic bag. Combine the eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in another large plastic bag; combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a third large plastic bag. Add about a half of the zucchini sticks to the bag with the flour and use a combination of your hands and shaking the bag to coat the zucchini. Remove the zucchini and shake off any excess flour. Transfer to the egg wash and repeat until coated. (It&#39;s less messy if you use only one hand for the dry ingredients and the other for the wet.) Let any excess egg drip off before transferring to the breadcrumb mixture; repeat until fully coated (you&#39;ll still see some green and white of the zucchini peeking through the breading). Transfer to the prepared baking sheets and coat the breaded zucchini generously with cooking spray (there&#39;s no need to turn them). Repeat with the remaining zucchini. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom about halfway through, until golden brown and tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Lower the oven to 350 degrees F and let the baking sheet cool for a few minutes. Remove the rack from one of the baking sheets and line the baking sheet with foil. Slide the fries onto the baking sheet and arrange them in four equal piles. Scatter both cheeses equally over the piles and bake until melted, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, warm the gravy. When the cheese is melted, use a spatula to lift each batch of cheese fries and place it on its own plate. Drizzle the gravy over the cheese fries and top with the bacon and scallions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 35707,&quot;Ladyfinger Parfaits 12 ladyfingers 2 cups melted vanilla ice cream 4 tablespoons orange flavored liqueur 1 cup raspberries Whipped cream, as a garnish, optional Instructions: Line 2 large wineglasses with ladyfingers all along the inside perimeter of the glass.

In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and butter, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the salt, sugar and flour, and stir vigorously with a heatproof spatula. Cook, stirring constantly, until a dense dough forms that pulls away from the side of the pan, about 3 minutes. Add the dough to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. On low speed, beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl between additions to make sure everything is evenly mixed. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Using a 1-ounce scoop, drop the dough, 1 inch apart, onto the prepared cookie sheet. Bake until puffed and golden, 35 to 40 minutes. (The puffs should feel light when you pick them up.) Make sure to keep the oven shut until at least the halfway point -- if you open the oven before 20 minutes have elapsed, the puffs will deflate and you won&#39;t be able to get the texture back. Remove the puffs from the oven and prick each one on the side to allow the steam to escape. Let cool completely. To dip in chocolate: If desired, dip the tops of the puffs in Warm Chocolate Ganache, shaking off the excess. Place on a platter and sprinkle with sliced almonds. Let stand for about 30 minutes, to set the glaze, before eating. Heat 1 inch or so of water in a medium saucepan over low heat. Put the chocolate chips and cream in a heatproof bowl that fits snugly into the saucepan without touching the water. Heat, stirring, until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35710,&quot;Grilled Sausage with Tuscan Beans 1 pound hot Italian sausage or one 6-count package 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained and juice reserved One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained and juice reserved<br> Salt and freshly ground pepper One 15-ounce can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed well One 15-ounce can red beans, drained and rinsed well 2 tablespoons torn fresh basil 3 pita pockets, each cut into 8 wedges One 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened<br> Zest of 1/2 a lemon<br> One 15-ounce can red beans, rinsed and drained<br> 3 tablespoons dressing, reserved from Grilled Sausage with Tuscan Beans, recipe above<br> Salt and fresh ground pepper Salt and fresh ground pepper<br> 1 cup Tuscan Beans, reserved from Grilled Sausage with Tuscan Beans, recipe above<br> 1/2 medium red onion, diced Instructions: Preheat a grill over medium heat.<br> Place the sausages on the grill and cook until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes, turning every 4 to 5 minutes.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, Italian seasoning, reserved juice from the can of tomatoes and season with salt and pepper.

Leave in refrigerator for 1/2 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the charcoal fire (or heat indoor grill).<br> When grill is heated, shape the pork mixture into 6 balls. Lightly oil a steamer tray and steam balls for 5 minutes. Transfer partially cooked balls to a hot grill fire. Cook for 10 minutes, turning occasionally, so all sides of the pork balls get golden brown. Remove pork balls from fire, cut them in half, and return them to fire, cut side down. Grill for 5 minutes. Remove pork and, when cool enough to handle, cut in shreds roughly 1 1/2 inches long and 1/4-inch thick. Reserve.<br> Bring a few quarts of salted water to a boil. Plunge the shrimp into the boiling water then turn the heat off. Remove shrimp from water when just cooked (about 2 to 3 minutes). In a bowl, mix 2 tablespoons fish sauce and remaining tablespoon of sugar. When shrimp are cool enough to handle, peel and slice them in half the long way (cutting the shrimp into 2 thin, C-shaped pieces). Reserve shrimp and fish sauce mixture.<br> Dip one sheet of banh trang into a basin of warm water, keep it submerged for 2 to 3 seconds, then remove it immediately from the water. Try to dip all of it into the water simultaneously, and handle it carefully so it doesn&#39;t tear. Place the sheet on a dry towel.<br> About 1-inch above the lower edge of the sheet, spread out 1/8 cup of shredded lettuce. Leave a 1 1/2-inch gap between the left edge of the sheet and the lettuce, and a 1 1/2-inch gap between the right edge of the sheet and the lettuce. Define a rectangle with the lettuce that&#39;s about 5 inches wide and 3 inches in the other direction (towards the center of the sheet). Now evenly top the lettuce rectangle with 1/8 of the bean sprouts, 1/8 of the carrots and 1/8 of the peanuts. Evenly distribute 1/8 of the pork over the rectangle. Tear 5 to 6 mint leaves and an equal amount of cilantro, and distribute over the rectangle. Top everything with a few sprinkles of nuoc mam.<br> Carefully pick up the right edge of the sheet, and fold it leftward toward the center of the filling. Make sure the folded sheet is even and uncreased everywhere. Do the same with the left edge of the sheet. The rectangle of the filling should now be covered by the folded sheet. Pick up the bottom edge of the sheet, and start rolling away from you, towards the top edge, making sure to tuck the filling in tightly as you roll. When you have rolled about halfway to the top of the sheet, dip the shrimp halves in reserved fish sauce/sugar mix. Place 2 shrimp halves along the cylinder that you have half-rolled, and keep on rolling until a fully rolled cylinder is formed. Place under a wet towel. Repeat process 7 more times.

Butter an 8-by-8-inch square flameproof casserole dish. Halve the leeks lengthwise, and then cut them crosswise into half circles (There should be about 1 3/4 cups.). Put the cut leeks in the basket of a salad spinner, or a colander set in a bowl, and fill with water. Swish the leeks around to flush out any grit. Lift the basket from water--don&#39;t pour the water off or you will pour any grit right back over the leeks. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat and fry the bacon until crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to cool, then crumble. Discard all but 1 tablespoon of the pan drippings, add the butter and leeks, and season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a small saucepan with the garlic, thyme, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and water, to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then drain. Discard the thyme and garlic and add potatoes to the leeks. In a medium bowl whisk together the eggs and half-and-half, then stir in the leek mixture, 1 cup of the cheese, the bacon, and nutmeg. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and some pepper. Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish, cover with foil and bake until just set but still moist, about 55 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Position a rack in the upper part of the oven and preheat the broiler. Scatter the remaining 1 cup cheese over the casserole and broil until the cheese browns, about 3 minutes. Set aside for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Unmold or serve from baking dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 35746,&quot;Peach Glazed Ham 3 cups peach nectar 1 (1-inch) piece ginger, smashed 1/2 lemon, juiced 4 cloves garlic, smashed 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1 cup brown sugar 1 (14-pound) precooked ham 3 whole peaches Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Return a list of the wine types only. recipe: Baked Brie with Fig Jam and Prosciutto 1 (1-pound) round of brie cheese 1/4 cup fig jam 8 slices prosciutto 1/4 cup&quot; 35747,&quot;Apple Pie as It Should Be 4 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons sugar 12 ounces (3 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/2 cup ice water (strain out the ice just before using) 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 5 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and thickly sliced 1/2 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 tablespoon heavy cream 1 tablespoon sugar Instructions: Pie Crust: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter. Turn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape into round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won&#39;t be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It&#39;s entirely up to you. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don&#39;t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on forming a good circle from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don&#39;t do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm up the butter. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11 inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies. Set your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it&#39;s up to you. Either choice will work. To transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan. Don&#39;t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don&#39;t be concerned; we&#39;ll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. Leave the edges of the bottom crust hanging over the rim. Roll out the second piece of dough into a circle about 11 inches in diameter. Line a sheet pan with parchment or waxed paper. Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, and then unroll it onto the sheet pan. Chill for 20 to 30 minutes before filling. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a medium bowl, toss the apple slices, sugar, salt, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla together. Transfer to the pie shell, and dot with the butter. Brush the overhanging edges of the dough with water. Carefully place the rolled-out top crust on top and pinch the edges together, turning under all around to make a thick edge. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \\V\\ with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. With the tips of a pair of scissors, snip 4 evenly spaced small vent holes in the top crust. Brush the top of the pie with cream, then sprinkle evenly with sugar. Place the pie on a sheet pan to catch any juices that boil over. Bake in the center of the oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling at the vents, 40 to 50 minutes more. Check the pie after 30 minutes; if the crust is browning too quickly, cover lightly with foil. Let cool at least 30 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35748,&quot;Grilled New Potatoes with Lemon-Garlic Aioli and Parsley 3 pounds small new potatoes 1 1/2 cups best-quality mayonnaise 6 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons finely chopped lemon zest Salt and freshly ground pepper Olive oil 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Place the potatoes in a stockpot and cover with cold water.

Set aside. Fill a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid with 2 inches of water. Add the vinegar and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, crack each egg into separate small heatproof mugs. Bring the boiling vinegar water to a simmer and gently lower the mugs all the way into the water. Carefully remove the mugs and leave the eggs behind. Cover and simmer the eggs for 3 minutes. If the yolks appear underdone for your liking, continue cooking them for 1 minute more. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate. While the eggs simmer, combine the wine and lemon juice in a saute pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Let boil 1 1/2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, then whisk in the butter, piece by piece, allowing each to emulsify before adding the next. Turn off the heat and season with salt and pepper.

(If using wood, I love cherry or apple wood.) Lop off about 1/4 inch from the top of a drumstick, and from the tip of the handle of the drumstick, using dry hands and a dry knife. (This way, you can stand them up straight, and it makes pulling the meat up easier.) About an inch up from end of the handle, where the bulb meets the handle, make a sharp cut that goes all the way around the handle (a 360-degree cut), making sure to cut through the skin, muscle and tendons. Push the meat up to the more bulbous end of the leg and remove the little bit of meat on the handle end. Repeat with the remaining drumsticks. Place the rub in a small sheet pan or flat dish and roll each drumstick in the rub. Place the drumsticks directly on the grill and cook, rotating a couple times throughout, until the internal temperature registers 165 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. Dunk each drumstick into the Glaze and stand up on the grill until the sauce is caramelized and set, another 10 to 12 minutes. Combine in the bourbon, ketchup, vinegar, honey, mustard and brown sugar in a small saucepot and simmer for 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Bourbon, Merlot, Zinfandel, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 35767,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Apple-Chicken Ranch Slaw 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 cup Hidden Valley?

One by one, pound the tails thin: Cover the top and bottom with plastic wrap, place on a hard surface and use a smooth mallet to gradually pound the tail to less than 1 inch thick and uniform. Repeat with each tail. Place the panko and flour and in separate shallow dishes. Season the flour with salt and pepper. Place the egg in another dish. Place the dishes in the order of egg, flour and panko. Take a lobster tail and rinse with the egg, letting the excess drip off before placing it in the flour, lightly coating both sides. Finally press the lobster into the panko, pressing on both sides to coat evenly. Set aside and repeat with the remaining tails. Reduce the wine and shallots to one-fourth in a medium saucepan over medium high-heat. Add the chicken stock and reduce by half. Add the key lime juice and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and slowly whisk in the cold butter. Check for seasoning and keep warm. Heat the clarified butter in a medium-to-large skillet over medium heat. Sear the lobster tails until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side (these can be done in batches). Be careful not to overcook: the lobster is done when it begins to become firm to the touch.

Remove the husks from the tomatillos, then rinse the tomatillos under warm water to remove any stickiness. Dry with a paper towel. Put the tomatillos, chiles, garlic and sliced onion on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle on 2 teaspoons or so of salt. Broil a few inches from the heat, turning everything once, until the tomatillos are softened and slightly charred, about 7 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Transfer the broiled vegetables to a blender; add the cilantro and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Make the chili: Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until just translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking it up, until browned, about 10 minutes. Spoon out and discard the excess fat, leaving 1 to 2 tablespoons in the pot. Stir in the oregano and garlic and cook, stirring, about 3 more minutes. Stir in the tomatillo salsa, hominy (including the liquid), cilantro and pumpkin.

Put the turkey breasts in the brine, making sure they are completely covered. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. To make the turkey: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot, sage, thyme, chili flakes, and a pinch of salt; saute for 5 minutes. Turn the heat to medium-high. Add the pears, spreading out in a single layer. Let sit untouched for 2 minutes to brown slightly. Toss, saute 1 minute more, then remove from heat. Transfer the pear mixture to a bowl and add the walnuts, bread crumbs and chicken stock. Stir to combine and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside to cool. Remove the turkey breasts from brine and pat dry. Butterfly the turkey by slicing the breasts into even halves on the horizontal, leaving about 1/2-inch, uncut at 1 edge so the breasts can open like a book. Season all over with salt and pepper, to taste. Lay a large piece of plastic wrap on a clean cutting board. Put 3 slices of bacon parallel, about 1-inch apart on top of the plastic. Arrange 1 of the open turkey breasts, cut side up, lengthwise on top of the bacon. Scoop half of the stuffing onto 1 half of the turkey breast, fold over the other half, then roll the bacon around it tightly. Make sure the bacon strips lay flat against the turkey. Sprinkle the outside of the bacon with a little paprika. Wrap tightly in the plastic wrap twisting the ends to really seal in the breast to keep its shape. Repeat with remaining bacon, turkey, and stuffing. Transfer the breasts to a sheet tray and rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the turkey breasts from refrigerator 1/2 hour before you plan to cook them. Discard the plastic wrap and using 3 pieces of butcher&#39;s twine, tie the twine over the center of the 3 bacon strips to secure the breasts when searing. Warm a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Add 1 of the turkey breasts, seam side down, into the skillet and sear until the bacon is slightly crisp and the turkey is lightly browned, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer the turkey breast to a baking sheet lined with a rack. Sear the remaining turkey breast, using 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and add it to the baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into the oven and bake until the turkey is cooked through and the internal temperature registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 60 minutes. Remove the turkey from the oven to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes before slicing. Cut away the butcher&#39;s twine, slice crosswise, arrange on a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35773,&quot;Creamsicle Crepe Cake Whipped cream and grated orange zest, for topping For the filling: 8 large egg yolks 2/3 cup granulated sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch Finely grated zest of 2 oranges, plus juice of 4 oranges 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Pinch of salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 cup cold heavy cream 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract For the crepes: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 large eggs 2 cups milk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Make the filling: Whisk the egg yolks, granulated sugar, cornstarch, orange zest, orange juice, lemon juice and salt in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula until the mixture comes to a simmer and is thick like pudding, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter until melted. Strain the filling through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pushing it through with a rubber spatula. Press plastic wrap onto the surface of the filling and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the crepe batter: Combine the flour, eggs, milk, melted butter, granulated sugar, vanilla and salt in a blender; blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed. Set aside, covered, 1 hour. (This prevents the crepes from turning out rubbery.) Finish the filling: Beat the heavy cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until it starts thickening, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until stiff peaks form, about 1 more minute. Beat in the vanilla. Stir one-quarter of the whipped cream into the orange filling, then gently fold in the rest. Cover and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Make the crepes: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lightly brush with butter, then pour 1/4 cup batter into the center of the pan. Quickly tilt and swirl the pan to coat and cook until the bottom is golden brown and the top is firm, about 1 minute. Loosen the edges of the crepe with a spatula, then flip with your fingers; cook until lightly browned on the other side, 30 more seconds. Invert onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the crepes as you go; lightly brush the pan with more butter as needed. You will have about 16 crepes. (Don&#39;t worry if a few tear-layer them in the middle of your cake.) Put 1 crepe on a platter and top with a scant 1/4 cup filling, spreading it to the edge. Repeat, stacking the remaining crepes and filling, and ending with a crepe. Refrigerate overnight (this will make slicing easier). Top with whipped cream and orange zest before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 35774,&quot;Ambrosia Extreme Makeover 1 cup creme fraiche, sour cream or yogurt 1/2 cup orange juice 1/4 cup lemon juice 3 tablespoons sugar 12 fresh mint leaves, chopped 2 ripe bananas 1 cantaloupe, peeled, seeded and cut into chunks 1 ripe pineapples, peeled, cored and cut into chunks 1 pint strawberries, hulled and quartered 1/2 cup red seedless grapes 3 kiwi, peeled and sliced Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the creme fraiche, orange and lemon juices, sugar and mint.

Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer until the pork and liver are tender, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the heat and drain, reserving the broth. Using a meat grinder with a 1/4-inch die or in a food processor, grind the pork mixture, 1/2 cup parsley, and 1/2 cup green onions. Turn the mixture into a mixing bowl. Stir in the rice, remaining salt, cayenne, and black pepper. Add the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a smooth, firm paste, and mix thoroughly. Adjust the seasoning, to taste. Let sit until cool enough to handle. In a large pot, preheat the vegetable oil to 360 degrees F. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour with 1 tablespoon of Essence. In another bowl, beat the eggs with the water and 1 teaspoon of Essence to make an egg wash. In a third bowl, season the bread crumbs with the remaining tablespoon of Essence. Shape the pork and rice mixture into balls the size of walnuts. Dredge the pork balls first in the flour, then dip in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off. Dredge the balls in the seasoned bread crumbs, turning to coat evenly. Using a slotted spoon, slide the balls in batches into the oil and fry, turning, until golden, about 2 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season lightly with Essence. To serve, place several boudin balls on a plate and garnish with chopped parsley. Serve with Creole Tartar Sauce on the side. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Put the egg, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, and green onions in a food processor and puree for 15 seconds. With the processor running, pour the oil through the feed tube in a steady stream. Add the cayenne, mustard, and salt and pulse once or twice to blend. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until well chilled before serving, 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35789,&quot;Espresso Chocolate Chip Cookie 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened 1 cup light brown sugar 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 large egg 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons instant espresso coffee powder 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Cream the butter with the sugars using an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy, approximately 30 seconds. Beat in the egg and the vanilla extract for another 30 seconds. In a mixing bowl, sift together the dry ingredients and beat into the butter mixture at low speed for about 15 seconds. Stir in the espresso coffee powder and chocolate chips. Using a 1-ounce scoop or a 2-tablespoon measure, drop cookie dough onto a greased cookie sheet about 3 inches apart. Gently press down on the dough with the back of a spoon to spread out into a 2-inch circle. Bake for about 20 minutes or until nicely browned around the edges.

(160 degrees C.). Place the beans in a large saucepan with plenty of water and allow to simmer for 2 hours along with the peeled tomatoes, sage, rosemary, garlic, pepper and chili powder. Add salt once the beans are cooked. Gently wash the mushroom caps with running water, protecting them with your hands so as to prevent them absorbing too much of the water. Place the mushrooms on a sheet of aluminum foil on a baking tray. Slice the garlic and gently insert each piece into the mushroom caps. Sprinkle the chopped nipitella over the mushrooms and add salt, pepper and a generous dash of olive oil. Wrap the mushrooms in the aluminum foil, carefully ensuring all the edges are sealed and place on a baking tray in a shallow bath of water. This is now ready to be cooked &#39;bain marie&#39; style for 20 minutes. Once the mushrooms are cooked, assemble them onto a plate with two large tablespoons of the cooked beans and some small shavings of crusty bread. Drizzle with olive oil and serve the dish piping hot. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 35792,&quot;Chocolate Brownie Baklava 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing pan 2 cups sugar 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (85 per cent cocoa preferred), melted and cooled 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup praline liqueur 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 5 sheets fillo dough 1/2 cup clarified butter 4 scoops good quality vanilla ice cream 1 cup caramel sauce 1 cup chocolate sauce 1 cup chopped pecans Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour a 9 by 13-inch pan. Place the softened butter in a large bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer, and whisk until it is pale yellow and light. Add the sugar and whisk until the mixture is light and fluffy. Whisk in the cooled chocolate, then add the eggs 1 at a time, whisking after each addition. Whisk in the vanilla and liqueur, sift in the flour, cocoa, and salt and fold them in until combined. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking pan, smoothing it out evenly, and bake in the center of the oven until the brownies have puffed slightly around the edges and are shiny on the surface, about 30 minutes. They will be very moist in the center. Allow the brownies to cool 4 to 6 hours, but overnight is best. When you are ready to make the baklava, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush the fillo sheets with clarified butter and stack them. Cut fillo sheets into 4 (6-inch) squares. Brush one side of the 4 squares with some caramel sauce and sprinkle with half of the chopped pecans. Cut the brownies into 3-inch squares (reserve remaining brownies for another purpose) and place one on each fillo square. Fold fillo sheets around the brownies like an envelope, brush them with clarified butter, and place them seam-side down on a baking sheet. Bake until they are golden brown, about 4 or 5 minutes.

Line the cake pan with parchment paper and brush or spray with oil. Cream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl until they begin to go pale. Add half the eggs and the all-purpose flour and mix well. Add the rest of the eggs, cake flour, unsweetened cocoa, salt, and baking powder and beat for a minute or two until the mixture is uniform. Dollop into the prepared pan and bake in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Let cool in the pan.<br> Meanwhile, make the buttercream. Put the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar in a bowl and whisk together until the mixture begins to go fluffy. Add the cooled melted chocolate and whisk for a further 2 minutes. Once the cake is completely cool, remove from the pan. Carefully cut the top flat with a large serrated knife. (Eat this bit as a chef&#39;s perk.) Turn the cake upside down on an 8in (20cm) cake board so that the bottom now becomes a nice flat top. Split the cake horizontally and sandwich the top and bottom together with a 1/2in (1cm) layer of buttercream. Spread half the remaining buttercream all over the top and sides of the cake, making it as smooth as possible. Put it in the refrigerator to set before doing another layer. This makes it much easier to get good squared-off edges. Gently push the cigarillos or wafers vertically onto the sides of the cake, positioning them as straight as possible and making sure they touch the bottom. The next step is up to you. I can&#39;t tell you the wide-eyed looks you&#39;ll get when you walk into the room holding the finished cake. Decorate with fresh flowers for a Christening or wedding, strawberries for a big family gathering, or with figs for a man&#39;s birthday.

In a medium bowl, add the butter, paprika, sage, thyme, garlic and a few grinds of black pepper. Mix with a rubber spatula. Add to a resealable plastic bag and snip a corner off with scissors. Butter the turkey. Fit a sheet pan with a wire rack and set aside. Using your finger or the rounded handle end of a wooden spoon, separate the skin from the meat on the breast and the legs of the turkey. Use the bag to pipe the butter beneath the skin. Use your fingers over the skin to press and spread the butter beneath the skin. Pat the turkey down with paper towels until one pressed on it releases dry. Place on the sheet pan and refrigerate the turkey, UNCOVERED, for 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Roast the turkey. Remove the turkey from the refrigerator and put it on the counter in a cool place. Allow it to come to room temperature for 2 hours. When ready to roast, transfer the turkey to a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Tie the ends of the drumsticks together with twine and tuck the wings underneath the body. While the turkey is coming to room temperature, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the turkey on the middle rack of the oven and pour enough beer into the pan to fill up to 1 to 2 inches. Roast, basting the turkey every 30 minutes with the beer in the pan, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the turkey (avoiding bone) registers 135 to 140 degrees F, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Make the glaze. In a medium bowl, add the brown sugar, mustard, vinegar and a few grinds black pepper. Whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Add water to loosen if necessary. Set aside. Once the turkey registers 135 to 140 degrees F, brush the glaze on the turkey every 20 minutes. Continue to roast until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F and the juices run clear, 30 minutes to 1 hour more. Remove the turkey from the oven and place a sheet of aluminum foil loosely over the top. Let rest for 10 to 20 minutes. Transfer the turkey to a platter and garnish the platter with lemon halves and sprigs of parsley and rosemary, if desired.

Add minced garlic. Once cooked, pour in tomato juice. Add chopped cilantro, green olives, and pulled turkey meat. Simmer on very low heat for 20 min. Turn off the heat and let your filling cool completely. Save dried cranberries for the assembly. Masa: Using the micro-grater attachment of a box grater, grate the Yautia, Green Plantains, Yuka and Pumpkin into a large mixing bowl. The consistency should be that of a loose dough or grits. Add your salt and anato oil, and mix well. Cranberry Sauce Escabeche:<br> Lightly cook the onions in the olive oil, until almost translucent; add peppercorns, olive oil, and bay leaf. Simmer for about 10 min. Add 3/4 of the can of the cranberry sauce once cooled, and mix lightly to break down the cranberry a bit. Let stand for 30 minutes. Serve chilled or at room temperature on top of the Pasteles. Assembly: Cut a piece of parchment paper about 10 inches by 5 inches. Cut two pieces of banana leaf about 8 inches by 4 inches. Lay the parchment paper on a flat work surface, so that it looks like a horizontal rectangle. Place one of the cut banana leafs in the center of the parchment paper. Brush a few drops of anato oil onto the center of the banana leaf. This adds color and flavor while preventing the masa (dough) from sticking. Place about 1 1/2 to 2 spoon fulls of masa onto the oil in the center of the banana leaf. Flatten and spread out the dough evenly, but do not go over the edge of the leaf. Place one spoon full of Turkey filling in the center of the dough. Sprinkle on a small amount of the dried cranberries on top of the filling Place another spoonful of masa (dough) on top of the meat filling. Spread the masa evenly to cover the filling. Brush a few drops of achiote oil on one side of the second piece of banana leaf.

Cut each scallop into 8 wedges. Cut the peeled shrimp into chunks that approximately match the size of the scallop wedges (unless you have rock shrimp, which doesn&#39;t need to be cut). In a medium bowl, pour enough lime juice over the scallop and shrimp pieces to cover. Toss gently so each piece is given a good lime juice bath. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place the bowl in the refrigerator to marinate for 4 to 10 hours. The shellfish is done when it&#39;s completely white and opaque and doesn&#39;t look or taste raw. In a separate bowl, mix the remaining lime juice with the lemon juice, coconut milk, and olive oil. You can chop the jalapeno, cilantro, and garlic by hand, but if you have a food processor it&#39;s much easier to pulse the 3 together. Add the pepper mixture to the coconut mixture, and stir in the red onion. (You may add the mango chunks here if you like, but I prefer to add them right before serving.) Season the mixture with the salt and mix well. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. When every chunk of shrimp and scallop is white with no hint of translucence, remove them from the juice. Discard the lime juice. Combine the seafood and the coconut milk mixture, tossing well. Add the mango chunks and gently toss together. Taste the seafood and add more salt or fresh lime juice, if desired. For a knockout presentation, spoon the seafood ceviche into the coconut shell halves and top with a sprinkle of unsweetened coconut, if desired. Pile warm tortilla chips around the coconut shells, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 35813,&quot;Balsamic Grilled Chicken Finger Sandwiches with Sundried Tomatoes and Herbed Goat Cheese Spread 2 1/4 pounds boneless chicken breasts 1 cup balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, minced Salt Pepper 1 cup sundried tomatoes, soaked for 15 minutes in hot water 8 ounces creamy goat cheese 1/4 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 pound foccacia bread Instructions: Combine the chicken breasts, vinegar, olive oil, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat the grill. Remove the chicken from the marinade. Place the chicken on the grill and grill for 4 minutes per side, or until the juices run clear. Remove the chicken from the grill and set aside. In a food processor, combine the sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, sour cream, oregano, basil and thyme. Process until well blended. Season the cheese mixture with salt and pepper. Set aside. Slice each chicken breast half in half. You should have 18 pieces that are each approximately 2 ounces. Cut focaccia into 18 (3-inch by 3-inch)squares. Cut each square in half horizontally. Spread the sundried tomato goat cheese spread on the bottom half of each piece of focaccia. Top the spread with a piece of chicken. Place the top piece of bread on top of the chicken.

Cook until oil is warm and pepper is fragrant when you waft it towards you, about 4 minutes. Add the onions, garlic, scallions, a pinch of cl flakes and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent them from browning, until the green of the scallions are wilted and darkened and the onion and garlic are tender, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add clam juice and lemon juice and bring to a light simmer; stir. Taste: If the tart of the tomatoes and lemon juice is too strong, add sugar in sprinkles, stirring and tasting as you go until it tastes just right. You may not use it at all or you may not use it all; it&#39;s totally optional. Raise the heat to medium and nestle the shrimp into the pan. Cover and cook on one side until shrimp begins to turn opaque and curl slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss and cook until shrimp just begins to turn pink on the other side, 1 to 2 more minutes. (Shrimp cooks fast and there&#39;s a thin line between done and overdone; the best rule is to remove the pan from the heat as it begins to reach the finish line.) Continue tossing and the heat of the pan will continue to cook the shrimp until done. Add pasta to a large serving bowl, then sprinkle with parsley, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with some more salt and pepper and top with the shrimp mixture. Serve warm during the winter or chilled during the summer. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 35815,&quot;Easy Chicken Pot Pie 1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell&#39;s?

Add about a third of the chilled butter cubes and process until the butter is absorbed. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the butter is the size of peas, 5 or 6 pulses. Add the vinegar. Then, pulsing quickly a few times as you do it, add the ice water through the tube. Squeeze some dough between your fingers, it should just hold its shape without feeling wet. If it is crumbly, add more ice water a tablespoon at a time. Pulse quickly and take care not to overwork or the dough will be tough. Wrap the dough loosely in a large piece of plastic wrap, then firmly press and flatten the dough into a thin round. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Lightly flour a work surface, then roll the dough into an 11- to 12-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Center the dough in a 9-inch pie plate, with an even overhang all around. Fold the edges and flute or crimp. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Press a piece of foil over the chilled crust, then fill with pie weights, raw beans or rice. Bake to set the crust, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and bake until the crust is light brown, 5 to 10 minutes more. Let cool slightly before adding the filling. Combine the bacon, sausage, salami, and ham with the Monterey Jack and sprinkle it in an even layer in the crust. Whisk together the half-and-half, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Stir in the parsley. Pour the custard over the filling.

Use a hot, clean, oiled grill. If pan roasting, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Liberally season the steak with the salt and pepper, coat with olive oil and press the seasoning into the meat. Grill the steaks for about 5 to 6 minutes on each side for medium rare. The fillet will cook a little faster than the strip loin. Move the steaks every 2 minutes or so for even cooking and a crispy exterior. For pan roasting, heat a cast iron skillet with a little olive oil until smoking hot. Turn on the fan, open the window and stand back to avoid getting splattered! Using tongs, place the steaks in the center of the pan. Cook until the first side is seared brown, about 4 minutes. Turn the steaks and place the pan in the oven until the steaks are done, about 6 minutes for medium rare. Remove the steaks to a carving board and let rest for at least 5 minutes before carving. Cut the steaks away from the bone and carve into 1/2-inch slices. Arrange the meat on warmed plates and drizzle a little bit of balsamic vinegar over the slices.

Add the diced butter and toss carefully with your fingers to coat each piece of butter with flour. Pulse 12 to 15 times, until the butter is the size of peas. While pulsing, add the ice water all at once through the feed tube. Pulse to combine, stopping just before the dough forms a ball. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and form it into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for one hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450? F. Heat the 4 tablespoons butter in a large (12-inch) saut pan over medium to medium-high heat. Add the leeks, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and saut for 8 minutes, until the leeks are tender and starting to brown. Set aside. Place the tomatoes on a plate, sprinkle them with salt and pepper and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Set aside. On a floured board, roll the dough into an 11-inch circle, then place it on a sheet of parchment paper. Turn a sheet pan upside down and transfer the paper to the inverted pan. Spread the leeks on the pastry, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border. Crumble the goat cheese evenly on top. Arrange the tomatoes over the goat cheese, overlapping the slices because they will shrink. Turn the edges of the pastry up and over the tomatoes, crimping so they lie flat. Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the pastry is nicely browned. Allow to cool on the pan for 5 minutes, sprinkle lightly with the fresh herbs and salt, cut in wedges and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 35827,&quot;Dad&#39;s Mushrooms 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter One 15-ounce can French onion soup<br> Salt and pepper to taste 2 1/2 pounds sliced white button mushrooms<br> Instructions: Melt the butter in a slow cooker on high.

(This dries out the meat&#39;s surface so it develops a better char.) Prepare a grill for indirect heat: For gas, preheat to medium high, 30 minutes, then turn off the burners on one side and turn the other burners to medium low. For charcoal, once the coals ash over, push them to one side. Rub the steaks with the garlic and let sit at room temperature, 30 minutes. Brush the grill grates with vegetable oil. Sear the steaks over direct heat until charred on the bottom, 5 to 10 minutes. Turn, season with salt and pepper and char the other side, 5 to 10 more minutes. Turn the steaks again and transfer to the cooler side of the grill with the smaller ends away from the heat. Season the steaks with salt and pepper and grill, turning every 2 minutes, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 125 degrees F for medium rare, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with the olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 35832,&quot;Very Berry Cream Cups 8 store bought sponge cake dessert cups 3 vanilla pudding snack cups 1/2 cup whipped topping 3/4 cup frozen mixed berries, thawed Fresh boysenberries, for garnish Strawberry syrup Instructions: Unwrap dessert cups and toast each side on grill.

Transfer mixture to bowl. The mixture should be firm enough to form balls; if not, add additional flour as needed. Shape mixture into balls about 2 inches in diameter. Toss in remaining 1/2 cup flour to coat all over. Set aside until oil is hot enough to fry. Heat oil over medium-high heat until about 375 degrees F. Test with some extra falafel mix to see if the temperature is right; it should sink and rise to the surface and float. Add falafel balls in batches so as not to crowd them and cook until crisp and golden, about 8 minutes. Carefully remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Fill pita halves with a few falafel balls, cucumber, lettuce, onions and peppers, and top with yogurt sauce. Combine all ingredients in a bowl until well incorporated. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 35848,&quot;Szechuan Shrimp with Chili Sauce 1 pound medium shrimp 4 teaspoons salt 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce 2 tablespoons chili sauce 2 teaspoons Shao Hsing 1 teaspoon thin soy sauce 1 teaspoon fish sauce 1 teaspoon chili paste with garlic 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon peanut oil 1/2 teaspoon hot chili oil 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon MSG 2 tablespoons fresh ginger root, finely minced 6 scallions, finely minced (about 2/3 cup) 3 tablespoons finely minced garlic 3 dried red chilies 4 cups peanut oil Instructions: Peel, devein and butterfly the shrimp. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the salt and allow to stand for 1/2 hour. During this time, prepare the sauce: mix together the hoisin sauce, the chili sauce, the Shao Hsing, the soy sauce, the fish sauce, the chili paste with garlic, the sesame oil, the peanut oil, the chili oil, the sugar and the MSG. In a wok, bring 4 cups of peanut oil to 375 degrees. When the shrimp are ready to cook, thoroughly wash off the salt with cold water. Add another teaspoon of salt to the shrimp, mix, let stand 30 seconds, and wash off the salt. Repeat this procedure twice more. The final time, drain well but do not dry--let some water cling to the shrimp. Immerse half of the shrimp in the hot oil and cook until just past translucent (20 seconds or so). Remove. Add the other half of the shrimp. The oil will not be as hot so this portion of shrimp may need 30 seconds to finish cooking. Remove. Drain all of the oil but 2 tablespoons from the wok. Over very high heat, stir-fry the ginger, the scallions, the garlic, and the dried chilies for one minute. Add the reserved shrimp. Toss. Add the prepared sauce. Stir to coat shrimp and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35849,&quot;Fresh Raspberry Sauce 1 (6-ounce) package fresh raspberries 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup (12 ounces) seedless raspberry jam, such as Tiptree (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 tablespoon framboise liqueur Instructions: Place the raspberries, sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat.

Lightly butter a 3-quart baking dish. Arrange the bread cubes on a rimmed baking pan in a single layer. Bake until light golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up any clumps, until brown, about 6 minutes. Transfer the sausage to the bowl with the bread using a slotted spoon. Reduce the heat to medium, add the remaining 3 tablespoons butter with the celery, fennel, onion, 3/4 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 more minutes. Transfer to the bowl. Add the broth, sage and thyme to the bowl and toss to coat thoroughly. If the mixture is very hot, cool until it is just warm, then add the eggs and toss to coat. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F.

Next, sprinkle the salmon fillets with the salt and pepper. Then, add to the oil, skin-side up, and allow to sear for 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, flip the fish and repeat cooking until desired temperature, 3 to 4 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the pan and allow to rest for 4 to 5 minutes before serving.<br> For the salad: In a saucepan over high heat, combine 2 cups water, the white balsamic vinegar and sugar. Stir the mixture and heat until the sugar is fully dissolved. Once the sugar is dissolved, add the onions and cook for 3 minutes. Then add the tomatoes and cook for a final minute. Once the tomatoes have cooked, remove from the heat and toss in the watermelon and basil.

Add the onions with a good pinch of salt and a few turns of pepper and cook, stirring, until very soft, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low, add 1/4 cup water and cook, stirring occasionally, until the water is evaporated and the onions are lightly caramelized, 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Divide the pie dough into 8 equal parts and shape into balls (keep half of the dough balls covered in the fridge while you aren&#39;t working with them to keep them cold). On a lightly floured surface, roll out the balls to ovals that are 8 inches long and about 6 inches wide. Top the bottom half of each dough piece with a pile of cheese and a pile of onions, leaving a 1-inch border. In the top half of each dough piece, punch out an upside down ghost face with piping tips or tiny round cookie cutters (it&#39;s upside down so that when you fold it over on top of the filling, it&#39;s right-side up). Brush the edges with egg, fold the top down over the filling and fold the sides in on themselves so that you have ghost shape. (Or, rather, a shape of a tiny kid in a bedsheet ghost costume that&#39;s lying down.) Press around the side and bottom edges to seal, transfer to the baking sheets, brush the tops all over with egg wash and sprinkle with a little salt. Bake until golden brown; begin checking for doneness at 20 minutes. Let cool slightly. Mix together the Dijon mustard and honey in a small bowl. Serve the hand pies warm or at room temperature with the mustard sauce. To make the dough, combine the cider vinegar and 6 tablespoons water in a measuring cup and stick it in the fridge (or the freezer even) to get really cold. In a large bowl or food processor, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Add the butter and either use your hands to toss it with the flour and pinch the butter into flat sheets, or pulse in the food processor, incorporating the butter so that about 75 percent of the mixture is mealy. The rest of the mixture should have some slightly larger, pea-sized bits of butter. Drizzle in the vinegar and water and mix with your hands or continue to pulse in the food processor just until the mixture comes together to form a dough. If it seems dry or is having a hard time coming together, add a bit more water a few drops at a time until it comes together. Turn it out onto a clean surface, using your hands to press on any stray crumbs, and divide the dough in half. Pat the halves into discs, wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35856,&quot;Hoisin Marinated Chicken with Napa Slaw 4 chicken breasts, skin on with drummette 1/2 cup hoisin sauce 1 tablespoon sambal 1 bunch chopped scallions 1/2 cup red wine 1/4 cup minced garlic 1/4 cup minced ginger 1 teaspoon black pepper 1/2 cup fish sauce 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar 1/2 tablespoon cl flakes 1/2 bunch basil chiffonade 1/2 tablespoon sugar Salt and black pepper to taste 3 cups napa cabbage chiffonade 1 cup carrots shredded 1 cup bean sprouts 1/2 cup scallions chopped Instructions: Mix all ingredients together and marinate chicken, covered and refrigerated at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. On a hot grill, season chicken and cook through, about 8 minutes a side. Be careful not to burn the skin. SLAW: In a bowl, whisk together fish sauce, vinegar, cl flakes, basil and sugar. Toss together the vegetables together and add to vinaigrette. Toss well and check for seasoning.

In a non-stick skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat until it bubbles. Stir a pinch of kosher salt into egg mixture then pour into pan, stirring slowly with a heat resistant rubber spatula. As soon as curds begin to form, increase heat to high and instead of stirring, use the spatula to fold the eggs over themselves while gently shaking the pan with your other hand. As soon as no more liquid is running around the bottom of the pan, remove from the heat and serve. Season with fresh black pepper and garnish with fresh chives or parsley. Remember: if they look done in the pan, they&#39;ll be over-done on the plate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35858,&quot;Bacon-Citrus Vinaigrette 1/4 cup cider vinegar 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice 2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lime juice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup warm bacon fat Instructions: Whisk the vinegar, orange juice, sugar, lime juice and a generous pinch of salt together in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in the bacon fat, starting with a few drops and then adding the rest in a steady stream to make a smooth, slightly thick dressing. Whisk in a few grinds pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 35859,&quot;Mace and Black Pepper Brandy Alexander 2 pinches mace 1 1/2 ounces heavy cream<br> 1 ounce brandy<br> 1 ounce creme de cacao<br> Ice<br> Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Make an ice bath in a heatproof bowl or a high-sided saute pan. Set aside. In a pot over medium-low heat, add the mace to the heavy cream. Bring the heavy cream up to a simmer, then remove the pot from the heat directly to the ice bath and stir until fully chilled. (If not using right away, transfer to a container and chill in the refrigerator until ready to use.) Combine the cream, brandy and creme de cacao in a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake until very cold. Strain into a tall cocktail glass and garnish with black pepper, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Banyuls, Tawny Port, Madeira, Sherry]&quot; 35860,&quot;White Grape Spritzer 16 ounces brandy or cognac (2 cups) 16 ounces white grape juice (2 cups) 1 ounce lime juice (from about 2 limes) One 750-milliliter bottle sparkling wine, such as Prosecco, chilled 1/2 cup red and white grapes, sliced into thirds, for garnish Instructions: Combine the brandy, grape juice and lime juice in a large pitcher or carafe. Refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours. When ready to serve, pour 2 ounces each into champagne flutes, then top with 6 ounces of the sparkling wine. Garnish with the red and white grapes, about 4 slices per glass. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35861,&quot;Triple Chocolate Brownies 3 sticks plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 12 ounces best-quality bittersweet chocolate 6 eggs 1 3/4 cups superfine sugar 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup white chocolate buttons, chips, or morsels 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate buttons, chips or morsels Approximately 2 teaspoons confectioners&#39; sugar, for garnish Special equipment: Baking tin (approximately 11 1/4 inches by 9 inches by 2 inches), sides and base lined with baking parchment. Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter and dark chocolate together in a large heavy based pan over a low heat. In a bowl or large measuring jug, beat the eggs together with the superfine sugar and vanilla extract. Allow the chocolate mixture to cool a little, then add the egg and sugar mixture and beat well. Fold in the flour and salt. Then stir in the white chocolate buttons or chips, and the semisweet chocolate buttons or chips. Beat to combine then scrape and pour the brownie mixture into the prepared tin. Bake for about 25 minutes. You can see when the brownies are ready because the top dries to a slightly paler brown speckle, while the middle remains dark, dense and gooey. Even with such a big batch you do need to keep checking on it: the difference between gooey brownies and dry ones is only a few minutes. Remember, too, that they will continue to cook as they cool. To serve, cut into squares while still warm and pile up on a large plate, sprinkling with confectioners&#39; sugar pushed with a teaspoon through a small sieve. &quot;,&quot;[Port, Tawny Port, Ruby Port, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 35862,&quot;Rabbit Stroganoff 4 boneless rabbit breasts 3/4 cup flour, seasoned with salt and pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 (10-ounce) can beef broth 1 cup water 1 medium onion, finely chopped 1 cup sour cream 1/2 cup white cooking wine Cooked rice or pasta, serving suggestion Instructions: Cut rabbit meat into cubes and toss in seasoned flour.

Melt half the butter with a drop of oil in a heavy casserole, and brown the quails on all sides over medium-high heat. Cook&#39;s Note: you could also use lard. Remove the quail from the pan, and set aside. Add the bacon to the pan, brown it, and remove. Finally, fry the onion until golden, adding more fat to the pan beforehand, if needed. Stir the flour into the onions, and cook 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with the wine, stirring up the good bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Return the onions, bacon and quails to the pot. Pour over the stock, cover, and simmer until the quails are just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining butter (a little more if you like) and cook each type of mushroom separate, as the various types cook differently. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper as you go, then, at the end, toss them all together with the chopped parsley. When the quails are done, remove them from the cooking liquid and keep them warm while you boil the juices, uncovered, to reduce to thin sauce consistency. Add the mushrooms to the sauce.

For the turkey breasts: Arrange a wire rack over a baking sheet. Combine the butter with the herbs. Loosen the skin on the turkey breasts and place the butter between the skin and breast meat, working out to the edges evenly. Place a bay leaf between the skin and meat. Spray the skin with olive oil, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast to 165 degrees internal temperature, about 1 hour. Remove and cover loosely with foil to cool back to room temp, reserving the drippings for the gravy. Then cover and store for a make-ahead meal, as well as another night&#39;s meal, such as the Turkey Club Enchilada Casserole. For the stuffing: Melt 6 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium heat. Grease a casserole dish with 1 tablespoon of remaining butter, and reserve the rest to dot the top of the stuffing once it is in its casserole dish. To the melted butter, add the herbs, celery, apples, onions, bay leaf and some salt and pepper. Cook to tender, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the stuffing cubes and moisten with the stock until damp, but not wet. Fill the casserole dish and dot the top with butter. Cover and refrigerate to store. For the gravy: Melt the butter in a large skillet and season liberally with black pepper. Whisk in the flour until light golden in color. Then whisk in the stock and Worcestershire and simmer at low boil to thicken. Add any pan drippings from the roasted turkey breasts. Once the gravy lightly coats the back of a spoon, add a ladle of it to the egg yolk while beating with fork. Then add the yolk back to gravy to gloss it up, stir in. Add the mustard, if using. Add salt to taste. Cool and store. To serve: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the rack in center of oven. Bring the stuffing to room temp, then bake until crispy on top and hot through. Reheat the gravy over medium heat, partially covered and stirring occasionally. While the stuffing is in the oven and the gravy is reheating, heat up an additional couple cups of plain stock in a high-sided skillet. Thinly slice 1 turkey breast, removing the bay leaf when you get to it. For each sandwich, very lightly toast a slice of bread and place on a dinner plate. Top the bread with a scoop of stuffing (I use an ice cream scoop). Set a few slices of turkey into broth to heat through. Arrange the turkey slices over the mound of stuffing. Liberally ladle the gravy over the top of the sandwich and garnish with chopped parsley. Save any leftover gravy for another meal, such as the Turkey Club Enchilada Casserole later in the week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35876,&quot;Marinated Cherry Tomatoes with Arugula 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon sugar<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar<br> 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 6 ounces arugula, washed and dried 2 ounces shaved Parmesan Instructions: Combine the cherry tomatoes in a medium bowl with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.

Add onions and garlic and saute until the onions are translucent. Add the potatoes and salt and stir to insure the potatoes are coated with the oil. Fry potatoes over medium heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, but don&#39;t allow them to get color. Add the tomatoes, then using the can, fill it up 1 1/2 times with water, and add to the soup. Add pepper and sugar bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until potatoes are tender. Add the peas, including the juice, and stir gently. Simmer another 30 minutes. Next increase the heat to medium-high and bring the soup to a boil. Crack eggs into a separate bowl and gently add to the top of the boiling soup in a clock pattern until there is no more room.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with a fork and then pour it into the flour/shortening mixture. Add the cold water, white vinegar, and salt. Stir together gently until all of the ingredients are incorporated. Separate the dough in half. Form 2 evenly sized balls of dough and place both balls of dough into a large plastic bag. Using a rolling pin, slightly flatten each ball of dough (to about 1/2-inch thick) to make rolling easier later. Seal the bags and place them in the freezer until you need them. (If you will be using it immediately it&#39;s still a good idea to put in the freezer for about 15 to 20 minutes to chill). When you&#39;re ready to use the dough to make a crust, remove from the freezer and allow to thaw for 15 minutes. On a floured surface, roll the dough, starting at the center and working your way out. Sprinkle some flour over the top of the dough if it&#39;s a bit too moist. If the dough is sticking to the countertop, use a metal spatula and carefully scrape it up and flip it over and continue rolling until it&#39;s about 1/2-inch larger in diameter than your pie pan. With a spatula, lift the dough carefully from the surface of the counter into the pie pan. Gently press the dough against the corner of the pan. Go around the pie pan pinching and tucking the dough to make a clean edge. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35900,&quot;5-Ingredient Quinoa Salad with Edamame and Carrots 3/4 cup dry quinoa 1 1/4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth 1 cup frozen shelled edamame 1 tablespoon dark sesame oil 1/2 cup shredded carrots Instructions: Put the quinoa in a medium pot and cover with cold water; let soak 5 minutes.

Set aside for 5 minutes. In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, blend the flours and salt. With the mixer running on low, pour in the yeast and water mixture. Mix for 1 minute, then add in the honey and olive oil. Once the dough comes together, add the olives. Mix until the olives are just incorporated. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand until smooth and elastic, 2 to 3 minutes. Put the dough on an oiled 13 by 9-inch baking sheet, cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes in a warm place. While the dough is rising, heat the 8 ounces of olive oil and garlic cloves in a small skillet over low heat. Simmer until the garlic is golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Divide the goat cheese between 6 small oven-proof bowls or ramekins. Divide the garlic, olive oil and nicoise olives between the bowls. Set aside. When the focaccia dough has risen, press the dough down with your fingertips until it fills the baking sheet, then brush with olive oil. Bake until golden brown and hollow sounding when tapped, about 45 to 50 minutes. Add the goat cheese bowls to the oven during the last 10 to 15 minutes of baking time. Bake until the cheese is warm and lightly browned. Slice the focaccia into thick wedges and serve 2 slices of warm focaccia with each bowl of warm goat cheese.

Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Place nuts in bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade. Pulse 10 or 12 times at 1-second intervals to finely grind without reducing to a paste. Remove cover and scrape inside of work bowl with a spatula. Add remaining ingredients except butter and pulse once or twice to combine. Add butter and pulse 3 or 4 times, until mixture is evenly moistened and looks crumbly. Remove blade and turn mixture out into prepared pan. Using your fingertips, distribute the crumb mixture evenly over the bottom and sides of the pan, gently pressing into place. Make sure that the crumb coating is even because thin spots will burn during baking. Use the back of a spoon to smooth the surface of the crust and to make the rim of the crust straight and even. Bake the crust for about 20 minutes, or until the surface of the crust is a deep golden brown. Watch carefully, because the high sugar content makes them burn easily. Cool on rack. To make the filling: Combine 2 cups milk, sugar and salt in a nonreactive saucepan; whisk once to mix and bring to a boil over low heat. Place remaining 1/2 cup milk in a mixing bowl and whisk in cornstarch, then eggs. Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil over low heat then whisk about a third of it into the egg mixture. Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil once more and whisk in the egg mixture, whisking constantly until the filling thickens and comes to a boil. Allow to boil, whisking constantly, for about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, whisk in butter and vanilla; pour into a nonreactive bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface of the filling and chill until it is approximately 75 degrees. Spread the cooled filling evenly in the cooled crust. To finish the pie, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla until it holds a firm peak. Use a hand mixer on medium speed or a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whisk. Spread the cream over the filling, making sure it touches the edges of the crust all around. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 35908,&quot;Creamy Parmesan Pasta Salad with White Beans and Sun-dried Tomatoes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano 1/4 teaspoon finely grated garlic 8 ounces dried farfalle One 15-ounce can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained 3/4 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped 1/2 cup thinly sliced celery Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Add the beans, bring back to a boil and boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the beans soak in the warm water for 1 hour. Place the slab of bacon, one third of the onions, and the bouquet garni bundle in the pot with the beans and bring to a simmer, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface. Simmer, uncovered, for about 1 1/2 hours, or until beans are just tender, adding water if necessary to keep the beans covered while cooking. Drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid, saving the bacon, and discarding the herb bundle. Cut the lamb into 2 inch chunks, removing excess fat, and pat dry. Pour the duck fat into a heavy, 8 quart casserole, and heat until almost smoking. Brown the meat, in batches, on all sides, and set aside. Lower the heat, add the remaining onions, and saute until golden, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the pureed garlic, tomato puree, thyme, and bay leaves, and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Add white wine and reduce by half. Return the lamb to the casserole along with the brown stock, salt and pepper, and stir well. Bring to a simmer, cover, and simmer slowly for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until fork tender. Remove the meat and reserve. Remove all but 2 tablespoons fat and adjust the seasonings. Pour the cooked beans into the lamb cooking juices. If necessary, add the bean cooking liquid so that the beans are well covered. Bring to a simmer, cook for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes. Drain the beans, reserving the cooking juices. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Slice the bacon into 1/4 inch pieces. Arrange a layer of beans in the bottom of the casserole, then continue with alternating layers of lamb, and duck, ending with a layer of beans. Pour enough of the meat and bean cooking juices over the top so the liquid comes just to the top layer of beans. Mix the bread crumbs with the parsley and spread over the top. Drizzle with the duck fat. Bring the casserole to a simmer on the stove, then place it in the oven. After about 20 minutes, when the top has a light crust on it, turn the oven down to 350 degrees F. Break the crust with a spoon and baste the casserole with the liquid. Bake for about 40 more minutes, and continue to baste as the crust reforms, but leave a final crust for serving. Serve warm from the casserole. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Barolo]&quot; 35937,&quot;Spaghetti Squash with Fresh Tomatoes and Ricotta 2 cups grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise or quartered if large 1 tablespoon finely minced shallot 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1/4 teaspoon red cl flakes 1 small garlic clove, finely grated 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil Kosher salt One 2-pound spaghetti squash 1/3 cup whole-milk ricotta Instructions: Stir together the tomatoes, shallot, vinegar, cl flakes, garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon basil and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Set aside to marinate, stirring the tomatoes every 10 minutes, while you prepare the spaghetti squash. Carefully slice off the top and bottom of the squash, trimming just enough so that the inner flesh of the squash is exposed. Use a sharp paring knife to poke ten to twelve 1/2-inch-deep slits all over the squash. Put the squash in to a medium glass heatproof bowl and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Carefully flip the squash over and microwave on high until a fork easily pierces through the flesh that is exposed on the squash, about 5 additional minutes. Allow the squash to cool enough so that you can handle it, then split it in half length-wise. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and discard them. Then use a fork to loosen the squash strands and transfer them to a medium bowl. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 teaspoon salt. Use your hands to gently work the oil and salt into the squash. Transfer the squash to a serving platter and pour the tomato mixture over the top (along with all of its juices). Top with spoonfuls of the ricotta and garnish with the remaining basil. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 35938,&quot;Crispy Snapper with Potato Salad 1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 3/4-inch chunks Kosher salt 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1/4 cup chopped pickled hot cherry peppers 1/4 cup chopped pitted kalamata olives 1 stalk celery, thinly sliced, plus 1/2 cup celery leaves 1 clove garlic, finely grated 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground pepper 1 1/4 pounds red snapper fillet (1 large piece or 4 small fillets) 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley Lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with water by about 1 inch; season with salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until just tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Combine the vinegar, cherry peppers, olives, sliced celery and garlic in a large bowl. Drain the potatoes well; add to the bowl. Drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss. Gently drag the blade of a knife back and forth across the fish skin to remove any moisture or remaining scales. Score the fish skin, making shallow diagonal slits about 3/4 inch apart (this prevents the fish from curling when cooked). If you have a large fillet, cut it into 4 pieces. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the fish skin-side down and immediately press with a spatula to prevent it from curling. Cook, rotating the skillet occasionally so the fish cooks evenly, until the skin is browned and crisp and the flesh is cooked about two-thirds of the way up the sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until just cooked through, about 1 more minute. Immediately transfer to a paper towel\\u2013lined plate. Add the parsley and celery leaves to the potato salad and toss; season with salt and pepper. Divide the fish and potato salad among plates; serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 35939,&quot;Raspberry Peach Aqua Fresca 1 pint fresh raspberries, picked over and rinsed 2 tablespoons agave nectar, or more depending on sweetness of fruit 6 large overly ripe peaches, halved and pitted Juice of 1 lime 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Combine the raspberries and agave in a bowl. Macerate at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br> Put the macerated raspberries, peaches, 4 cups cold water, lime juice and vanilla in a blender. Blend until smooth. Strain the mixture into a pitcher and add more agave if needed. Cover the pitcher and let chill for at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 35940,&quot;Pate a Choux: a Classic Pastry Goes Mexican 1 cup water or milk 1/2 cup butter (4 tablespoons) 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar if making a sweet pastry 1 cup flour 4 eggs (1 cup) Instructions: Place liquid, butter, salt and sugar, if using, in a medium saucepan and bring slowly to a simmer. Turn off heat and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until it forms a ball. Return to medium heat to dry the paste so it will have the maximum puffing ability: turn the ball around in the pan, pressing it against the sides and flipping it over, until butter starts oozing out and the paste no longer sticks to your fingers. Remove from heat and let cool a bit. Turn the paste into a medium bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle and beat in the eggs, one at a time, with a wooden spoon or the paddle. Each time you add an egg, the mixture will become slippery and messy but will then come together, at which point you can add the next egg. Load mixture into pastry bag with a round tip (1/2 or 1-inch depending on size puff desired) and pipe out as required. It will give the fullest puff if used right away but can be held for several hours. Basic proportions for Pate a Choux are 1:1:1:1/2, or 1 cup liquid, 1 cup flour:1 cup egg:1/2 cup butter. Water makes choux more crisp, milk makes them more tender, Puffs expand when cooked as water in batter turns to steam and explodes the dough. Pate a choux is an extremely versatile pastry that can be the base of many sweet and savory dishes. It can take many forms: be poached as gnocchi, baked to form hollow puffy balls that can be filled with various things, or fried as fritters and sprinkled with sugar. It is neutral in flavor so is adaptable to any cuisine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 35941,&quot;Japanese Eggplants with Sriracha Shrimp 4 small Japanese eggplants (about 6 inches) 1 teaspoon olive oil 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 pound shrimp (21 to 25 count) cleaned, deveined and diced 1/3 cup rice vinegar 1 tablespoon agave syrup 1/2 cup seeded and 1/4-inch diced red bell pepper 1/4 cup diced snow peas 3/4 cup mayonnaise 2 teaspoons Sriracha hot chili sauce 1 teaspoon sweet chili sauce 1 lime, zested and juiced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and salt and continue whipping until soft peaks form. With the mixer running, gradually add 1 cup of the sugar and continue whipping until stiff and the sugar has dissolved, about 30 seconds. In a small bowl, stir together the hot water and instant coffee to make coffee extract. Using a sieve over a large bowl, sift the remaining 1/2 cup sugar with the pre-sifted cake flour 3 times, to aerate the mixture. Fold the flour mixture into the egg whites in batches; then fold in the vanilla and dissolved coffee. Spoon the batter into an ungreased 9 or 10-inch tube pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Bake until light golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool by turning the cake (in the pan) upside down, propped on top of a bottle until it cools to room temperature. Run a long, sharp knife blade, or a butter knife, around the cake to loosen, then knock the cake out onto a plate or work it out with your fingers. The outside crumb of the cake will remain in the pan; exposing the white cake underneath. Make the Glaze: Stir the ingredients together until smooth. Add more liquid if too thick or more sugar if too thin. Pour glaze over the top of the cake, letting it drip down naturally. Let glaze set until hard, at least 30 minutes before serving.

Add the Chihuahua cheese and Birria meat, then let the cheese melt for 1 minute. Drop 2 ounces of the Birria broth on top of the quesabirrias, then fold and let them get crispy on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and let them get crispy on the other side, another 2 minutes, then remove to a plate. Put the onion and cilantro in a 6-ounce soup cup and fill with the remaining 6 ounces Birria broth. Serve on the plate with the quesabirrias, then add the Mexican grilled onion, grilled serrano pepper, the lime wedge and the Salsa Birriera to complete the dish. The best way to eat them is by putting some salsa inside the quesabirria, and some in the broth. Squeeze the lime in the broth as well, then roll your quesabirria, dip it in and enjoy. Cut the meat into big chunks, then put them in a pot with 1 gallon of water and put it on the heat. In a small pot, make an adobo, using the peppers, garlic, tomatillos, tomatoes and 1/2 gallon water. Boil for 10 minutes, then blend and add to the pot with the meat.

Preheat the oven to 400F. Remove the packet of neck and giblets and set aside. Cut away any fatty pieces near the cavity or neck of the bird and discard. Pat the turkey dry inside and out with paper towels and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper inside and out. Combine the butter and chopped rosemary. Loosen the skin over the breast of the turkey and push half of the butter mixture under the skin and over the breast meat. Rub the skin of the turkey with the rest of the butter mixture. Stuff the cavity of the turkey with the lemons and rosemary sprigs. Tie the legs together with twine. Tuck the wings under the body of the turkey and place it, breast side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.</li><li>Roast the turkey until it begins to turn golden, about 25 minutes. Loosely tent the breast with foil, then reduce the oven temperature to 325F. Continue cooking, basting the turkey with pan drippings every 30 minutes, until the internal temperature near the thigh joint reaches about 155F. Remove the foil and continue roasting until it reaches 165F., about 30 minutes longer. Transfer the turkey and rack to a cutting board and let rest about 30 minutes while you make the gravy.</li><li>For the gravy: Using a fat separator or spoon, remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the drippings in the roasting pan. Transfer the drippings and any brown bits from the bottom of the pan to a large straight-sided skillet. Set over medium-high heat. Add the giblets and neck and cook until nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Add the carrot, celery, onion, sage and rosemary.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a pencil, trace two 8-inch-diameter circles, side-by-side, on the parchment paper.<br> Beat the egg whites until fluffy in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Gradually add the superfine sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, with the machine running on medium-low speed, until the mixture holds soft peaks. Beat in the cream of tartar and salt. Increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture is thick and holds stiff peaks, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. Place the meringue in the piping bag. Pipe the meringue into two 8-inch circles on the prepared baking sheet using the traced circles as a guide. Bake until crisp, 2 hours. Turn off the oven and allow the meringues to cool completely while still in the oven, about 2 hours.<br> For the cream: Beat the cream on high speed until thick using an electric hand mixer. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Continue to beat on high speed until the cream holds stiff peaks. Add the raspberries and beat until incorporated into the cream.<br> Spread one-third of the cream over each meringue circle. Place 1 circle on top of the other to create 2 layers. Spread the remaining cream on the sides of the cake. Garnish with fresh raspberries if using, and freeze the cake until firm, 3 hours.<br> For the syrup: Mix the raspberries, vinegar and maple syrup in a small saucepan. Lightly mash the raspberries using a fork. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until thick, 25 to 30 minutes.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Remove the stems from the chard but keep the leaves whole. Add the chard to the boiling water (the pot will be packed at first) and cook for 10 minutes. Drain in a colander and run under cool water. Drain again, then wrap the chard in a kitchen towel and squeeze to remove the excess water. Chop the chard. Meanwhile, heat the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking, for 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and season with salt, pepper and a little nutmeg. Simmer until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Adjust the seasonings to taste. Stir in 1/3 cup Roasted Garlic Paste. Spread half the chard in the bottom of a medium casserole dish. Top with half the garlic sauce and half the cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with the cheese. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the casserole from the oven and turn on the broiler. Halve the bread lengthwise, then cut in half crosswise to make four 12-inch-long pieces. Broil the bread, cut-side up, until charred, about 1 minute. Slather with the remaining Roasted Garlic Paste and top each piece with one-quarter of the chard au gratin. Cut each pizza in half and serve. The unbaked chard au gratin can covered be and refrigerated for a make-ahead meal. Bring to room temperature, then bake as directed. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Arrange the garlic in a cluster on a large piece of foil and drizzle with 1/4 cup EVOO. Wrap up the garlic in the foil to make a tightly sealed pouch. Roast until very tender, about 45 minutes. Let cool, then squeeze the garlic from the skins into a food processor. Add the remaining 3/4 cup EVOO and the honey and season with salt and pepper. Puree until smooth, then transfer to a small container. (Alternatively, you can mash the garlic paste with a fork instead of using a food processor.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 35966,&quot;Chocolate Raspberry Pavlova 6 large egg whites 2 cups superfine sugar 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted 1 teaspoon balsamic or red wine vinegar 2 ounces dark chocolate, finely chopped 2 cups heavy cream 4 cups raspberries 1 to 2 ounces dark chocolate Instructions: Prepare the pan: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment. Draw a 9-inch-diameter circle on the paper with a pencil, tracing a round cake tin that size. Flip the paper over so your meringue doesn&#39;t touch the pencil marks - you&#39;ll still be able to see the circle. Make the meringue: Beat the egg whites with a mixer until satiny peaks form, and then beat in the sugar a spoonful at a time until the meringue is stiff and shiny. Add the chocolate: Sprinkle the cocoa, vinegar and then the chopped chocolate over the egg whites. Gently fold everything with a rubber spatula until the cocoa is thoroughly mixed in. Shape the meringue: Secure the parchment to the baking sheet with a dab of meringue under each corner. Mound the meringue onto the parchment within the circle, smoothing the sides and the top with a spatula. Bake the meringue: Place in the oven, then immediately turn the temperature down to 300 degrees F and cook for one to one and a quarter hours. When it&#39;s ready, it should look crisp and dry on top, but when you prod the center you should feel the promise of squidginess beneath your fingers. Let it cool: Turn off the oven and open the door slightly; let the chocolate meringue disk cool completely in the oven. When you&#39;reready to serve, invert onto a big flatbottomed plate and peel off the parchment. Decorate the Pavlova: Whisk the cream till thick but still soft and pile it on top of the meringue, then scatter the raspberries on top. Coarsely grate the chocolate haphazardly over the top so that you get curls of chocolate rather than rubble, as you don&#39;t want the raspberries&#39; luscious color and form to be obscured. You want the Pavlova to look like a frosted cake. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 35967,&quot;Lemon Fried Chicken 2 pounds boneless chicken legs Juice of 4 lemons 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour Pinch kosher salt One 14-gram packet dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) Extra-virgin olive oil, for frying Instructions: Cut the chicken into small 2-bite pieces and place in a bowl.

The texture should be that of hollandaise sauce.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 35975,&quot;Chicken and Bacon Waffles 16 slices bacon 4 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons baking powder 1 tablespoon sugar Kosher salt 3 large eggs plus 1 egg white 3 cups buttermilk, plus more if needed 1 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly Cooking spray 3 cups peanut or vegetable oil, for frying 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2-inch-wide strips Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour Maple syrup, for serving Instructions: Make the waffle batter: Dice 10 bacon slices; cook in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Add the remaining 6 bacon slices to the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 9 to 11 minutes. Remove to the paper towels; reserve the drippings in the skillet. Combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Whisk the whole eggs, buttermilk and melted butter in a separate bowl, then whisk into the flour mixture until smooth. Stir in the cooked diced bacon. Transfer 2 cups of the batter to a separate large bowl for the chicken; reserve the remaining batter for the waffles. Make the chicken: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Add the peanut oil to the skillet with the reserved bacon drippings; heat over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Add the thyme, paprika and cayenne to the 2 cups waffle batter; add up to 2 tablespoons buttermilk if the batter is too thick. Season the chicken with salt and black pepper, then toss with the flour. Add the chicken to the batter and set aside until ready to fry. Set a rack on a baking sheet. Working in batches, remove the chicken from the batter, letting the excess drip off, then fry until golden brown, 2 minutes per side; transfer to the rack and season with salt. Transfer to the oven and bake until no longer pink in the middle, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the waffles: Spray a waffle iron with cooking spray and preheat. Whisk the egg white in a bowl until soft peaks form; fold into the reserved waffle batter. Ladle 1/2 to 1 cup batter into the waffle iron for each waffle and cook according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Serve with the fried chicken, bacon slices and maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 35976,&quot;Lemon Meringue Pie 4 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons sugar 12 ounces (3 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/2 cup ice water (strain out the ice just before using) 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 1 cup sugar 3 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch 3 tablespoons flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups water 1 1/2 lemons, zested 1/3 cup lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract 3 egg yolks 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup sugar, superfine 2 tablespoons water 4 large egg whites 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar Instructions: Plain and Perfect Pie Crust: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter. Turn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape into round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.)<br> When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won&#39;t be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It&#39;s entirely up to you. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don&#39;t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don&#39;t do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm up the butter. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11 inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies. Set your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it&#39;s up to you. Either choice will work. To transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.<br> Don&#39;t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don&#39;t be concerned; we&#39;ll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. Working around the rim, turn the crust under itself (not under the rim of the pan) to make a thick edge, pressing it firmly against the pan to reduce shrinkage. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \\V\\ with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Chill the finished crust for 20 to 30 minutes before baking the pie.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don&#39;t turn it down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights or dried beans. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \\blond.\\ Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent overbaking, until medium brown.<br> Filling: In a saucepot over high heat, combine sugar, cornstarch, flour, salt and water. Bring to a boil and stir until thickened, about 3 minutes. Combine the lemon zest, juice and extract with the yolks. Temper the yolks with the hot sugar mixture. Stir in the butter and strain through a fine mesh strainer if necessary. Put the mixture back over heat and cook for another 3 minutes. Transfer the custard to the pie crust, hot.<br> Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Pie Crust Courtesy of \\Butter Sugar Flour Eggs\\ by Gale Gand, Rick Tramonto, Julia Moskin, Clarkson N.

Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners and spay the liners lightly with cooking spray. Reserve 1/2 cup of the blueberries for garnish. Place the remaining blueberries in a large bowl and lightly crush them with the back of a fork (crushing keeps them from sinking to the bottom of the muffin batter during baking). Add the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt to the blueberries and stir to combine. Whisk together the milk, oil, brown sugar, carrots, eggs, lemon zest and vanilla in another bowl, whisking until no clumps of brown sugar remain. Fold the milk mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (don&#39;t worry if there are a few lumps). Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Press the reserved blueberries into the tops of the muffins. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and sprinkle the tops of the muffins with the turbinado sugar. Rotate the pan and continue to bake until the muffins are golden and a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 20 to 24 minutes. Cool the muffins in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer the muffins to a rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35982,&quot;Cupcake Lollipops 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/8 teaspoon fine salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 large egg, at room temperature 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/3 cup whole milk, at room temperature 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted Pinch fine salt 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 to 2 tablespoons whole milk, at room temperature 5 drops bright yellow gel food coloring 4 to 5 drops leaf green gel food coloring 4 to 5 drops sky blue gel food coloring 2 to 3 drops violet gel food coloring 4 drops neon pink gel food coloring 24 spice drops or gumdrops Instructions: For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 12-cup mini muffin pans with paper liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a small bowl. Set aside. Beat the butter and granulated sugar together in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 4 minutes.<br> Beat in the egg, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to medium low; beat in half the flour mixture, then all of the milk, then the remaining flour mixture until just combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br> Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about three-quarters full. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cupcakes comes out clean, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time. Transfer the pans to a cooling rack and cool for 5 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the pans and let them cool completely on the rack.<br> For the buttercream: Combine the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and increase the speed to medium-high. Mix until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 2 minutes more. Add 1 tablespoon of milk and mix to combine. Add more milk a 1/2 tablespoon at a time until the buttercream is firm but spreadable.<br> Divide the buttercream evenly among 5 bowls, about a heaping 1/3 cup in each. Add the yellow gel food coloring to one bowl and mix until no streaks remain. Repeat with the remaining bowls of buttercream and the green, blue, violet and pink food colors. Scoop each color into a separate disposable piping bag with no tip; then snip off the tip of each bag so there is a hole about the size of a penny.<br> Prepare a sixth piping bag fitted with a medium-sized round piping tip; this will be your decorating bag.<br> Holding the decorating bag in one hand and the yellow buttercream bag in the other, pipe the yellow buttercream into the decorating bag making in a vertical stripe about 1 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining colors, working around the edge of the decorating bag to create stripes of each color and leaving at least 5 inches at the top so you can seal the bag. Be sure not to overfill the bag; you can repeat piping in the colored stripes if necessary.<br> Once the cupcakes are completely cool, attach them to the lollipop sticks by poking small holes just big enough to fit a lollipop sticks in the bottom of each cupcake with the tip of a paring knife, poking through the paper liners.<br> Slice 1/8 inch off the bottom (flat side) of each spice drop with a paring knife. Insert a lollipop stick through the domed top of a spice drops and slide it down so there is about 3/4 inch of the stick above the spice drop. This is where the cupcake will sit.<br> Next, poke the lollipop stick into the hole in the bottom of a cupcake and slide the bottom of the cupcake down so it rests on the flat, sticky side of the spice drop. The lollipop stick should not poke through the top of the cupcake; if the cupcake seems wobbly, slide the gumdrop down a bit further and press the cupcake onto the stick a bit more. Anchor the assembled lollipop cupcakes in a Styrofoam board or stick them in tall containers filled with sugar or sprinkles. Repeat with the remaining lollipop sticks, spice drops and cupcakes.<br> Holding a cupcake in one hand and the decorating bag in the other, starting in the center of the cupcake, pipe the frosting in a swirl over the top of the cupcake. Stick the frosted cupcake back into the Styrofoam to hold it upright. Repeat with the remaining cupcakes.<br> Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 days; remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 35983,&quot;Apple-Date Fritters with Lemon Curd Cream and Candied Ginger 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 3 tablespoons sugar 1 large egg 3/4 cup whole milk 2 medium green apples (Pippin or Granny Smith) 1/2 cup chopped pitted dates 3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice Canola or vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup jarred lemon curd 3/4 teaspoon superfine sugar 1 tablespoon minced candied ginger Instructions: Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger and sugar; set aside.

If using salmon fillets, slice about 8 to 10 sliced angles into flesh, to help flesh more completely soak in the glaze.<br> In a small bowl or cup, mix the salt, pepper, and dry mustard.<br> In a medium glass bowl, heat the honey in the microwave for 30 seconds to liquefy further. Remove from the microwave and mix in balsamic vinegar.<br> Brush the top of the salmon fillets (not the skin side) with the melted butter. Season the flesh side with the spice mixture. Brush with the honey-balsamic mixture, reserving some for later.<br> Put the soaked planks under the hot broiler, about 5 inches from the heat source, until the wood is browned on top, about 3 minutes. With tongs, carefully remove the planks from the oven.<br> Immediately brush the browned surface with olive oil, then lay the salmon fillets on the oiled surface, skin side down.<br> Put 2 cookie sheets in the oven below where the planks will go to catch any glazes or juices that run off. Return the planks to the broiler and cook the fish for 10 minutes. Baste with honey-balsamic and place in oven.

Toss the onions from time to time. After 30 minutes, take out the garlic, chop it roughly, and add it back to the onions. Meanwhile, for the dough, combine the water, yeast, honey, and olive oil in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. (If the bowl is cold, start with warmer water so it&#39;s at least 100 degrees F when you add the yeast.) Add 3 cups of the flour, then the salt, and mix on medium-low speed. While mixing, add 1 more cup of flour, or just enough to make a soft dough. Mix the dough on medium-low speed for about 10 minutes, until smooth, sprinkling it with flour to keep it from sticking to the bowl. When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured board and knead it by hand a dozen times. It should be smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl and turn it to cover lightly with oil. Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel. Allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts, rolling each 1 into a smooth ball. If you&#39;re only making 1 pissaladiere, place 1 ball on a baking sheet and cover it loosely with a damp towel. Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes. (If you&#39;re not using the other dough, wrap it well and refrigerate or freeze it for the next time.) Roll the dough lightly with a rolling pin, then stretch it to a 10 by 15-inch rectangle and place it on a baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Spoon the onion topping onto the dough, leaving a 3/4-inch border all around. Artfully arrange the anchovies and olives on top, brush the edge of the dough with olive oil, and bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust is crisp. Serve hot on a cutting board. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 35995,&quot;Edamame with Kosher Salt 10 oz. bag frozen in the pod edamame kosher salt to taste Instructions: Place edamame in a microwaveable bowl and add 1 tablespoon water.

Cool and set aside. (This can be done up to day ahead). Mix the soy sauce, fish sauce, sambal oelek and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl and set near the stove. Place all the remaining ingredients by the stove as well. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a wok or large deep skillet over high heat. Add the eggs and cook, swirling the pan but not stirring the eggs, so the eggs spread out to make a flat, set omelet, about 2 minutes. Remove the omelet from the wok to the work surface, cool, and slice into strips. Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the pan and, when hot, add the shrimp and cook, stirring, until just pink, about 3 minutes. Remove from the wok and chop coarsely. Wipe out any accumulated juices in the wok. Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the shallots, garlic, brown sugar and coriander and cook until the shallots are soft, about 2 minutes. Add the rice along with the soy sauce mixture and stir to coat and combine. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue stir-frying until the rice is heated through and lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Stir in the shrimp and egg strips and cook until just heated through. Transfer to a platter and top with the drained scallions and carrots. Serve with more sambal oelek and hoisin, as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 36065,&quot;Traditional Pesto 2 cups fresh basil leaves 1/2 cup olive oil 1/2 cup grated parmesan or romano 1/2 cup grated grana Padano 4 garlic cloves, chopped 1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Using a pestle and mortar or a food processor, crush the basil.

Stir in the warm water and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil while the machine is on low speed, mixing until the flour is completely moistened. Let stand 5 minutes. Add the salt and knead on medium speed for 5 minutes. (The dough will tighten up, then begin to relax. After 5 minutes, it will be very wet and stick to the bottom of the mixer but not the sides.)<br> Rub 2 tablespoons olive oil around the bottom and sides of a large mixing bowl (large enough to hold at least double the volume of dough). Transfer the dough to the bowl with a scraper or spatula, flipping once to coat completely with oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand until doubled in size, about 2 hours.<br> Pour the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil into the bottom of an 18-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Use your hands to evenly distribute the oil along the bottom and up the sides. Scrape the dough into the baking sheet, flattening it slightly with your hands. Flip the dough once and gently stretch it to fit into an even layer in the baking sheet. (The dough may not stretch to the edges at this point. If it starts to pull back, let rest 10 minutes and re-stretch, making sure to pull from the center as well as the edges to get an even thickness.) Use your fingertips to make dimples over the surface of the focaccia, pressing firmly but not so hard you make holes in the dough.<br> For the brine and toppings: Dissolve the kosher salt in 1/3 cup warm water. Drizzle over the surface of the focaccia, letting it pool in the dimples.<br> Starting in the upper right corner, gently press the largest mushroom pieces into the dough and continue down and to the left, working from the largest pieces to the smallest in a curling, tapering wave shape. Fill in the spaces between the mushrooms with the arugula, radicchio, carrot slices, fennel, fennel fronds and rosemary sprigs. Let stand in a warm place for 45 minutes so the dough can relax and rise again.<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.<br> Sprinkle the focaccia all over with flaky sea salt and sprinkle the vegetables with a couple pinches of red pepper flakes if using. Bake, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until the focaccia is deep golden brown on the top and bottom, 30 to 35 minutes. Drizzle with the olive oil and let rest for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to remove the focaccia to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 36073,&quot;Roasted Chicken with Lemon Butter 6 tablespoons butter, at room temperature 2 lemons, zested and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper One 4 to 5-pound chicken (organic and free range, if possible) Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1/2 fennel, bulb sliced and fronds cut into 2-inch lengths 1/2 fennel, bulb sliced and fronds cut into 2-inch lengths<br> 1 onion, sliced 4 cloves garlic 3 sprigs fresh thyme 2 to 3 sprigs fresh oregano 3/4 cup dry white wine Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a large skillet or roasting pan in the oven to preheat while you prepare the chicken.<br> Begin by preparing a lemon butter. Place 4 tablespoons of the butter in a mixing bowl and add about 1 teaspoon of zest from the lemons. Season with salt and pepper and mix well.<br> Flatten the chicken by cutting out the backbone and flattening the breast by firmly pressing with the heel of your hand. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. Using your fingers, loosely separate the skin from the breast and thighs. Smear the lemon butter evenly in the cavity between the skin and meat, ensuring it is worked evenly over the bird. With the skin side facing up, drizzle olive oil over the chicken.<br> Remove the preheated pan from the oven and place the chicken in the pan, skin-side down.<br> Place the lemon slices over the bird along with fennel, onions, garlic, thyme and oregano. As it cooks, this will flavor the bird.<br> Place in the oven and roast for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, flip the chicken to skin-side up and add half the wine to the pan. Return to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the joint between the leg and thigh registers 165 degrees F, approximately 30 minutes longer. When the chicken is done, remove from the pan to a serving platter and allow to rest for 15 minutes before carving and plating.<br> Meanwhile, make a pan sauce. Place the chicken pan over medium-high heat and add the remaining butter and wine. Stir until the butter is melted and the sauce thickens slightly. Pour the pan sauce over the platter of chicken.

Arrange two racks evenly spaced in the oven. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and spread the sugar so it\\u2019s a perfectly even thickness on the paper right to the edge of the sugar, leaving a border on the paper so the sugar doesn\\u2019t spill onto the pan. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the edges start to brown lightly. Watch carefully! Lower the oven to 250 degrees F. Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Just before the sugar is ready, whisk the egg whites on high speed for one minute, until frothy. With the mixer on low, slowly add the hot sugar to the egg whites. (I use a large spoon at first, then pick up the paper and pour the sugar in slowly.) Add the vanilla and continue to whisk on high for 10 minutes, until the egg whites are room temperature. (The bowl may still be warm.) The meringue will be very thick and glossy. Using two large serving spoons, scoop 6 very large, messy oval dollops of meringue onto each of two sheet pans lined with parchment paper, spacing them out because they will expand while they bake. Sprinkle the pistachios on top and bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (make sure your oven isn\\u2019t above 250 degrees!), until the outsides of the meringues are crisp but not browned and the centers are still soft.

In a heavy bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat 1 cup peanut oil over moderately-high heat until hot but not smoking. Slowly whisk in the flour until fully incorporated, making a roux. Cover the pot, place in the oven and cook for 2 hours, whisking every 15 minutes. In a large stockpot, add the whole chicken, chicken wings, 3 chopped onions and a handful of black peppercorns. Add enough water to cover the chicken by 4 inches and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and let simmer until the whole chicken is cooked, about 2 hours. Pull the whole chicken out, leaving the wings in to simmer for another hour. When the whole chicken is cool enough to handle, pull the meat and set aside. Strain the stock, discarding all solids, including the wings. You should have between 6 and 8 cups stock. In a large pot, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderately-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until golden brown, about 6 minutes, turning once. Remove the sausage and turn the heat down to moderate. Add the remaining 2 chopped onions and cook until softened, about 8 minutes. Whisk in the roux, slowly add the stock and simmer about 30 minutes. Add the reserved chicken and sausage and cook about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve over rice. What Makes This Recipe Really Sing: Ask any New Orleanian and they will tell you gumbo is all about the roux. I have given you the secret to a perfect yet easy version. Also, organic chicken is a must here. It has much more flavor then most mass produced brands found in grocery stores. BYOC: Okra is a traditional ingredient in gumbo, so if it is in season, chop into 1/3-inch pieces and add when you add the reserved chicken. Sometimes I add chopped kale just to make sure I am getting my veggies in. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Tempranillo]&quot; 36079,&quot;Chocolate and Orange Hazelnut Cookies 1 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread 2/3 cup cake flour<br> 1 tablespoon orange zest and 1 tablespoon orange juice (from 1 orange) 1 large egg<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup hazelnuts, roughly chopped<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.

If you&#39;re going to cook your kebabs on the grill, soak bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes, so they don&#39;t burn. Grab your food processor. You can chop all this by hand too; just make sure to chop it all up very finely. Throw the ginger, garlic, shallots, lemon zest, mint, cilantro and salt into the processor. Grind until very finely chopped. Throw the lamb into a big bowl. Add the shallot mixture, 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses, baking soda, garam masala if using and pepper to the meat. Using your hands, knead 2 to 5 minutes until the meat lightens in color, taking on the appearance of knitted fabric. It will also be very sticky. Perfect! Divide the meat in half, then in half again and then half again, until you have 8 mounds. Have a platter ready for your completed kebabs. Drizzle a little oil on the platter so the kebabs don&#39;t stick. Have your bamboo skewers standing by. Take one ball of meat and roll it into a short stump. Thread the skewer through it, and then begin shaping the kebab with quick strokes, pulling the meat down. It should be a little over 1/4-inch thick. Roll the kebab between your hands to seal the meat. Repeat. Preheat a griddle over medium heat, drizzling oil over it, so that when it starts to smoke, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s ready. Meanwhile, mix the juice of half the lemon with the remaining 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses in a small bowl. When it&#39;s hot, place the skewers on the grill. Cook about 2 minutes, then turn a quarter of the way. Brush with the lemon-molasses glaze and cook another 2 minutes. Continue in this way until you&#39;ve cooked the meat 8 to 10 minutes. For the raita: Mix the yogurt, mint, cucumber and garlic together. Season with salt and pepper, and serve alongside the kebabs. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 36089,&quot;Chocolate Truffle Pots de Creme 2 1/4 cups half-and-half 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 5 egg yolks 1 tablespoon cognac or flavored liqueur, such as Frangelico or Grand Marnier 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Two 4-ounce bars semisweet chocolate, chopped Whipped cream, cocoa powder, chopped toasted walnuts, chocolate curls, toasted coconut for garnish Instructions:</p><ol><li>Arrange eight 4-ounce ramekins or small coffee cups on a baking sheet.

Generously grease 2 baking sheets with butter (about 2 tablespoons) and dust with flour; tap off the excess flour. Measure out the flour and put in a fine-mesh strainer set in a bowl. Beat the egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until thick and pale, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the vanilla and beat until just combined. Transfer the egg yolk mixture to a large bowl. Clean out the mixer and dry. Put the egg whites and salt in the mixer; beat with the whisk attachment on medium speed, adding the remaining 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoonful at a time, until combined, about 3 minutes. Increase the speed to medium high and continue beating until the egg whites are shiny and stiff, 4 to 6 minutes. Add one-third of the egg white mixture to the yolk mixture, then sift about one-third of the flour over the eggs. Gently fold the ingredients together with a rubber spatula. Repeat 2 more times, folding in one-third each of the egg white mixture and flour each time. (Do not overmix or the batter will deflate.) Put the confectioners&#39; sugar in the mesh strainer. Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch round tip. Pipe 3-inch ladyfingers onto the prepared baking sheets, about 11/2 inches apart. Dust the ladyfingers with some of the confectioners&#39; sugar to coat and set aside until the sugar starts to dissolve, about 5 minutes. Dust with another coating of confectioners&#39; sugar.

Set up a grill for indirect cooking over medium heat (leave one side with no heat source). Drain the wood chips. If using a gas grill, put the chips in a smoker box and place over the heat source; if using a charcoal grill, place the wet chips directly on top of the coals. Make the rub: Combine 1/4 cup salt, 2 tablespoons pepper, the garlic powder, oregano, celery seeds, paprika, chili powder and ancho cl powder in a bowl. Set aside about one-third of the mixture for sprinkling on the ribs when finished. Make the ribs: Combine the vinegar, lemon juice and 1/4 cup water in a spritzer bottle. This will be used for basting, which will keep the ribs moist and tender and help the rub stick. Rub the ribs all over with the remaining dry rub, then put them on the cooler side of the grill (not over direct heat; you want the ribs to cook low and slow). Cover and cook 2 hours and 30 minutes, spraying the ribs with the vinegar mixture two or three times throughout the cooking. When the ribs are just about done, give them a final spray and sprinkle liberally with the reserved dry rub so the finished ribs are coated with all that delicious flavor. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 36104,&quot;Kebabs with Pork Three Ways Vegetable oil, for the grill 1 1/2 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 pound andouille sausage, sliced 1/2 inch thick 4 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces 3 dill pickles, sliced 1/4 inch thick 2 large banana peppers, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces 2 large onions, quartered and cut into 1-inch pieces Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup whole-grain or Creole mustard 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium and brush the grates with vegetable oil.

Butter a 9-inch round cake pan and line with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, almond meal, salt, baking powder, baking soda, poppy seeds and lemon zest. In a small bowl, whisk the lemon juice and yogurt until very smooth. In a large bowl, whisk the granulated sugar and olive oil until combined, then whisk in the eggs, one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in the almond extract. Whisk in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the yogurt mixture in two batches, whisking well after each addition.<br> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, make the glaze: Combine the cranberries and water in a small saucepan over low heat and cook, smashing the cranberries with a rubber spatula as needed, until they start to break down and release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, pressing on the solids with the rubber spatula and scraping off the bottom of the sieve. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and salt and mix until the glaze is smooth and spreadable. (It will seem like a lot of sugar at first but it will eventually incorporate.) If the glaze is too thick, add a couple drops of water. If it&#39;s too thin, add a pinch of confectioners&#39; sugar.<br> Spread the glaze over the top of the cake, allowing some to drip down the sides. Decorate as desired.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 36112,&quot;Miss Brown&#39;s Pineapple Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 1/4 teaspoon allspice<br> 1 cup vegetable oil<br> 1 cup crushed canned pineapple 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3 large eggs<br> 3 cups grated carrots (preferably grated by hand) 1 cup golden raisins<br> 3/4 cup chopped or whole walnuts<br> 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 12 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 5 cups confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 cup walnuts<br> Instructions: For the carrot cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheets and line each baking sheet with parchment paper (see Cook&#39;s Note). Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ginger and allspice in a large bowl. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the oil, pineapple, brown sugar, granulated sugar and vanilla. Beat in the eggs one at a time until well combined. Mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until the batter is smooth. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the grated carrots for garnish and fold in the remaining carrots, raisins and walnuts into the cake batter. Divide the batter between the prepared baking sheets. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes, then transfer to cooling racks, taking the parchment off the base of each cake as you go. Allow the cakes cool completely before frosting. For the cream cheese frosting: While the cake is baking, chill the bowl and paddle attachment for your stand mixer. Once the cake is cooled, beat together the cream cheese and butter until very smooth in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the vanilla, then slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar, about 1 cup at a time. The consistency should be fairly thick yet easy to spread. If it becomes too loose, add more powdered sugar (a little at a time). Transfer the frosting into a piping bag or a resealable plastic bag. Pipe the frosting evenly over the top of one of the cake layers. Top with the other cake layer. (If you have the time, pop the cake into the freezer here for a few minutes to make it easier to cut). Carefully cut the layered cake into 2-inch squares, so that you have individual, square, naked cakes. Pipe a little more frosting on top and decorate with the reserved grated carrots and walnuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 36113,&quot;Sun-Dried Tomato, Black Olive and Mozzarella Orzo Gratin 1/2 pound orzo 1 cup minced onion 1/2 cup diced fennel 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 16-ounce can plum tomatoes, drained and chopped 1 cup light cream combined with 1 tablespoon flour 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled 2/3 cup sliced sun-dried tomatoes 1/3 cup sliced pitted oil-cured olives 1/2 pound fresh Mozzarella, diced 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Add the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt and lemon zest to a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until it&#39;s mostly pea-sized; a few larger chunks are okay. Dump the mixture into a large bowl and gently toss in the blueberries. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, yogurt, vanilla and almond extract. Pour into the dry ingredients and, using a rubber spatula, mix until about 80 percent of the dry mixture is incorporated. Dollop teaspoon-sized plops of cream cheese all over the mixture, then gently fold the mixture just until the remaining dry ingredients are incorporated. (You want the cream cheese to generally stay intact but it will of course swirl a little.) Using an ice cream scoop or large spoon, divide the dough into 8 balls and place them on the lined baking sheets about 2 inches apart (they will spread quite a bit). Bake until the tops are lightly browned and the bottoms are golden, 16 to 20 minutes.<br> For the glaze: Meanwhile, whisk together the powdered sugar, yogurt and salt in a bowl.

Put 3 tablespoons of the butter in a small skillet and let it melt over medium heat. Add the shallots, garlic, and caraway; season with salt and pepper. Saute until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Put the ground beef and pork in a large bowl. Add the sweated shallot mixture, egg, parsley, and dill; season with salt and pepper. Squeeze the milk out of the soaked bread crumbs, add the bread to the meat mixture, and mix well using your hands. Pinch off about 1/2 cup worth of the meat mixture and roll it around in your moistened hands to shape it into a cue ball-sized meatball. Continue forming the meatballs and putting them on a platter; there should be about 20 meatballs. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over moderate heat. When the foam starts to subside, add the meatballs in batches so you don&#39;t overcrowd the pan. Saute the meatballs until well-browned on all sides, about 7 minutes total. Remove the meatballs to a platter lined with paper towels as they are done. Discard most of the fat from the skillet and return it to the heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and swirl it around to coat the pan. Sprinkle in the flour, and stir with a wooden spoon to dissolve into the fat. Pour in the chicken broth, and stir with a wooden spoon to loosen the bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer and stir until the liquid is reduced and a sauce starts to form; season with salt and pepper. Lower the heat and stir in the sour cream. Return the meatballs to the sauce and stir in 1/4 cup of the lingonberry jam until combined. Simmer until the sauce thickens slightly and the meatballs are heated through, about 15 to 20 minutes. Shower with chopped parsley and transfer to a serving bowl. Serve the Swedish meatballs with additional lingonberry jam on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 36124,&quot;Tarragon Chicken 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 chicken (about 3 pounds/1.4 kg), cut into 8 pieces Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup/125 ml chicken stock 3/4 cup/175 ml dry white wine 1 shallot, minced 1 cup/250 ml creme fraiche 1/2 cup chopped fresh tarragon Lemon juice Instructions: Melt the butter with the oil in a large skillet over quite high heat. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and fry in batches until well browned, about 5 minutes per side.<br> Put all the chicken back in the pan, add the chicken stock and reduce the heat to medium. Cover and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and keep warm. Reduce any leftover juices until sticky.

Cut the lid off the pumpkin and scoop out the seeds and fibers. Scrape away some of the flesh, especially around the top, to form a large, smooth inner cavity. Make sure to leave the shell at least 1-inch thick all around. Oil the pumpkin inside and out and season inside with salt and pepper. Replace the lid. Place on a baking sheet and bake until about 2/3&#39;s cooked but still firm enough to stand and act as the soup container, about 40 minutes. Do not over-bake. If a good deal of liquid gathers in the bottom, spoon out and discard. Set aside; it will stay warm on its own a good while. Bring the stock to a low simmer in a saucepan. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the onion and cook until soft but not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the thyme, stir, and add 2 cups of the stock. Bring to a boil. Add the pastina, stir well, and reduce the heat to maintain a slow simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer, adding the stock 1/2 cup at a time as the previous addition is absorbed and stirring occasionally to prevent the pastina from sticking to the bottom of the pan, until the pasta is al dente, about 15 minutes. Add the roasted squash and turkey to reheat. Stir well. The consistency should be quite loose, like a thick soup. Add more stock, if necessary. Add the 1/2 cup cheese and let melt for a moment before stirring in. Taste, for seasoning. Ladle the pastina into the reserved pumpkin shell and garnish with the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Replace the lid and take to the table immediately. Variation with Greens: For a colorful and nutritious addition, cut several handfuls of winter greens such as spinach or chard into a chiffonade and stir into the pastina just to wilt before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 36126,&quot;Pellet Grill Cajun Dry-Brined Chicken One 4- to 5-pound chicken, giblets removed 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 2 teaspoons granulated garlic 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon dried thyme 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions 2 tablespoons minced cornichons 2 tablespoons Creole or whole-grain mustard 2 tablespoons ketchup 1 tablespoon capers, minced 1 clove garlic, grated Several dashes hot sauce 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Soft dinner rolls, for serving Instructions: The day before cooking the chicken, pat it dry with paper towels and put on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Stir together the smoked paprika, granulated garlic, onion powder, sugar, oregano, thyme, cayenne pepper, 2 tablespoons salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl. Rub a generous amount in the cavity of the chicken then sprinkle the remaining Cajun seasoning all over the outside of the bird to create a thick coating on the skin. Refrigerate, uncovered, at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Combine the mayonnaise, parsley, scallions, cornichons, mustard, ketchup, capers, garlic and hot sauce in a medium bowl. Stir to combine then season with salt and black pepper. Refrigerate the remoulade, covered, until ready to serve. Let the chicken rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before grilling.

Set aside for 10 minutes, allowing the yeast to dissolve and fully activate. It should bubble around the edges and almost double in size. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, oil, orange zest and juice and remaining 1/4 cup sugar and set aside. Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and orange juice mixture and beat until the dough forms a ball, 2 to 3 minutes. Switch out the paddle for the dough hook and knead the dough until fairly smooth, 4 to 5 minutes. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time. Lightly coat a large bowl with vegetable oil and add the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise until it doubles in size, about 1 hour at room temperature. Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. For the filling: On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a large rectangle about 1/4 inch thick and slightly bigger than the baking dish. Spread the butter over the dough, leaving a 1/4-inch border on all sides. Sprinkle the dough with the brown sugar, then the cinnamon. Starting with one longer edge, roll the dough into a cylinder and pinch the ends together to seal completely. Cut into 12 rolls and place in the prepared baking dish. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and allow the rolls to rise until they double in size, about 30 minutes at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap from the rolls and bake, uncovered, until light brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Squeeze the excess milk from the bread and transfer to a large bowl. Add the pork, beef, parmesan, eggs, parsley, cognac, oregano, garlic, nutmeg, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; mix with your hands until combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and fill a large bowl with ice water. Carefully separate the cabbage leaves (you will need 12 large leaves, or you can use 2 small leaves to make a large one). Working in batches, blanch the leaves until pliable, about 45 seconds, then remove with tongs and transfer to the ice water. Remove from the ice water, shake dry, then layer between paper towels to soak up the excess moisture. Trim the tough center stem from the bottom of each leaf. Shape the meat mixture into twelve 4-inch-long sausages. Lay out a cabbage leaf, then put a sausage on top lengthwise. Fold in the short ends of the leaf, then tightly roll up the leaf like a burrito. Repeat with the remaining cabbage leaves and sausages. Transfer the rolls to a plate and refrigerate until ready to cook. Fit a large, wide pot with a steamer insert and fill with 2 inches of water; bring the water to a boil. Arrange the cabbage rolls in the steamer insert, cover and reduce the heat to medium low; steam until the filling is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft, about 6 minutes. Add the cognac and simmer until almost evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, 1 1/2 cups water, the oregano and 3/4 teaspoon salt; bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a blender and puree until mostly smooth, then return to the pot; thin with up to 1/2 cup hot water, if desired. Season with salt. Bring just to a simmer and stir in a splash of cognac. Serve the cabbage rolls topped with the sauce, parmesan and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 36158,&quot;Mutha Heffer Sandwich (Meatloaf Sandwich) 10 pounds high-gluten flour, plus more for dusting 3 1/2 ounces salt<br> 2 ounces yeast<br> 10 cups water 1 1/4 cups heavy cream<br> 1 cup honey<br> 6 pounds ground chuck and brisket 6 pounds ground pork<br> 3 pounds ground veal<br> 8 cups ketchup<br> 6 cups breadcrumbs<br> 2 cups brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup Italian seasoning blend<br> 1/2 cup seasoned salt (kosher salt, cracked black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder)<br> 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce<br> 3 green bell peppers, chopped 3 red bell peppers, chopped 2 jumbo yellow onions, chopped 15 eggs, beaten 3 cups ketchup 2 cups brown sugar<br> 1 cup Worcestershire sauce<br> 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise 1/4 cup Dijon mustard<br> 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning<br> 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic<br> 4 pints heirloom tomatoes, chopped 3 packs tomato medley, chopped 1 white onion, chopped<br> 4 cups sugar<br> 1 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 2 rosemary sprigs, leaves stripped<br> Salt and ground black pepper<br> Vegetable oil, for frying Buttermilk, as needed Hot sauce, such as Texas Pete<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon garlic powder<br> 2 teaspoons onion powder<br> Salt and ground black pepper<br> 1 sweet onion, cut into thin rings 2 slices Texas toast (double-thickness sliced bread) One 1/2-inch-thick slice meatloaf (about 6 ounces)<br> 2 ounces SNS sauce<br> 3 slices candied bacon 1/4 cup fried onion straws 2 tablespoons heirloom tomato jam 1/2 cup baby arugula Instructions: For the white bread: Mix the flour, salt, yeast, water, heavy cream and honey in a large stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for 15 minutes.

Turn off the heat immediately, cover, and allow mixture to come to room temperature. Cool mixture in the fridge until you&#39;re ready. To brine the turkey, remove the turkey from wrapper, remove interior bags (set aside; refrigerate), and rinse turkey thoroughly under cool water. Place the turkey into a plastic brining bag or a very large pot. Pour the cooled brine mixture over the top, adding extra cold water if you need more to completely cover the turkey. Seal the bag or cover the pot and allow the turkey to brine in the refrigerator for 16 to 24 hours before roasting. Before roasting, remove the turkey from brine and rinse thoroughly under cold water. Then soak in a sink full of fresh water for 15 to 20 minutes. Pat dry. Discard brine. (This soaking process will decrease the likelihood of too-salty gravy). Preheat the oven 275 degrees F. Truss the bird and place it breast side up on a rack in a large roasting pan. Cover the turkey tightly with heavy-duty foil. Make sure it&#39;s entirely covered (cover over the bottom edges of the pan). Place in the oven and roast for about 10 minutes per pound (a 20 pound turkey will roast for about 3 1/2 hours). Remove the turkey from the oven and increase the temperature to 375 degrees F. Remove the aluminum foil and set aside. Mix the softened butter with the rosemary and orange zest and rub all over the skin of the turkey, covering every single inch of the skin. Insert a meat thermometer into the thigh, near the hip joint. Place the turkey, uncovered, back into the oven. Continue roasting the turkey, basting with butter every 30 minutes, until the thermometer registers 170 degrees F and until the juices are no longer pink. Remove from the oven and cover with foil until you are ready to carve and serve.

Drain and rinse, then put in a pot with the onion and bay leaf. Cover the beans, just with water. Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until very tender, about 45 minutes. Drain the beans, discarding the onion and bay leaf. Heat the oil in a saute pan, and gently fry the garlic, 30 seconds. Add the chickpeas, salt, and pepper, to taste, to heat through. Crush a bit, here and there, with a potato masher, leaving some chickpeas whole. Remove from the heat, and stir in the olives, parsley, and lemon zest. Add lemon juice, to taste. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, and serve as a base for the fish or chicken. For the carrots: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice the carrots lengthwise, leaving a bit of green top attached, for looks. Toss on a baking sheet with the olive oil, crushed cumin seed, and salt and pepper, to taste. Roast until tender and golden-edged, about 30 minutes, depending on their size. They should be slightly crinkly and golden-edged. For the halibut: Melt the butter in a saucepan, and cook until lightly brown and foaming. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, and set aside. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Season the fish with salt, and pepper on both sides, place the fish in the hot pan, and fry 4 minutes. Flip, and cover to finish, 4 to 6 minutes. Serve the fish with some brown butter dribbled over.

Make the pies: In a medium heatproof bowl, combine the unsweetened chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate and butter. Fill a pot (relatively the same size as the bowl) about 1/3 full with water and place it over medium heat. When the water simmers, place the bowl of chocolate and butter over the simmering water and lower the heat. You want to melt the chocolate and butter gently together, stirring and scraping the sides (to avoid scorching). In another bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon and lemon zest. Set aside. Separately, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. When the chocolate and butter is melted, remove the bowl from the heat; stir to assure it&#39;s completely mixed and transfer to another medium bowl. This will accelerate cooling. Allow the chocolate to cool a few minutes. Whisk in the egg mixture. Whisk in the flour mixture. Only whisk until blended, over-mixing can affect the texture of the pies. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray (alternatively, use a piece of fitted parchment sprayed with nonstick spray). Drop the batter in large spoonfuls (keeping the shapes as round as possible) on the baking sheet. You are aiming for rounds that are about 2 inches in diameter. Take care to leave some room (about 2 inches) between each one to allow for spreading that will occur as they bake. Place the tray in the hot oven and bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Check the pies. Leave in the oven an additional minute or two if they seem under baked. The dough will lose some of its shiney-ness and no longer look wet but will still feel soft. Remove the tray from the oven and allow them to cool for about 5 to 10 minutes before gingerly lifting them off the baking sheet and onto a flat surface. Make the filling: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk to a simmer and add about 3/4 of the cup of the toasted almonds. Reserve the remaining almonds. Shut off the heat and allow the almonds to \\steep\\ in the milk, for 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the milk and pour it back into the same pan, discarding the almonds from the milk. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat together the sugar, flour, cornstarch and egg yolks until thick and smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour some of the hot milk mixture over the eggs and whisk to blend. Pour the egg mixture back into the milk; turn on a low to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the almond extract. Continue to cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes, stirring to make sure it doesn&#39;t cling to the bottom of the pan and burn, until very thick. Pour the cream into a clean bowl. Stir in the remaining almonds. Cover tightly with a layer of plastic so the cream doesn&#39;t form a skin. Allow to cool. Assemble: \\Sandwich\\ some of the cream in between two of the chocolate rounds. Drizzle with melted chocolate, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 36189,&quot;Tuna alla Puttanesca 2 cans or pouches (5 oz) tuna, drained and flaked 1 pound dry farfalle or bowtie pasta 4 tablespoons olive oil 3 garlic cloves, minced 2 medium onions, cut in 1/4 inch slices 1 can (14 1/2 oz) diced tomatoes in juice 1 cup dry white wine 3 tablespoons capers, drained 1 tablespoon chopped rosemary 1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and cut in quarters 1 teaspoon ground black pepper salt to taste 2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley Instructions: Prepare pasta according to package directions.

Put the quinoa in a medium saucepan filled two-thirds full of water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until the grains are tender, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse the quinoa under cold water. Drain again, then return to the pot. Meanwhile, combine the coriander, cumin and 1 garlic clove, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a mortar and pestle coarsely crush to make a rough paste (alternatively use a small food processor). Rub the pork tenderloin all over with the spice mixture. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat until very hot. Add the pork tenderloin and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the pork until just cooked through, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the pork registers 150 degrees F, about 15 minutes.

Leave the mixture in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal fire. When you are ready to cook the pork, shape the mixture roughly into 6 ping-pong sized balls. Lightly oil a steamer tray and steam the pork balls for 5 minutes. Transfer the partially cooked pork balls to a hot grill fire. Cook for 10 minutes, turning occasionally so all sides of the balls get golden brown. Remove the pork balls from the fire, cut them in half, and return them to the fire, cut side down. Grill them for 5 more minutes. Remove the pork and when it is cool enough to handle, cut it in shreds roughly 1 1/2 inches thick. Reserve. Bring a few quarts of salted water to the boil. Plunge the shrimp into the boiling water and turn the heat off. Remove the shrimp form the water when just cooked (2 to 3 minutes). In a bowl, mix together the remaining 2 tablespoons of fish sauce and the remaining tablespoon of sugar. When the shrimp are cool enough to handle, peel them and slice them in half the long way (cutting each shrimp into 2 thin, C-shaped pieces). Reserve the shrimp and fish sauce sugar mixture. Submerge 1 sheet of banh trang in a basin of warm water for 2 to 3 seconds, then remove it immediately. Try to dip all of it into the water simultaneously and handle it carefully so it doesn&#39;t tear. Place the sheet on a dry towel. Roll the sheet right on the towel: About 1-inch above the lower edge of the sheet, spread out 1/8 cup of shredded lettuce. Leave a 1 1/2-inch gap between the left edge of the sheet and the lettuce and the same between the right edge of the sheet and the lettuce. Define a rectangle with the lettuce that is about 5 inches wide and 3 inches long toward the center of the sheet. Now evenly top the lettuce rectangle with 1/8 of the bean sprouts, 1/8 of the shredded carrot and 1/8 of the peanuts. Evenly distribute 1/8 of the grilled pork shreds over the rectangle. Tear 5 to 6 mint leaves, and an equal amount of cilantro and distribute those over the rectangle. Top everything with a few sprinkles of nuoc mam. Carefully pick up the right edge of the sheet and fold it toward the center of the filling. Make sure the folded sheet is even and uncreased. Do the same with the left edge of the sheet. The rectangle of filling should now be covered by the folded sheet with the left and right edges meeting each other at the center of the rectangle. Pick up the bottom edge of the sheet and start rolling away from you, making sure to tuck the filling in tightly as you roll. When you have rolled about halfway to the top of the sheet, dip the shrimp halves in the reserved fish sauce-sugar mixture. Place 2 shrimp halves along the cylinder that you have half-rolled and keep on rolling until a fully rolled cylinder has been formed. Place it under a damp towel.

Peel off lower leaves (approximately 18.) Slice off the top half so that only the light green remains (artichokes should be approximately 1 1/4 inches), then cut the artichoke in half lengthwise. Place the artichokes in a medium pot, flat side down, and add olive oil to just cover. Add the garlic, thyme, salt and pepper. Bring the olive oil to a boil, cover the pot and reduce the heat to a low flame and simmer for 15 minutes. Insert a knife into the lower half and if easily penetrated, it&#39;s done. Remove the thyme and garlic from the pot, raise the heat and fry uncovered for approximately 2 minutes, turning over the artichokes midway. They are done when brown and crispy. Remove the artichokes from the pot and place them on paper towels flat side down. Sprinkle with salt and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 36210,&quot;Red Pepper Pancakes with Smoked Salmon, Caviar and Chive Cream Sauce 3 red bell peppers 3 ounces butter, plus additional for greasing<br> 3 eggs, separated<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 4 slices smoked salmon<br> 3 ounces creme fraiche<br> 2 ounces American caviar<br> 3 tablespoons minced fresh chives<br> Instructions: Char the peppers over a flame; place in a bowl and cover to steam until cooled.

Add the apples in an even layer, then the vanilla bean, lemon zest, lemon juice, and sugar. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are completely soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the cover, increase the heat if necessary for the apples to be bubbling vigorously, and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until any liquid has evaporated and the thickened apple mixture moves around as a mass when you stir it, about 15 minutes. It may caramelize in spots, but watch it so it doesn&#39;t get too dark. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place a round of buttered parchment paper in the bottom of a 1-quart charlotte mold or ovenproof bowl with a flat bottom. Prepare the crust: Cut about 4 slices of the bread in half to form triangles, and then cut those triangles in half. Brush 1 side of each triangle lightly with butter, and arrange them in the base of the prepared mold, buttered-side down, so they completely cover the bottom. If there are any spaces, fill them in with pieces of bread that are cut to fit. Cut the remaining bread slices into 14 to 16 (1-inch) wide strips, and trim them so they are just long enough to reach the top of the mold. Lightly brush each with clarified butter, and arrange them, buttered-side out, upright along the sides of the mold to completely line it, overlapping them slightly. Set aside the extra bread strips. Remove the vanilla bean from the apples and discard it. Spoon the apple mixture into the mold. The apples may mound above the edge of the mold; they will sink during cooking. Completely cover the apple filling with any remaining pieces of bread, cut to fit, buttered-side out. Place the charlotte mold on a baking sheet, and bake it on the center rack of the oven for 15 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F, and continue baking until the bread on the top and sides is deep golden, about 35 minutes. If the top is getting too dark, cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Transfer the charlotte mold to a wire rack and let it cool for 15 minutes. Then, place a serving plate over the top of the mold and carefully flip it over. The charlotte will slide right out. Because of its pudding-like consistency, use 2 large spoons to cut the charlotte. Serve it warm or at room temperature, with the custard sauce alongside. Combine the milk and the vanilla bean, if using, in a medium-sized heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Scald the milk by heating it just until little bubbles form around the edge of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and the sugar together in a medium bowl until pale yellow and thick. Strain the hot milk into a bowl, and discard the vanilla bean. Whisk the milk into the egg yolk mixture, add the vanilla extract, if using, and return it to the saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until the custard has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to let the custard curdle. Immediately transfer the custard to a bowl, to stop the cooking of the custard. Let it cool to room temperature, and then serve or cover and refrigerate. The custard will thicken in the refrigerator, and it will keep for 1 day.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk the heavy cream, sour cream and vanilla in a small bowl; refrigerate until ready to use. Pulse the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter; pulse until the mixture looks like fine meal. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the chocolate chips and 1 cup shredded coconut. Gently fold in the heavy cream mixture using a rubber spatula until just combined. Divide the dough into 6 pieces on the prepared baking sheet; pat into 3-inch rounds (about 1 inch high). Brush the rounds with heavy cream and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup shredded coconut. Bake until lightly browned and slightly firm to the touch, about 30 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet. Meanwhile, make the toppings: Toss the strawberries, 1/4 cup brown sugar and the vanilla in a medium bowl; set aside. Just before serving, beat the heavy cream, sour cream and the remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.
