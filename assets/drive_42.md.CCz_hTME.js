Sweet but balanced dark fruit and cola aromas are nice, while the palate is forward and tastes of blackberry and cola. Complex and slightly gritty and tannic on the finish, which indicates that it has the structure to age. Drink now through 2013.","designation":"12 Meses"},{"country":"cl","description":"This unoaked Chardonnay starts with aromas of citrus and stalky greens.

The tannins emerge at the end of the sip, and will continue to smooth out beyond 2020.","designation":"Domaine du Docteur Rodgers"},{"country":"cl","description":"This is a perfectly good and honest wine, with aromas of fresh lettuce yet not a whole lot of vivid fruit.

The touch of green apple makes it even more alluring. The palate jumbles all of these fresh, lithe, bright and appetizing flavors together and swirls them across the palate on a joyous, light-footed lemon sweep. Oh for the pleasure of Riesling in a vintage that majors on freshness rather than ripeness. This dances on the tongue with its dryness, purity and aromatic ease.

The palate is lively with black raspberry before the chalky, still quite stiff tannins arise, carrying flashes of cigar box, pencil shavings and bittersweet chocolate.","designation":"Martin Vineyards"},{"country":"us","description":"In this lively, delicately balanced wine from an exceptional vineyard, an exuberance of pear and tangerine plays on the palate, buoyed by focused minerality. With just the right touch of ripeness and richness, it ends with a suggestion of lemon custard.","designation":"Hyde Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Viognier, Roussanne and Gr√ºner Veltliner mix pleasantly in this newest edition of Syncline's popular Subduction white.

Mellow tannins come with echoes of clove and cinnamon. This friendly and soft red also works without food.","designation":"Gaissberg"},{"country":"us","description":"Dark red in color, though fraying, like an older wine, this lacks in aroma. Otherwise it's a straightforward expression of blackberry, tar and leather.","designation":"Black Glass Estate Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"This Barolo has typical varietal aromas of rose and a hint of leather, but shows the heat of the 2007 vintage in its overripe black fruit and spice accompanied by a warm midpalate.

Black-cherry and plum flavors are plump and fleshy on the palate but layered in dark shadowy swathes of char, smoke, bramble and herb.

The fruit is extracted in pineapple jam, the oak is strong, the wine went through malolactic fermentation, which gives it buttered toast flavors, and the acidity feels unnatural given the ripeness.

Bitter almond skin flavors control the finish on this textured, warm wine.","designation":"Estate Bottled"},{"country":"za","description":"The 2007 vintage was generally a great one for Bordeaux-style reds in Stellenbosch, and the Els Signature definitely demonstrates it.

Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's easy to imagine the winemaker singling out the most tannic and concentrated lots, but what you get is, simply, a very tannic wine. There's a gigantic core of blackberry and black currant fruit, but it's hard to appreciate because of the astringency.

A blend of fruit from Atlas Peak and Rutherford, the wine is a barrel selection from the winery's regular 2010 output, and accounts for only about 20% of total production. The Cabernet Sauvignon is mixed with a little Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It's delicious in blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors, and well structured in acids and tannins. The wine should develop in the bottle for at least 10 years.","designation":"Family Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"The winery's philosophy is, if you're going to make a dessert wine, why not make it fabulously sweet instead of boringly off-dry? With 17.5% residual sugar, this indeed hits the limit of the sweetness scale.

There's a certain austerity that suggests the rocky soils of this mountain vineyard. But the fruit, packed into a dense core, is ripe and suggestive of blackberry and cherries.

It's eruptive with jammy, blackberries, cherries and black currants, with a delicious edge of dark chocolate. The new oak adds spicy, pungent notes of buttered toast and caramel.

This is an awkward, cumbersome wine. Sure, the fruit is as ripe as anything on earth, but what good is extract if it doesn't have balance? The wine is excessively soft.

Red berry flavors are lined with red apple acidity and a texture that shows a touch of minerality from the Grand Cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims.

Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish.

Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours.","designation":"Brandluft"},{"country":"us","description":"The high alcohol (15.5%) and pruney character suggests that this was picked late‚Äîa bit too late to retain any elegance.
