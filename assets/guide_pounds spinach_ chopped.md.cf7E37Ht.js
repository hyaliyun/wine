Place the whole peppers on a sheet pan and place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until the skins are completely wrinkled and the peppers are charred, turning them twice during roasting. Remove the pan from the oven and immediately cover it tightly with aluminum foil. Set aside for 30 minutes, or until the peppers are cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, combine the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside. Remove the stem from each pepper and cut them in quarters. Remove the peels and seeds and place the peppers in a bowl along with any juices that have collected. Discard the stems, peels, and seeds. Pour the oil and vinegar mixture over the peppers. Stir in the capers. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend. To assemble the sandwiches, spread the bottom half of the loaf with the goat cheese. Add a layer of peppers and then a layer of basil leaves. Separate the onions into rings and spread out on top. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Add the walnuts, sugar and egg whites to a nonstick pan or saucepan. Place over low heat and cook, mixing constantly with a spatula, until the sugar is dissolved, about 12 minutes. At this point, you should be able to divide the mixture in the pan using the spatula and it should take about 8 seconds for the mixture to come back together. Transfer the walnut mixture to a plate and start spreading it with the spatula, then fold it over on itself. Add the lemon juice and repeat the spreading and folding process a few more times until the mixture is at room temperature, about 5 minutes. Using 2 spoons or a piping bag, drop about a tablespoon of the mixture per cookie on the prepared baking sheets (leave 1 1/2 to 2 inches of space between each). Wet your index finger with water and smooth the tops. Bake until the edges are lightly browned and the cookies have puffed slightly, about 16 minutes. Let them cool on the baking sheets for 15 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. The cooled cookies can be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for about a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 36228,&quot;Ahi Palette Dancer 50 wonton wrappers 2 quarts oil, for frying 8 pounds Ahi Grade #1, cut 1-inch center logs 2 cups Caribbean seasoning 1 ounce chili flakes 1/4 cup spring mix 2 heads napa cabbage, shredded julienned style thin 6 ounces toasted white and black sesame seeds 2 bunches freshly chopped cilantro leaves 3 bunches green onion, chopped small 3 ounces wasabi tobiko caviar 1 package rice noodles, fried 3 small cans Mandarin oranges, drained 1 basket mushrooms, sliced thin 5 pounds candied walnuts 3 pounds toasted almonds Citrus soy sesame vinaigrette 6 mangoes, diced small 1/2 jalapeno, minced, use only 1/2 1 red onion, minced 1 bunch freshly chopped cilantro leaves 2 limes, juiced 1/2 ounce sweet chili sauce Teriyaki glaze, to taste (from recipe below) 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 2 tablespoons minced shallots 2 tablespoons minced garlic 5 stalks lemongrass, bruised 3-inches from bottom 2 quarts teriyaki sauce (recommended: Kikkoman&#39;s) 2 cups pineapple juice 2 cups orange juice 1 (1-pound) box light brown sugar Freshly ground white pepper Cornstarch slurry, as needed 2 cups Teriyaki Glaze (above)<br> 1 orange, zested 1/2 bunch fresh cilantro leaves 1/2 cup seasoned rice vinegar 1 ounce yuzu juice 1 teaspoon sesame oil Salt and freshly ground white pepper<br> Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 cup salad oil 2 ounces seasoned rice vinegar 3 ounces Yuzu juice 1/2 cup teriyaki glaze 1/4 cup yellow miso paste 1/2 cup mango puree 2 cups mayonnaise 3 ounces honey 1 teaspoon sesame oil Salt and freshly ground white pepper 2 cups mayonnaise 4 ounces wasabi paste 3 ounces sweetened condensed milk 1 ounce lime juice 1 ounce mirin wine 2 ounce honey<br> Salt and freshly ground white pepper Instructions: Wontons: Cut in triangle, and deep-fry in oil at 375 degrees F about 1 1/2 minutes each side until golden brown.

For the crumb crust: combine the nuts, flour, salt, sugar, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl, and stir to mix well. Stir in the melted butter and continue stirring until the mixture has absorbed the butter. Break the mixture into even 1/2 to 1/4 inch crumbs, rubbing with the fingertips. Place half the crumb mixture into a 9 inch Pyrex pie pan and press with the fingertips to line the pan evenly. Place the remaining crumb mixture, in an even 1/2 inch layer on a cookie sheet. Bake the crust and crumbs on the middle rack of the oven about 20 minutes, until crisp and light golden in color. Cool the crust and crumbs on racks. For the Mousse Filling: Whip the cream until it holds soft peaks and set it aside in the refrigerator. Sprinkle the gelatin on the water in a small, heatproof bowl. Allow to soak 5 minutes, then place over a small pan of simmering water to melt while preparing the filling. When the gelatin is melted, remove from the pan and allow to cool. In the bowl of an electric mixer, or another heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Whisk in the rum, then the sugar. Place over a pan of gently simmering water and whisk constantly until thickened, about 3 minutes. If the yolk mixture becomes too hot, it may scramble. Remove the bowl from the water and beat by machine, on medium speed, until cooled to room temperature. Whisk in the dissolved gelatin, then fold in the whipped cream and the chopped nuts. Pour the filling into the cooled shell and smooth the top. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and chill until set at least 6 hours. To finish the pie, top with the baked crumbs. Or whip the optional cream, spread half on the mousse and top with the crumbs. Then, pipe a border of rosettes of the remaining cream around the edge of the pie with a pastry bag fitted with a star tube. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 36232,&quot;Pappardelle with Scallops 1 pound large sea scallops, patted dry 1 pound pappardelle pasta 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 teaspoon sea salt, plus 1/2 teaspoon 2 cups mixed chanterelle, oyster, trumpet, mushrooms, thinly sliced 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, plus more for serving 3 cups arugula 2 tablespoons white truffle oil 2 ounces best quality Parmesan, shaved Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium heat and add 1 teaspoon of salt. Rinse and pat dry the scallops. Slice in half on equator and pat dry again. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt and set aside. Prep all of your ingredients and have them at ready, then start pasta. Cook the pasta approximately 8 minutes. If the pasta is done before prepping all the ingredients, add 3 cups cold water into pot to hold. (Water will still be hot, but will arrest cooking.) Drain when ready to use. In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil and butter over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, add the scallops, cook for 1 to 2 minutes and turn over. When scallops are just cooked, remove from heat and set aside, keeping them warm. Let the juices in pan reduce for 1 minute, then add the mushrooms and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic, red pepper flakes and black pepper. Toss to combine. Add in the reserved scallops and half of the truffle oil. Add in the drained cooked pasta, then the arugula and gently toss or stir to combine.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat the peanut butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and salt with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla and egg. Fold in the chocolate. Put some granulated sugar in a small bowl. Scoop tablespoonfuls of the cookie dough, roll them into balls and roll each ball in the sugar to coat. Evenly space them on the prepared baking sheets. Press each ball down with a fork to flatten it out and make an indentation. Bake until the bottoms are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Malbec, Barbera]&quot; 36234,&quot;St. Joseph&#39;s Vegetables 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon Chef Paul Prudhomme&#39;s Meat Magic(r) 1 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 3/4 teaspoon dry mustard 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, in all 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 1/2 cups onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 cup red bell peppers, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 cup yellow bell peppers, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 cup green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 large parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 medium butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 5 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 fresh fennel bulb, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic 1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce 1 cup vegetable stock 1 tablespoon lightly packed dark brown sugar Instructions: Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with the olive oil in a 14-inch skillet or 5 quart pot, preferably nonstick, over high heat. As soon as the butter begins to sizzle, add all the vegetables, seasoning mix, and garlic. Stir well, then cover and cook, uncovered to stir and scrape the bottom of the pan frequently, for 4 minutes. You will see that the vegetables color is a little brighter and their texture is somewhat more tender, and the fragrance is crisp and earthy. Continue to cook, still uncovering to stir and scrape, until the vegetables begin to brown, about 4 minutes longer. Now the fennel will be wilted, transparent and tender, and the bottom of the pan will be dry. At this point the vegetables are partially cooked, but still retain some of their crunch. Add the tomato sauce, stir, re-cover and cook, uncovering every 2 or 3 minutes to stir, scrape and check to be sure the mixture is not going to scorch. Do this just until the vegetables are pasty and thickly coated with sauce, and the liquid has evaporated, about 7 to 8 minutes. If you feel that there might be a risk of over-browning, then lower the heat slightly. Add the stock, brown sugar, and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Stir very well and cook just until the butter is thoroughly melted into the sauce and the vegetables are tender, except for the celery which should still have a little crunch, about 2 to 3 minutes. Serve over hot pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 36235,&quot;Fried Chicken 9 cups brown chicken stock 1 cup pickle brine (can be store-bought pickles and use that brine) 2 1/2 tablespoons salt 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1/2 teaspoon yellow mustard seeds 1 bay leaf 1 orange, quartered 1/2 head garlic, split 1/2 bunch fresh thyme 2 whole chickens, cut into 10 even pieces 1 quart all-purpose flour 1 cup cornmeal 1/2 cup cornstarch 2 tablespoons chicken spice, recipe follows Canola oil, for frying Hot Sauce, for serving, recipe follows Buttermilk Biscuits, for serving, recipe follows Bread and Butter Pickles, for serving, recipe follows 2 tablespoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay 4 teaspoons paprika 4 teaspoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons ground celery seeds 2 teaspoons chili powder 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 pounds red bell peppers, seeded and chopped 1 pound jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped 5 fish peppers, stemmed and seeded 4 cloves garlic 4 ounces fresh thyme, leaves picked and finely chopped 1 cup rice wine vinegar 3 tablespoons light brown sugar 2 grams xanthan gum 2 teaspoons ground white pepper 4 limes, zested and juiced Salt 10 ounces cold butter, diced 3 pounds all-purpose flour 1 1/2 ounces sugar 3 tablespoons baking powder 1 tablespoon baking soda 4 tablespoons salt 34 fluid ounces buttermilk, cold 1 cup fresh chopped chives 6 egg yolks Egg wash, for brushing 2 1/2 pounds Kirby cucumbers, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch rounds (about 4 cups) 1/2 quart thinly sliced Spanish onions 2 1/2 cloves garlic 1 jalapeno, stems removed and split in half 1/2 cup salt 1/2 quart apple cider vinegar 1/2 quart white distilled vinegar 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons coriander seeds 1 1/2 tablespoons yellow mustard seeds 1/2 tablespoon allspice 1/2 tablespoon celery seeds 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes 1/2 tablespoon turmeric 2 whole cloves 1 bay leaf Instructions: Chicken Dredge: For the brine: Combine the stock, brine, salt, seeds, bay leaf, oranges, garlic and thyme in a large pot and bring up to a high simmer for 15 minutes. Strain and cool the liquid to 40 degrees F and reserve until time to brine the chicken. Add the chicken to the brine, place in the fridge and brine for 12 hours. For the dredge: Combine the flour, cornmeal, cornstarch and Chicken Spice evenly in a large mixing bowl. Dredge the chicken in the seasoned flour mixture and allow a minimum of 30 minutes for the flour to adhere. Re-dredge just before frying. Heat 3 inches canola oil in a deep pot or a deep-fryer over high heat to 350 degrees F. A rule of thumb: If you drop a pinch of flour into the oil and it fries up immediately, you&#39;re good to go. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F and get ready a baking sheet with a rack. Take the chicken out of the dredge, shake off excess flour and fry in batches until golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to the rack and sprinkle some of the chicken spice over the fried chicken pieces. Hold in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve the fried chicken on a platter with Hot Sauce, Buttermilk Biscuits and Bread and Butter Pickles on the side. Chicken Spice: Grind the seafood seasoning, paprika, salt, celery seeds, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. Mix together. Hot Sauce: Juice half of the red bell peppers. Pass through a fine mesh strainer and reserve. In a large pot, sweat out the remaining red bell peppers, the jalapenos, fish peppers, garlic and thyme. Add the vinegar, sugar, xanthan gum, white pepper, lime zest and juice. Simmer for 15 minutes. Puree with the juice from the bell peppers and pass through a fine mesh strainer. Season with salt. Cook&#39;s Note: If you can&#39;t find fish peppers, can use any red mild pepper (scale of 4, so like a mild jalapeno). Buttermilk Biscuits: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut the cold butter into the flour and combine with the sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Combine the buttermilk, chives and yolks separately. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry, fold in gently and chill. Roll out the dough to a 1/2-inch-thick sheet. Fold into thirds, turn a quarter of the way around and fold into thirds again. Rest for 10 minutes. Roll out to 1/2 inch thickness again and cut into 1 1/2-inch squares. Brush with egg wash and bake for 8 minutes. Yield: 40 biscuits. Bread and Butter Pickles: Toss the cucumbers, onions, garlic and jalapenos with the salt and macerate overnight in the fridge. Combine the vinegars, sugar, coriander seeds, mustard seeds, allspice, celery seeds, red pepper flakes, turmeric, cloves and bay leaf in a large pot and bring to a boil. Simmer on low heat for 15 minutes. Strain over the cucumbers. Cover and allow to cool to room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 36236,&quot;Potato and Bacon Pizza 3 slices bacon 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound refrigerated pizza dough, at room temperature 1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 4 medium) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 ounces Cambozola or blue brie cheese, rind removed, cut into 1-inch pieces Chopped fresh chives, for topping Instructions: Freeze the bacon on a plate until firm, 20 to 30 minutes (this will make it easier to chop). Dice the bacon and set aside. Meanwhile, place a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet in the top third of the oven and preheat to 475 degrees F.

In a separate bowl, combine the Cheddar powder, mustard powder and white pepper. Fold the mixture into the popcorn in two additions and toss until evenly coated. For the caramel popcorn: Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or aluminum foil and lightly spray with cooking spray. Evenly spread the popcorn out on the baking sheet. Combine the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and corn syrup in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepot fitted with a candy thermometer (see Cook&#39;s Note). Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently with a heatproof rubber spatula; be careful: the caramel will bubble up a few inches as it cooks. Cook until the caramel reaches 248 to 250 degrees F (firm ball stage). Immediately turn off the heat and carefully stir in the salt and baking soda; the caramel will bubble up again when you add the baking soda. Spray a second heatproof rubber spatula with cooking spray. Immediately, and very carefully, pour the caramel evenly over the popcorn. With the greased spatula, carefully fold the caramel into the popcorn to coat; not every kernel will be completely coated, but the caramel will be evenly distributed.

Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower with some olive oil, salt and pepper. Put the cauliflower florets onto a baking sheet and into the oven to roast until nicely browned, about 20 minutes. Keep warm until service.<br> In a separate bowl, toss the potatoes, eggplant and carrots with some olive oil, salt and pepper. Place the potatoes, eggplant and carrots on the grill. Grill until marked, 5 to 6 minutes. Put onto a baking sheet and into the oven until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Keep warm until service.<br> For the chutney: Heat the olive oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and shallots and caramelize, about 2 minutes. Add the jalapeno and tomatoes, tossing to combine. Turn down the heat. Add the clam juice, orange juice, lime juice, cumin and smoked paprika. Simmer on low until the liquid dissolves, about 2 minutes. You may need to add more clam juice in order to further cook the tomatoes.<br> For the porgy: Rinse the porgy in cold water and pat dry. This is very important; the fish needs to be completely dry or it will stick to your grill! Rub the porgy with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Get your grill screaming hot. Place your porgy at 10 o&#39;clock and don&#39;t touch it! Leave it for a few minutes, and then lift slightly with a fish spatula to check for lines and sticking. If it&#39;s sticking, leave it there another 2 minutes or so, and then carefully turn it to 1 o&#39;clock. Leave it there long enough to get some nice black lines, and then flip. Again, get some nice black lines and then either finish it on the grill or pop it in a 350 degree F oven for 3 to 4 minutes or until desired doneness. Cooking time varies based on the size of fish so you have, to feel it out. It is perfectly acceptable for a porgy to be served \\pink on the bone.\\ In fact, some Montauk locals will send it back to the kitchen if it&#39;s cooked any further!<br> Place the whole grilled porgy on a serving plate.

Cover and set aside to keep hot. In a heavy Dutch oven or large saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and saute until transparent, about 4 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, until rice is opaque and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add a pinch of saffron and the white wine and cook, stirring, until absorbed. While continually stirring with a wooden spoon, begin adding the stock in 1/2 cup increments, allowing the liquid to become completely absorbed by the rice between additions. Cook until the rice is just tender and the risotto is creamy, about 20 minutes. Add the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, heavy cream, herbs, salt and pepper and stir to combine well. Transfer to a mixing bowl or baking dish and allow to cool completely. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. When ready to make the arancini, remove the chilled risotto from the refrigerator and stir in 1 of the eggs. Using a small scoop or large spoon, divide the risotto into approximately 3 tablespoon sized portions. Using your hands, form the portions into rough ball shapes. Press a hole into the center of each risotto ball and stuff the center with a heaping teaspoonful of the Bolognese Sauce. Press the opening closed and roll the ball between your hands until it is smooth. Set aside while you prepare the other arancini. Refrigerate at least 1 hour to allow balls to set up before coating and frying. In a large saucepan, heat 2 inches of oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F. Place the flour, remaining 2 eggs and bread crumbs in 3 separate bowls. Season each bowl with Essence to taste. Using a fork, lightly beat the eggs. One by one, lightly dredge each risotto ball in the flour, rolling to coat completely, then the beaten egg mixture, then the bread crumbs, so that each ball is completely coated. Transfer to a plate or baking sheet briefly, if necessary, until you are ready to fry the arancini. Fry the balls in batches, a few at a time, turning once during cooking so that they are evenly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer balls to paper towel lined plates to drain briefly before serving. Serve hot or warm, sprinkled with a little Parmesan. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. Recipe from \\New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch<br> Published by William Morrow, 1993. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until it is crisp and has released almost all of its fat, about 6 minutes. Add the onion, carrots, celery, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are very soft and lightly browned around the edges, about 6 minutes. Add the ground chuck, ground veal, and ground pork and cook, stirring to break up any clumps, until the meat is browned, about 5 minutes. Add the white wine, garlic, and tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the beef broth and bring to a boil. Lower the heat so that the sauce just simmers. Simmer, partially covered, for 10 to 15 minutes. Combine the milk and cream in a small mixing bowl. After the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, and at even intervals, start adding the milk-cream mixture little by little, 1/4 cup or so at a time over 1 1/2 hours. By the end of the 1 1/2 hours, the milk mixture should be completely incorporated and the sauce should be very thick and creamy. This sauce is not supposed to be very \\saucy\\ it should be tender morsels of meat coated by a thick, creamy sauce. Remove 1/2 cup of the sauce for the arancini, place in a small bowl and stir in the peas. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled before using in the Sicilian Style Arancini recipe. The remaining sauce may be used for pasta; sauce freezes exceptionally well and may be frozen for up to 4 months. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 36272,&quot;Stovetop Spinach and Artichoke Dip 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 1 tablespoon butter 3 cloves garlic, chopped 1/2 onion, chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves or 2 teaspoons dried 1/2 small red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock 1/2 cup half-and- half or heavy cream 1 can (15 ounces) artichoke hearts in water, drained and coarsely chopped 2 boxes, 10 ounces each, chopped spinach, defrosted and squeezed dry in kitchen towel 1 1/2 cups shredded Italian 4 cheese blend (provolone, Parmesan, mozzarella and Asiago) available in 10-ounce pouches on the dairy aisle of your market Salt and pepper 1 round loaf crusty bread: top removed and cubed, bottom hollowed out to use as serving bowl 1 loaf multigrain or whole wheat baguette, sliced at bakery/bread counter in market Instructions: To a medium saucepot preheated over moderate heat, add about 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream.

(Reserve all the potato scraps: you can toss them with salt and oil to air fry later.) Stand up each potato on its flat side. Working with 1 potato at a time, place a 16-slice thin apple slicer over the center of the rounded end. Carefully push the slicer down using a see-sawing motion until the blades are 1/4 inch from the bottom of the potato. Don\\u2019t push firmly straight down or you could accidentally slice through the entire potato. Remove the slicer by grasping the sides with both hands and firmly pushing your thumbs into the center of the potato. Use a melon baller to scoop out three-fourths of that center. Thoroughly coat the potatoes all over with olive oil spray and season with the salt. Add them flat-sides down to a 6-quart air fryer. Cook at 380 degrees F until the petals are crispy and golden brown, 14 to 17 minutes depending on the size of your potatoes (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Remove the air fryer basket, wait until the potatoes are cool enough to handle (about 1 minute) and gently pluck them out of the basket with your hands. Fill each center with 1/2 teaspoon ranch dressing and nestle half a cherry tomato on top, dome-side up.

Add the ground allspice, brown sugar, thyme, allspice berries, cinnamon and nutmeg, then process. Add the juice, olive oil, soy sauce, black pepper and 1 tablespoon salt and process until a thick paste is formed, clingy enough to stick to the back of a spoon. (If it\\u2019s too thick, thin with more soy sauce.) Scrape half of the paste into a large shallow dish with a lid. Add the chicken and top with the remaining paste. Spread the paste, making sure each piece of chicken gets a little attention. Cover and marinate in the fridge overnight, up to 24 hours. Prepare the grill with one hot and one unheated side. This works best on a charcoal grill or a gas grill with one burner turned off. Oil the grill grates liberally with the vegetable oil. Place the chicken skin-side up on the cool side of the grill and close the lid. Grill, rotating the pieces every 10 minutes to ensure even exposure to the hot side of the grill, until the breasts register 165 degrees F and the thighs register 170 degrees F, 40 to 45 minutes for the breasts and 30 to 35 minutes for the thighs.

Repeat with white morsels. Using an off-set spatula, spread melted chocolate thickly over 1 side of 2 of the crown templates. Repeat with melted white morsels and remaining crown template. Arrange additional chocolate morsels decoratively on white crown. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until chocolate is set. Wrap 1 chocolate template around half of cake; carefully peel off paper. Wrap second chocolate crown around remaining half of cake; carefully peel off paper. Seal ends of crowns with a knife dipped in very hot water. Refrigerate cake until chocolate crown is completely firm. Wrap white crown, paper side inward, around a 5-inch bowl. Refrigerate until white crown is completely firm. Carefully peel paper from white crown. Place white crown atop cake. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Malbec]&quot; 36280,&quot;Sugarplums 6 ounces slivered almonds, toasted 4 ounces dried plums 4 ounces dried apricots 4 ounces dried figs 1/4 cup powdered sugar 1/4 teaspoon anise seeds, toasted 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds, toasted 1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds, toasted 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom Pinch kosher salt 1/4 cup honey 1 cup coarse sugar Instructions: Put the almonds, plums, apricots, and figs into the bowl of a food processor and pulse 20 to 25 times or until the fruit and nuts are chopped into small pieces, but before the mixture becomes a ball.

Meanwhile, in a saucepan place the heavy cream and butter. Simmer over low heat for a minute or until slightly reduced and then season with salt and pepper. Keep warm over low heat. To the pot of boiling water, add the fettuccine, and bring water back to a boil. If pasta has just been made, cook for a few seconds after water returns to a boil, other wise cook until just slightly firmer than al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain fettuccine and add it to the cream sauce. Toss fettucine coating them with cream sauce. Add fresh herbs, salt, pepper and toss again, still over low heat, until sauce has thickened and fettuccine is well coated. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 36283,&quot;Sauteed Cherries with Grappa and Almonds 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, divided 1/2 cup whole almonds, skin-on Kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, sifted 1 pound or 3 cups whole cherries, preferably Bing cherries, washed, dried, cut open and pitted, but left somewhat whole 1/2 cup granulated sugar 2 cinnamon sticks 1/2 cup Grappa, plus a splash to finish 1 pint lemon sorbet Instructions: After spending some time in the south of France, I really came to love certain fruits and nuts mixed together in desserts. Maybe it&#39;s because almonds and cherries are actually both fruits, that I feel they belong together. Or maybe, quite simply, it&#39;s the flavor combination of these 2 ingredients that makes them perfect (and simple finish) for any meal. It can be paired with a sorbet or ice cream, depending on your mood. Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter and the almonds. Stir to coat the nuts with the butter. Add the ground cinnamon and toss to coat. Toast until fragrant. Transfer the almonds to a bowl and set aside. Return the skillet to medium heat and allow it to get hot again, about 1 minute. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and toss in the cherries. Stir in the sugar and cinnamon sticks. Cook for 1 minute, stirring so the sugar dissolves, then remove the skillet from the heat. Carefully add the Grappa and gingerly return the skillet to the heat. Step back a little as the alcohol may cause the pan to flame slightly. Stir and continue cooking until the liquid becomes somewhat syrupy, an additional 1 to 2 minutes Remove the cinnamon sticks. Arrange the cherries in 4 to 6 bowls, top with almonds, a splash of Grappa and a generous scoop of lemon sorbet. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 36284,&quot;Smashburger-Style Burgers 1/4 cup mayonnaise 4 teaspoons yellow mustard 12 dill pickle chips, plus 1 teaspoon brine 1/8 teaspoon onion powder 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder Pinch of smoked paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 1/4 pounds ground beef (80% lean) Unsalted butter, softened, for brushing 4 bakery hamburger buns, split 4 slices American cheese Ketchup, for serving 8 thin slices tomato 4 thin slices red onion 4 lettuce leaves Instructions: Heat a griddle or large cast-iron skillet over medium heat for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the mayonnaise, mustard and pickle brine in a small bowl. Combine the onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a separate small bowl. Set aside. Loosely form the beef into 4 balls; set aside. Working in batches, lightly brush the griddle with butter and toast the buns cut-side down until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Brush the griddle with more butter and add 1 ball of beef. Press firmly with 2 large crisscrossed metal spatulas for exactly 10 seconds, then gently remove the spatulas. Sprinkle the patties with some of the seasoning mixture and continue cooking, undisturbed, until well browned, 1 1/2to 2 minutes. (Start cooking another burger at this point.) Flip the patty, sprinkle with more of the seasoning mixture and top with 1 cheese slice. Continue cooking until the cheese is melted around the edges and the bottom of the burger is browned, about 1 more minute. Repeat with the remaining beef. Spread the mayonnaise mixture on the bun tops and add some ketchup. Serve the patties on the buns with the pickles, tomato, red onion and lettuce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel]&quot; 36285,&quot;Sloppy Joe Sliders 2 1/2 pounds ground beef 1 large green bell pepper, diced<br> 1/2 yellow onion, diced<br> 5 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 1/2 cups ketchup<br> 2 teaspoons chili powder<br> 2 teaspoons brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon dry mustard<br> 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 3 to 4 dashes Worcestershire sauce<br> Hot sauce, to taste<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 16 soft slider buns<br> 1 cup canned fried onions, such as French&#39;s<br> Red grapes, for serving<br> Instructions: Place the beef in a large pot over medium-high heat and cook until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain off the fat. Add the green peppers and onion and cook, stirring, until they soften slightly and are combined with the beef, a couple of minutes. Add the garlic and stir into the mixture for another minute or so. Add the ketchup and 1 cup water and stir to combine. Add the chili powder, brown sugar, dry mustard, red pepper flakes, Worcestershire and hot sauce. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the sauce has thickened, about 20 minutes. Spoon a good amount of the meat on the bottoms of the slider buns.

Coat two 9-inch round cake pans and two 6-inch round cake pans with cooking spray; dust with flour and tap out the excess. Line the bottom of each pan with parchment. Whisk the flour, granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the milk, vegetable oil and eggs. Mix with a rubber spatula until just combined. Stir in the vanilla and coffee extracts. Pour 3 cups batter into each of the prepared 9-inch pans. Divide the remaining batter between the 6-inch pans (about 11/2 cups each); tap the pans against the counter to release any air bubbles. Bake, switching the position of the pans halfway through, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 35 minutes for the 6-inch cakes and 45 minutes for the 9-inch cakes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then remove the cakes to the racks, discard the parchment and let cool completely. Using a long serrated knife, split the cake layers in half horizontally to create four 9-inch layers and four 6-inch layers. Whisk the coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk in a medium bowl. Brush onto the cooled cake layers, using just enough to moisten the top of each. Make the frosting: Puree the raspberries in a food processor until smooth. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Slowly beat in 4 cups confectioners? sugar until smooth. Add the raspberry puree, the remaining 2 cups confectioners? sugar and the lemon zest and juice; beat until fluffy, about 2 more minutes. Assemble the cake: Place one 9-inch layer on a cardboard round. Using an offset spatula, spread about 3/4 cup frosting on top. Stack the remaining 9-inch cake layers on top, spreading 3/4 cup frosting between each. Cover the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting (this is the crumb coat). Refrigerate until set, at least 30 minutes. Make the fondant: Dust a surface with confectioners? sugar. Roll 8 ounces white fondant into a thick log. Roll 2 ounces each blue, pink, green and yellow fondant (or other desired colors) into thin logs the same length as the white log. Use a little water to stick the colored logs to the white log. Use your hands to roll the fondant logs together into one big log, then twist the log a few times. Fold the twisted fondant log in half, then gather together into a ball. Using a rolling pin, roll out the fondant ball into a 15-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick, dusting with confectioners? sugar as needed. Lift the round of marbled fondant and drape it over the 6-inch cake. Smooth out the fondant with your hands. Trim off the excess fondant around the cake with a paring knife. Refrigerate until ready to assemble. Place the 9-inch layer cake on a cake board or cake stand; top with the 6-inch layer cake. Pipe the reserved frosting around the bottom edges of each cake layer. Repeat steps 1 through 3 to make a larger ball of marbled fondant, using 1 pound white fondant and 4 ounces each of the colored fondants. Roll into an 18-inch round. Drape the fondant over the 9-inch cake, then smooth and trim the edges. Meanwhile, lay one 6-inch cake layer on a cardboard round; spread 1/4 cup frosting on top. Stack the remaining 6-inch layers on top, spreading 1/4 cup frosting between each. Cover the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Place the remaining frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip; set aside. Cover the tiers with marbled fondant and finish assembling. Decorate with the remaining frosting as desired. Refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 36288,&quot;Best Breakfast Potatoes Ever 5 pounds red potatoes, roughly chopped/diced 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 onion, chopped<br> 1 green bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped<br> 1 red bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped<br> 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 1/2 stick butter, melted<br> 1 teaspoon seasoned salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until fluffy. Beat in the egg, then beat in the vanilla and almond extracts. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the flour mixture and beat until combined. Cover and chill 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop 1-inch mounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, about 2 1/2 inches apart; flatten the mounds with your fingers. Bake until the cookies are golden around the edges, about 10 minutes. Let the cookies cool 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Make the frosting: Beat the butter, almond and vanilla extracts, and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until smooth and creamy. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a small star tip.

Add the yeast and stir until blended. Let sit for 10 minutes; you should be able to see the yeast activate and create an expanding foam in the bowl. Mix together the bread flour and salt in a separate bowl, then slowly drizzle over the melted butter and blend until the flour is a soft crumbly texture. Stir the almond and vanilla extracts into the beaten egg, pour into the flour mixture and continue mixing. Slowly add the yeasty water until all the liquid is incorporated and the flour has formed into a soft mound. Transfer the dough to a lightly-floured surface and knead 1 to 4 times until smooth. (Don&#39;t overwork the dough or it will become tough.) Spray a large bowl with nonstick spray and place the dough in the bowl. Spray the top with a light coating of nonstick spray and cover with plastic wrap or a towel. Let rise in a warm place for at least 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. For the stuffing: Toss together the spinach, lemon juice, artichokes and garlic. Saute over medium-low heat until the spinach is slightly wilted, and then stir in the cream, cream cheese and Parmesan until the cheese is melted. Remove from the heat and gradually add the breadcrumbs until the mixture is slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Chill until ready to stuff the beignets; it will thicken as it chills. For the reduction: Heat a pan over medium-high heat. Add the syrup and vinegar and stir until the sauce is bubbling and slightly reduced, to the consistency of syrup, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar. The sauce should be tangy and slightly sweet with a gentle hint of maple. Keep warm. For assembling and frying: Preheat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. Cut the beignet dough ball into 4 equal sections, and roll each section out to about 1/4-inch thickness and cut into rounds about the circumference of a coffee cup. Moisten the edge of each round with water using your fingertips or a misting sprayer, and then place a heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of half the rounds. Top with the remaining rounds and gently press down the edges to create a seal. Deep-fry, flipping frequently, until golden, and then drain for a few seconds on paper towels. Lightly dust the tops with confectioners&#39; sugar. This dusting effect is best when done using a wire strainer filled with confectioners&#39; sugar, held over the warm beignets, and lightly tapped on the side to release a fine spray of the sugar. Dust the center of plates very lightly with confectioners&#39; sugar, then drizzle the balsamic-maple reduction in whatever pattern desired over the bottom. Top with the stuffed beignets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 36291,&quot;Roast Chicken 1 stick butter, softened 2 whole lemons, zested 4 sprigs fresh rosemary Salt and pepper 1 whole roaster chicken, rinsed and patted dry Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

For the Chicken with Tasso: Sprinkle the chicken pieces with 2 tablespoons of the seasoning mix and rub well with your hands. In a heavy 4-quart pot, preferably nonstick, heat the olive oil over high heat until it begins to smoke, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken, in batches if necessary, skin sides down first, and large pieces first, and cook until the skin is brown, about 4 minutes. Turn the pieces over and cook just until the other sides are brown but the chicken is not cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside. To the same pot add the onions, celery, peppers and all the tasso. Stir well and scrape the bottom of the pot loosen the brown bits left from the chicken. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes-the colors are so bright they&#39;re almost glowing-then add the remaining seasoning mix and the garlic. Stir well, then cover and cook for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir well, you&#39;ll see that the vegetables are beginning to brown and stick slightly. Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any sticking material, then re-cover and cook for 4 minutes. At this point the vegetables are medium brown and may be sticking hard, so add 1/2 cup of stock and deglaze the pot by scraping to loosen all the material on the bottom. Add the flour and stir until the white is no longer visible, adding a little more stock if necessary to help absorb the flour. Scrape the bottom of the pot one more time, then cover and let the mixture cook for 3 minutes. Warning: do not do this if your pot does not have a good thick bottom. A thin pot will heat too quickly and your mixture will definitely burn, so reduce the heat and watch closely to be sure that the food doesn&#39;t burn. Your cooking time may have to be a little longer to make up for using less heat. But if you do have a good heavy bottomed pot, you&#39;ll discover that flour moistened with the juices from the vegetables and tasso creates a wonderful flavor when it is allowed to brown in this way. Uncover, add the remaining 2 1/2 cups of stock, and scrape the bottom of the pot well. Bring to a boil, return the chicken and any accumulated juices to the pot, and return the liquid just to a boil. At this time, the broth is reminiscent of gumbo, but very salty from the seasonings. Reduce the heat to medium, recover and cook, stirring and scraping the pot occasionally, until the chicken is fully cooked, about 25 minutes. Serve over rice. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 36295,&quot;Crabmeat Fondue Nonstick cooking spray 1/4 cup plain panko bread crumbs 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves 4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel), softened at room temperature 1/2 cup light mayonnaise 1/4 cup fat-free milk 1 shallot, minced 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon Worcestershire 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon hot sauce 1 (8-ounce) container lump crabmeat, picked through Celery or other crudites Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Close the jar tightly and shake vigorously for 30 seconds to emulsify. To make the zucchini blossoms: In a big bowl, combine the flour, onion powder, sea salt, honey brown beer, and egg. Whisk until smooth. Heat a 1/4-inch of extra-virgin olive oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add a few drops of the beer batter to the oil. When the batter starts to sizzle, the oil has reached the appropriate heat for frying, 375 degrees F. Dip the zucchini blossoms in the honey brown beer batter and then delicately fry them for a few seconds, until they are golden on all sides. Remove the zucchini blossoms from the pan with slotted spoons and strain them on a wire rack to remove any excess oil. Lightly sprinkle with sea salt.

Add a steamer insert and bring the liquid to a boil over high heat. Add the crabs and 1/4 cup of the Old Bay and cook, covered, until the crabs are bright red, 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the size. Transfer the crabs to a large platter and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup Old Bay. Serve the hot crabs with the Spicy Butter and lemon wedges on the side. Make the butter while the crabs cook: combine the butter, Old Bay, cayenne and garlic in a small saucepan over medium heat. Melt the butter, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Pour the melted butter into a small ramekin, leaving the milk solids in the saucepan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 36300,&quot;Sorullitos de Maz y Queso 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups coarsely grated Gouda (5 ounces) Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Heat the sugar, salt and 2 cups water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until the sugar and salt dissolve and the water begins to boil. Mix in the cornmeal, stirring constantly with a sturdy rubber spatula until everything is incorporated, about 1 minute. Turn off the burner and add the butter and 1/2 cup of the Gouda. Continue stirring until the cheese and butter melt and a cohesive mass of dough forms, about 3 minutes. The mixture should be somewhat resistant to mixing, gummy and malleable, but not sticky. Let the corn and cheese dough cool down for about 3 minutes. When the dough is cool enough to handle, form 2 tablespoons of dough into a 2-by-3-inch rectangle. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons of the remaining Gouda to the center of the rectangle and roll into a small 3-inch cigar-shaped stick. Repeat the process. The recipe should yield about 25 corn sticks. If frying right away, heat about 1 inch oil in a small to medium heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 325 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer or it bubbles when it comes in contact with a wooden spoon. Fry the sorullitos until golden all around and the cheese is melted on the inside, about 5 minutes. Drain the sorullitos on paper towels. They are best served right away. To make ahead to fry at a later time, line a baking sheet that is small enough to fit in your freezer with wax paper. Lay the sorullitos in a single layer without touching on the prepared baking sheet. Freeze until hard, then transfer to freezer bags or containers and freeze for up to 2 months. If cooking the sorullitos from frozen, there is no need to thaw them out before frying. Heat the oil following the above instructions and fry the frozen sorullitos until golden brown and the cheese is melted on the inside, about 6 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 36301,&quot;Pomegranate and Mint Sorbet 1 cup Mint Simple Syrup, recipe follows 2 cups 100 percent pomegranate juice (recommended: Pom Wonderful) 1 cup orange juice 1/2 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips Fresh mint sprigs, for garnish 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 1 packed cup packed fresh mint leaves Instructions: Special equipment: an ice cream maker In a glass pitcher, combine the Mint Simple Syrup, pomegranate juice, and orange juice.

Place the water, butter, and salt in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil and stir until the butter melts. Stir in all the flour at once and stir with a wooden spoon. Stir and cook until a dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. The mixture will be in a tight ball and not stick to the sides or bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat and transfer the dough to the bowl of a standing mixer and let cool for 3 or 4 minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, making sure the first egg is completely incorporated before continuing. Once all the eggs have been added and the mixture is smooth, turn off the mixer and remove the bowl. Spoon half the dough into a pastry bag fitted with a round tip. Don&#39;t fill the bag completely. Twist the top of the bag so that the dough will not leak out. (To pipe out the dough, gently squeeze out the amount you want, then release.) On a sheet tray lined with parchment paper, squeeze out 1-inch size dough balls, about 2 inches apart. Form more balls on another sheet pan, if needed. Place in the oven and bake until they&#39;re golden and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. For the filling: In a food processor, pulse the chorizo until finely chopped, but not a paste. No large chunks. Transfer to a bowl, stir in the mascarpone, manchego, pimenton, and chives.

Liberally sprinkle all sides of the short ribs with salt and pepper. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the oil. Sear the short ribs on all sides until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Once seared, set aside on a plate. Add the carrots, garlic and onions to the pot with the short rib drippings and season with some salt and pepper. Cook the vegetables until they turn golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Add in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute more. Add the wine and deglaze the pot, scraping up any developed fond (all the delicious brown bits) from the bottom. Bring the wine to a simmer and season with some salt and pepper. Add the thyme, bay leaf and short ribs and any leftover juices from the plate the short ribs were resting on. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven until the meat is fork tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Turn the short ribs one time during the cooking process after about 1 hour of cooking. Once the short ribs are tender, remove them from the braising liquid and set aside to cool. Skim the fat off the top of the braising liquid. Then strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve and bring to a simmer until it is reduced by half, about 8 minutes (to yield about 2/3 cup of reduced sauce). Remove the meat from the bone and cut in half horizontally to fit on the croissant. For the sandwich build: Lightly toast the croissants and then schmear some horseradish mustard on the bottom half of the croissant. Place the slices of short rib on top of the mustard and drizzle with some of the reduced sauce. Top with a fried egg and then a nice pile of the chips. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

To make the tuiles: In a mixer fitted with a paddle, cream the butter, sugar, and lemon zest. Add the honey and flour and mix well. Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of the batter onto a Silpat-lined or nonstick sheet pan. Use a small offset spatula to spread the tuile into a 1 3/4-inch circle. Repeat the process, making at least 18 tuiles (the extra will allow for breakage). Sprinkle the top of each tuile with a pinch of rolled oats, reserving 1/2 tablespoon for garnish. Bake for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. (The tuiles may be cut with a ring cutter after cooking for a more precise shape.) Immediately transfer the tuile to a countertop or other flat surface to cool. To prepare the figs: Cut the tops off 6 of the figs. Use a small spoon to press a cavity into each fig and dip the whole fig in the simple syrup. Fill the figs with the port. (If the figs have any holes in the bottoms, cut small pieces off the tops to fill the holes.) Place the filled figs on a sheetpan and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, or until they have softened. Slice the remaining 6 figs in half lengthwise and then cut them crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. Warm the slices in the remaining simple syrup. To make the goat cheese cream: Thoroughly combine 2 tablespoons of the heavy cream with the goat cheese and granulated sugar. Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup cream until it reaches soft peaks and fold into the goat cheese mixture. To assemble, place 3 to 4 fig slices on one half of each plate. Place a small spoonful of the goat cheese cream on the figs and top with a tuile. Spoon another small spoonful of the cream, 3 to 4 fig slices, another tablespoon of the cream, and a tuile on top of the first stack. Build another layer with a spoon of cream, figs, another spoonful of cream, and a tuile. Place a roasted fig alongside the stacked figs and top with a quenelle of Goat Cheese Ice Cream. Spoon the Spicy Fig Sauce around the plates and sprinkle with the thyme sprigs and the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oatmeal. Prepare an ice water bath. Bring the cream and milk to a boil. Whisk together the egg yolks, and sugar, and slowly pour in some of the hot cream to temper the eggs. Pour the eggs into the cream and continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture coats the back of a spoon and steam rises from the top. Whisk together the corn syrup and goat cheese and then whisk this mixture into the cream mixture until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and chill over the ice water bath. Freeze in an ice cream machine. Keep frozen until ready to use. Cook the sugar in a heavy-bottomed saute pan over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Add the orange juice and bring to a boil. Add the figs, star anise, and peppercorns, bring to a boil, and cook for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve, pushing on the solids to remove as much liquid as possible. If necessary, thin with a little warm water to a make a sauce consistency. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 36335,&quot;Spicy Shrimp Tempura 1 cup white medium-grain rice, such as Calrose One 13.5-ounce can coconut milk 1 1/2 red bell peppers, diced 1 jalapeno, sliced with seeds 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup cider vinegar 1 to 2 pinches red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon liquid pectin 1 avocado, sliced 1 cucumber, seeded and sliced 1 fresh mango, chopped 1/4 of a fresh jalapeno, sliced 6 sprigs fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish 3 green onions, chopped, plus more for garnish 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 1 teaspoon chili paste Pinch black pepper 8 large shrimp or tiger prawns 1 1/2 cups rice flour 1 1/2 to 2 cups carbonated water Canola oil, for frying Instructions: For the sticky rice: Wash the rice until the water is clear and all the starch is washed off. Put the rice in a shallow cooking pan and add the coconut milk and 3/4 cup water. (Trick - place your hand flat in the pan and pour in the water. When the liquid reaches your middle finger knuckle, you have the right amount.) Bring the rice and coconut milk to a boil. Then turn down the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer for 15 minutes. For the jelly: Put the bell peppers, jalapeno, sugar, cider vinegar and red pepper flakes into a saucepan and cook over medium heat until the liquid is reduced by two-thirds. Add the liquid pectin to give it a jelly-like consistency. Then set aside. For the salad: Combine the avocado, cucumber, mango, jalapeno, cilantro, green onions, sugar, oil, vinegar, chili paste and black pepper in a bowl and mix together. For the shrimp: Peel and clean the shrimp. I like to use tiger prawns - big daddy shrimp!! Frozen shrimp is fine - just let them thaw out and rinse them in water. Whisk together the rice flour and carbonated water until it reaches a batter consistency (alternatively, you can get premade tempura batter at Asian markets). It&#39;s key to not whisk too much, you want a nice fine batter without much air in it. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Next, take a heavy-bottomed pot and fill it with canola oil. Don&#39;t fill the pot too much! If using a 1-gallon saucepot, use 1/4 gallon oil. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it&#39;s about 350 degrees F. You can test if the oil is ready by dropping some of the tempura batter into the oil. If it floats to the top, it&#39;s ready to go! Dredge the shrimp in the batter and drop into the oil. The shrimp will cook all the way in 2 to 3 minutes. It&#39;s key to not add too many shrimp at once, just add 3 or 4 at a time. When the shrimp floats to the top, they should be done. You can test them by taking one out and cutting into it to make sure it&#39;s opaque, and then taking a bite. Place the shrimp in the oven until you are ready to plate. Combine all the components: Put the fried shrimp in a bowl with some pepper jelly and toss to coat them. Next, take a little bit of the jelly and place on the bottom of each plate. Put some sticky rice down on the plate on top of the jelly. Place 2 shrimp on top of the rice. Add some mango and avocado salad.

For the spring rolls: In a bowl, mix together the shrimp, slaw and marinade. Place a spring roll wrapper on your work surface with 1 of the corners facing you so it looks like a diamond. (Keep the spring roll wrappers covered with a damp towel so they don&#39;t dry out). Place 2 tablespoons filling on the lower third of the wrapper. Spread the filling out in a line from side to side. Roll the bottom corner up over the filling, and then fold in the sides. Moisten the top corner with some water, using your finger or a brush, and roll the filling over it so it sticks to itself and forms a seal. Place seam-side down on a plate and keep covered with a damp towel while you make the remaining rolls.

Line a rimmed quarter-sheet pan with parchment paper and rub with a light coating of butter. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and baking soda in a medium bowl. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until the cubes have blended together into one large smooth ball. Add the brown and granulated sugars and beat until completely combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes. (It should have the texture of wet sand.) Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until well combined. (There might be small pebble-size pieces of butter in the mixture, but that is okay.) Add half of the flour mixture and beat on medium-low speed until just combined. Add the remaining flour mixture and beat until the mixture just comes together. Do not overmix. Add the hazelnuts and dark chocolate chunks and mix on low speed until just combined. Transfer the cookie dough to the prepared sheet pan and use your hands or a rubber spatula to lightly press the dough in an even layer. Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until the edges are light golden brown and the top is dry to the touch, 15 to 18 minutes. Place the pan on a cooling rack and cool completely. It is okay if the cookie is slightly under-baked when it comes out of the oven; it will continue to cook as it cools. (These bars are best when they are nice and gooey in the middle, so it is better to err on the side of under-baking than over-baking.) When ready to serve, preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat. Using a bench scraper or a straight-sided metal spatula, cut the cookie into 24 bars. Put the pan with the cut bars directly on the grill and cook, covered, until the chocolate is melted and the bars are warmed through, about 5 minutes. (Alternatively, the bars can be rewarmed in an oven or removed from the pan and rewarmed in a microwave.) Transfer the cookie bars to individual plates and top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 36343,&quot;Blackened Tuna Chesapeake Style 4 (8 to 9-ounce) tuna steaks Blackening Spice 4 ounces butter 8 ounces jumbo lump crabmeat 4 ounces ham (Virginia Smithfield preferred), small diced 4 ounces butter Your favorite Bearnaise Sauce, optional Instructions: Preheat a convection oven to 500 degrees F. Heat an iron skillet over medium high heat. Season both sides of the tuna steaks with blackening spice. Add the tuna to the hot skillet and sear each side for about 1 minute to seal in the moisture. Remove the tuna from the skillet and place in a broiler pan. Top each tuna steak with 1 ounce of butter and place in the oven. Cook for 6 minutes for medium rare or 8 minutes for well done. After you place your tuna in the oven start your Chesapeake topping by sauteing jumbo lump crabmeat with the Virginia Smithfield ham in the butter over medium heat until warmed through. When fish is done, place the Chesapeake topping on fish and finish off with Bearnaise sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 36344,&quot;Everything Bagel Crispbreads 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting 2 cups rye flour 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 stick butter, melted 1/2 cup sesame seeds 1/3 cup poppy seeds 1/4 cup dried minced garlic 1/4 cup dried minced onion 1/4 cup coarse salt 1 large egg Instructions: For the crispbread: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a mixer on low speed, combine the flours, sugar, baking powder and salt. Pour in the melted butter, then slowly pour in 1 1/2 to 2 cups water, 1/4 cup at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms. Dust the counter and rolling pin well with flour, and roll the dough into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. For the topping: In a small bowl, mix together the sesame seeds, poppy seeds, garlic, onion and coarse salt. Whisk together the egg with 2 tablespoons water and brush a thin layer over the crispbread dough. Sprinkle the topping mixture evenly over the top. Use a wheeled pizza cutter or pie crimper to cut the dough into medium-sized rectangles (it&#39;s okay if the shapes are irregular). Using a spatula, carefully transfer the crispbreads to a lightly floured baking sheet (they won?t spread, so it&#39;s fine to leave little room between them). Using a fork, lightly prick the surface of each of the crispbreads. Bake in the center of the oven until the edges become golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. (Bake time will vary depending on the size and thickness of the crackers, so keep an eye on them!) Once golden, allow to cool 5 minutes, then move to a wire rack until completely cool.

Measure and add enough water just to cover the turkey. (There should be at least 6 inches between the water line and the top of the pot to fry safely.) Remove the turkey and water and dry the pot very well. Combine the butter, broth, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, lemon zest and 1 tablespoon salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over very low heat and cook until the garlic softens, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the lemon juice and let cool completely. Strain; reserve the liquid and discard the solids. One hour before you are ready to cook, take the turkey out of the refrigerator and remove the neck and giblets. Pat the turkey very dry, inside and out. If there is a pop-up timer, remove and discard. Use an injector syringe to inject the butter mixture into the turkey, 4 or 5 places in each breast and 2 or 3 in each leg and thigh. (Inject as deep into the flesh as you can.) Pat dry if any of the mixture leaks out. Season the turkey inside and out with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper and rub it in well.<br> Add the oil to the frying pot and heat to 350?

F, using protective gloves, slowly lower the turkey into the fryer according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. The oil temperature will drop 30? F to 40? F almost immediately. Adjust the heat so the temperature stays between 300? F and 325? F the whole time you are frying. Fry 3 minutes per pound. When the turkey is done, turn off the fryer. Using the gloves and the lifting rack, carefully remove the turkey from the oil to a rack set on a rimmed baking sheet. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; it should register 155? F. Let the turkey rest 20 to 30 minutes before removing from the rack and carving (the internal temperature will increase about 10? F). Make sure the frying oil cools completely before discarding, at least 4 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 36367,&quot;Sausage and Pepper Sliders 1 1/4 pounds sweet Italian sausage, casings removed 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 1 orange bell pepper, sliced<br> 1 large shallot, sliced<br> 1 clove garlic, sliced<br> 8 ounces tomato sauce (store-bought or homemade)<br> 8 slider buns or small potato rolls, split, lightly toasted if desired<br> 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped flat-leaf parsley<br> Instructions: Form the sausage into eight 1/2-inch-thick patties.

Put the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and beat slowly until it is smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and salt and cream at moderate speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the eggs and egg whites together a little at a time, beating after each addition until the eggs are absorbed before adding more. Mix until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl to insure even mixing, about 5 minutes. Sift together the cake flour and baking powder in a medium bowl and set aside. Mix the milk and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Add one-quarter of the flour mixture to the butter and egg mixture and beat just until blended in. Add one-third of the milk mixture and beat just until blended in. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, alternating the flour with the milk, until all the ingredients are used. Scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally for even mixing. Scoop some batter into each liner and bake until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool completely before frosting. For the custard frosting: Using an electric mixer with a whip attachment, whip the cornstarch and egg yolks in a stainless steel bowl until light and fluffy. Warm the whipping cream and confectioners&#39; sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. When the cream mixture reaches about 100 degrees F, add about half of it to the egg yolks, whisking, and then transfer the mixture back to the saucepan. Continue cooking the yolk and cream mixture until it reaches a boil (about 180 degrees F). Remove from the heat immediately and pour into a clean stainless steel bowl. Whip in the butter and vanilla until smooth and creamy. (The mixture may be stored in an air-tight container up to 5 days.) For the brulee sugar mixture: Mix together the brown sugar and granulated sugar in a medium bowl. Top each cupcake with 1 1/2 ounces of the custard frosting. Sprinkle on some of the brulee sugar mixture and torch.

Bring to a boil over medium heat and par-cook the sausages for 7 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, warm the stock and saffron in a medium pot over low heat. Heat a large heavy pot or deep skillet, over medium-high heat and add the extra-virgin olive oil. When the oil smokes, add the chicken and season liberally with salt and pepper, to taste. Brown the chicken for a couple minutes on each side, then remove it to a plate. Add the par-boiled sausage and crisp up the casings, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the sausages and cut them into large chunks. Add the butter to the pot and let it melt. Add the pasta to the melted butter and let it toast for a couple minutes, then add the onions and garlic. Season the pasta with salt and pepper, to taste, then add the bay leaf and stir for 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the rice and stir to combine, then deglaze the pot with the white wine, stirring for 30 seconds. Put the chicken and sausages back into the pot, pour in the saffron stock and stir. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the seafood and tomatoes and cook until the shrimp are opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes more.

Add 1 tablespoon salt and the pasta and cook until just al dente (1 to 2 minutes less than the label directs). Meanwhile, put the peppercorns in a small resealable plastic bag and coarsely crush with the flat side of a meat mallet or the bottom of a skillet. Place the crushed peppercorns in a fine-mesh sieve and discard any dust that falls through. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed peppercorns and cook until sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a large bowl. Using tongs, remove the pasta from the boiling water and transfer to the bowl with the peppercorn oil along with 2 tablespoons of the cooking water. (Reserve the remaining cooking water in the skillet.) Toss the pasta until coated. Let cool slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. (If the pasta is too hot, the cheese will clump and not melt.) Add the cheese to the bowl with the pasta in three batches, tossing well and adding a few tablespoons of the reserved cooking water with each addition; make sure most of the cheese is melted before adding more. Continue adding the cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, until the pasta is coated in a thick creamy sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 36380,&quot;Next Day Empanadas 1/2 cup leftover mashed potatoes 1/2 cup leftover green bean casserole 1 teaspoon Mexican seasoning 1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese 1 (15-ounce) box refrigerated pie crust (recommended: Pillsbury) 1 egg Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

For the duck: Score the duck breast in a 1/4-inch cross hatch, salt the skin and allow to sit skin-side down on a tray for 25 minutes. To cook the duck breasts, pat the skin dry and place the breasts skin-side down in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Begin to render the fat out of the skin. Allow the duck to roast for 18 to 20 minutes. Once the skin is golden brown, turn and tap the flesh side on the pan for a quick second, then return to the skin side and put into the hot oven for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the duck breasts from the pan and allow to rest for10 minutes before slicing into 1/2-inch-thick slices. For the potatoes: Place the cast-iron pan back over medium heat and add the thyme and fingerling potatoes. Once they begin to get color on them, after a couple of minutes, finish the potatoes in the oven and allow to cook until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the pan and set aside on a plate. For the jus: Add the duck stock and thyme to the pan, return it to the oven and allow to cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Pull the pan out of the oven and swirl in the butter and salt. For the vinaigrette: Add the orange juice, vinegar, Dijon, miso and thyme to the carafe of a high-speed blender. With the blender on, stream in the olive oil and grapeseed oil. Add the salt and pepper and set aside in a bowl. Fold in the sliced kumquats and cayenne and set aside. To serve: Line a platter with the radicchio and endive leaves. Place the sliced duck breasts over top of the chicories and top with the roasted potatoes and jus. Drizzle some of the vinaigrette over the platter and garnish with orange zest. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]</p><p>&quot; 36391,&quot;Chocolate-Espresso Martini 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 2/3 cup brewed espresso, chilled 2/3 cup coffee liqueur, such as Kahlua 2/3 cup vanilla-flavored vodka Ice Instructions: Combine the chocolate and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl and place over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth, 2 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Dip the rims of 4 martini glasses into the melted chocolate, allowing any excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl. Chill the glasses in the freezer for 10 minutes. In a pitcher, mix together the espresso, coffee liqueur and vodka. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. In batches, add the vodka mixture and shake for 10 seconds.

Skim to remove all the gray scum that will float to the surface, then let cook at a simmer for about 3 hours. Just keep tasting: when the broth tastes golden and chickeny, it&#39;s ready. Remove the chicken and, if you like, leave the soup to get cold to you can remove any fat that collects on the surface. That way you can accrue some schmaltz, too. Reheat the stock, and serve it as a plain soup, or add a few carrot sticks - from about 2 carrots, say - and cook in the soup, adding some torn-up pieces of chicken to warm through at the end. I like to add freshly chopped parsley. (You can also cook the Matzo Balls in the soup as well while it&#39;s heating up again.) Whisk the egg in a large-ish bowl, then whisk in the melted schmaltz (or whatever). Carry on whisking as you add the water or soup stock, the matzo meal and salt and pepper, and mix together into a rough paste; if it&#39;s too stiff to feel that it might be malleable later, add a little more water. Put in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour (or leave overnight if you wish) then dip out small lumps of paste and roll them into walnut-sized balls between the palms of your hands. Cook the dumplings in boiling, salted water and simmer for about 40 minutes (you can just cook them directly in the soup, but I&#39;ll do anything to preserve its unstarchy clearness). They are cooked when they rise to the surface.

Although the above amounts will make a fine mash, you&#39;re better off with these simple formulas. Try to hit a 2 to 1 ratio of russets to reds (by weight), and have at least 1/4 cup of dairy per pound of potatoes. You may not use it all, but it&#39;s good to know it&#39;s there. As for the garlic, use your best judgment. Combine potatoes in a large pot and just cover with hot tap water. Place over high heat and season water with 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, (it should taste like sea water). Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, combine dairy and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Keep this mixture barely simmering until the potatoes are done. As soon as the water comes to a boil, remove the lid and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until a potato chunk can easily be crushed with a pair of tongs. Drain, then return potatoes to the pan, return pot to heat and shake for 30 seconds so the surface water can evaporate. Remove pot and set on a towel or hot pads. Pour about half the garlic mixture into the potatoes and mash with an old-fashioned potato masher. Start tasting and looking at the consistency right away. If mashers seem dry or bland, add more of the garlic mixture. Avoid over mashing or you&#39;ll end up with gluey instead of fluffy Serve straight or garnish with any of the following: parsley, chopped scallions, crumbled bacon, sun dried tomatoes, (If you have the dry ones, make sure you re-hydrate them.) grated horseradish, horseradish sauce, pesto, more bacon, Sauteed mushrooms...use your imagination. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 36399,&quot;Cauliflower Stuffed with Saffron and Scallop Mousse 24 ounces cream 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets 1 pound bay scallops 1 egg 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (recommended: Tabasco) 1 tablespoon saffron steeped in 2 ounces white wine Salt and pepper Olive oil 1 leek washed, thinly sliced 4 baby fennel, cleaned, thinly sliced 4 cups baby greens Instructions: Bring the cream to a simmer in a large saucepan.

Place the peppers on a cookie sheet and season with salt and pepper. Roast the peppers for 15 minutes, turning periodically with tongs, so they are really charred and blistered on all sides. Put the peppers into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and steam for about 10 minutes to loosen the skins. Pull out the cores and seeds from the peppers and peel off the blackened skins; coarsely chop the peppers into chunks and set aside. Season the flour with the garlic powder, dried oregano, and a fair amount of salt and pepper. Whisk the egg and milk together in a shallow bowl. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour and tap off the excess. Dip each piece in the egg wash to coat, then dredge again in the flour. Place a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat and pour in about 1/4-inch of oil. Pan-fry the chicken in batches, skin-side down, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over and brown the other side about 3 minutes longer. Remove the chicken to a side plate; it will not be completely cooked. Carefully pour out the oil from the skillet and add 1/4 cup of clean olive oil. Put the pan back on the stove over medium heat. Add the anchovies, red pepper flakes, garlic, onion, tomatoes, lemon slices, capers, 1/2 of the roasted red peppers, and 1/2 of the basil; season with salt and pepper. This part of the recipe is going to be your base. What we are looking for is a fragrant vegetable pulp, so simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring often, until everything breaks down. Add the remaining roasted peppers and basil. Tuck the chicken into the stew and pour in the wine and chicken broth. Transfer the chicken cacciatore to the hot oven and cook for 20 to 30 minutes until the chicken is cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 36404,&quot;Homemade Croissants 4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3/4 cup milk 1/3 cup sugar 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon instant yeast 2 1/4 teaspoons fine salt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 2 1/2 sticks (10 ounces), chilled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 large egg Instructions: Combine the flour, milk, sugar, yeast, salt, 3 tablespoons room-temperature butter and 1/2 cup cold water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and continue to mix until completely combined and gathered into a ball that is no longer sticky to the touch, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured baking sheet, dust the top with flour and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight. The following day, put the remaining cold butter pieces (2 1/2 sticks) in the middle of a piece of parchment and dust with a generous pinch of flour. Top with another piece of parchment. With a rolling pin, pound the butter to form a 7-inch square, using a bench scraper or ruler to help even out the sides. Refrigerate while you roll out the dough. To roll and fold the dough: Unwrap the dough and lay it on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a 12-inch square, dusting with flour as needed. Peel the parchment off the butter square and position the butter in the middle of the dough. Fold the top flap of dough over the butter towards you, stretching it slightly so that it reaches just past the center of the butter. Repeat with the opposite flap so they overlap by a couple inches. Turn the dough so that one of the open ends is closest to you. Using the rolling pin, gently pound the dough so the butter is spread out evenly in the middle of the dough. Then, roll the dough to an 8-by-24-inch rectangle. Pick up one short end of the dough and fold it back over the dough, leaving one-third of the other end of dough exposed. Then fold the exposed dough over the folded side (like folding a letter). Put the dough back on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and chill so the dough relaxes and the butter firms slightly, 20 to 30 minutes.<br> Lay the dough on a lightly floured work surface folded-side down. Roll in the direction of the 2 open ends, until the dough is about an 8-by-24-inch rectangle. Fold the dough in thirds again like a letter, put back on the baking sheet, cover and chill for another 20 minutes.<br> Give the dough a third rolling, then fold one side to the middle of the dough and fold the other side to meet it in the middle. Fold the dough in half so it resembles a book. Put the dough on the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap, tucking the plastic under all sides. Refrigerate for 2 hours and up to overnight. To divide the dough: Unwrap the dough and lightly flour the top and bottom. Roll the dough into a 10-by-35-inch rectangle. Lay the dough in front of you so the long sides are horizontal. Position a ruler lengthwise along the bottom side of the dough (the side closest to you) and mark with a paring knife every 5 inches along the length of the dough. Move the ruler to the top side of the dough (the side farthest from you) and make a mark on the dough at 2 1/2 inches. Move the ruler to the 2 1/2-inch mark, then make marks every 5 inches along the length of the dough from that point.<br> Using a pizza cutter or long sharp knife, make a diagonal cut from the bottom left corner to the first mark on the top edge (at 2 1/2 inches), then cut diagonally down from that mark to the first 5-inch mark on the bottom edge of the dough, to make a triangle. Continue cutting diagonally from bottom mark to top mark and back again to create 15 triangles total (2 will be from the ends and a little smaller but still useable). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Lay one triangle on the work surface with the short side closest to you. Gently pull to extend the tip at the top. With one hand on each side of the short end of the triangle, start to roll the dough away from you towards the pointed end. Press down on the dough with enough force to make the layers stick together. Arrange the croissant on one of the lined baking sheets with the tip of the dough on the bottom. Repeat with the remaining dough triangles. Whisk the egg with a splash of water in a small bowl until combined. Lightly brush some of the egg wash on each croissant. (Refrigerate the remaining egg wash for later.) Put the croissants in a warm spot to proof, until puffy looking and about 1 1/2 times larger, about 2 hours. Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F.<br> Brush the croissants again with the egg wash. Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the sheets from front to back and top to bottom. Continue baking until dark golden, another 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets on wire racks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 36405,&quot;Heaven Waffle 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3/4 cup light, unflavored corn syrup 3 egg whites, preferably at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 2 teaspoons apple extract (or vanilla or whatever flavor you\\u2019d like) 1 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice 32 hard cookies, crumbled (we use a European Biscoff style) 1 tablespoon clarified butter or ghee, melted 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 tablespoon unrefined coconut oil, melted 1 1/2 teaspoons ground Ceylon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream 2 cups heavy whipping cream 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 tablespoon pure Mexican vanilla extract 2 1/3 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons unpacked light brown sugar 3 tablespoons ground Ceylon cinnamon 3 tablespoons double-acting baking powder 2 tablespoons dehydrated apple powder 1 tablespoon powdered vanilla extract or 2 teaspoons wet vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups unsweetened, plain almond milk or water 1/2 cup unrefined coconut oil, melted Bananas and chocolate salted caramel sauce, for serving Instructions: For the fluffy marshmallow: In a heavy bottomed saucepan, place the granulated sugar, corn syrup and 1/3 cup water. Stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved, then stop stirring and don\\u2019t stir again. Insert a candy thermometer and simmer over medium heat until the temperature reaches the softball stage or about 240 degrees F. Place the egg whites and cream of tartar into a mixer and whisk on medium-high speed until the whites create soft peaks, about 6 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly pour in the simple syrup to avoid splashing. Increase the speed to medium-high and whisk until the desired consistency (the mixture will initially steam but we mix until the steam goes away and the fluff becomes sticky). Reduce the speed to low, then add the extract and continue whisking for another minute. Use a spatula to remove from the mixer and set aside in a bowl. For the golden syrup: In a heavy bottomed saucepan, place the granulated sugar and 1/4 cup water. Stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Bring to a medium boil, avoiding the sugar crystals that may form on the side of the pan. Add the lemon juice, stir, reduce the heat to a low simmer and insert a candy thermometer. Do not stir the mixture again. Simmer over medium heat until the temperature reaches the softball stage or about 240 degrees F. Remove from the heat and set aside in a warm place, being careful not to touch as it will burn. For the cookie butter: Place the cookies in a food processor and crumble them finely. Place the crumbled cookies, clarified butter, canola, coconut oil, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, 6 tablespoons water and 6 tablespoons golden syrup in a mixer bowl. Turn the mixer on medium speed and slowly pour in the heavy cream. Turn the mixer to medium-high and beat until the mixture is creamy, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula to remove from the mixer and set aside in a bowl. For the whipped cream: Place the heavy cream, granulated sugar and vanilla extract in a mixer bowl and mix on high speed until thickened, about 3 minutes. For the waffles: Preheat a Belgian-style waffle iron. Whisk the flour together with the granulated and brown sugars, cinnamon, baking powder, apple powder and vanilla powder in a medium bowl (if using wet vanilla extract, add it to the wet ingredients, not the dry). In a separate medium bowl, add the almond milk and coconut oil, then whisk in the dry mixture. Using a 1/3-cup scoop, pour the batter into the waffle iron and cook according to the factory instructions. Repeat with the remaining batter. Cool the waffles on a cookie rack for 1 to 2 minutes. To assemble the heaven waffle: Use a spatula to place a thin layer of fluffy marshmallow on each waffle, basically filling in the pockets of the waffle. Slice a banana and place the slices in a circle on top of the marshmallow. Spoon some cookie butter on the middle of the waffle, then add a scoop of whipped cream using an ice cream scoop.

In a mixing bowl, combine the green onions, celery, sugar, shrimp, white onions, cilantro, mushrooms and pork together. Mix thoroughly. Season with salt, pepper, and fish sauce. Slice the wing along the bone in order to leave the skin and meat attached. Sever the first joint of the chicken wing and remove the bones. Holding tight to keep the joint intact, slide the knife along the underside of the skin and separate all the way to the joint. Season each chicken wing inside and out with Creole seasoning. Roll back the skin, remove the bones and cup the edges of the skin to begin stuffing the forcemeat into the cavity. Stuff the entire section of the skin and lop the leftover meat and skin over the top to \\close\\ the wing. Place the wings on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the wings from the oven and cool completely. Season the flour with Creole seasoning. Dredge the wings in seasoned flour. Preheat the fryer. Carefully lay the wings in the hot oil and fry 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Fry the wings in batches. Remove and drain on a paper towels. Season with Creole seasoning. Arrange the wings on top of the lettuce. Drizzle the sauce over the wings and lettuce. Garnish with parsley and chopped peanuts. Serve warm. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container. Recipe from \\New New Orleans Cooking, by Emeril Lagasse and Jessie Tirsch.

Melt the butter in a 3-quart saucier over medium heat. Stir in the onion, bell pepper and 2 pinches of salt. Decrease the heat to low and sweat until the onion is translucent and aromatic but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Increase the heat to medium and add the rice. Cook, stirring frequently, until you smell nuts, another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the saffron and its water, the broth, orange zest, bay leaves and the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Increase the heat and bring to a boil. OK, now the weird part: Thoroughly wet a clean towel, kill the heat, scatter the peas on top of the rice, then place the towel across the top of the saucier. Top with the lid, then fold the towel corners up over the lid. Transfer the saucier (towel and all) to the oven and bake 15 minutes. Remove and rest at room temperature for 15 more minutes without opening the lid. Fish out the orange zest and bay leaves. Turn the pilaf out onto a platter, fluff with a large fork and garnish with the raisins and pistachios. Serve family-style, right in the middle of the table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 36409,&quot;Yellow Cakes in a Jar with Chocolate Ganache 1 stick butter, softened 1/2 cup sugar 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup half-and-half Vegetable nonstick spray 1/4 cup half-and-half 1/2 cup chocolate chips Instructions: For the yellow cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness. When the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the two corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear. Using tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Slide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired. Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it&#39;s shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 36465,&quot;Salmon Tacos 1 tablespoon chili powder 1 tablespoon salt<br> 1 tablespoon brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon cumin<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon coriander<br> Pinch cayenne<br> 2 1/2 pounds salmon fillet<br> 1 cup apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup 80/20 blend oil<br> 1/4 cup soy sauce<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 1 tablespoon lime juice<br> 1 1/2 pounds cabbage, shredded<br> 1 cup julienned carrots 1/2 cup chopped scallions 12 flour tortillas 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil<br> 6 lime wedges<br> Instructions: For the salmon: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, salt, brown sugar, cumin, pepper, coriander and cayenne. Sprinkle the salmon fillet with a generously with the spice mix and rest the fish for 1 hour. Roast the salmon in the oven until fully cooked, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the salmon from the oven and cool slightly. Flake the salmon into medium chunks and season with salt and pepper. For the slaw: In a bowl, combine the vinegar, oil, soy sauce, sugar and lime juice, and whisk until the sugar dissolves. Add the cabbage, carrots and scallions, and mix well to coat all of the slaw with the dressing. Refrigerate the slaw for at least 1 hour before using. For plating: Heat a cast-iron griddle over high heat until the griddle begins to smoke. Warm the tortillas on the griddle without any oil, just until they are pliable. Heat the oil on the griddle and add the flaked salmon to bring back up to temperature if the salmon has cooled. (If the salmon is hot out of the oven skip this step.) Place about 3 ounces of flaked salmon in the center of each tortilla and top with 2 ounces of slaw. Plate 2 tacos with a lime wedge for each serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 36466,&quot;Deviled Tomatoes 6 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 cup chopped red onion 1 cup chopped green bell pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced 3 large tomatoes, halved 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 slices sourdough bread, toasted 3/4 cup shredded pepper jack cheese Instructions: In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crisp, about 6 minutes.

Add the mixed cheese (except for the Parmesan and Cheddar) slowly while stirring. Once all the cheese is in, you will begin to see a nice sauce come to life. Continue to cook, stirring, about 15 minutes. Add the Parmesan at the very end. This cheese is like glue; it holds the sauce and the pasta together. While the cheese sauce simmers, bring a large pot of water with 1/4 cup salt to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain and add a touch of olive oil to keep the pasta from sticking. The pasta is now ready to soak up the cheese sauce. Return the pasta to the pot and stir in the cheese sauce. For the sandwich: Preheat a flattop to 350 degrees F. Place the Cheddar slices and lobster if using in between the bread slices and close the sandwich. Ladle some clarified butter onto the flattop.

Whole-wheat flour blends in seamlessly because its nutty flavor complements the walnuts. Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350degreesF. Coat a 10-inch (12-cup) Bundt pan, preferably nonstick, with cooking spray. Spread walnuts in a small baking pan and toast in the oven until fragrant, 4 to 6 minutes. Let cool. Place walnuts, whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a food processor; process until walnuts are finely ground. Combine buttermilk, oil, rosemary, vanilla and lemon zest in a glass measuring cup. Place eggs, egg whites and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on high speed for 5 minutes. The mixture should be thickened and pale. With a rubber spatula, alternately fold the dry ingredients and buttermilk mixture into the egg mixture, making 3 additions of the dry and 2 additions of liquid. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, spreading evenly. Bake the cake until the top springs back when touched lightly and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Loosen the edges and turn the cake out onto the rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make Vanilla Cream. To serve, set the cake on a platter and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. Garnish with berries and rosemary sprigs. Serve each piece with a dollop of Vanilla Cream and some berries. Recipe Tips &amp; Notes: 1. Ingredient notes: 2. Whole-wheat pastry flour is milled from soft wheat. It contains less gluten than regular whole-wheat flour and helps ensure a tender result in delicate baked goods while providing the nutritional benefits of whole grains. Store in the freezer. Available in large supermarkets and in natural-foods stores. 3. Dried egg whites are pasteurized so this product is a wise choice in dishes that call for an uncooked meringue. They are also convenient in recipes calling for egg whites because there is no waste. Look for brands like Just Whites in the baking or natural-foods section of most supermarkets. 5. To bring cold eggs to room temperature quickly, place in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes; they will beat to a greater volume. 6. To separate eggs safely: Use an egg separator, an inexpensive gadget found in cookware stores; separating eggs the traditional way, by passing the yolk back and forth between pieces of egg shell or your hands, can expose eggs to bacteria.

Whisk egg yolk and vinegar together in a small cup or bowl and add ice water. In a food processor, pulse flour, salt and butter until a course, crumbly meal forms. Add liquid and quickly run processor just until a ball of dough forms. Immediately stop processor, remove dough and flatten into a disk. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or until ready to use. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Put rockfish on a lightly greased sheet pan and season with lemon zest, lemon juice, salt and crab boil seasoning, to taste. Roast until fish is firm to the touch and flakes easily, about 15 to 20 minutes depending on thickness of fillets. Set aside. Remove galette dough from refrigerator, lightly dust with flour and roll out to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Using a 1 1/2 to 2\\ cookie cutter, or a lightly floured glass, cut dough into circles and put on a lightly greased baking sheet. Score each circle with the tines of a fork and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown. If the galettes are puffing up too much, put a second, ungreased cookie sheet on top of the first to weight the dough down slightly. Remove galettes from oven and top with warm flaked rockfish, truffle oil and chives (if using). Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 36501,&quot;Green Goddess Dressing 1 cup mayonnaise 1/3 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 cup packed fresh basil leaves 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 4 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons fresh chopped tarragon 1 clove garlic, peeled and roughly chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> Crudite, such as blanched radish, cauliflower, broccoli and sugar snap peas, for serving Mixed field green salad, for serving Instructions: Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, basil, parsley, chives, tarragon and garlic, processing until smooth and scraping down the sides as necessary.

Combine the butter, peanut butter and brown sugar in another medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the flour mixture and blend until just combined. Shape the dough into a log: Place it onto a piece of plastic wrap about 18 inches long. Use your hands to pat the dough into a log about 7 inches long and 2 inches around. Roll the plastic wrap around the dough. Twist both ends of the wrap, like a candy, and tighten both sides until the dough log is compact and tightly wrapped (this might cause the dough to shrink down to a 6-inch log instead of a 7-inch log, but that is okay). Tuck the twisted ends under the dough and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. When ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and arrange 2 racks in the middle of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the plastic wrap from the dough and use a sharp knife to slice the dough into 1/8-inch-thick rounds. Place the rounds about 1 inch apart on the baking sheets, about 12 cookies per baking sheet. Press a halved peanut in to the center of each cookie. If the dough is still very cold, it might crack slightly around the peanut. Simply use your finger to lightly push the dough back together. Bake the cookies until the edges are very lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Halfway through cooking, rotate the baking sheets front to back and top to bottom. Cool the cookies slightly on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, and then transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely. Sandwich the cooled cookies between large scoops of your favorite ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 36504,&quot;Bella Bella Bellini Half of a 15-ounce can (about 1 cup) sliced peaches in juice, drained<br> 16 fresh raspberries 1 (750-ml.) bottle sparkling white wine, chilled Instructions: Put peaches in a small food processor or blender, and pulse until pureed.

Put the flour mixture in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the butter and shortening and pulse about 10 times, or until the butter is in the size of peas. Add the ice water and process until the dough comes together. Dump on a well-floured board and form into a disk. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out the dough and fit into 4 (4 1/2-inch) tart pans with removable sides. Don&#39;t stretch the dough when placing it in the pans or it will shrink during baking. Cut off the excess by rolling the pin across the top of each pan. Line the tart shells with a piece of buttered aluminum foil, butter side down, and fill them with dried beans or rice. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the beans and foil, prick the bottom of the shells all over with a fork, and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until lightly browned. Set aside to cool. Before serving, fill the tart shells with the pastry cream. Arrange the berries decoratively on top of the cream. Melt the apricot jelly with 1 teaspoon of water and brush the top of the tarts. Sprinkle with pistachios, if using, and serve. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the egg yolks and sugar on medium-high speed for 4 minutes, or until very thick. Reduce to low speed, and add the cornstarch.

Saut until the vegetables are tender, but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the sauerkraut and garlic and cook while stirring to release the steam and moisture from the pot. Add the stock. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer over medium heat. Add the heavy cream and cook further until the liquid slightly reduces, 15 to 18 minutes. Use a blender or immersion blender to blitz the soup until smooth. Finish and serve. Preheat the broiler to low heat. Put 4 broiler-safe bowls (I use my French onion soup crocks) onto a sheet pan. Divide the corned beef and soup equally between the bowls, then top with croutons and cheese. Place on the top rack of the oven beneath the broiler and broil until the cheese melts and bubbles a bit, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and serve with a drizzle of the chilled sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 36517,&quot;Greek Saganaki 1 cup kalamata olives 8 (1/2-inch) slices kasseri cheese (about 1 1/2 ounces each) Salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 cups brandy, or enough to cover cheese slices 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 tablespoons butter 3 to 4 tablespoons lemon juice 4 rounds of pita bread, brushed with olive oil, grilled and quartered Instructions: Season both sides of the cheese with salt and pepper.

Spread the pistachios out on a baking sheet and bake until golden and toasted, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a heat-safe plate to cool, then pulse them in a food processor until very finely ground. Transfer the ground pistachios to a small bowl and set aside. Set a 9-inch springform pan on top of a piece of parchment paper and trace a circle around it. Cut out the circle and set aside. Generously grease the bottom and sides of the pan with the room temperature butter, then press the parchment circle into the bottom of the pan. Put the ricotta and 2/3 cup sugar in the bowl of food processor and process until the mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer the ricotta mixture to a large bowl and whisk in the eggs yolks, orange zest and juice and the vanilla. In another large bowl, add the egg whites and whip using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the eggs become foamy. Sprinkle in the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and continue to whip the egg whites until medium peaks form, about 2 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the ricotta mixture until just incorporated and a few white streaks remain. Gently fold in the remaining whipped egg whites, folding until there are no white streaks remaining. Pour the mixture into the prepared springform pan and set it on a baking sheet. Bake until the cheesecake is light golden brown and the sides begin to pull away from the pan, 55 minutes to about 1 hour and 5 minutes. Transfer the cheesecake to a cooling rack and let it cool completely, about 1 hour. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 2 days before serving. To serve, run a thin knife or spatula around the cake to release it from the sides, then unclasp the latch of the pan.

Off the heat, mash the beans to a smooth paste with a potato masher, leaving some beans partially mashed to add some texture. The beans should have the consistency of a thick sauce; if they&#39;re difficult to stir, they&#39;re too thick. If needed, thin the beans out with extra chicken stock, 1 tablespoon at a time. Finish by stirring in the lime juice and adding salt to taste.

Add the oil when the pan has warmed through. Then add the ground beef, breaking it up as much as possible so the beef can brown. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Cook until all the meat has browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer the meat to a bowl. Dice the onion and mix with the meat. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour (it&#39;s easier to create the samosa pocket with cold meat). When the meat is cool, you&#39;re ready to assemble and cook. Create the flour paste by mixing the flour with the water. Add more water or flour until you have a gluey consistency. Slice the cheese into 1/2-inch strips. Cut the egg roll wrappers down the middle so you create two long rectangles. Drape a damp paper towel over the egg roll wrappers so they don&#39;t dry out while you&#39;re working. Lay an egg roll wrapper on a clean working surface, the long side facing you. Bring the bottom left corner to the top edge of the wrapper, creating a triangle shape on the left side. Flip the triangle along the right edge of the triangle, so the triangle is sitting on top of flat surface of the wrapper. Keep wrapping in this fashion until you reach the edge. You should have a cone shape with a single flap with two layers of wrapper. Hold the cone in your hand, with the flaps to the back against your fingers and the front seam behind your thumb. Use the flour paste to seal the front seam under your thumb. Stuff the shape with 2 cheese slices and some of the beef and onion mixture. Seal the samosa shut by tucking the interior flap over the filling, then sealing the outer flap to the outside of the samosa with flour paste. Keep assembling until you run out of meat. Heat 2 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven to 375 degrees F. Deep fry in batches until the skin is golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Mix the ketchup, soy sauce and lemon juice. Serve alongside the samosas. Sprinkle the samosas and ketchup with sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 36569,&quot;Gazpacho and Seafood Cocktail with Flavored Popcorn 1/2 cup popping corn Drizzle olive oil Salt 3 cups tomato juice or tomato vegetable juice blend 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 cup (1/2 bulb) finely diced fennel 1 cup (1 medium) finely diced, peeled, seeded cucumber 1/2 cup (1/2 small) finely diced red onion 1/2 cup (2 medium stalks) finely diced celery Gray salt Fresh coarsely ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 8 ounces halibut fillet, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 to 3 tablespoons minced, seeded jalapeno 8 ounces medium shrimp, peeled, de-veined, and cut into 1-inch pieces 1 can (6.5 ounces) clam juice 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 pint tiny, ripe cherry tomatoes (preferably Sweet 100s), each quartered 2 tablespoons finely chopped fennel fronds 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh basil leaves 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar Instructions: Pop the popcorn, season it with a drizzle of olive oil and salt, and set aside.

Place the sweet potato on a baking sheet and bake until soft, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool, then peel it. Meanwhile, heat a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and heat until just hot. Add the carrots, celery, onion and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions just turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and bay leaf and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are nice and brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes with their juices and cayenne, then stir in the broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer until the carrots are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Add the roasted sweet potato. Using a blender, puree the soup until silky smooth. Return the soup to the skillet and heat on low. Stir in the cream. For a thinner soup, stir in more broth. Season to taste and serve hot with the micro basil and Croutons. To the bowl of a food processor, add the basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan, lemon zest and salt. Pulse until the mixture forms a chunky paste, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl occasionally. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a steady stream. Keep processing until the desired consistency is reached, pulsing less for a more coarse pesto and more for a smooth one. Season to taste. To make the sandwiches: Spread some pesto on 1 side of 2 slices of bread. Arrange a slice of Cheddar over the pesto on 1 slice of bread. Sandwich with the other slice of the bread, pesto-side down. Repeat with remaining pesto, bread and Cheddar. Mix the butter and mayo together in a small bowl. Spread a generous layer on both sides of each sandwich. Place the sandwich in a nonstick skillet and turn the heat to medium-low. Cook, turning occasionally, until the bread is nice and toasty and golden brown, the cheese is melty and the sandwich is heated through. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches. Cut into croutons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 36583,&quot;Vanilla Bean Lemonade 1 cup fresh lemon juice 3/4 cup Simple Syrup, recipe follows 2 tablespoons vanilla bean paste 8 cups (2 quarts) cold sparkling water Crushed ice Fresh basil or mint leaves, for garnish Lemon slices, for garnish 3/4 cup sugar 3/4 cup water Instructions: Whisk together the lemon juice, Simple Syrup and vanilla bean paste in a large pitcher.

Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, nutmeg and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside. Beat the butter and sugar together, in a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then the vanilla, beating until smooth. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in half of the flour mixture until just combined. Add the sour cream, mixing to combine, and then the rest of the flour. Beat until well combined, taking care not to overmix. Stir in the chopped apples. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, filling them almost halfway full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cupcakes comes out clean and the tops spring back when pressed gently, about 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the tin on a rack for 10 minutes then remove from the tin and cool completely. Transfer the cooled cupcakes to a baking sheet. Preheat broiler on low. Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Whisk together the egg whites, sugar, lemon juice and zest, cream of tartar and salt in a heat-safe bowl. Set the bowl over the saucepan, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Continue whisking until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and beat, using an electric mixer at medium-high speed, until the meringue is cool and holds a stiff peak, about 7 minutes. Using a spoon, offset spatula or piping bag, dollop, spread or pipe the meringue on top of each cupcake. Use the back of a spoon to create peaks and valleys in the frosting as desired. Working in batches, place the cupcakes under the broiler and cook until the meringue is browned in spots, 1 to 2 minutes, watching carefully to avoid burning. Let cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 36585,&quot;Herb Roasted Pork with Honey Dijon Mustard 1 pound pork tenderloin 1/2 cup honey Dijon mustard, divided (recommended: French&#39;s) 3 tablespoons fines herbs (recommended: Spice Islands) 1/2 cup organic chicken broth (recommended: Swanson) 1 cup frozen pearl onions (recommended: C and W) Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Coat the lamb on both sides with the marinade and enclose it in a plastic bag. Let the lamb marinate, chilled, turning it several times if possible, overnight. Alternatively, let the lamb marinate at room temperature, turning it several times, for 3 to 4 hours. Grill the lamb boned side up on a very clean rack 2 to 3 inches above glowing coals, basting it several times with the marinade for 5 to 6 minutes on each side, or until it is seared and charred lightly. Transfer the lamb in a shallow roasting pan to a warm oven (170 to 190 degrees) for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. (The lamb will continue to cook as it rests in the warm oven; at serving time a meat thermometer should register about 130 degrees for medium-rare meat.) Transfer the lamb to a carving board, and cut it into 1/4 inch slices. Arrange the slices on a heated platter, nap them with some of the remaining pan juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 36605,&quot;Black Bean Burgers 2 cups canned seasoned black beans, drained 1 cup seasoned breadcrumbs 1/4 cup grated onion 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 1 large egg Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Canola oil, for the pan 4 slices Swiss cheese 1/2 cup mayonnaise Hot sauce, to taste 4 burger buns, toasted Lettuce and sliced tomatoes, for topping Instructions: Using a fork, mash the beans in a medium bowl until they are mushy but still have some whole bean pieces throughout.

Rub a little more butter onto the paper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a double boiler, melt the chocolate over simmering water, stirring occasionally, and set aside to cool. Sift the flour together with the sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In the bowl of an electric mixer or with a handheld mixer, beat the butter until it is fluffy. Add the flour mixture, 3/4 cup of the buttermilk, and the vanilla and beat in thoroughly, mixing for about 2 minutes with the electric mixer. Add the melted chocolate, eggs, and the remaining 1/4 cup of the buttermilk and beat for 1 minute longer. Pour an equal amount of the cake batter into each prepared pan and bake on the center rack of the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cakes in their pans for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a cake rack and finish cooling. With a soft pastry brush, brush any loose crumbs from the side edges of the cake layers. To make the marmalade, combine the milk, sugar, egg yolks, and butter in a medium saucepan. Over medium heat cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens, about 10 minutes. Do not let the mixture come to a boil. Remove from the heat and add the coconut and pecans. Stir together well, then let cool almost to room temperature, beating occasionally so that it does not form a crust. To assemble the cake, place the first layer of cake on a serving dish. Spread a layer of the marmalade on the top of the cake only, about 1/2 inch thick. Place the second layer of the cake on top of the first and spread the top of it with some of the marmalade. Finally, place the third cake layer on the top and spread a nice, thick, and slightly rounded layer of the marmalade on top of that.

Place the artichokes on a cutting board. With a sharp chef&#39;s knife, trim the stem ends off until the bottom is flat. This way, the artichokes can sit upright. Cut the top third from each artichoke and discard. With kitchen scissors, cut the pointed tip from each of the remaining outer leaves. Discard. Rub the cut areas with the lemon halves. Squeeze any remaining juice from the lemon halves and add the juice to the boiling water along with the juiced lemon halves themselves. Using a slotted spoon or skimmer, carefully add the artichokes to the boiling water. Top with a heavy pot lid or heat-proof baking dish that will fit inside the pot, so that the weight will keep the artichokes submerged in the water. This is a bit tricky. Be sure to have an adult help with this. Lower the heat and cook at a slow boil until the artichokes are tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. With oven mitts or pot holders, carefully remove the lid or weighted dish from the top of the artichokes. With a slotted spoon or skimmer, and with a small bowl or dish held underneath to catch the hot water, carefully transfer the artichokes to a colander set in a sink. With tongs, turn each artichoke upside down and place in the colander. Let drain, inverted, until cool enough to handle. To make the lemon-butter sauce, melt the butter over medium heat in a small saucepan. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and the remaining teaspoon of salt, and stir to combine.

Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the edges of each won ton wrapper. Put about a teaspoon of the chocolate-hazelnut spread in the center of each wrapper and top with 1 to 2 teaspoons of the banana mixture. Fold 1 corner of each won ton wrapper diagonally over the filling to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Fill a large heavy-bottomed saucepan with about 3/4-inch oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 375 degrees F. (If you dont have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 2 minutes.) Fry the ravioli, 2 or 3 at a time, turning occasionally, until golden, about 60 to 70 seconds. Drain on paper towels. Cool for 2 minutes and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 36702,&quot;Molded Chocolate Handbag 32 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered Powdered food color, as needed Cocoa butter, melted 16 ounces white chocolate, tempered<br> Instructions: To make the sides of the handbag, use a ladle to fill one of the side mold pieces with bittersweet chocolate. When it is full, empty the excess chocolate back into the bowl. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the plastic mold clean and place upside down on a wire rack over a sheet pan. Repeat using the other side of the mold. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip of the mold clean again with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold, and a clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden.<br> If the chocolate is properly tempered, it will easily release from the mold. To unmold, rest your thumbs on the outside, place your first two fingers on the inside of the bag and gently begin to lift the chocolate from the mold. Do not press or pull too hard or you will break the chocolate. You will need to apply this lifting pressure to all sides to loosen the chocolate from the mold. Repeat for all of the mold pieces. To make the body, use an offset spatula to spread a layer of chocolate onto the square textured plastic pieces of the handbag mold set. Be careful not to make it too thin or it will break when you bend it. Allow the chocolate to set slightly. Place each of the molded side pieces at one end of the square and carefully wrap the rest of the square up the side pieces.<br> When the chocolate has set, carefully peel away the plastic sheet. It should release from the chocolate quite easily. When you are ready to close the handbag, repeat the same procedure using the other flat textured piece. Be careful that you do not make this piece until after you have filled the bag with the desired contents. The handle is made using the same technique. To make the label, place a transfer sheet in front of you. Mix a little bit of red food coloring into the melted cocoa butter. Using a small pastry brush, apply a light layer of color to the transfer sheet and allow it to set briefly. Using an offset spatula, spread approximately a 1/4-inch thick layer of white chocolate over the color onto the transfer sheet, completely covering the design. Allow the chocolate to set. When the chocolate has set, carefully peel away the back of the transfer sheet. It should release from the chocolate quite easily. Using a hot, sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut out a label. To do this, heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \\cut\\ through the chocolate by melting it. Repeat to make as many labels as required. Set aside until ready to use. Carefully fill the handbag with the desired filling. Attach the piece that closes the bag (as described above). Use tempered chocolate to \\glue\\ the handle and label to the front. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.<br> One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.<br> The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.<br> A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 36703,&quot;Scallops with Mint Chutney 2 bunches fresh mint, leaves roughly chopped 2 serrano chiles, stemmed, seeded and ribs removed 1/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 pound sea scallops, cleaned Instructions: Puree the mint, chiles, coconut, 1/4 tablespoon water and lime juice in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Chill until ready to use. Pat the scallops dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat until hot. Cook the scallops until a golden brown crust forms, are just cooked through and release easily from the pan, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Serve the scallops topped with chutney. What Make This Recipe Really Sing: The heat of the chiles and the sweetness of the coconut and scallops give this dish great balance. When in season, try to find bay scallops, you will be surprised how sweet they are. BYOC: You don&#39;t like mint? Try adding cilantro or your favorite herb.

When the cookies are cool and the parfait is frozen, invert the parfaits onto the cookie bases and place back in the freezer (make sure the parfaits are centered on the cookie). For the meringue: Put the eggs whites and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk over a saucepan of simmering water until the sugar dissolves. Transfer the bowl to the mixer and whip on medium-high speed until you have firm glossy peaks. Place in a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch tip. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the parfaits from the freezer. Starting at the bottom of the cookie, working in circles, make meringue kisses until all of the parfait is covered. Put back in the freezer. When ready to serve, bake until golden brown. Drizzle with Rum Caramel Sauce and serve. Pour the cream into a 1-quart saucepan. Add the butter and bring to a simmer. Turn off the heat. Meanwhile, in a 2-quart saucepan, add the sugar and 2 tablespoons water. Swirl and let the sugar absorb the water. Heat over medium-high heat until it caramelizes (watching carefully) to a dark amber color. Turn off heat. Carefully pour the warm cream, a little at a time, being very careful to avoid any splattering caramel. Add salt, to taste. When all the cream has been added, mix well and pour into a container. Add rum, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 36710,&quot;Grilled Farmer&#39;s Market Paella 4 whole chicken legs (with thighs connected) 2 links sweet Italian sausage<br> 2 links hot Italian sausage<br> 4 tablespoons canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cups cooked rice (leftover rice works great)<br> 6 slices cooked bacon, chopped<br> 2 ears of corn, kernels cut from the cobs<br> 1 bunch scallions, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced<br> 1 zucchini, sliced 1/2 inch thick diagonally<br> 1 yellow squash, sliced 1/2 inch thick diagonally<br> 1 pint cherry tomatoes (yellow or red)<br> 6 sun-dried tomatoes, chopped<br> 1 cup minced fresh herbs (I used lemon basil, flat-leaf parsley and cilantro)<br> 1 lemon, zested and juiced<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium-high heat.

Add 2 teaspoons salt, the onion, thyme, oregano, bay leaves and peppercorns; cover and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the pork is tender, 1 hour, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Transfer the pork to a plate and shred. Strain and reserve the cooking liquid; keep warm. Meanwhile, soak the corn husks in a bowl of hot water, using a plate to keep them submerged, until pliable, 1 hour. Combine the pork, cumin, 1/3 cup chili powder, the garlic, flour, sugar, vegetable oil and 1 cup of the reserved cooking liquid in a large skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, make the dough: Mix the masa harina, lard, 2 teaspoons salt, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and 2 2/3 cups of the reserved cooking liquid in a bowl until combined. Drain the husks and pat dry. Starting 1/2 inch from the wide end, spread about 3 tablespoons of the dough down a husk, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the pork filling down the center of the dough, then fold in the sides of the husk, wrapping the dough around the filling. Fold up the narrow end of the husk. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough and filling. Set a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 1 to 2 inches of water. Arrange the tamales standing up in the steamer, folded-side down.

Bake the potatoes for 1 1/2 hours on a baking sheet; this removes water from the potatoes in order to have lighter, less dense gnocchi. Let cool. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the potatoes in half and scrape the insides into a mixing bowl. Using a ricer or potato masher, mash the potatoes. Add the flour, Parmesan, egg and some salt and pepper and mix until smooth. Flour a clean surface and roll the dough into long strips. Cut 1-inch pieces and boil for about 1 minute, until the gnocchi start to float. Remove with a slotted spoon. For the brown butter: In a saute pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat until foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the apricots and sage. Cook until the butter starts to brown, 8 to 10 minutes.

Let the mixture sit to allow the yeast to activate. The mixture should start foaming and forming small bubbles on the surface, 10 minutes. Gradually add the flour with the mixer on low speed. Add the olive oil and salt. Continue to mix on low and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Increase the speed as the flour becomes incorporated, and knead on medium speed, 7 to 8 minutes. The dough is done when it comes together as a single mass.<br> Remove the dough from the mixer and knead 4 to 5 times on a lightly-floured surface so the dough is smooth and consistent. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic and allow to sit until the dough rises and doubles in volume, 1 hour.<br> For the filling: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Divide the dough in half and, working with one piece at a time, stretch the dough into a 10-by-13-inch rectangle. Arrange the dough rectangle so the 13-inch-long side is closest to you. Brush the surface with half of the melted butter, then spread the minced garlic out evenly over the top, remembering to split the filling ingredient quantities evenly across both stromboli. Leave a 1-inch border around the far and side borders. Sprinkle the dough with the Parmesan, then layer with the salami slices. Top the salami with a layer of deli ham and then a layer of bresaola. Shingle the cheese slices over the top and finish with fresh basil and some ground black pepper. With the covered edge closest to you, roll the dough up into a log, gently sealing the ends of the roll as you go. When you get to the end that has no filling on it, gently press to seal, then place the roll seam-side down on a nonstick sheet tray. Repeat the process with second piece of dough. Brush the tops of the dough with the remaining melted butter and sprinkle with Parmesan. Bake in the center of the oven until golden brown and puffy, 25 to 30 minutes.<br> Allow the stromboli to cool 5 minutes before slicing it into thick slices with a serrated knife. Serve with the Marinara Sauce on the side or some mustard. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes.

Pour about 1/3 cup of the mixture over the ladyfingers in a shallow bowl, then toss and set aside. Gently beat with a handheld mixer the remaining espresso mixture and the remaining 4 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar into the mascarpone until smooth. Take care not to overbeat it or the mascarpone will be grainy. Using the same beaters (no need to clean them), beat the whipped cream to soft peaks and fold it into the mascarpone mixture. To assemble the tiramisu: Crumble half the soaked ladyfingers into four 8-ounce parfait or wine glasses. Spoon 1/4 cup of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers and press and spread gently with the back of the spoon to fill the spaces between the ladyfinger pieces. Repeat with remaining ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon ground chocolate over each tiramisu, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 36730,&quot;Winter Vegetable Terrine 2 medium beets (about 10 ounces), trimmed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 8- to 10-ounce delicata squash 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, plus more, for the pan 2 medium carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces 10 black peppercorns 1 1/2 cups dry white wine 2 leeks, white and light green parts, trimmed, sliced and well rinsed 2 stalks celery, sliced 1 shallot, thinly sliced 4 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley 3 sprigs fresh thyme Two 1/4-ounce envelopes or 4 1/2 teaspoons powdered gelatin 2/3 cup finely chopped fresh chives (about 1 large bunch) 4 cups mache or other baby lettuce Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Fleur de sel, for sprinkling Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Divide the beets between 2 sheets of heavy-duty foil and wrap to enclose. Put the wrapped beets on a baking sheet and roast until very tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Let the beets steam in the foil 15 minutes, then peel and cut into 3/4-inch pieces. Season generously with salt and pepper. Cool. Meanwhile, trim the squash, then halve lengthwise, scrape out the seeds and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices, leaving the skin intact. Toss the squash with the vegetable oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt on a baking sheet. Roast, flipping once, until tender, about 15 minutes. Cool. Put the carrots in a saucepan with the peppercorns, 1 3/4 teaspoons salt and 3 1/2 cups water. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook until the carrots are very tender, about 15 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the carrots to a bowl, reserving the pan and the cooking liquid. Add the wine, leeks, celery and shallot to the saucepan and bring back to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Add the parsley and thyme and simmer 10 minutes. Pour the vegetable stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a 1-quart glass measure or heatproof bowl; discard the solids. If the stock measures more than 2 1/2 cups, return to the saucepan and boil until reduced to 2 1/2 cups. If there is less, add water. Season the stock with salt and pepper. Stir the gelatin into 1/4 cup cold water and let stand 1 minute to soften, then add the gelatin to the hot stock, stirring until dissolved. Set aside. Very lightly oil a 4 1/2-by-8 1/2-inch terrine or glass loaf pan with vegetable oil, then line the long sides and bottom with a sheet of plastic wrap, smoothing out any wrinkles and allowing at least 2 inches of overhang on each side. Pour about 1/3 cup of the gelatin-stock mixture into the terrine and quick-chill in the freezer until just set, about 10 minutes. Arrange the beets in one layer over the gelatin layer then sprinkle with one-third of the chives. Arrange the carrots on top, leaving some space between them for the gelatin to fill and hold the vegetables together. Sprinkle half the remaining chives over the carrots, then top with a layer of squash. Sprinkle the remaining chives over the squash. Stir the remaining gelatin-stock mixture again, reserve 1/2 cup at room temperature, then slowly pour the remainder into the terrine, pushing down the vegetables if necessary to just submerge in the gelatin mixture. Chill, uncovered, until the top is set, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If the reserved 1/2 cup gelatin mixture has begun to set, heat until just liquefied but not hot, then pour over the set terrine. Chill until firm, about 2 hours. To serve, run a thin knife along the short sides of the terrine, then invert the terrine onto a cutting board, gently pulling on the plastic overhang to help unmold; discard the plastic. With a very sharp knife, carefully cut the terrine into 8 slices. Using a metal spatula to hold the outside of each slice steady, transfer 1 or 2 slices to each plate. Place the mache next to the terrine slices. Drizzle the olive oil over the mache and around the plates and then sprinkle the plates with fleur de sel and freshly ground pepper.

Put a baking sheet on the rack in the center of the oven and close the door. Drizzle both sides of the fish with olive oil and season the inside and outside with salt. Stuff the cavity with the lemon slices and the leftover fennel stalks and fronds. Open the oven door and carry the fish over squarely in both of your hands. Put the fish in the center of the hot sheet pan and quickly close the door so minimal heat escapes. You should hear the fish sizzle slightly as it hits the hot sheet pan. Reduce the heat to 450 degrees F and cook for about 20 to 25 minutes, then open the door to look at the fish. The eyes will turn white when it s cooked. Touch the fish near the head. It should feel fairly firm, if cooked. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and allow it to rest a few minutes as is. Use 2 spatulas, 1 under the head and the other under the midsection, to transfer the fish to a serving platter. Use a paring knife to gently cut around the head and the tail. Cut down the length of the back until you can insert 1 of your spatulas down the length of the top fillet and lift it off the bone. Then, lift the head and the full backbone off the fish, unveiling the second fillet. Season the fish with a pinch of salt and lemon juice. Serve with lemon slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Albari?o]&quot; 36734,&quot;Nutmeg Cheesecake 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 pounds fresh cream cheese, at room temperature 1 teaspoon fresh cream cheese, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 3/4 cups sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 4 eggs 1/3 cup graham cracker crumbs (available at large supermarkets, or pulse whole graham crackers in a food processor) Instructions: Thick brush a 9-inch springform pan with half of the melted butter and place in the freezer to harden, about 10 minutes.

Place the pan on a double-layer sheet of aluminum foil, with at least 3 inches of foil all around pan.<br> Fill a roasting pan large enough to hold the cake pan with hot water to a depth of about 1-inch, then lift the foil wrapped cake into the roasting pan, keeping the foil turned up so that it prevents water from overflowing or seeping into the cake. The foil should not be closed over the top of the cake. Be careful not to tear any holes in the foil.<br> Bake until the top of the cake is golden brown and dry to the touch, though still a bit soft in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. It should \\shimmy\\ a bit when you shake the pan; it will firm up more as it cools.<br> Remove the pan from the water bath, remove the foil, and let cool at room temperature 15 minutes. Refrigerate, uncovered, 2 hours before removing the cake from the pan.<br> To remove the cake from the pan, first remove the sides. Cover the surface the with plastic wrap. Place a large plate over the cake, then flip the cake over onto the plate, tapping if necessary to help the cake come away from the pan bottom. If tapping doesn&#39;t do the trick, try a blow torch or stove burner to warm the bottom of the pan to loosen it. Remove the pan bottom and evenly sprinkle the exposed surface with graham cracker crumbs. Place a serving plate over the crumbs and flip the cake again so that the crumbs form the bottom crust and the top is covered with plastic.

Set a wire rack on a baking sheet. Lay 1 turkey breast smooth-side down on a cutting board. There will be a thin side and a thick side. At about the midway point between them, slice horizontally into the thick side to within 2 inches of the outer edge so that you can open that side like a book and have 1 long piece. Pound the turkey with a mallet to an even thickness of about 1 inch. Repeat with the remaining breast. Place a large piece of parchment on a work surface. Arrange 12 slices of bacon horizontally on the parchment in 6 lines, with 2 slices of bacon slightly overlapping per line. Arrange the 6 lines so they are touching but not overlapping, with the ends lining up to form a rectangle. Working with the remaining 9 slices, weave the bacon in an over-under pattern by lifting alternating slices of the horizontal bacon lines and vertically placing a slice of bacon over or under as needed to create a woven lattice design.<br> Place the turkey breasts horizontally on the bacon, overlapping slightly. Scoop the stuffing into the center of the turkey. Holding the bacon and turkey, roll them up away from you, making sure the roll ends up seam-side down. (Use the parchment to help you keep the bacon and turkey together as you roll.) Tie with twine in 3 spots across the roll and once lengthwise. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.<br> Bake until the internal temperature registers 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 1 hour 40 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Slice and serve with the gravy and cranberry sauce.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 36752,&quot;Stuffed Roasted Strawberries 12 extra-large strawberries (the bigger the better!) 1 to 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 1 teaspoon sugar, optional Spray whipping cream (the real kind in the can in the dairy section) Cocoa powder, for garnishing Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Slice the tops of the berries off just below the stem. Cut the tips off (about 1/4-inch), so that the berries will sit upright. Next, use a small spoon or a melon ball scoop to hollow out the strawberries, working from their tops, in order to create a cavity in each one. Stuff some chocolate into the cavity of each strawberry and place them upright in a baking dish. Lightly sprinkle the berries with sugar, if using. Roast the berries until soft and the chocolate is melted, about 10 to 12 minutes. To serve, place 3 strawberries on a dessert plate in a triangle. If the berries have given off liquid in the baking dish, spoon it over them. Spray a small mound of cream in the center of the berries, and top each berry with a rosette of cream. Sift a little cocoa powder over the plate, and serve! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 36753,&quot;Warm Mango And Prawn Salad 4 1/3 ounces snow peas (mangetout) Two 10-ounce semi-ripe (but not green) mangos, peeled and julienned 1 handful mixed fresh mint, Vietnamese mint, basil and perilla leaves, sliced 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 3 red Asian shallots, thinly sliced One 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and julienned 1 pound large raw prawns, peeled and deveined, tails intact Juice of 2 limes Instructions: Bring a saucepan of water to a boil.

Heat 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and thyme and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and cook, stirring often toward the end, until dry and starting to form small crumbles, 25 to 28 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the cognac. Carefully return the skillet to the heat (the cognac may ignite) and continue cooking until the mushroom mixture is dry and the alcohol cooks off, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and season with kosher salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and let cool completely.<br> Meanwhile, season the beef all over with kosher salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a separate large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook, turning, until browned on all sides (including the ends), about 8 minutes. Transfer the beef to a rack and let cool.<br> Overlap 2 sheets of plastic wrap on a work surface to make a large rectangle (about 22 by 30 inches) with a short side in front of you. Arrange the prosciutto slices crosswise on the plastic wrap in overlapping rows to form a rectangle slightly longer than the beef and wide enough to completely wrap it with a slight overlap. (You might not use all of the prosciutto.) Spread the mushroom mixture over the prosciutto, pressing gently. Cut the ties off the beef and brush it all over with the mustard. Place the beef on top of the prosciutto-mushroom mixture, perpendicular to the prosciutto slices. Tightly roll the prosciutto-mushroom mixture around the beef, using the plastic wrap to help you roll. Twist and tie the ends of the plastic wrap to help the roast hold an even shape. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Roll the puff pastry into a 14-by-15-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface; if using 2 smaller sheets of pastry, press the ends together before rolling out, then trim as needed. Brush the pastry all over with the beaten egg. Remove the plastic wrap from the beef and place the beef on the pastry. Carefully roll the pastry around the beef, overlapping the ends at the seam; trim off any excess pastry, if needed, then pinch the seams together. Turn seam-side down. Fold in the pastry on the two open ends, trimming off any excess. Refrigerate until the pastry is cold and firm, about 1 hour. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 425? F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Place the beef seam-side down on the baking sheet and brush all over with the beaten egg. Score lines in the pastry with the dull side of a paring knife (don\\u2019t cut through the pastry) and sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until the pastry is crisp and dark golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the center of the beef registers 110? F for rare to 120? F for medium rare, 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer to a rack set on a baking sheet and let rest 15 minutes before slicing.

Working quickly to keep the dough from getting warm, thread the skewers, alternating sausage pieces (skewer them through the casings), tomatoes and dough squares (skewer them through opposite sides of each square, keeping them as flat as possible so they cook through). Leave 1/2 inch of the skewer at both ends empty. Each skewer should have 4 pieces each of sausage and dough and about 3 tomatoes. Grill the skewers, covered, until the tomatoes have dark grill lines and the dough squares have started to puff, 2 to 3 minutes. Put the prepared foil square on the grill, and transfer the skewers onto the foil cooked-side up, so that they are almost touching. Top with the mozzarella, and grill, covered, until the tomatoes are soft, the dough squares have doubled in size and the mozzarella has melted, 3 minutes more. Divide the skewers among 4 plates. Tear the basil leaves over the tops. Serve with the marinara sauce, for dipping, and pass the Parmesan and red pepper flakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 36776,&quot;Kale Mashed Potatoes 1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters 1/2 clove garlic, peeled 1/4 cup butter 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 1/2 cup milk or heavy cream, heated until warm 5 ounces frozen kale, cooked and squeezed dry Instructions: In a large pot with enough cold water to cover, place the potatoes and garlic.

Divide between two 1 1/2-cup bowls or ramekins; press into the bottoms and up the sides. Put the cream cheese in the medium bowl (no need to wipe clean); stir with a spatula. Add the heavy cream, lemon juice, vanilla and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar; mix until smooth. Spoon into the prepared bowls, cover and freeze until firm, about 2 hours. Remove the bowls from the freezer and run a knife around the cheesecakes; turn out onto a cutting board and roughly chop. Cover and keep frozen until ready to use. Meanwhile, make the blueberry sauce: Combine the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan; bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook, stirring occasionally, gently squashing the berries as they soften, until the mixture is thick and shiny, about 30 minutes. (You should have about 1 2/3 cups of sauce; cook slightly longer to reduce if necessary.) Transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate until cold. Make the ice cream: Put the heavy cream, cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, vanilla, lemon zest and salt in a food processor; process until very thick and fluffy. Layer the ice cream mixture, blueberry sauce and cheesecake bites in a shallow 2-quart baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing against the surface; freeze at least 3 hours. Let sit at room temperature 20 minutes before scooping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 36778,&quot;Angry Red Lentil Tortilla Soup 2 (6-inch) flour tortillas 4 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup minced onion 1/4 cup minced carrot 1 clove minced garlic 1/2 habanero pepper, minced 1/2 cup red lentils 2 cups water Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons dry chives, for garnish 6 tablespoons grated Manchego cheese, for garnish 2 lime wedges, for garnish Instructions: Campsite Instructions: Leave tortillas out a few days at room temperature, or on the trail, to allow them to dry out and become crispy. Place cooking vessel on camp stove over medium to medium-high heat. Add olive oil. Add onion, carrot, garlic, and habanero, cook until onions are caramelized. Add red lentils and toast for about 30 seconds. Add the water and cover the pot with a lid or camp plate. (I never bring a lid for a camp stove, a plate works great and then it&#39;s nice and hot to put your food on and saves weight.) Simmer the soup until lentils are tender, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the lentils from sticking. Mash the soup with a fork or wooden spoon against the sides of the pot, breaking up some of the lentils to thicken the soup. Season with salt and pepper. Rip up the tortillas and place in the bottom of 2 serving bowls or cups. Ladle soup over the tortillas and garnish with chives, cheese and lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 36779,&quot;Crispy Cornflake-Crusted Chicken Sliders 3 tablespoons buttermilk 3 tablespoons mayonnaise<br> 3 tablespoons sour cream<br> 1/2 teaspoon dried dill<br> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon paprika<br> 2 tablespoons finely sliced chives 1 teaspoon sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3 to 4 turns freshly ground black pepper<br> Pinch cayenne<br> 1/2 head cabbage, cored and finely sliced<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 cloves garlic, minced<br> 3 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley<br> 3 cups canola oil 1 cup buttermilk<br> 1/4 cup Sriracha sauce<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 2 teaspoons granulated garlic<br> 2 teaspoons granulated onion<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 cups cornflakes, crushed<br> 24 ounces chicken tenders (twelve 2-ounce tenders)<br> 12 slider buns, split 2 Roma tomatoes, sliced thin<br> 1 small red onion, sliced thin<br> Instructions: For the buttermilk slaw: In a medium bowl, combine the buttermilk, mayonnaise, sour cream, dill, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, chives, sugar, salt, pepper and cayenne. Whisk together until fully incorporated. Add the sliced cabbage and toss well. Cover and refrigerate. For the garlic butter: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the parsley, then transfer the mixture to a small bowl and set aside. For the chicken sliders: Heat the canola oil in a deep cast-iron skillet until it reaches 350 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Combine the buttermilk and Sriracha in a medium mixing bowl and mix well. In another medium bowl, mix together the flour, granulated garlic, granulated onion, salt and pepper. Place the cornflakes in a third bowl. Dredge the chicken tenders in the seasoned flour, lightly pressing down on the tenders to give them a more even shape. Remove the chicken from the flour with your left hand and lightly dip them in the Sriracha buttermilk. Shake off excess buttermilk and, with your right hand, roll the tenders in the cornflake crumbs, pressing the crumbs into the tenders until they are completely breaded. Set the breaded tenders on baking sheet as you go. In two batches, fry the tenders until golden brown on both sides, 6 to 7 minutes. When done, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to paper towels to drain. Brush the slider buns on both sides with garlic butter. Toast the buns, buttered-side down, in a large saute pan over medium heat until golden brown, 30 to 45 seconds. To build the sliders, layer the bottom buns with a slice of red onion, a slice of tomato and a chicken tender. Top with buttermilk slaw and cover with the bun top. Arrange the finished sliders on a serving platter and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 36780,&quot;Gougere 1 cup milk 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper Pinch of nutmeg 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour 4 large eggs, at room temperature 4 ounces Parmesan cheese, at room temperature, grated (about 1 cup, but you do need the correct weight here) 1 cup chopped ham 1 large egg, beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for brushing Additional grated Parmesan (about 2 tablespoons) for sprinkling (optional) Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch pie pan. Put the milk, butter, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a large, heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the butter has melted and the mixture comes to a full boil. Take the saucepan off the heat and add in the flour all at once, stirring hard with a wooden spoon. Return the pan to the heat. Stir vigorously and constantly for 2 to 3 minutes, until the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan. This recipe will give you good arm muscles. (There are recipes for making gougere in a food processor, but that involves a lot of sticky cleanup. A saucepan and spoon are actually easier in the long run.) Take the pan off the heat again (this time, turn off the burner). Beat the eggs, 1 at a time, into the hot dough, stirring vigorously after each addition until the egg is completely incorporated and the dough is smooth. The dough will be very stiff and thick. Beat in the Parmesan cheese. Fold in chopped ham. Scrape/pour the dough into the prepared pie pan. Brush with the egg-water mixture and sprinkle with the extra Parmesan cheese, if desired. Bake for 50 minutes without once opening the oven door. The gougere should be quite brown and puffy. Without taking it out of the oven, make a few slashes in the top with a sharp knife; this will let out some of the steam in the center and help the gougere stay puffy once it&#39;s out of the oven. Bake for 10 more minutes. Serve the gougere hot, at room temperature, or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 36781,&quot;Grilled Chicken and Chorizo with Spanish-Style Marinade 1/4 cup sherry wine vinegar 2 garlic cloves, pressed 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon pimenton Freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup olive oil 4 chicken thighs 4 chicken legs 1 pound Spanish-style chorizo sausages Paella Rice Salad, recipe follows 3 cups water 1 teaspoon kosher salt Large pinch saffron threads 1 1/2 cups arborio rice or short-grain white rice 1/2 cup sherry wine vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup fresh or frozen peas, cooked and cooled 2 red bell peppers, diced 1/2 cup packed fresh Italian parsley leaves, chopped 1 tablespoon dried oregano Instructions: In a measuring cup, whisk together vinegar, garlic, salt, oregano, pimenton, and pepper to taste. Add olive oil and whisk until blended. Place chicken in a large re-sealable plastic bag and pour in the vinegar mixture. Seal bag, then shake gently to coat chicken with marinade. Let chicken marinate at room temperature for 2 hours or refrigerate overnight. Prepare a fire in a barbecue and let coals burn down until covered with gray ash. Remove chicken from bag with tongs, shaking off excess marinade, and place skin-sides down on grill. Cook, turning as needed, until skin is crispy and meat near bone is no longer pink (cut with a knife to test), about 35 minutes. During last 10 minutes of barbecuing, add chorizo to grill and cook, turning until skin crackles and sausages are hot throughout, about 10 minutes. Cut sausages into portions to serve if necessary. Bring the water and salt to boil in a medium saucepan. When water is boiling, stir in pinch saffron. Add the rice, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is just tender (about 20 minutes). Meanwhile, in a large bowl, blend vinegar and mustard with a fork. Pour in olive oil in a thin stream, whisking with fork to emulsify. Stir in the peas, bell peppers, parsley, and oregano. When rice is cooked, add it to the bowl and stir well to distribute dressing and ingredients. Let rice cool to room temperature and serve.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the lime juice, soy sauce, sugar, garlic and cl until the sugar is dissolved. Add the beef, toss to coat and set aside. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until shimmering, about 1 minute. Then add the beef and cook, stirring, until cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside. Allow the liquid in the skillet to reduce until thickened, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms, spring onions and asparagus and cook until all the vegetables are tender-crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Return the beef to the skillet and toss to combine. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 36823,&quot;Peach Half-and-Half Cocktail 2 cups peach iced tea 2 cups lemonade<br> 1 cup vodka<br> 4 lemon wheels<br> 4 mint sprigs<br> Instructions: Fill 4 highball glasses with ice. Divide the peach iced tea, lemonade and vodka evenly among the glasses. Garnish each with a lemon wheel and mint sprig. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 36824,&quot;The Best Risotto 7 cups homemade chicken stock (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large shallot, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup) 2 cloves garlic, minced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 bay leaves 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cups arborio rice (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 cup dry white wine 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish Instructions: Warm the chicken stock in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, cover and keep warm while you make the risotto. Heat the olive oil in another medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the shallot, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and about 10 grinds of black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the bay leaves and 3 tablespoons butter, stirring until the butter has melted, about 1 minute. Add the rice and toast, stirring only once, until it smells nutty and starts to turn light golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the wine and simmer, stirring occasionally, until it has evaporated completely, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle one cup of the warm stock into the rice and cook, stirring gently without stopping, until the rice has absorbed the liquid, 2 to 3 minutes (you will know it&#39;s time to add more stock when you move the rice aside and no liquid pools in the center). Repeat this process, adding more stock a ladleful at a time, until the rice is al dente, 17 to 19 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. (You may have a little stock left over. If so, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week.) If you prefer your risotto on the saucier side, add more stock 1/4 cup at a time until the desired consistency is reached. Stir in the Parmesan, the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, 1 teaspoon salt and a few more grinds of black pepper and serve with more Parmesan, if desired.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 36825,&quot;Quinoa Salad 1/2 cup quinoa 1 cup water 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons orange juice 1 clove garlic, finely minced 2 scallions, thinly sliced 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger 2 tablespoons raisins 2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts 1 orange, peeled and coarsely chopped 1 cup chopped cooked chicken (optional) Salt and pepper Instructions: In a strainer rinse the quinoa under running water and drain. Combine the quinoa and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until all the of the water is absorbed. In a large bowl combine the remaining ingredients and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the quinoa and mix well. Serve chilled or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 36826,&quot;Stuffed Salmon in Flaky Dough 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/3 cup sliced shallots 1/2 pound wild or cultivated mushrooms (chanterelles, oyster, cremini, shiitake, or a mixture), thinly sliced (about 3 cups) 4 ounces shrimp, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons chopped chives 1 small salmon (about 5 pounds with head on), yeilding about 2 1/2 pounds of boneless, skinless salmon flesh 1 package store-bought puff pastry 1 large egg 1 cup chicken stock, plus 1/2 cup 1/2 teaspoon potato starch 3 egg yolks from large eggs 1/4 teaspoon salt Dash cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons lemon juice Instructions: To make the mushroom-shrimp stuffing: Heat the tablespoon of butter in a skillet. When it is hot but not smoking, add the shallots. Saute for about 1 minute, until the shallots have softened, then add the mushrooms, and cook over medium to high heat until they have released their juice. When that juice has evaporated and the mixture starts sizzling again, add the shrimp, and cook for about 1 minute, just long enough for the shrimp pieces to change color. Season with the pepper, salt, and chives. Cool. When ready to assemble the dish, line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. Roll the dough into a 16-inch square. Cut a 16-inch-long strip from the dough measuring 5 to 6-inches wide, and place it on the diagonal on the parchment paper. Place one of the salmon fillets on top, and sprinkle it lightly with salt and pepper. Spread the cooled mushroom-shrimp stuffing evenly on top, then cover the stuffing with the remaining salmon fillet. Take care to arrange the fillets so that the thinner part of the fillet on the bottom corresponds to the larger, thicker part of the fillet on top (tail to head and head to tail), and the shape and thickness are the same throughout. This way the salmon will cook evenly. Roll the remaining, wider strip of dough up onto your rolling pin, then unroll it on top of the second fillet. Brush off any flour from the surface of the dough, and press it all around the edges, so it conforms to the fish shape underneath. The large top layer of dough will stick around the edge to the layer of dough underneath. Press the two layers of dough gently around the edge so they adhere well together, then place in the freezer for about 10 minutes to firm up the dough. This will make trimming and decorating the \\fish\\ easier. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. After 10 minutes, remove the \\fish\\ from the freezer, and trim the excess dough all around the edge to create a fish outline with dorsal fins as well as a tail from the extra dough around the salmon. Make a gill with a strip of the trimmed dough, and cut and position a round piece of dough for the eye. Continue decorating as you fancy. Break the whole egg into a small bowl, and remove about half the white. Beat the remaining egg in the bowl with a fork to make a wash for coating the \\fish. Brush the salmon with the egg. Holding the tip from a pastry bag (large end down) at an angle, press it lightly into the \\fish\\ to simulate scales. Bake in the 375 degree F oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove and set aside, uncovered, in a warm place while you make the sauce. Foamy lemon sauce: Whisk together 1 cup of the chicken stock and the potato starch in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Whisk the egg yolks and the remaining chicken stock in a bowl, then pour into the hot stock, and whisk constantly over medium heat for about 2 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and foams, but don&#39;t let it boil. It should reach a temperature of 180 degrees, the temperature needed to cook the eggs and the starch and to thicken the sauce. Whisk in the salt and cayenne, then remove the saucepan from the heat, stir in the lemon juice, and set aside. The sauce should have doubled in volume. Using 2 long hamburger spatulas, transfer the \\fish\\ to a serving platter. To serve, cut into 1 to 1 1/2-inch slices, and arrange on warm individual plates. Spoon some sauce around the slices, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 36827,&quot;Speedy Beef Stew with Noodles 1 cup leftover or canned beef gravy 8 oz medium butter noodles, cooked 1 cup low sodium beef stock and drained 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon water 1/4 cup chopped parsley 2-3 slices leftover pot roast, cut in strips Salt and pepper Leftover roasted carrots and potatoes, diced 2/3 cup frozen peas Instructions: Warm gravy with stock in medium saucepan over medium high heat.

Wash under cold water. Put a cup of full of all-purpose, flour into a plastic bag. While the pieces are still very wet, place them one at a time into the flour. Shake the bag to coat each piece. Melt about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of shortening in a pan on medium heat. Shake the bag again to keep the pieces from sticking together.<br> When the shortening is melted and very hot, remove the chicken from the bag. Gently shake off the excess flour and lay into the hot fat. When all the pieces are in the pan, cover with a lid and allow to fry about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove cover and check each piece to see how brown it is. When it is lightly golden brown, turn to fry the other side. Add salt and fresh ground pepper to each piece on the browned side. Cover again and allow the other side to brown. Season the second side. At this point, you may remove the cover and continue to fry the chicken to the desired \\browness\\ you prefer. Turn often.<br> It should be nicely browned with a very crisp outside and a moist, tender inside. You may want to reduce the heat a little after you have browned the second side. Boneless, skinless chicken gets done much faster than meat with the bone in. Place than fried pieces on a wire rack covered with a paper towel to drain off the excess grease.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 36829,&quot;Grape-Vanilla Soda 11.5 ounce thawed frozen purple grape juice concentrate 1/2 cup water 2 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup seltzer 2 to 4 tablespoons flavored syrup Instructions: Combine one 11.5-ounce can thawed frozen purple grape juice concentrate, 1/2 cup water and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a medium skillet; cook over medium-high heat until syrupy, about 10 minutes.

In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and salt and continue whipping until soft peaks form. With the mixer running, gradually add 1 cup of the sugar and continue whipping until stiff and the sugar has dissolved, about 30 seconds. In a small bowl, stir together the hot water and instant coffee to make coffee extract. Using a sieve over a large bowl, sift the remaining 1/2 cup sugar with the pre-sifted cake flour 3 times, to aerate the mixture. Fold the flour mixture into the egg whites in batches; then fold in the vanilla and dissolved coffee. Spoon the batter into an ungreased 9 or 10-inch tube pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Bake until light golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool by turning the cake (in the pan) upside down, propped on top of a bottle until it cools to room temperature. Run a long, sharp knife blade, or a butter knife, around the cake to loosen, then knock the cake out onto a plate or work it out with your fingers. The outside crumb of the cake will remain in the pan; exposing the white cake underneath. Make the Glaze: Stir the ingredients together until smooth. Add more liquid if too thick or more sugar if too thin. Pour glaze over the top of the cake, letting it drip down naturally. Let glaze set until hard, at least 30 minutes before serving. Serve with vanilla frozen yogurt, so you have a cappuccino in your mouth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 36839,&quot;Very Berry Croissants 8 tablespoons salted butter, softened 1 cup almond paste<br> 1/2 cup dark rum<br> 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 2 teaspoons almond extract<br> 1 large egg<br> 1 1/2 sticks salted butter, cold 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats<br> 1 cup turbinado sugar<br> 3/4 cup brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Six 1-day-old store-bought croissants 1/4 cup simple syrup, homemade (recipe follows) or store-bought 3 cups frozen blueberries<br> Powdered sugar, for dusting<br> 1 cup granulated sugar Instructions: For the almond cream: Add the butter, almond paste, rum, flour, almond extract and egg to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside. For the streusel: Add the butter, flour, oats, turbinado sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse until the ingredients become a coarse crumb and set aside. To build: Cut each croissant in half lengthwise and place cut-side up on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Brush the cut sides of the croissants with the simple syrup, about 1 teaspoon per half. Equally distribute the almond cream on the croissants followed by the blueberries, and sprinkle the streusel over the top. Freeze, uncovered, until totally set, at least 2 hours. Remove from the freezer and wrap individually in plastic wrap (to keep the toppings on), then place in large plastic bags. To serve: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Take the croissants out of the plastic bags, remove the plastic wrap, place on a baking sheet and bake until the almond cream has set and the streusel is golden, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from the oven. Sprinkle with the powdered sugar and serve hot or at room temperature. Pour 1 cup water into a saucepan and add the granulated sugar. Stir and place the saucepan over medium heat. By the time the edges start to simmer, the sugar should have dissolved and the liquid should be completely clear, not cloudy. Immediately remove from the heat and cool completely. Store the simple syrup in an airtight container, in the fridge, until ready to use. Simple syrup stays fresh up to 4 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 36840,&quot;Black Bean, Tropical Fruit and Queso Blanco Salsa 1 cup well-rinsed, canned black beans 1/3 cup finely diced red bell pepper 1/4 cup finely chopped scallions, white and light green parts only 1 Scotch bonnet cl, stemmed, seeded, and minced 3/4 cup crumbled queso blanco 3/4 cup diced mango 1/2 cup coarsely chopped orange sections 1 1/2 teaspoons Spanish sherry vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon fresh orange juice 1 cup diced ripe avocado 1 1/2 teaspoons minced shallot 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped Italian parsley 1/2 teaspoon toasted and ground cumin seeds 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt 2 tablespoons Spanish sherry vinegar 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: To make the Salsa: In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the avocado in the order listed.

Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining berries. Cover and keep warm. For the waffle batter: Preheat a waffle iron to medium-high if there are settings (but it&#39;s ok if there aren&#39;t any). Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (to keep cooked waffles warm). Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and corn kernels in a large bowl. Whisk together the buttermilk, vanilla, eggs and butter in another bowl. Fold the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (it&#39;s ok if there are lumps). Lightly brush the top and bottom of the waffle iron with butter, then fill each section about three-quarters of the way full (there should still be some waffle iron showing). Close and cook until the waffles are golden brown and slightly crisp, 6 to 10 minutes. Keep waffles warm in the oven or covered with foil on a plate while you repeat with the remaining batter.
