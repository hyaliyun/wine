This equipment allows our winemakers to achieve maximum desirable extraction with only five to six days of on-skin fermentation, after which fermentation is completed in new American oak barrels. This progressive technique allows for early integration of oak-driven nuance into the wine and avoids the extraction of harsh, overly drying tannins. The wine's firm, fine-grained tannin and seamlessly integrated oak are two characteristic results of this process. Individual, high-quality batches of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from steep hillside vineyards in Alexander Valley and an incredibly rocky site in Knights Valley form the core of this wine's character. Each batch was fermented separately in small lots. After racking off lees, the resultant wines from the vineyard selections were further selected on quality and style, to produce the final Reserve Cabernet blend. The blend was then matured a further 12 months in a combination of new and used American oak barrels to integrate both the vineyard and oak components. The wine has not been fined or final filtered."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Alexander Valley Reserve Chardonnay 1999","region":"Alexander Valley, Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The 1999 Reserve Chardonnay fruit came predominantly from the Trione's Cloverdale and Geyserville ranches. Their sandy soils, low yields, and the cooling influence of coastal fogs produced the ideal sites for this fruit. Upon reaching full maturity, the fruit was whole-bunch pressed without crushing, thus avoiding any harsh extractiveness. After cold settling, the juice was racked directly to barrel. Following fermentation, the wine was allowed to remain in contact with the yeast lees for the entire 8-month maturation period. During this time, the lees were periodically stirred to enhance the complexity and mouth feel. Approximately 50% of the blend has also undergone malolactic fermentation."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Alexander Valley Reserve Shiraz 1998","region":"Alexander Valley, Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"A big, rich style of Shiraz with deep, inky crimson color.

Black tea, a hint of soy and sleek tannins bring weight and length to the dominant fruit and a shade of well-proportioned oak contributes sweetness to the finish."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Chardonnay 2005","region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The delicate golden color of this wine conceals a bright, fruit intensity evidenced by aromas of fig and pear, with undertones of butterscotch and vanilla. These characteristics are carried through on the palate, where the fruit flavors intensify, and are complemented by balanced oak. The initial creaminess on the palate evolves into a crisp finish that makes this wine a perfect match for a wide variety of cuisines. Try it with sea bass in a ginger coconut broth or a creamy pasta topped with crab or shrimp."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Chardonnay 2011","region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The color is straw with the slightest green cast, which is reminiscent of the color of the skins on freshly picked Chardonnay grapes. In the glass the wine shows exquisite aromas of green apple, lemon, and acacia that dominate the nose and carry through to the palate. In the mouth are flavors of guava, pineapple, and pear mixed with creamy yeast and roasted nut notes that are kept in check by a vibrant acidity. The subtle wood notes lend structure to the blend and lead to a long and refreshing finish."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Chardonnay 2014","region":"California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"This relatively early-season varietal has exquisite subtlety of flavor with floral and melon notes when fermented in stainless steel but takes on richer nutty and buttery components when fermented with oak. Blend components, some aged with oak some in stainless to layer a wine with complexity and depth while still keeping the weight light and refreshing. The cooler growing regions contribute the crisp apple, green melon and delicate floral characters while warmer regions provide the rounder, softer components and cantaloupe, tropical and pear flavors. Aging sur lie brings nutty nuance and a creamy backnote."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Gewurztraminer 2001","region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"A lovely, delicate, clean wine with distinct spicy varietal characters.

On the nose the classic Alexander Valley characters of black cherry and cassis dominate with a complexing element of lovely cigar box oak. Intense Cabernet fruit and spicy oak are the hallmarks of the palate. The wine has a great structure and balance with a backbone of fine-grained tannin and long persistent flavor."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Merlot 2014","region":"California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The Merlot grape purportedly takes its name from a species of blackbird found in fr. This association of the varietal with a graceful, light creature is apt for the beautifully balanced wine the grape produces. The plentiful fruit and relatively low acidity make the wine feel plush and fruity in the mouth while well-rounded tannins lend structure to the full palate. The deep ruby-red color leads to a nose of cherry, mocha, red berry and black tea. The flavors are sumptuous and generous with waves of blackberry & plum fruit. For best enjoyment this wine is best served at ever so slightly below room temperature."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Pinot Grigio 2012","region":"California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Pale straw in color.  Aromas of lychee fruit, white peach, freesia blossoms, white pepper.  On the palate, it is fresh and lively with vibrant acidity, a hint of saffron-like spice, and abundant pear,pineapple, and lychee flavors."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Pinot Grigio 2016","region":"California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Pinot Grigio is a white wine produced from a black-skinned grape. Like a blanc de noirs sparkling wine, we are careful to handle the fruit as little as possible to avoid releasing color from the skins. This is achieved through early morning harvesting (while the fruit is still cool) and gentle pressing of the grapes which are then fermented in 100% stainless steel. The component wines are blended soon after the completion of fermentation so that they have an opportunity to properly marry before bottling. Our inspiration for this wine is the Alsatian style - the crisp, delicate white wines of northeastern fr. In this spirit, we incorporate a small component of Gewrztraminer to complement the aromatics and add dimension to the palate."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Reserve Alexandre Meritage 1996","region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Sweet cherry and berry fruit aromas fold into elements of spice and cedar."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Reserve Alexandre Meritage 1998","region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Sweet cherry and berry fruit aromas fold into elements of spice and cedar."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Reserve Alexandre Meritage 1999","region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Amazing!

This equipment allows our winemakers to achieve maximum desirable extraction with only five to six days of on-skin fermentation, after which fermentation is completed in new American oak barrels. This progressive technique allows for early integration of oak-driven nuance into the wine and avoids the extraction of harsh, overly drying tannins. The wine's firm, fine-grained tannin and seamlessly integrated oak are two characteristic results of this process. Individual, high-quality batches of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from steep hillside vineyards in Alexander Valley and an incredibly rocky site in Knights Valley form the core of this wine's character. Each batch was fermented separately in small lots. After racking off lees, the resultant wines from the vineyard selections were further selected on quality and style, to produce the final Reserve Cabernet blend. The blend was then matured a further 12 months in a combination of new and used American oak barrels to integrate both the vineyard and oak components. The wine has not been fined or final filtered."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2003","region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Big, bold and rich are the operative words to describe this wine. From its inky, totally opaque red hue to the vibrant, ripe fruit aromas, the wine promises intensity and style.

Black fig, Chambord liqueur, hibiscus flower, briar berries, and Bing cherry flavors dominate the palate. More subtle notes of ginger, caramelized brown sugar and mocha add dimension to the opulent structure. Aging in rich American oak barrels lends a plush fullness to the palate and complements the supple grape tannins with silky texture and vanilla spice character. The deep ruby hue of the wine shows beautiful purity of color and alludes to the robust weight of this bottling."},{"name":"Geyser Peak Reserve Merlot 1998","region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"A powerfully structured Merlot. The color is dark and dense. The nose is a rich and exotic array of red cherry, chocolate and roasted coffee beans with accents of smoky barrel ferment and vanilla oak characters. Rich, intense flavors of cherry and cocoa roll through the palate, leading to a wine of amazing structure and balance. Tannins, while being substantial, are ripe and round.

The palate is unctuous and authoritative, and thick with the flavours which that astounding bouquet warned of.

In its youth it is filled with the sharp signature of the chardonnay grape: pear, pineapple, citrus, green apple. Also present when young is a steely, minerally quality and bright citrus crispness. As the chardonnay matures it gains nuances of sweet pear, honey, ripe apple, vanilla, hazelnut, smoke, and toasted almond.  The majority of the chardonnay is fermented in custom-made stainless-steel tanks that hold one ton. About 10-20% is fermented in barrels, and aged 10 months sur lie with the lees stirred up to six months. The chardonnay is allowed a short period of skin contact in the one-ton stainless steel fermentation tanks before being pressed. It is transferred into other tanks of various sizes and allowed a period of cold settling prior to being inoculated for fermentation.  Hanzell Vineyards uses almost exclusively Tonnellerie Sirugue barrels from Nuits-St.-Georges, fr to age the chardonnay. Approximately 25-40% is allowed to undergo malolactic fermentation on average. The chardonnay ages for one year in barrel, of which 25% are new.  The Vintage:  \\"This year's vines started growing rather late because of cool temperatures and robust rain from November through February. It was a steady moderate summer which was mild enough until the end of September and beginning of October. Then for a few days a flash of heat ripened the fruit almost faster than we could pick it, and we finished with very ripe and very flavorful clusters of Chardonnay.\\"  Winemaker's Comments:  \\"We think our '98 is a stunner. It starts out very brightly in the nose with nice, fruity pear-peach-apple. It's got a very small touch of malolactic influence and then a larger wave of that mineral, almost fruit-like quality that emanates from the lower slopes of the Mayacamas range. Its finish is powerful and stays for the longest time! This seems a particularly powerful expression of the great ancient Burgundy clone of Chardonnay that we grow and cherish at Hanzell.\\""},{"name":"Hanzell Chardonnay 1999","region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Hanzell Vineyards Chardonnay is rich, but vibrant.

In October, I did a vertical tasting of every Harlan Estate vintage made (which I will report on at a future date), and one thing that was clear is just how extraordinary these wines are, and how well they are aging.

Fruit flavors are extra concentrated and this is immediately obvious just by looking at the wine. It is dark, deep, purple red to the point of almost being black. There is color all the way to the rim of the glass.  The blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Franc offers immense concentration on the nose with ripe and sweet fruit flavors such as blackcurrants and blackberries, plums and cherries mixing with the more savoury, secondary flavors like tobacco, earth/mineral and nutty aromas. In addition there is an overlay of vanilla from judicious use of new oak barrels.  Whilst the palate sees all the flavors identified on the nose it is the fruit flavors that tend to dominate now, because the wine is so youthful. The secondary characters will take a few years to soften and integrate. Because of the lower than normal yields, which are very low anyway, the wine has a rich thick texture as it glides over the tongue. The finish lingers on with the assistance of ample acidity and very firm, finely grained tannins.  It is not advised to drink this wine immediately. it has been made for at least medium term cellaring and quite possibly will develop and mature for many years. I would recommend waiting a minimum of 5 years, with potential to age for a further 10 years or so.  If you can't help yourself and need to drink a bottle or two now make sure you serve an appropriate dish to help soften the firmness of the tannins. Then you will enjoy the depth of fruit flavor even more. The best style of dishes to fit this requirement are slow cooked braising meals using flavorsome cuts of beef served in rich juices flavored with plenty of herbs and root vegetables."},{"name":"Highfield Sauvignon Blanc 2002","region":"nz","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Deliciously aromatic, redolent of quince, passion fruit and ripe pears."},{"name":"Highway 12 Cabernet Sauvignon 2015","region":"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"This is undeniably the classic bold Sonoma cab you've been searching for.

What compels about the 2012 is a high-toned rose petal scent followed by cascading aromas of tangy pomegranate and other red fruits, earthy minerality from the iron-rich Hambright soils, and finally deep tones of toasty wood smoke. Hourglass Estate Cab has always been noted for its exotic aromatics, but in phenolically-balanced vintages it elicits an extra band at the top end of the floral spectrum."},{"name":"Hourglass Cabernet Sauvignon 2013","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Aromatically, the traditional markers of camphor and mint are there, but melded against black licorice, tobacco and a faint and attractive wood smoke.

An earthy minerality runs through the aromatics and across the palate, lending an umami richness to the interlocking flavors. This minerality is a signature of the iron-rich Hambright fractured bedrock soils in our Hourglass Estate Vineyard and quite consistent vintage to vintage."},{"name":"Hourglass Cabernet Sauvignon 2015","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The traditional Hourglass aromatic markers of camphor and mint are there, though less prominently than in bright, floral vintages like 2012 and 2014. Instead, the 2015 profile leans toward the darker expression of black fruits, cassis and blackberry. A thread of dark earth and toasted hazelnut intermingle with the fruit to deliver a complex weave of aromas. The 2015 Hourglass is more dense and brooding than the past several vintages as the black fruit theme extends from the initial palate impression to the finish. The earthy dark soil minerality of the iron rich Hambright bedrock soils persists from aromatics to the palate, lending an umami richness against the interlocking mixed fruit flavors. This minerality is a signature of the vineyard and is quite consistent vintage to vintage. The 15 is less overtly tannic than the previous several vintages, with greater silky texture. There has always been a yin/yang of energies to Hourglass; elegant vibrancy (natural acid) counterbalances richness and power. 2015 is no exception, but leans a little more toward the opulent side, as is consistent with the warmer vintage. Natural acidity creates a nice tension and lift, lending brightness and vitality to what otherwise would be a very saturated, rich wine. These counterweights act in concert to elicit greater complexity, extending the finish in a long afterthought. As tends to be true of riper vintages, the forwardness of flavors and texture reveal a wine that is very approachable while in its youth. As for cellaring potential, the common wisdom tends to favor earlier consumption in riper vintages. That said, there is incredible structure to the 2015 Hourglass that may defy common logic."},{"name":"Hourglass Cabernet Sauvignon 2017","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The aromatics are explosive C high-tone rose petals and toasted espresso beans lead into both red and dark cherry notes.

In 1964, while studying viticulture and clonal adaptation in Alsace, Coury grew an affinity for a particular clonal selection of Pinot Noir. After smuggling the clone back into the United States in his suitcase, he promptly propagated it and began establishing a nursery stock. Several years later, the vines were purchased from Coury by the founders of Hyland Vineyard and planted in its Jory soils, located on a pristine, south-facing bench just north of the Van Duzer Corrisor in the McMinnville AVA. The resulting decades-old, gnarled vines have yielded fruit that has been sought after by many of Oregon's most prominent producers over the years and is now the proprietary source for this limited \\"Coury\\" selection.

We've been proud to work with them and represent their wines in the US since Andr first met the father of the current owners over 16 years ago.Josep d'Anguera the elder had made a name as the man who introduced Syrah to the region. After he passed away, his two sons Joan and Josep took over, under the guidance of their mother Merc. Since then, they have been working on defining their own style and putting their unique mark on the wines. This process has led to numerous developments.

A texturally thrilling and structurally intimidating Alma. One to lay down for a few years as it evolves into a classic."},{"name":"Jonata El Desafio de Jonata 2009","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"In this bottle of 2009 Desafio, they've produced what is consider to be the definition of Jonata Cabernet: in the glass it displays classic Cabernet notes of cassis, tobacco, cedar, subtle smoke and dark chocolate. There is a distinct earthiness to this blend that creates a great counterbalance to the immense fruit evident everywhere on this red. Plush and soft on the attack, the Desafio envelops the palate in silky black fruit and liquid minerality. Its formidable nature becomes even more evident as the cascade of tannins begins, coating the mouth with legions of firm, but incredibly fine grained tanninsa textural ride on the palate. For all of its ripeness and voluminous fruit, this wine remains sincere not only to the earthiness and complexity of Cabernet Sauvignon, but also to the unique cool climate of the Jonata terroir."},{"name":"Jonata El Desafio de Jonata 2010","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Absolute 2010. One pick taken from nearly every block of merlot, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and petit verdot. This complex blend shows the pronounced voice of each individual block and grape variety. The best of the best and sadly the only Bordeaux lot worthy of the Jonata name in 2010. Unmatched in its layers of aromatic complexity, with decadent black fruit, hints of pepper, cool mineral notes, and the perfect touch of herbaceaousness. For those bemoaning the loss of Alma, the higher than normal percentage of cabernet franc in this blend comes screaming out of the glass with lavender and a cool minty side. The black fruit from the cabernet acts as the anchor with silky texture and a strong backbone of structure. Some flesh and plummy sweetness from the merlot rounds out the mid palate. The true miracle wine and a blend that speaks volumes to the powerful personality and toughness of the Jonata vineyard. Tightly coiled like the sangiovese with dusty tannins that will reward patience in the cellar. An unforgettable Desafio! The ultimate act of defiance; a ripe, layered and luscious Bordeaux blend from a patience-trying vintage."},{"name":"Jonata El Desafio de Jonata 2011","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Sings in the glass immediately. Much like its sister, El Alma, it has delicate earth and herbal notes. Cacao, black plum, espresso, dust and black licorice. It is a completely different beast on the palate. It is juicy and packed with mouthwatering fruit. Cabernet sauvignon thrived in 2011 and it shows immediately on the mid palate and long lingering finish. At 95% Cabernet Sauvignon, it is apparent that the \\"king of grapes\\" didn't need any help from its Bordeaux brethren to fill any holes in tis vintage. This Cabernet Sauvignon fires on all cylinders.  It has monstrous intensity of fruit and palate filling chalky tannin. A sparkling and pristine presentation of Desafio."},{"name":"Jonata El Desafio de Jonata 2013","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Ripe red fruit moving to black fruit and fresh mushrooms.

Classic Jonata Cabernet Sauvignon."},{"name":"Jonata El Desafio de Jonata 2014","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Dark and brooding with the essence of cassis.

An absolutely refined and classic Desafio."},{"name":"Jonata El Desafio de Jonata 2015","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"An unforgettable wine from two fermentation lots consisting of minuscule berries. Long and slow fermentations that allowed for maximum extraction under ideal conditions. Green mint, black cassis, pencil shavings. Black and red fruit with a creamy, expansive and sweet texture. Cedar and cigar notes. Voluptuous and packed with power. Tannins start early and build to an impressive intensity."},{"name":"Jonata Fenix 2008","region":"Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Although the Fenix is still a \\"young'un\\" holding its cards close to its chest, as it unfolds, a cascade of cassis, black olive and earthy mushroom notes pour out of the glass--this is truly a wine for the decanter. Dig deeper and you find merlot's classic plum quality and mid-palate toasty notes, melding with that telltale velveteen texture as it spreads across the palate. Black and suave with fine grained tannins and great length."},{"name":"Jonata Fenix 2012","region":"Ballard Canyon, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"A deft balancing act between luscious black fruit and herbal notes of black olive and fresh mintthe two sides of Merlot. Currently the softest and most expansive on the palate with loads of blackberry leading the way. Velvet. Remarkably long finish that echoes the depth of fruit. Textured for immediate drinking pleasure, but structured also to reward a decade in the cellar."},{"name":"Jonata Fenix 2013","region":"Ballard Canyon, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Robust and sexy. A veritable black hole of sweet black fruit and structure. Layers and layers of powdered tannins. Rose petals and cinnamon. Red licorice and dried strawberry. Soft and pillow-like mid palate attack. Immense. Supremely rich. Huge push of herb-laced bold fruit with notes of cedar. Erupts with wonderful fruit push on the finish. Cacao tannins. Salted caramel and toasty oak. Lingers with nuance of dried blueberries and charred steak."},{"name":"Jonata Fenix 2014","region":"Ballard Canyon, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Crushed raspberry, fresh tobacco, peat and smoke lead the way on this serious expression of Merlot. Pretty and inviting on the nose, then taut and structured with intense black plum and cedar on the palate. Expands and stretches with air to become both sweet and chewy. More plush and round today than its cabernet counterparts. Elegance and pleasure."},{"name":"Jonata La Flor de Jonata White 2015","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Blend: 80% Sauvignon Blanc, 20% Smillon"},{"name":"Jonata La Sangre de Jonata 2007","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"A seemingly endless array of powerful aromatics bloom out of this wine, with heady jasmine and violets followed closely by hints of smoked meat, blackberries, white pepper, licorice and rosemary. The Sangre is opulent and silky on the palate with waves of richness that literally cascade; within its incredible density it remains delineated and focused, never losing its purity or vibrancythis is a Syrah thats anchored by quiet, balanced acidity. The tannins are firm, but at the same time utterly fine grained, a reminder that though the wine is already complete, it still has years to grow into much more."},{"name":"Jonata La Sangre de Jonata 2008","region":"Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2008 Syrah is a sensory ride that starts strong out of the gate and accelerates to dizzying heights. Based more in the red fruit end of the spectrum, this version of La Sangre also features the classic grilled steak, white pepper, cacao, iodine, tar and truffles that have defined our previous vintages. Furthermore, it's vibrant and lively on the palate, with a constant tension between bright red fruit and the darker, deeper notes of spice and smoke. It charges to the finish with dusty Syrah tannin and invigorating acidity. Both sleek and formidable, this is a surprisingly delicate La Sangre considering the palate weight."},{"name":"Jonata La Sangre de Jonata 2010","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"An explosively aromatic wine with jasmine, black pepper and hard blackberry candies. Though it is the most powerful of the Jonata reds in 2010, it also already strikes me as the most cohesive and complete at this stage. Unforgettable purity of fruit throughout and a remarkable weight on the palate. This wine boasts the most velvety midpalate of any Sangre to date. It flows across the palate with incredible energy and unmatched power. Seamless! The tannins build slowly at the start and form a formidable tower that will certainly reward cellaring. 2010 Sangre strikes me as a blend between the best aspects of the 2008 and 2009 Sangre in its combination of impenetrable black fruit, formidable extract and surprising brightness."},{"name":"Jonata La Sangre de Jonata 2012","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Gamier and darker than the Todos at this stage. Truly lives up to its name. The 2012 is an exotic sangre with ripe fruit, pronounced black pepper, tar and truffle. Perfumed and powerful and equally impressive on the palate. Floods the mouth with densely packed black fruit. So much kinetic energy. Seamless travel across the palate. Even with the remarkable aromatic profile and mind-boggling density, it is the finish that leaves the lasting impression. Perfectly layered tannins slowly subside leaving nothing but subtle fruit and perfectly balanced acidity. Combination of the tension and massive proportions of its 2007 predecessor and the delicate cool climate notes of the ethereal 2010."},{"name":"Jonata La Sangre de Jonata 2011","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Even at this early stage, it immediately jumps out of the glass aromatically. It displays some similarity at this stage to its older sibling, the legendary 2008. This is the first Sangre to include significant amounts of passito-style dried and whole cluster fermented wines (20%) and also a dollop of Grenache (6%). The resulting notes of dried herbs on the nose and the blast of ripe red fruit on the palate are a welcome addition to the simultaneously chaotic and focused mlange that is Sangre. After all this exotic talk of stem inclusion, drying fruit and Grenache additions, it is remarkable to note that this is the most reserved and elegant of all of the Sangre blends to date. It is beyond perfumed on the nose, but remains tightly coiled on the palate. With time in glass it opens to showcase peeks of velvet and plush richness on the mid palate. The earthy side of Syrah also plays a large role. It is soft and supple with remarkably fine tannins. This is a special Sangre."},{"name":"Jonata La Sangre de Jonata 2013","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Still tight and closed, which is a great sign for a young Sangre with such a long life ahead.

Tough to put in to words. Unmatched complexity with ripe blackberry, charred tri-tip and green peppercorn. Luxurious texture. Perfumed, exotic and supple. Creosote, tar, violets and truffle. Such is the power and density of this wine that the formidable tannins on the finish appear merely as soft, dusty and balanced. Everything on a higher level and nothing out of place. Similar only to the 2007 Sangre in which both wines were seamless and gorgeous from the moment the grapes were harvested to the moment we put them in bottle. Very special and rarified air."},{"name":"Jonata Tierra Sangiovese 2010","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Classy and elegant. A Tierra that shows off the increasing maturity of the vines. Less overt toast from oak, more purity of fruit and perfume. More Tierra on every level. Mid weight with brambly, peppery, smoky and gamey notes. Bay leaf and sweet tobacco. Darker fruit than previous vintages. Sweet and savory. The wine shows the warmth of September in richness of black cherry fruit and increased density on mid-palate, while the cool summer weather promoted higher acidity and charmingly rustic and lingering tannins lend. These rugged yet mouthwatering tannins start early and grip the entire tongue. Though still very young and concealing a part of its fruit potential, this Tierra shows incredible length. A young sangiovese that strikes me as the most tightly coiled vintage to date with the most upside potential in the cellar."},{"name":"Jonata Todos Proprietary Red Wine 2007","region":"Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Another chameleon in the glass, the Todos displays simultaneous notes of cassis from the Cabernet Sauvignon, sanguine elements from Petit Verdot, minty coolness from the Cabernet Franc and powerful savory and truffle-like notes from the monstrous 2007 Syrah lots. A hint of honeysuckle from the Viognier adds a floral beauty to the mix. At first sip its a voyage to the dark side, displaying inky, black fruit and dark chocolate. Then herbs and white pepper emerge, along with sweet and bright fresh berries. Layers of tannin continue to form and recede, creating a chewy, yet integrated finish."},{"name":"Jonata Todos Proprietary Red Wine 2011","region":"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Fresh raspberries, candied strawberries, charred steak and a hint of jasmine from the viognier.

Tremendous depth from the seemingly endless 2012 summer. Pure fruit throughout the attack and midpalate. Truly a pleasure to drink today. Perfectly balanced and evolved tannins.

Called the \\"Good Mothers\\" by the locals, it soon became \\"Bonnes-Mares\\" (from \\"Bonnes-MSres\\").  This Grand Cru vineyard is halfway between Le Chambertin and Le Musigny, and yet is not as well known. Its overall surface is 15 hectares (37.5 acres), straddling two communes : Morey (the smaller portion) and Chambolle. Maison Joseph Drouhin is the proud owner of a beautiful parcel on the Chambolle side, planted of course with Pinot Noir.  It is located on a gentle slope. Its soil, made up of small chalky stones, is very light and relatively easy to work. Yet, it is a very low yielding vineyard, made even more so because of the age of the vines and their severe \\"Guyot\\" pruning. No fertilizers or weed killers are used. The grapes are hand-picked and brought to the Drouhin cellars in small crates.  Joseph Drouhin's winemaking technique remains strictly traditional. Fermentation and maceration occur in wooden open vats with punching down of the cap and pumping over of the juice.  The wine ages in oak barrels for almost two years and is fined with egg whites prior to bottling.  Bonnes-Mares is a wine of great breed: a sumptuous ruby-red colour, with an intense and luminous hue.  Complex aromas reveal wild cherry and some discrete notes of brown tobacco. With age, truffle and musc become more evident. The structure, always firm, enables the wine to age and improve remarkably through the years.

Chardonnay is the unique variety used to produce these white wines. It is growing on limestone soil mixed with brown clay.  A careful balance between tradition and modern techniques characterizes Joseph Drouhin vineyard management and vinification : they have their own nursery. Ploughing and leaf removal are the only methods used. The whole harvest is picked by hand. The grapes are gently and slowly pressed. The juice settles down for a few hours and is then placed in oak barrels. The fermentation starts naturally, with no yeast inoculation. The malolactic fermentation is always led to its natural completion. The wine matures in small oak barrels for 9 to 10 months and receives all the necessary care before bottling. The percentage of new oak varies with the vintage, never exceeding 40%, so that the oak cannot dominate the fruit.  Chassagne-Montrachet always has a beautiful, limpid, golden hue. On the nose, there are often delicate nuances of pear, vanilla and almonds flavours. Round and ample on the palate, the wine has length and complexity. It is best served with white meat (turkey, veal) or fish in delicate sauces."},{"name":"Joseph Drouhin Chassagne-Montrachet 2008","region":"Burgundy, fr","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Chassagne-Montrachet always has a beautiful, limpid, golden hue.

By September, our efforts had paid off as we observed ripe, deeply-pigmented fruit hanging in our Las Rocas and Manley Lane vineyards.

Record heat waves in May and June reduced berry size and added potency to the flavors. The remainder of the summer brought cooler weather with heat spikes near harvest. The sudden heat finally ripened the fruit while creating a new challene: berries that were just starting to shrivel at their peak of ripeness, concentrating the flavors even more. The end result was a vintage with long hang times, bringing both power and finesse to the carefully picked fruit. WINEMAKING: Grapes from old vines deserve a gentle crush, followed by a cold soak, warm fermentation and minimal maceration on the skins lasting 12 days in all. This extra care allowed this Zinfandel to develop deep color, rich aromatics and soft tannins. The freshly pressed wine was racked into small French and American oak barrels, where it aged for 10 months. This wine includes small amounts of Petite Sirah, Grenache and Carignane, typical complements to Zinfandel, which adds a dash of complexity and interest to a true old vine Zinfandel. This wine shows extraordinary white and black pepper, spice and plenty of blackberry and raspberry jam with a long, voluptuous finish."},{"name":"Kendall-Jackson Great Estates Monterey Chardonnay 1999","region":"Central Coast, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"This wine encompasses our best vineyards in Monterey.

I think it will probably open up more quickly than the 2007 did.

My best results have been when I treat it gentlyin fact, when I treat it like Pinot Noir. So each of the last two years we have been treating the Syrah more gentlyfewer punchdowns and pumpovers, not quite so many stems in the fermentor, less new oak and a bit longer in barrel. We are trying to come up with a wine that is more about complexity and flavor than sheer power. I think we've made some strides in that direction with the 2008 Lucero, which although it likes some aeration upon first opening, is chock full of blackberry fruit and spice and is surprisingly fleshy and soft on the palate. It is still not for the timid, and it pairs well with hearty food and company."},{"name":"Kingston Family Lucero Syrah 2010","region":"cl","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2010 Lucero will benefit from some air.
