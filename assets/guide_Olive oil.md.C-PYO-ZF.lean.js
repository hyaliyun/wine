Truss the turkey. Place turkey on a work surface, breast side up. Rub it with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Heat the grill to medium heat. Have the rotisserie shaft fitted with 1 spit fork. Making certain that the turkey is centered, push the rotisserie shaft through the turkey between the legs, exiting at the neck. Slide the spit fork onto the shaft. Insert the tines of the spit forks into the turkey, screw side up, and tighten the screws to secure firmly. Set the rotisserie shaft in place in the rotisserie ring. Loosen the retaining loop at the handle, and let the counterweight assembly hang down to counterbalance the weight of the breast. The rotisserie should rotate so that the heavy side of the turkey rotates down to the bottom. Swing the counterweight assembly so that the counterweight is directly opposite the heavy side of the turkey. Tighten the retaining loop. The counterweight travel should stick out a little bit above the shaft handle and retaining loop. You may need to adjust the travel of the counterweight as the food cooks, or if the motor sounds like it is straining. Insert the pointed end of the rotisserie shaft into the motor. Set the rotisserie shaft into the ring. Cover the grill, and turn the motor on. Grill the turkey 11 minutes per pound if unstuffed. During the last 30 minutes, baste the entire turkey with 1 cup of the marinade. Remove the turkey from the grill and immediately brush with the remaining glaze. Let rest for 20 minutes before slicing. To determine if the turkey is thoroughly cooked, insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the inner muscle of the thigh, making certain not to touch the bone, and check that the temperature is 175 to 180 degrees F. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 39951,&quot;El Nuevo 4 ounces blanco tequila, such as Santo Blanco 4 ounces mezcal<br> 1 ounce agave<br> 8 dashes bitters<br> 4 to 6 grapefruit twists, for garnish<br> Instructions: Add the tequila, mezcal, agave, bitters and 1/4 ounce water to a large cocktail shaker filled with ice.

In a large pot, bring 2 inches of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon kosher salt, the juice of 1 lemon and the artichokes. Cover and steam until the artichoke bottoms pierce easily, 20 to 40 minutes, depending on size. Drain the artichokes. When cool enough to handle, cut each artichoke in half lengthwise. Scrape out and discard the fuzzy center. Preheat a grill to medium direct heat. Brush the artichokes with the oil, season with salt and pepper and grill, cut-side down, until lightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip and grill briefly to heat through. Arrange the artichokes on a platter, drizzle with some of the Green Goddess Dressing and garnish with lemon wedges. Combine the mayonnaise, creme fraiche, parsley, chervil, tarragon, chives, garlic, anchovy fillets and lemon juice in a food processor and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Add a teaspoon of honey, or to taste. With the machine running, drizzle in just enough oil to thicken slightly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 39953,&quot;Raspberry Porter Trifle with Chocolate Ganache and Whipped Cream 1 (3-ounce) package raspberry gelatin 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar 1 cup boiling water 1/4 cup ice water 1/2 cup porter 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 vanilla bean, or vanilla extract, to taste (approximately 3 tablespoons) 1/4 cup sugar 4 egg yolks 1 (29 to 32-ounce) can fruit cocktail, drained 1 (12-ounce) pound cake, thawed and cut into 3/4-inch cubes (recommended: Sara Lee) 2 bananas, sliced and tossed with lemon juice 4 ounces semisweet chocolate pieces or chocolate squares, finely chopped 2/3 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup heavy cream whipped until light and fluffy with an electric beater Instructions: 4 (16-ounce) or larger wine glasses or snifters (note that the idea of a trifle is to see the layers) Dissolve gelatin and sugar in boiling water. Add cold water and porter. Cover and set aside at room temperature. Pour the milk and heavy cream into a heavy bottomed saucepot and scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pot (or add vanilla extract). (If using a vanilla bean, put the vanilla pod in the pot as well.) Add half the sugar to the pot and bring to a simmer (just below a boil). In a small bowl whisk together the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar and temper it by adding a small amount of the heated milk mixture to the bowl while whisking constantly (known as a liaison). Now pour the liaison (egg mixture) into the milk pot, stirring constantly. You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook. The idea of a liaison is to incorporate the eggs and avoid making them into scrambled eggs! You want the mixture to begin to thicken so it will coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and allow to cool, then remove vanilla pod and discard, and refrigerate until chilled. Spoon fruit cocktail into each glass as a base layer. Follow with a layer of cubed pound cake, then a layer of sliced bananas. Spoon about 1/3 cup gelatin/porter mixture on top of the fruit and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours until the gelatin is set. A few minutes before serving, make the ganache, place the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to just under a boil in a small saucepan. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit for about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir gently with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is melted and smooth. If the chocolate is not melting readily, nest the bowl in another bowl of very hot tap water. Spoon creme anglaise over the chilled trifle and drizzle with ganache. Spoon whipped cream on top to finish. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 39954,&quot;Souffle a L&#39;orange 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3/4 cup whole milk 1/4 cup granulated sugar 4 extra-large egg yolks, at room temperature 2 tablespoons orange liqueur 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest 5 egg whites, at room temperature 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch kosher salt 1/4 cup granulated sugar Confectioners&#39; sugar, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Position a rack so the souffle will sit in the middle of the oven. Spread the 1/2 tablespoon of butter evenly inside a 6-cup souffle dish (6 1/2-inches round x 3 1/2-inches high) with a paper towel. Add the 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar and tilt the dish to distribute the sugar evenly. Lightly tap out the excess and set aside. Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter in a 9-inch round enamel pot, such as Le Creuset, over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly. Whisk in the milk and 1/4 cup granulated sugar and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly. Off the heat, cool for 1 minute and whisk in first the egg yolks and then the orange liqueur, vanilla, and orange zest and set aside. Put the egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat on medium-high speed until they are doubled in volume and frothy. With the mixer running, slowly add the 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and beat until the egg whites form soft, very creamy (not firm!) peaks. Whisk 1/4 of the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture, then add all the egg whites and fold them carefully but thoroughly with a rubber spatula into the base. Pour the mixture into the prepared souffle dish, not filling it more than 1 1/4 inches from the top of the dish (there may be extra mixture). Put your finger 1 inch down into the edge of the souffle mixture and run it all the way around, making sure you don&#39;t rub off the butter and sugar inside the dish. Place in the middle of the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 375 degrees. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the souffle is puffed and browned on top. Don&#39;t peek!! Sift a light dusting of the confectioners&#39; sugar on top and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 39955,&quot;Sage Rubbed Pork Chops with Warm Apple Slaw 4 teaspoons chopped fresh sage or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried 1 large clove garlic, minced (about 1 teaspoon) 1 teaspoon salt, divided Freshly ground black pepper 4 (3/4-inch) bone-in pork loin chops (about 8 ounces each) 1 large onion 1 large Granny Smith apple, cut in 1/2, cored 1/2 head green cabbage, cored 3 large carrots 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth Instructions: Combine the 3 teaspoons of the fresh sage or 1 teaspoon dried, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a few grinds of fresh pepper. Rub this mixture all over the pork chops and let the chops sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion, apple and cabbage and julienne the carrots (very thin sticks). Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick frying pan until hot but not smoking. Add the chops and brown on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove. Carefully wipe out the pan. Heat the remaining teaspoon oil over moderate heat and add the onion, apples and remaining teaspoon fresh sage or 1/2 teaspoon dried. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is soft and golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the cabbage, carrots, vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt and continue cooking until the cabbage and carrots begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the broth and return the pork chops to the pan burying them in the vegetable mixture. Cover and cook just until the pork chops are just slightly blush in the center, 5 to 7 minutes longer. To serve, arrange the warm slaw on individual plates and top with a pork chop and pan juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 39956,&quot;Bay Ridge Empanadas 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 small onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 pound ground beef 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon curry powder 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 1/4 teaspoon allspice 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme Pinch ground cinnamon Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup frozen corn, defrosted 1/2 cup shredded white Cheddar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon sazon seasoning 12 store-bought (6-inch) empanada wrappers 1 egg, lightly beaten Instructions: In a skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. When the oil is warm, add the onion and saute until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute 1 minute more. Stir in the beef, cumin, curry, chili powder, allspice, thyme, cinnamon, and salt and pepper, to taste. Saute, stirring often, until the beef has browned, about 10 minutes.

Spray a rimmed baking sheet generously with cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the cheese, corn, beans, spinach, chiles, scallions, cumin, chili powder, cayenne and salt. Stir together, making sure to break up the clumps of spinach. Have a small bowl of water ready for moistening your fingers. Lay one egg roll wrapper out on a work surface and moisten the edges with your finger. Scoop 1/4 cup of the filling into the center of the wrapper; mound into a 1-inch wide log arranged diagonally across the wrapper, with about an inch of space to the corners. Fold the corners over the filling, gently pressing down on either side to secure the fold. Then, starting at one of the unfolded corners, gently but firmly roll up the egg roll. Place on the prepared baking sheet and repeat until all of the filling has been used. Brush the tops and sides of the egg rolls generously with beaten egg. Bake until golden brown all over, 15 to 20 minutes. For the salsa: Meanwhile, pulse the tomatoes, garlic and jalapeno in a food processor until the tomatoes are almost smooth. Add the scallions, cilantro, lime juice and salt; pulse just to combine. Serve the egg rolls with the salsa on the side, for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 39959,&quot;Route 66 Burgers 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 large red onion, thinly sliced 1 pound ground beef (80/20 leanness) 2 teaspoons garlic powder Salt and pepper 2 slices Cheddar, cut into 8 squares 8 dinner-size potato rolls Instructions: Heat canola oil in a saute pan and cook onions over medium heat until they caramelize. Heat grill. Form ground beef into 8 (2-inch) patties. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and grill burgers until medium rare, remove to a platter and top with cheddar cheese slices to allow melting. Use a 2-inch circle cutter (or biscuit cutter) to cut the potato rolls into circles. Place burgers in rolls and top burgers with caramelized onion. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 39960,&quot;Pizza Dough 1 package active dry yeast 1 teaspoon sugar 1 cup warm water 1 tablespoon kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil 3 cups 00 flour, plus more for dusting Instructions: In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water; stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the mixer on low and add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium; stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough by squeezing a small amount together: if it&#39;s crumbly, add more water; if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour - 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix until the dough gathers into a ball, this should take about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times; kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a round and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it over to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e. over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. This is a good time to stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees F. Once the dough is domed and spongy, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter. Roll and stretch the dough into a cylinder and divide into 3 equal pieces. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes so it will be easier to roll out. Roll or pat out a piece of dough into a 12 inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Dust a pizza paddle with flour and slide it under the pizza dough. Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and top with your favorite flavors. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp. Repeat with the remaining dough. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 39961,&quot;Spicy Vegetable Wrap 1 medium sweet potato, peeled and diced (about 3/4 pound) 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 teaspoon curry powder, plus 1 teaspoon Coarse grained salt 1 (15-ounce) can peeled plum tomatoes 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas 1 cup carrots, julienne or shredded 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 5 ounces washed baby spinach leaves 4 small whole-wheat pitas or other flatbread 1/2 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves 1/2 cup plain lowfat yogurt Lime wedges, for garnish Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place sweet potatoes, olive oil, 1 teaspoon curry powder, and a dash of salt in a plastic bag. Shake until well coated. Spread on a cookie sheet. Bake, until golden and cooked through, stirring once at the halfway point, 18 to 20 minutes. While the sweet potatoes are cooking, combine tomatoes, chickpeas, carrots, red pepper flakes, and remaining curry powder in a medium saucepot. Bring to a boil and immediately reduce to a simmer. Add cooked sweet potatoes, stir in the spinach, and cook until spinach is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes Divide among the pita, top each sandwich with 1/4 of the cilantro leaves and 1/4 of the yogurt. Serve with lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 39962,&quot;Waffled Banana Bread 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup smashed banana (2 to 3 small bananas) 1/2 cup vegetable oil, plus more for brushing waffle iron 1/2 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 large eggs Soft unsalted butter and confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting, optional Instructions: Preheat a waffle iron to medium-high. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (to keep cooked waffles warm). Whisk together the flour, sugar, walnuts, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the banana, oil, sour cream, vanilla and eggs in another bowl. Fold the banana mixture into the flour mixture until just combined (it&#39;s ok if there are lumps). Lightly brush the top and bottom of the waffle iron with oil. Fill each section about three-quarters of the way full (there should still be some waffle iron showing). Close and cook until the waffles are golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Keep the waffles warm in the oven or covered with foil on a plate while you cook the remaining batter.

Cover and freeze until ready to use. Combine 1/2 cup heavy cream with the brandy in a small bowl; set aside. Line the bottom of a 9-inch-round springform pan with parchment paper. Arrange about one-third of the panettone in the pan in a single layer, cutting the pieces as needed to completely cover. Brush the panettone lightly with some of the brandy cream. Spread half of the spiced ice cream over the panettone layer. Repeat with another layer of panettone, brush with more cream and top with the remaining ice cream. Cover with the remaining panettone and brush with the remaining cream. Cover the pan with foil and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove the cake from the freezer about 20 minutes before serving. Beat the remaining 2 cups heavy cream, the confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Remove the springform ring.

Immediately plunge into a bowl of ice water and drain. Pat dry. Cut each spear in half on a diagonal and cut the bottom of the spears into small dice. Melt half of the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add all the asparagus and cook, gently stirring, to heat thoroughly. Meanwhile, melt the remaining butter in a large skillet. Add the eggs and whisk in a figure eight, making sure the edges of the eggs don?t stick. When the eggs are almost set, slowly pour in the cream, a little at a time, continuing to whisk briskly. Sprinkle in the chives and whisk until the eggs are completely set. Divide the eggs and asparagus evenly among four plates, placing the spears and diced asparagus around the eggs or stack the spears so they lean against the eggs. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Prosecco]&quot; 39973,&quot;The Carriage and Reindeer 6 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered Chocolate Gift Cakes, for inside the carriage 2 3/4 cups heavy cream 28 ounces pounds bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 1/3 cup orange liqueur 18 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted and still warm 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 10 large egg yolks 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup almond flour Scant 1/4 cup dark rum (optional) 10 large egg whites 3/4 cup granulated sugar 16 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered Instructions: To make the reindeer and carriage: Refer to the templates and trace these shapes onto parchment paper or poster board. Use a pair of scissors to cut them out. Place another sheet of parchment paper on your work surface. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered chocolate on the paper, being sure to spread it all the way to the edges. Lift the paper by its corners and move it to a clean space on your work surface. Let the chocolate harden slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. The chocolate will be firm enough to cut but it will not be hard.<br> With the tip of a sharp paring knife, trace around the templates (2 reindeer, 2 stands, and as many of the pieces of the carriage that will fit), cutting through the chocolate all the way. You will need to repeat the process in order to finish all of the pieces. When you cut out the wheels, you can choose to use a heart-shaped cutter. If you want to add more detail, cut a round circle for each hub of the wheel. Work quickly or the chocolate will become too hard to cut. When finished, allow the chocolate to set completely before removing the scraps. Now you are ready to assemble the carriage. With additional chocolate, \\glue\\ the reindeer to the stands, and glue together the pieces of the carriage. For the wheels, suspend the carriage on top of an overturned bowl where you have clearance to attach them. Allow it to dry completely before removing from the bowl.<br> For additional decorations, half fill a cornet with more tempered chocolate and cut a small opening at the tip. Use to pipe dots or teardrops onto the side of the carriage. When the chocolate is dry, you can dust with gold leaf or combine the gold with a few drops of oil to use as paint. You could also decorate with mini M&amp;M baking bits. Ganache: Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Gradually pour about half of the hot cream over the chocolate. Let stand for 30 seconds to melt chocolate. Slowly whisk it until smooth and homogenous. Add the remaining cream gradually (the shock of the hot cream can cause the fat in the chocolate to separate or \\break, if added too quickly), and mix until all of it is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous.<br> It should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the liqueur and mix to fully incorporate. Pour the ganache onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet to cool.<br> When the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste but is still easily spreadable, it is ready to be used. If the ganache has set too much, soften it by heating a small amount in a saucepan placed over medium heat until melted. Then quickly, but gently, stir the melted ganache into the harder, cooler ganache. If it&#39;s still too hard, repeat the procedure until the desired consistency is reached.<br> Cake layer: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a medium bowl with an electric mixer, combine corn syrup, egg yolks, butter, and almond flour. Beat at medium high speed until light and fluffy. Add dark rum (or substitute vanilla and orange zest).<br> In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat egg whites until foamy. Add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Increase mixer speed to medium high and whip to stiff but not dry peaks, about 7 minutes.<br> Fold the meringue into the butter mixture all at once. Using a rubber spatula fold up from the bottom of the bowl, careful not to deflate the meringue. When the two mixtures are just incorporated, add the warm chocolate. Fold again, carefully. Use a whisk, if the meringue does not fold in well.<br> Pour the batter into a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and spread it evenly to the edges with a rubber spatula. Careful not to smash the batter or it will lose its air and the cake will be flat and chewy. Bake until the cake springs back when touched, or a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool cake in the pan on a wire rack. The cake will collapse slightly as it cools.<br> Using an offset spatula spread the ganache onto the cake layer. Spread the ganache all the way to the edges. If the cake is uneven, use the ganache to make it flat and even as possible. Place the cake in the refrigerator and allow the ganache to harden, about 20 minutes. Then use the offset spatula to make the edges as clean and straight as possible. Place the frosted cake in the refrigerator for about 1 hour to set.<br> When ready to serve, remove cake from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before serving. Heat a chef&#39;s knife in hot water; wipe off excess water and cut cake into the serving size preferred.<br> Decorations: Spread about a 1/16-inch thick layer of the tempered chocolate over a transfer sheet (see note below). Use a chef&#39;s knife to cut the chocolate, but not the transfer sheet, to match the size of the cake pieces. Set aside and let the chocolate set about 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the air temperature. When the chocolate has set, lift each pre-cut piece from the transfer sheet and place it, design side up, on top of the individual cake serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 39974,&quot;Caramelized Onion Sweet Potato Salad 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 red onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon honey 1 tablespoon finely chopped orange zest 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme 3 sweet potatoes, sliced into 1/2-thick slices Vegetable oil Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat.

Add the rice, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring once or twice, until the rice is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain, shaking the colander to remove any excess water. Spread the rice on a rimmed baking sheet and let cool. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and place a baking sheet on the middle rack. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 6 minutes. Tear the basil and add to the skillet along with the garlic and tomato paste. Increase the heat to high and cook, stirring, until the tomato paste browns, about 4 minutes. Stir in the chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, grease the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Coat the pan with the breadcrumbs, tapping to remove any excess. Put the eggs and all but 3 tablespoons of the pecorino cheese in a small bowl and beat with a fork. Put the cooled rice in a bowl; add the egg mixture and stir to combine. Transfer about two-thirds of the rice mixture to the prepared springform pan. Using moist fingers, pat the rice onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan, forming a 1/2-inch-thick layer. Place the provolone slices over the rice in the pan. Spoon about three-quarters of the sausage filling over the provolone, filling it to 1/2 inch from the top. Pat the remaining rice mixture on top to enclose the filling, then sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons pecorino cheese. Put the pan on the hot baking sheet and bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool, 5 minutes. Run a small knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the timbale, then remove the side of the pan. Slide a spatula under the timbale and transfer it to a platter. Thin the remaining sausage filling with a splash of water and reheat. Serve with the timbale. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 40007,&quot;Pecan Sticky Buns 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1/4 cup (2 ounces) very warm water (105 to 115 degrees F) 5 1/3 cups (24 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour 2 1/4 teaspoons Kosher salt 2 cups (16 ounces) warm water (90 degrees F) 9 tablespoons (4 1/2 ounces) unsalted butter 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon (5 ounces) dark brown sugar, firmly packed 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) unsalted butter, softened 2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon (2 3/4 ounces) pecan pieces, toasted 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon (2 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar 1 teaspoon cinnamon Instructions: Place the yeast and warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Allow it to stand for about 3 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the warm water and the yeast mixture and stir with your fingers to moisten the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand for 5 minutes. This is a soft, moist dough. If the dough seems too stiff and hard to knead, add extra warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until you get a nice malleable dough. Gently shape the dough into a loose ball, cover it with plastic, and let it rest on the table for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.) Gently knead the dough on the lightly floured surface for 1 to 2 more minutes, or until it becomes smooth, supple, and elastic but not too firm. The texture of the dough should be soft but springy. Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn to coat the top with oil. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. While the dough is rising; in a small saucepan, heat the 9 tablespoons butter and the dark brown sugar over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter has melted and the sugar is completely moistened (it won&#39;t be dissolved), then whisk until the mixture looks silky and a little lighter in color. Use 1 tablespoon softened butter to grease the sides of a 9-inch square pan, then pour in the caramel, tilting the pan slightly so the mixture spreads evenly over the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle the toasted pecans over the warm caramel and press them down slightly. Put the pan in the refrigerator to cool the caramel; be the pan&#39;s on a level surface. Put the granulated sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and stir until evenly mixed. Set aside. When the dough has doubled, gently pour it out of the bowl onto the floured work surface. Flatten the dough and stretch it with your fingers to form a 13 by 10-inch rectangle, with a longside facing you. Work gently so you don&#39;t tear the dough surface. The dough should stretch easily at this point, but if it resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and resume stretching. Check to be sure the dough isn&#39;t sticking to the work surface; flour the table again, if necessary. Spread 3 tablespoons of the softened butter evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch strip unbuttered along the top edge. Sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture generously and evenly over the butter, again leaving the top 1/2-inch of the rectangle bare. Starting with the bottom edge, roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion into a long log. If the dough sticks to the table as you&#39;re rolling, use a dough scraper to loosen it gently. Pinch gently but firmly along the seam to seal it. If necessary, gently shape the roll so it is a nice uniform log. Take the caramel-lined pan out of the refrigerator. Cut the log of dough into 9 equal pieces. (It&#39;s easiest to mark the roll first to show where you&#39;re going to make the cuts--a slight indentation with the knife edge will do--then use a sharp serrated knife to cut completely through the dough.) Lay the pieces cut side down on top of the caramel. Don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s a tight fit. Let rise, uncovered, at room temperature until the dough has almost doubled, about 1 to 1 1/4 hours. The rolls should fill the pan and extend 1/2 to 3/4-inch above it. In the meantime, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the pan of sticky buns on a foil-lined baking sheet and place it in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes longer, until the tops of the buns are golden brown and crusty. It&#39;s important to bake the buns long enough so the dough is cooked all the way through and the caramel topping develops properly. Set the pan of buns on a rack to cool for 5 minutes. Then quickly but carefully turn the pan upside-down and release the sticky buns onto a large flat heatproof plate. Immediately scrape out any hot caramel remaining in the bottom of the pan and spread it on the tops of the buns, filling in any bare spots. Let them cool until just warm before serving. (Clean the pan by soaking it in very hot water to dissolve the caramel.) Store any leftovers covered in plastic wrap at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40008,&quot;St. Nino&#39;s Chicken 1 (3 to 4-pound) chicken 3 tablespoons walnut oil or olive oil 3 cloves finely minced garlic 4 fresh sprigs cilantro, finely minced 2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon fenugreek (Georgian spice-utskho suneli) 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 cup red wine (preferably Georgian) 1 empty soda/beer can Instructions: Prepare outdoor grill for indirect cooking.

Meanwhile, if cooking the potatoes on the stove top, peel them and place in a saucepan with salted water to cover generously. Bring to a boil and boil until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain well and pass through a ricer or food mill placed over a bowl, or simply mash. Alternatively, place the baking potatoes in an oven preheated to 400 degrees and bake until very soft, about 1 hour. Cut in half and scoop out the potato flesh, passing it through a ricer or food mill or mashing it. While still warm, add the 1 2/3 cups flour and the salt to the potatoes and knead them in to make a firm, smooth dough, adding more flour as needed to achieve the correct consistency. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees. Lightly oil a 10-inch pie plate. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into an 11-inch round, about 1/4-inch thick. Carefully press it into the prepared pie plate. Turn under the edges and press on to the plate rim. (Alternatively, roll out, place on an oiled baking sheet, and fold up the edges like a pizza crust.) Spread the ricotta over the crust, then distribute the olives evenly over the ricotta. Sprinkle with the pepper, Parmesan cheese, and chopped marjoram or savory. Bake until golden, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool slightly.

In a mixing bowl, combine remaining sugar with salt, cocoa, and cornstarch. Whisk in remaining 1/2 cup unheated milk. Gradually whisk in hot milk and place entire mixture back into the saucepan. Heat, over medium heat, stirring, until mixture thickens and just starts to bubble. Whisk in egg and egg yolk and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and whisk in chopped chocolate and butter. When both are melted, strain pudding through a fine-mesh strainer, and cool. Cover with plastic and reserve in refrigerator. To make the Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter 2 (8-inch) cake pans and line with parchment. Butter the parchment and flour pans, shaking out the excess. Sift together flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Reserve. In a mixer with a whip attachment, beat eggs and sugar until thick and lemon-colored. Beat in vegetable oil. Alternately add dry ingredients with buttermilk, scraping the bowl once or twice. Add the coffee and vanilla to form a thin batter. Divide between prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean, about 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in pan for 15 minutes. Invert onto cooling racks, peel off paper and cool completely. When cool, split each cake in half with a serrated slicing knife. Reserve 1 layer for another use. Spread bottom layer with half of the reserved Chocolate Pudding. Place second layer on top and spread with remaining pudding. Top with last cake layer. To make the Icing: Over a double boiler, melt chocolate with butter. Remove from heat, whisk in brewed coffee, corn syrup, and vanilla. Place icing over an ice bath and chill, whisking often until the mixture is of soft but a spreadable consistency.

Refrigerate up to 24 hours, changing the water a few times. (This makes the potatoes extra crispy when fried.) Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the red onion, white onion, shallots, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until the onions are soft, 30 minutes. Stir in the brown sugar, brandy and Worcestershire sauce and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vinegar; transfer to a bowl and set aside. Combine 3 teaspoons crushed peppercorns with 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Add the steak and toss to coat, pressing the peppercorns into the meat. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook until it just starts browning.

Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan, a 6-inch cake pan, and a 3-inch cake pan. To make the cake, cream the butter and sugar on medium-high speed in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. On medium speed, add the eggs, 2 at a time, then the sour cream, vanilla, and lemon zest, scraping down the bowl as needed. Mix well. Sift together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and stir just until smooth. Finish mixing by hand to be sure the batter is well mixed. Proportionately divide the batter between the 3 cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula, and bake as follows: the 9-inch pan for 45 minutes, the 6-inch pan for 35 to 40 minutes and the 3-inch pan for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean in each cake. Cool in the pans to room temperature. For the frosting, cream the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.

Macerate at room temperature for about 2 hours or, refrigerated, overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Dust a worktop and rolling pin with flour. Roll out one dough disk a little less than 1/4-inch thick, about 14 inches in diameter. Fold the dough in half and transfer it to a 9- or 10-inch pie plate. Unfold. Press the dough into the corners, leaving the overhang. Refrigerate the first crust while you roll out the second disk of dough. Remove the bottom crust from the fridge and fill it with the macerated apples. Tuck the pats of cold butter beneath the top layer of fruit. Top with the second piece of dough, and trim both to a 1/2-inch overhang. Tuck the overhang into a roll and crimp the edge, pressing down to hook some of the dough over the edge of the dish. (You want to make a hard crimp because it will shrink as it cooks.) Cut a hole in the center of the pie, as well as some decorative vents. Brush the top of the pie with cream, dust it with sugar, and bake for 20 minutes. Then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for another 45 to 55 minutes, until the center juices bubble and thicken, for a total of about 1 hour 10 minutes. Let the pie cool until it is just warm to the touch before slicing and serving. Mix the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add the lard and the butter, and cut them in with a pastry blender until the larger pieces are the size of peas and the mixture begins to clump on the pastry blender. Shuffle through the mixture with your hands, pinching chunks of lard to flatten them. Add 4 tablespoons of the ice water and mix with a fork. Pinch a clump of dough in your hands: If it feels moist and clumps together easily, it&#39;s probably hydrated enough. If it feels really crumbly, add another tablespoon or two of ice water until you can form a baseball-size clump of dough, packing it on as if you were making a snowball. You want to mix the dough as little as possible to ensure it stays tender. Divide the dough in half and form each half into a flat disk. Wrap both disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. Thirty minutes before you&#39;re ready to roll out the dough, remove it from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature to soften. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40082,&quot;Shrimp Stir-Fry with Fried Egg and Flavored Vinegar 1/2 cup white wine vinegar 2 teaspoons sugar 1 tablespoon cl oil or cl flakes Kosher salt Finely chopped fresh chives 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 4 eggs 1 tablespoon butter 2 (12-ounce) packages thick pre-cooked egg noodles 1/3 cup oyster sauce 1/3 cup water 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1/2 red onion, julienned 2 cups shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and quartered 2 cloves garlic, chopped 16 large (21/25) shrimp, peeled and deveined 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger 3 plum tomatoes, medium diced Bunch green onions, chopped 1 1/2 cups spinach, stemmed, washed, dried and coarsely chopped Instructions: Soak the egg noodles in hot water for 5 minutes, drain, and then set them aside. For the vinegar: Put the white wine vinegar, sugar, and cl oil into a bowl. Season the mixture with salt, to taste, and set aside. Add the chives to the flavored vinegar just before serving. For the egg: In a nonstick saute pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the pan. Increase the heat to high, and add the butter. Cook the eggs until their bottoms are crisp and the yolks are runny. Switch off the heat, and set the eggs aside. For the stir-fry: In a small bowl, stir the oyster sauce and water together, and set aside. Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or a shallow, wide-bottomed pot, over high heat. Once smoking hot, add the red onion, and shiitake mushrooms, and toss for 1 minute. Add the garlic, and toss. Add the shrimp, and toss. Once the shrimp has turned pink, pour the oyster sauce and water mixture into the wok. Stir in the ginger and cooked noodles, then toss. Add the tomatoes and chopped green onions, then toss.

Cook, stirring frequently with a heatproof rubber spatula, until the mixture is thick and bubbly and darkens slightly in color. Carefully and slowly, pour in the milk and cream. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the caramel is dissolved and the mixture is scalding hot. Turn off the heat. Whisk together the egg yolks, salt and remaining 5 tablespoons brown sugar in a bowl until well combined. Slowly ladle in about one-third of the hot milk mixture, whisking constantly. Pour the tempered yolk mixture back into the saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and heat slowly, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, until the custard reaches 175 degrees F and has thickened slightly. Do not allow to boil or the mixture will curdle. Set the pan into a larger container half-filled with ice and water and stir occasionally until completely chilled. Stir in the vanilla extract. If the custard is not totally smooth, strain through a fine-mesh strainer or blend until smooth with a handheld immersion blender. Process in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. Store in the freezer until firm, at least 4 hours. For the sorghum molasses cookies: Add the butter and granulated sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large bowl, if using a handheld mixer). Using the paddle attachment (for the stand mixer), beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula, and beat again for 20 seconds to ensure a homogeneous mixture. Add the egg and beat until incorporated. Add the molasses and beat again until incorporated. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula, and beat again for 20 seconds. Combine the flour blend, baking soda, cinnamon, chia seed, ginger, salt and nutmeg in a medium bowl with a whisk. Add the dry mixture to the stand mixer bowl and stir on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened. Increase the speed to medium and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula, and beat again for 20 seconds. (For easier shaping, chill the dough for several hours until firm.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (if using a convection oven, preheat to 325 degrees F.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Using a small ice cream scoop, shape 1-ounce balls of dough (2 tablespoons in size) and roll them lightly in turbinado sugar. Place on the prepared baking sheets 4 inches apart and flatten slightly with your hands to a 1/2-inch thickness. Bake, rotating the pans once from front to back and from the bottom rack to the top rack during baking, until rich golden brown all over and puffed in the center, about 18 minutes. They will spread quite a bit and feel just set. Allow to cool completely, then freeze until ready to assemble the sandwiches. To assemble the sandwiches: Remove the ice cream from the freezer. If it is too firm to scoop easily, allow to soften for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the cookies from the freezer. Place 6 cookies face-down on a baking sheet. Top each cookie with a generous scoop of butterscotch ice cream, then top each with another cookie, face-up. Press down gently with the palm of your hand until the ice cream spreads to the edges of cookies. Place the sandwiches in the freezer until ready to serve. For the pineapple: Toss the pineapple with the brown sugar, rum, vanilla and salt in a medium bowl. Let marinate, stirring once or twice, until the sugar has dissolved and the pineapple releases its juices, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain the pineapple, reserving the marinade. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. When the pan is quite hot, add the butter and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the pineapple to the pan, spreading the pieces out in a single layer and taking care not to crowd the pan. When the pan has recovered its heat, pour in the marinade and allow to reduce until thickened and bubbly. Turn over the pineapple pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is all but evaporated and the pineapple is nicely browned all over. Remove the pineapple from the skillet. To serve: Cut each ice cream sandwich in half and plate with the warm, caramelized pineapple. Add a drizzle of caramel sauce and garnish with a bright edible flower and a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

Add the flour, baking powder and milk to the egg yolks and mix to a smooth thick batter. Whisk the whites with the salt until they form stiff peaks. Fold into the batter ? it is now ready to use. Heat a non-stick pan on a medium heat. Pour a little oil onto some kitchen paper and spread onto the pan. Pour some of your batter into the pan and fry for a couple of minutes until it starts to look golden and firm. At this point, sprinkle your chosen flavoring onto the uncooked side before loosening with a spatula and flipping the pancake over. Continue frying until both sides are golden. You can make these pancakes large or small, to your liking. You can serve them simply dowsed in maple syrup and even some butter or creme fraiche. Or try one of these great flavorings. Nice one. ; P.S. You must try the corn pancakes, they are great. On one condition: you must use fresh corn. To do this, remove the outer leaves, and carefully run a knife down the cob, this will loosen all the lovely pieces of corn.

Wet a fingertip and press down lightly to remove the point on each gougere. Bake for 8 minutes and rotate. Bake until the gougeres are golden brown, another 4 minutes. Cool to room temperature. For the Mornay: In a medium saucepot set over low heat, melt the butter and sweat the shallots and garlic for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the flour and cook until it smells toasted, 2 minutes. Add the milk and bring to a boil, stirring continuously so no lumps form. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce reaches the desired consistency. Slowly add the gruyere and Parmigiano-Reggiano, and stir until smooth. Add the mustard and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the Mornay to a bowl and cool in the fridge or set over ice. When cool, transfer to a piping bag fitted with a small tip. For the sauce: In a large bowl, combine the mayonnaise, mustard, beer extract powder, honey, mustard powder and vinegar, and whisk thoroughly to remove the lumps. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fill the gougeres with the Mornay sauce and reheat in the oven to melt the cheese, 5 minutes. Serve the hot gougeres with the beer mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 40117,&quot;Raspberry-Lemon Easter Cake 3 cups cake flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 1/4 cups sour cream 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 1 1/2 lemons) 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into small pieces 2 cups sugar 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 5 large eggs, room temperature 1 1/4 cups sugar 5 large egg whites 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch fine salt 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into small pieces 1/2 cup seedless red raspberry jam Rabbit Sugar Cookies, homemade or store bought, recipe follows Pastel sanding sugars Candied almonds 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 2 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla paste or vanilla extract Instructions: For the cakes: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush 2 (9-inch) round cake pans with shortening or butter. Line bottoms with buttered parchment paper and dust with flour.<br> Sift the flour, baking powder, soda, and salt into a medium bowl; whisk to combine evenly. Stir the sour cream, lemon juice and vanilla together in a liquid measuring cup, and set aside.<br> Beat the butter in a standing mixer with the paddle attachment on high until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Stop and scrape butter off the sides of the bowl. Continue beating while gradually adding the sugar-- it should take a couple minutes to add all the sugar. Continue beating until very light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes more. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in the lemon zest. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.<br> At low speed, add the flour mixture in 3 parts, alternating with the sour cream in 2 parts, beginning and ending with the flour. Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix for 15 seconds longer.<br> Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the top with a knife. (Lightly tap the pan on the counter so the batter settles evenly.)<br> Bake the cakes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes; then turn cakes out onto the rack to cool completely.<br> For the Icing: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a mixer&#39;s bowl above the water. Whisk the sugar, the egg whites, lemon juice, cream of tartar, and salt in the bowl by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and continue whisking until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar dissolves, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the bowl to a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat the whites at medium-high speed until they almost holds a stiff peak and are cool, about 10 minutes. Beat in the butter, a little at a time, until the icing is smooth and spreadable. (If the icing separates, just keep beating and it will come back together.)<br> To assemble the cake: Slice each cake in half horizontally with a serrated knife, to make 4 even layers, taking care that they are as flat and straight as possible.<br> Set a large flat plate on a large inverted bowl or bottom of a salad spinner (of course, if you have a cake stand, use that), dabbing a little frosting on the bottom of the plate to secure it. Place a cake layer top side up on the plate. Using an offset spatula spread about half of the jam in a thin layer over the first cake layer, leaving about 1/4-inch border along the outside. Lay the second cake layer on top, stacking it as straight as possible. Using an offset spatula spread about 1 cup of the icing on the top layer. Place a third cake layer on top.<br> Spread remaining red raspberry jam over the cake layer and place the final layer on top, pressing down lightly to secure all 4 layers together. Spread about 3/4 of the remaining icing around the sides with a knife or offset spatula, then ice the top of the cake. Use an offset spatula to smooth icing as much as possible. Press plain or iced cookies around the sides, taking care to leave space to cut the cake. Garnish with additional candied almonds and sprinkle the top of the cake with pastel colored sanding sugars. Serve immediately or set aside at room temperature for up to 2 hours before serving. If refrigerating the cake, bring to room temperature 30 minutes before serving. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.<br> Beat the butter and both sugars in another medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs and vanilla mixing until fully incorporated. Slowly add the flour mixture, and continue beating just until the dough comes together, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br> Divide dough in half, pat into disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.<br> Generously flour a clean work surface. (For a nice, even layer of flour, lightly sift flour over the work surface.) Gently roll chilled dough about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into desired shape using a cookie cutter, working quickly enough so dough remains chilled. If dough gets too soft, refrigerate on a lined baking sheet until firm again, about 30 minutes.<br> Transfer cut cookies to un-greased baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between cookies. Refrigerate the formed cookies for at least 30 minutes. Lightly dust off excess flour with a dry pastry brush. (Excess dough can be pressed into a disk, chilled and rerolled.)<br> Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bake the cookies, until the bottoms are golden, about 12 to 15 minutes depending on shape. Cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool. Decorate as desired and serve. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40118,&quot;Baked and Fried Calzone 1 pound soprafina ricotta 3 tablespoons dried basil 3 tablespoons dried oregano 1 tablespoon butter 1/3 pounds fresh basil 2 cups pine nuts 1 3/4 cups shredded Parmesan 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 4 to 5 cloves garlic 2 balls store-bought dough Bench flour Marinara sauce, for dipping Italian Sausage, cooked Mushrooms, sliced Onions, sliced Baby spinach Roma Tomatoes, sliced Parmesan cheese, shredded Mozzarella cheese, shredded 2 eggs, beaten, for egg wash, if frying Instructions: For the ricotta: Combine ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir together. For the pesto: Combine garlic, basil, pine nuts and parmesan in a food processor. Slowly add olive oil as dry ingredients are processing. Preheat oven to 550 degrees F. Sprinkle flour on a wooden cutting board or preparation surface. Slap out the ball of dough into a circle about 1/4-inch thick. Spread a layer of pesto on dough a few inches across, leaving about 1-inch around the edges uncovered. Add ricotta and toppings and fold the dough over the toppings to create a \\half moon.\\ Press down along the edges to create a seal so the melted cheese will not leak out. Bake for 15 minutes on a pizza stone. Rotate halfway through to ensure they cook evenly. Serve with marinara sauce. To deep-fry: Preheat peanut oil to 350 degrees F. Use an egg wash to seal the edges of the dough. Place in the fryer basket and deep-fry for 6 to 8 minutes, until golden brown. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 40119,&quot;Charred Steak Pasta Salad Salt 3 cups fusilli 12 ounces steak Cut clove of peeled garlic 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons tarragon vinegar 1/3 cup each finely diced red, green and yellow bell pepper<br> 1/2 cup green or black olives (or a combination) packed in olive oil; chopped Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

The object here is to puncture the individual casings so that it is easier to force out the contents (as described in step 2). The depth of the incision, as well as your ability to slice a straight line, is of no consequence. Grab your largest pot and a common dinner knife. Hold the cob inside the pot. Starting at the top of the cob, run the backside of the blade down the cob, using pressure to force out the meat and milk from the casings. Be forewarned, this is a messy job (hence the pot) that requires a healthy amount of muscle power. If possible, do this outdoors. Discard the cobs and transfer the corn mash to a smaller pot. If you decide to add butter and/or chipotle do it here. Warm over a medium heat for a few watchful minutes, stirring frequently. If you warm corn for too long, or over too high a temperature, the natural liquids will evaporate and the corn will become gooey.

Let sit until the dates are softened, about 30 minutes. Using a blender or an immersion blender, blend the dates and water so no large chunks are left. Pour this mixture into a pot and place it over medium-high heat. Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent the dates from sticking to the bottom of the pot, until the mixture is no longer watery and has a creamy, almost pudding-like consistency, about 1 hour. Remove from the heat and let the mixture come to room temperature. Put a nut milk bag or large piece of cheesecloth in a colander and place it over a saucepan. Working in 2 batches, pour the date mixture into the nut milk bag and squeeze it over the colander to strain the liquid through. You should be left with 2 to 2 1/2 cups of liquid. What&#39;s left in the nut milk bag is date pulp, which can be saved for another use (see Cook&#39;s Note). Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring it to a simmer. Lower the heat to medium and simmer until the liquid is thickened, coats the back of a spoon and is reduced by one-half or more, depending on how thick you want your syrup, 30 to 40 minutes.

Butter three 9-inch round cake pans or line them with wax paper or parchment paper and butter the paper. Divide the Classic Vanilla Cake batter evenly among 5 small bowls. Add food coloring to each bowl--1 drop at a time--until the desired intensity of each color is reached. Scoop each color into a disposable pastry bag and snip the tip of the bag. I tie the ends of the pastry bags with plastic wrap or rubber bands to keep the batter in. Pipe the batter into the first pan, one color at a time, one over the next. (You could also use a spoon, but the pastry bags make this much easier.) Repeat with the remaining 2 pans. To make the tie dye effect, carefully drag a skewer completely through the batter from the center out to create a pattern with the colors. Don&#39;t overmix the colors. Bake until the middle of the cake feels springy when you gently press your finger against it, 35 to 40 minutes. Set the cakes aside to cool completely before icing. Level the cakes with a serrated knife. Place one layer on a cake turntable and frost the top with the Vanilla Icing. Add the second cake layer and frost the top. Place the third layer on top and cover the entire cake with a \\crumb\\ coat of vanilla icing. I do a crumb coat--a thin layer of icing spread around the cake to seal in all the crumbs and ensure a neat finish. Unless it&#39;s a chocolate cake, the crumb coat is done with vanilla icing. It looks so clean and creates a nice blank canvas for decorating. Divide the Vanilla Glaze between 2 mixing bowls. Add pink food coloring to one bowl and blue food coloring to the other bowl--1 drop at a time--until the desired intensity of each color is reached. The food coloring will thin out the glaze a bit. You can always add more liquid, but you can&#39;t take it away. Working with an offset spatula, spread pink glaze over the top of the cake and let it drip down the sides. Spread the blue glaze over the pink, but do not let it completely cover the pink. Finally, spoon more pink glaze onto the center of the cake top. Alternate the glazes just like you did with the batter. Use a skewer to pull the glaze from the center out to the edge and make the tie dye design. Work quickly before the glaze starts to dry. With a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whip the butter for 1 minute on high speed, then scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Add the granulated sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again. Add the vanilla extract. While mixing at medium-low speed, add the eggs one at a time. Scrape down the edges of the bowl midway through. Combine the flour, baking powder, and sea salt in a separate bowl. With the mixer on low speed, add half the flour mixture. When it&#39;s mostly incorporated, add half the milk. Add the remainder of the dry and wet ingredients, scraping down the sides of the bowl between additions. Stop mixing as soon as you have a smooth batter. With a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the butter on high speed for 1 minute. Add the vanilla and whip just to incorporate. In a separate bowl, mix the confectioners&#39; sugar and salt. With the mixer on low speed, add the sugar mixture 1 cup at a time until completely incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl between additions. Whip on high speed for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. With a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, and vanilla. Mix on low speed until smooth. If the glaze is too thick, add a little more milk to thin it to the desired consistency. If not using within 10 minutes of mixing, cover the bowl with plastic wrap to keep the glaze from drying out. Store at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40141,&quot;Custard Gelato 2 1/4 cups whole milk Pinch of salt 2/3 cup sugar 6 egg yolks 2/3 cup heavy cream Instructions: In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and salt. Heat the milk over medium heat until bubbles form around the edges of the pan. Set aside and cover to keep hot. In a blender or food processor, blend the sugar and egg yolks together until very thick and smooth. With the machine running, gradually add the hot milk. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of the spoon. Remove the pan from heat and set it in a bowl of ice water. Stir for 2 minutes to cool the mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, or until thoroughly chilled. In a deep bowl, beat the cream until soft peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the custard mixture. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 40142,&quot;Veal Saltimbocca 1 1/3 pounds thinly sliced veal medallions, from the butcher Salt and pepper 1/4 pound thinly sliced prosciutto Several sprigs fresh sage 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 4 turns of the pan 4 tablespoons butter 1 cup white wine, eyeball it 1/2 lemon, juiced Instructions: Season veal scallops with salt and pepper. Layer 1/2 of the medallions with 1 thin slice ham, folded to fit medallion. The edges of the ham can peak out a bit. Place 1 whole sage leaf on top of ham, then place another veal medallion on top of sage leaf. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter and saute 1/2 of the veal 2 to 3 minutes on the first side, 1 to 2 minutes on the second side. Transfer to a warm platter, then repeat with remaining veal. Transfer the last of the cooked meat to the warm platter and return pan to heat. Reduce heat to medium low. Add wine to veal pan and scrape up pan drippings with wine and add lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pan. Pour pan juices over veal and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 40143,&quot;Cheddar Potato Rolls 2 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese (about 8 ounces) Vegetable oil, for brushing 1 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 medium russet potato (7 to 8 ounces) 1 stick plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the baking dish 1/4 cup sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon mustard powder 2 large eggs, at room temperature Instructions: Combine 1 cup warm water (105 degrees F to 110 degrees F) and the yeast in a medium bowl; let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Sift 1 1/2 cups flour over the yeast; stir until mostly smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size with large bubbles on the surface, 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prick the potato all over with a fork; microwave until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool, then peel the potato and grate on the large holes of a box grater. Combine 1 stick butter, the sugar, salt and mustard powder in a stand mixer; beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs and grated potato until combined, then beat in the yeast mixture and 1 1/2 cups cheddar until incorporated. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually beat in the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour until the dough starts coming together in a soft, sticky ball. (You may not need all of the flour.) Gather into a loose ball and transfer to a lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 24 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, dusting with flour as needed, and arrange in the baking dish, slightly touching. Set aside until the rolls are lightly puffed, about 20 minutes. Lightly oil a sheet of foil and loosely cover the rolls, oiled-side down. Bake until just firm to the touch, about 30 minutes. Uncover, brush with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup cheddar. Continue baking until the rolls are golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 20 more minutes. Let cool at least 20 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40144,&quot;Eggplant Rollatini 1 medium eggplant, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices Salt<br> Olive oil<br> 1/2 bunch broccoli rabe<br> 1 cup ricotta 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella 1/2 cup Parmesan, plus more for sprinkling 1 egg<br> 1/2 red onion, diced<br> 1/4 cup vegetable stock Pinch crushed red pepper<br> 15 cherry tomatoes, halved<br> 1 clove garlic, smashed<br> 1 sprig fresh oregano, leaves coarsely chopped<br> 1 cup arugula<br> 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar 5 fresh basil leaves, cut into chiffonade<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the eggplant slices on a baking sheet; sprinkle with salt and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 15 minutes. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of ice water alongside. Add the broccoli rabe to the pot and cook for a few minutes. Transfer to the ice bath. Drain, pat dry and chop finely. Combine the broccoli rabe, ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan and egg in a food processor; process until smooth. Spread a thin layer of the filling onto each slice of eggplant. Roll the slices up tightly and place, seam-side down, in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Bake for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, sweat the onions in some olive oil in a medium pan, about 5 minutes.

Add the garlic, carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt, stir to combine and then partially cover with a lid. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are soft, about 6 minutes. Add the wine, bay leaves, thyme, crushed red pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt and simmer until most of the wine has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Nestle in the browned ribs (and any accumulated juices), then add the crushed tomatoes and 1 1/2 cups of water (it&#39;s nice to rinse the tomato can out with water and then use 1 1/2 cups of that \\tomato water). Bring to a high simmer, then adjust to a low simmer and cover the pot partially with the lid. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and falling apart and the sauce has reduced, about 2 hours. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the pot and add back into the sauce. Remove the pieces of pork and let them cool slightly; finely shred the meat, then stir back into the sauce. The sauce can now be finished and served or it can be cooled down, refrigerated and reheated the next day. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the pasta. Cook according to the package instructions, reserving about 1 cup of the cooking water. Stir the parsley into the sauce and adjust the seasoning to taste with salt.

Whisk in the flour, starting a few tablespoons at a time to prevent lumps, them whisk in the sugar, salt, and cardamom. Warm a griddle or a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Pour a thin film of oil onto the griddle and add a teaspoon or two of butter. Pour or spoon out the batter onto the hot griddle, where it should sizzle and hiss. A scant 2 tablespoons of batter will make a 3-inch pancake, about as large as you&#39;ll want to go with this batter. Because they spread so much, pour the batter out quickly, in one motion, then pause long enough for the previous pancake to firm, so that the cakes don&#39;t run into each other. Make as many cakes as you can fit without crowding. (Stir the batter up from the bottom each time you make a cake.) Cook the pancakes for about 1 minute, until their top surface is covered with tiny bubbles, like most American pancakes, or until the batter has lost its gloss and turned a couple of shades darker near the outside edges, depending on whether you&#39;ve used more or less flour, respectively. Flip the pancakes with a thin-bladed spatula and cook until the second side is golden brown, a minute or two longer. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding a bit more oil and butter to the griddle as needed.

(If you don&#39;t have two saucepans, you can execute this step in two stages using the same saucepan twice.) When the water comes to a boil, drop the shrimp into one pan and the scallops into the other. Cook the shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes, depending on their size, and the scallops for about 1 minute, until their color turns a flat white. Drain immediately. Shell the shrimp leaving the tails on, remove the vein that runs down the center of the back, and put them in a bowl with the drained scallops. Peel 4 oranges with a sharp paring knife, removing the peel and the pith. Slip the blade in between the sections to detach the pulp from the thin membrane that encloses each section. Lift out the membrane-less sections and remove any seeds. Set aside. Detach the lettuce leaves from the head, discarding any bruised or wilted leaves. Wash the leaves in several changes of cold water and shake dry in a towel or in a salad spinner. Cut the leaves into strips about 1/2-inch wide. Cut the remaining orange in half and squeeze out the juice. Combine the shrimp, scallops, and orange sections in a bowl. Add the orange juice, salt, olive oil, and liberal grindings of pepper and toss thoroughly. Choose a shallow-- neither too deep nor too flat-- serving platter. Line it with strips of lettuce and top them with the shrimp, scallops, and orange sections, distributing evenly over them all the seasonings in the bowl. Serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 40191,&quot;Milk Chocolate Cupcakes with Dark Chocolate Icing 3 eggs 1 (18 1/4-ounce) box milk chocolate cake mix 1/3 cup canola or vegetable oil 1 1/4 cups chocolate milk 1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, divided 1/2 cup heavy cream Small silver dragees, for decorating Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line 2 (10-inch) (25 centimeters) cake tins with greaseproof paper and rub with a little butter. In a mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until fluffy. Add the eggs, flour, baking powder, and cocoa powder. Mix well and divide into the cake tins. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C/gas 4) until firm but soft. So, you have 7 to 8 minutes, while the sponge is cooking, to make the filling. Add the ricotta to a food processor and blitz with the sugar until shiny and smooth. Scoop into a bowl, add the chopped fruit, cherries, chocolate, and almonds and stir together. Now add the coffee to taste (bash the hell out of the beans using something heavy wrapped in a tea towel, or use a coffee grinder if you don&#39;t like too much noise?). Whip up the egg whites and fold into the ricotta mix. By now, the sponge is probably ready. Turn it out while it is still hot and cut it into 8 wedges. Line a shallow round bowl, about 9-inches (23 centimeters) across, with two sheets of cling film, making sure it fits the shape of the bowl. Then fit half of the sponge pieces neatly around the insides of the bowl (as you would if you were making summer pudding). Drizzle with liqueur, then pour in the ricotta mixture. Level it out, then place the remaining sponge over the top. Drizzle again with liqueur. Pull the cling film over the top and weigh it down with some plates, pushing down on them before placing in the freezer for at least 4 hours. Serve this &#39;semi freddo&#39; (semi frozen), dusted with cocoa powder and sliced into wedges. If it&#39;s very frozen then that&#39;s fine; just pull it out of the fridge when dinner is served so it can slowly thaw as you are eating. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 40211,&quot;Buttermilk-Brined Turkey Breast 1 (2 1/2 to 3-pound) turkey breast, bone-in 3 cups buttermilk 1/2 cup hot sauce (recommended: Crystal) 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon dried basil 1 tablespoon granulated garlic 1 tablespoon fresh cracked black pepper 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon ground white pepper Instructions: Combine all the ingredients together in a large re-sealable plastic bag.

Blend in the flour and cream to make a stiff dough. Chill at least 30 minutes or until firm. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 to 1/16-inch thickness and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. (The thinner you roll the dough, the crispier the cookies will be). Place about 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake cookies for 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned. Slide cookies and parchment off the baking sheet onto the countertop to cool. Dip cooled cookies into melted white chocolate to decorate, or decorate with Royal Icing. Mix all of the ingredients together using an electric hand mixer, until the icing is smooth and thin enough to be pressed through a pastry bag with a writing tip. Add more lemon juice, if necessary. Gingerbread House/Box: Cut paper patterns for the gingerbread house: Five rectangles, 3 by 5 inches, to make the floor, walls and roof of the house, and two pieces for the ends of the house, 3 inches wide at the base, 3 inches to the roof line, and slanted to a peak 5 1/2 inches from the bottom. Roll gingerbread dough out to edges on a large, rimless cookie sheet. Place paper patterns onto the rolled out dough. With a sharp, straight edged knife, cut around each of the pieces, but leave pieces in place. Bake at 375 degrees F for about 15 minutes until dough feels firm. Place patterns on top of the gingerbread again and trim shapes, cutting edges with a straight-edged sharp knife. Leave to cool on baking sheet. Place royal icing into pastry bag with a writing tip and press out to decorate individual parts of house, piping on decorations, windows, door, etc., as desired. Let dry until hardened.

If the tortillas are fresh, spread them in a single layer and let them dry out for 5 minutes. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Fry the tortillas, one at a time, for 2 or 3 seconds per side, just to soften them. Drain them on paper towels. Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-low and wait a few minutes for it to cool down. Break 6 of the eggs into the skillet and let them cook slowly until set (cover the skillet if you like the yolk firm). Season the eggs with salt and pepper to taste and transfer them to a roasting pan to keep warm in the oven. Add a little more oil to the pan, if necessary, and fry the remaining 6 eggs in the same way. Dip each tortilla quickly in the warm sauce and place it on a warmed breakfast plate. Spread some of the refried beans evenly on the tortilla and top with 2 fried eggs. Spoon more of the sauce generously over the edges of each tortilla and the whites of the eggs. Garnish with the crema and the avocado, then sprinkle with the crumbled cheese, parsley, and cilantro and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 40226,&quot;Mini German Pancakes with Apple-Calvados Caramel Sauce 1 cup milk 1 heaping tablespoon granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 6 eggs 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled 1/2 teaspoon salt Nonstick cooking spray Apple-Calvados Caramel Sauce, recipe follows 1/4 cup powdered sugar mixed with 1 heaping teaspoon ground cinnamon 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 Gala apple, peeled, cored and diced 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and diced 1 cup packed light brown muscovado sugar 1/4 cup calvados 1/4 cup heavy cream 3 fresh mint leaves, torn, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Melt lard in a heavy 6 to 8-quart Dutch oven. Add the beef cubes to the oil and brown. Work in batches if necessary, removing cubes as they are browned. Don&#39;t overcrowd the pan. Add onions to the pot. Heat should be low in order not to brown the onions. When onions become glossy, add back the seared beef. Stir. Meanwhile, chop and crush the garlic with the caraway seeds and a little salt; use the flat side of a heavy knife. Take kettle from heat. Stir in paprika and the garlic mixture. Stir rapidly with a wooden spoon. Immediately after paprika is absorbed, add 2 1/2 quarts warm water. (Cool water toughens meat if you add it with the meat is frying.) Replace covered kettle over low heat and cook for about 1 hour. While the braising is going on, peel the tomato, then cut into 1-inch pieces. Core green peppers and slice into rings. Peel potatoes and cut into 3/4-inch dice. After the meat has been braised for about 1 hour (the time depends on the cut of the meat), add the tomato and green peppers and enough water to give a soup consistency. Add a little salt. Simmer slowly for another 30 minutes. Add potatoes and cook the gulyas till done. Adjust salt. Add hot cherry pepper pods if you want to make the stew spicy hot. Cook the dumplings in the stew. Serve the gulyas steaming hot in large, extra-deep bowls. The meat should be tender, but not falling apart. Mix the egg with flour and salt. Spoon the mixture into boiling soup, using 1/4 teaspoon at a time. Cook in the soup for 2 or 3 minutes just before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 40248,&quot;Strawberry Balsamic \\BLT<br> 2 cups fresh strawberries, tops removed and sliced thin top to bottom 8 slices honey oat bread<br> 1 1/2 cups shaved iceberg<br> Mauro Method Bacon, recipe follows Balsamic Black Pepper Mayo, recipe follows 12 slices thick-cut bacon 1 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon balsamic glaze<br> 1 tablespoon fresh basil chiffonade 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt Instructions: Arrange an even layer of strawberry slices on 4 slices of bread.

I cooked them all the way through as I would a baked potato. I tried roasting them a second time replacing the olive oil with hazelnut oil for even tastier results. Now, the vegetable risks to take over my produce life as I know it! I cut some into thin rounds, fried them and sprinkled them over an arugula salad. Delicious. I thought I had reached my peak with these preparations until I tasted this soup...The combination of roasting and stewing them yields a complex flavor. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place 1/2 the Jerusalem artichokes on a baking sheet. Drizzle them with 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the tray in the center of the oven and cook until they are completely yielding when pierced with the tip of a knife, 30 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the rest of the Jerusalem artichokes in 1/2-inch thick slices. Heat a medium pot and add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes. Add the thyme and the Jerusalem artichokes slices and stir to blend the ingredients. Check the seasoning. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes and add 4 cups water. Cook until the Jerusalem artichokes are completely tender, 25 to 30 minutes. If the liquid reduces too much during this cooking time, add the remaining 1 cup water. Remove the roasted ones from the oven, quarter them and add them directly to the soup mixture. Taste for seasoning. Remove the thyme from the pot. Add the cream. Puree the soup in small batches in the blender (or a hand blender) until smooth. For a more \\rustic\\ texture, puree only 1/2 and leaving the other 1/2 \\chunky.\\ Serve with crusty sourdough or a seeded bread to bring out the naturally nutty flavor of the soup. Serving suggestion: Crusty sourdough bread or seeded bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 40250,&quot;Tuscan Rosemary-Smoked Whole Chickens 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1/2 cup kosher salt 1/4 cup clover honey 2 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons black peppercorns 8 large sprigs fresh rosemary 4 cloves garlic, smashed 4 cups ice cubes One 4-pound chicken, excess fat trimmed Canola oil Freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: For the brine, bring 6 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan.

Combine the herbs and garlic in a food processor and finely chop. Add the oil, vinegar, water, salt, pepper and hot pepper flakes and process to make a thick sauce. Correct the seasoning, adding salt or vinegar, to taste. The chimichurri should be highly seasoned. Pour a 1/4 of the chimichurri into a baking dish just large enough to hold the tenderloin. Holding the knife parallel to the cutting board, cut the tenderloin lengthwise into 4 flat even slices. Place each slice between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound with the side of a cleaver (or a scaloppini pounder) to a thickness of 1/4-inch. Arrange the steaks on top of the chimichurri in the baking dish. Pour another 1/4 of the chimichurri on top. Marinate the beef for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to high. If using charcoal, toss the chips directly on the coals. If using gas, place them in the smoker box and preheat until you see smoke. If your grill lacks a smoker box, use a foil smoking pouch. Arrange the beef slices on the grate on the diagonal and grill until cooked to taste, about 2 minutes a side for medium-rare, rotating the slices 90 degrees after 1 minute to create an attractive crosshatch of grill marks.

In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and heat until very hot. Season the steak with salt and pepper. Turn on the exhaust fan and put the steak in the pan; stand back to prevent being splattered. Cook until the steak is brown on the first side, about 2 minutes; brown on the other side. Remove the steak to a rack or baking pan until you are ready to finish cooking it. When ready, put the steak into the oven and cook until done to your liking, about 10 minutes for rare. Remove the steak to a carving board and let it rest for 5 minutes. Peel and cut the onions into thirds or quarters, depending on their size. Leave as much root on as possible to keep the wedges from falling apart. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in the same skillet used to cook the meat over medium-high heat until hot. Add the onions, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Season them with salt and pepper. Place the pan of onions in the oven and roast until tender and very browned (the onions tend to char around the edges), 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the onions from the oven, add the garlic, and cook briefly until light brown. Add the thyme and stir. Add the vinegar (stand back so as to not get splattered) and toss well with the onions. Stir and scrape up all the browned bits clinging to the bottom of the pan. To serve, cut the meat off the bone, then carve it into thin slices. Put 1 slice of meat on each crostini and top with the roasted onions. Pour any juices from the carving board over the crostini. Serve immediately. Chef&#39;s Note: In order to cook the meat in the shortest amount of time and thus extract the most flavor, the meat must be at room temperature. Afterward, the meat must rest before carving. If this procedure is followed, the carving knife glides right through the steak. A 1 1/2 pound porterhouse should give you about 14 ounces of meat off the bone, enough for 3 or even 4 people. However, if you are steak lovers, you might want to buy 2 steaks of that size for 4 people.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and salt until smooth. Whisk in the egg yolks. While whisking the eggs, slowly drizzle in 1/3 cup of the warm milk to temper the yolks. Pour the entire egg mixture into the saucepan of warm milk and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until a few bubbles pop to the surface and the mixture is thick like pudding, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the pistachios, vanilla and almond extracts and food coloring, if using, and stir to combine. Transfer the cream to a clean bowl. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours. (It can also be made a day ahead.) When the dough has doubled, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Punch the dough down and roll out on a floured surface to about 1/2-inch thickness. Use a 2-inch cutter to cut as many rounds as possible; you should get about 18 rounds. Place the rounds on the baking sheet. (You can re-roll the scraps once more, if necessary, to get 18, but re-rolling more than once will make the bomboloni tough.) Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until puffy, up to 30 minutes (or a little less if your kitchen is very warm). Meanwhile, heat about 2 inches of neutral oil in a Dutch oven to 350 degrees F. Set a cooling rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Spread some sugar in a small bowl. Fry the rounds in 2 batches, turning once, until puffed and golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes total per batch. Remove to the cooling rack. While still hot, roll in the sugar to fully coat. Let cool completely. Put the chilled pastry cream in a pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip. To fill, insert the tip straight down in the top of a bombolone and wiggle the tip to make a little space. Fill the space with the pastry cream. Fill all of the bomboloni, then garnish with pistachios and serve right away. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>Note: The wine pairing suggestions are based on general guidelines and may not be suitable for everyone&#39;s taste preferences.

Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, and continue to bake for approximately 50 minutes, or until the middle of the pie is bubbling. During this cooking time, brush the lattice with milk and sprinkle with granulated sugar. If the edges start to brown too much, cover loosely with foil or a tart ring turned upside down. Remove the pie from the oven and cool on rack. Let the pie cool for 3 to 4 hours to let the filling set up. Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla bean ice cream if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40306,&quot;Fresh Ricotta Crostini 4 cups whole milk 3 tablespoons lemon juice, plus the zest of 1 lemon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 baguette, sliced and toasted Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving Instructions: Lay three layers of cheesecloth over a colander. Add the milk to a large heavy pot and place over medium-high heat. Stir in the lemon juice and salt and heat until an instant-read thermometer reaches 175 degrees F. The milk will begin to just bubble and start to steam. At this temperature you&#39;ll begin to see the curds separate from the whey. Be mindful of over stirring the ricotta while the curds are forming, you don&#39;t want to make your ricotta stiff. Let it sit for 5 minutes undisturbed and you will be left with a very creamy and pleasant finished result.<br> Gently remove the curds from the pot to the colander. Use the side of the cheesecloth to very gently release some of the liquid. Tie up the curds using butcher&#39;s twine and let drain for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the cheesecloth and place in a bowl. Serve warm on toasted bread with lemon zest and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 40307,&quot;Peppercorn Chicken with Lemon Spinach 3 tablespoons dijon mustard 3 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1 3/4 pounds) 2 to 3 teaspoons coarsely ground mixed peppercorns 3/4 teaspoon finely minced fresh rosemary Kosher salt 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 shallots, thinly sliced 1/3 cup brandy or red wine 1/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 pound spinach 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a small bowl, whisk together the olives, cilantro, oil, vinegar, and salt, and pepper to make a light vinaigrette. Drizzle the dressing over the rice and toss to coat completely. In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil, then add the onions and cook over medium heat until very tender and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne, and lemon zest and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chickpeas and stir to coat. Turn the heat up to high and deglaze the pan with the wine. Remove the pan from the heat, season with salt, and pepper, to taste and set aside. Place the eggplant cubes in a colander and salt liberally. Let rest for 20 to 30 minutes and then blot with paper towels. In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and cook the onions until tender. Add the blotted eggplant. The eggplant will absorb the oil, but only add more if the eggplant is very dry. Cook for 5 minutes on medium heat, turning occasionally. Add the garlic, and lower the heat, adding a little more oil, if necessary. Season the mixture with salt, and pepper, to taste and cook until the eggplant is tender, about 3 or 4 more minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook for a minute to soften just a little and force the juices to release. Turn off the heat. Season with salt, and pepper, and set aside.

Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Saute the onions until lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the apricots to the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Heat the apricots just until their skins begin to soften, for no more than 2 to 3 minutes so the fruit keeps its shape. Add the herbs, 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the pan and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool. Meanwhile, prepare 4 (3 to 4-inch) ring molds by lining them with prosciutto slices. Each mold gets 4 slices of prosciutto, which you&#39;ll overlap so that the entire mold is covered but open with room for the apricot filling. Once you&#39;ve draped prosciutto over all 4 molds, spoon in the apricot mixture, filling each mold to the top. Lift the prosciutto slices that are resting open over the mold&#39;s edge and drape the slices over the apricot filling, gently patting into place. When you unmold these, the prosciutto should completely encase the apricot filling. Set the filled molds aside while you dress the greens. In a small bowl, whisk the remaining olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper. Place the greens in a medium bowl, spoon on a little of the vinaigrette - just enough so each leaf is lightly coated - and gently toss. Divide the greens evenly between four individual salad plates. Unmold each prosciutto ring by turning it upside down and over the greens. Drizzle any remaining vinaigrette around the prosciutto ring and top the salad with the shaved sheep&#39;s cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 40324,&quot;Artichoke Risotto: Risotto Coi Carciofi 1 quart chicken stock 10 baby artichokes 1 lemon, juiced 1 onion, chopped 1 clove garlic, chopped 1 tablespoon virgin olive oil 1 pound arborio rice 1/2 cup dry white wine 1/4 cup grated Sicilian pecorino 2 tablespoon fresh minced Italian parsley 1 sprig thyme, leaves removed 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper Instructions: Bring the chicken stock to a boil over high heat.

Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Halve lengthwise, discard the seeds, then cut into 1-inch dice. Place in a large bowl. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter ceases to foam and has turned a light brown, pull the pan off the heat and immediately add the sage, rosemary, sugar, vinegar (stand back so as not to get splattered), and molasses. Mix well and bring up to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour the vinegar mixture over the squash and toss well, then transfer to a heavy rimmed baking sheet or baking dish large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. Place in the oven and roast, tossing at least once, until very tender and caramelized, about 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm, so the liquids are runny. Working in batches, if necessary, transfer the warm squash and all the cooking liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40332,&quot;STIR FRIED WILD RICE WITH APPLES AND SUN-DRIED CHERRIES 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons finely minced onions 1 tablespoon curry powder 1 apple, peeled, cored, and cut into small cubes 1 cup chopped mushrooms 1/4 cup sun dried cherries 1 1/2 cups cooked wild rice Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste Instructions: Heat saute pan.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise with a paring knife, and scrape down the length with the back of the knife to remove the seeds. Add the seeds, granulated and brown sugars, butter and shortening to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and beat on medium-high speed until the mixture looks pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition, and beat for 3 minutes, scraping down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula halfway through. Add the peppermint extract and food coloring to the milk, reduce the mixer speed to low and add the milk to the sugar-egg mixture (it may appear curdled, but that&#39;s OK). Mix until combined, then slowly add the flour mixture, continuing to mix, without overmixing, until the batter is smooth and uniform. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch round tip or a resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off to make a 1/2-inch opening. Pipe rounded-tablespoon-sized mounds of the dough about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake until the cakes are set and springy when gently touched, about 10 minutes. Let the cakes cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then gently transfer them to a wire rack with a spatula to cool completely. For the filling: Beat the cream cheese and butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar, and beat until the mixture is smooth and light. Add the bourbon, and beat for 1 minute more (the filling will be very soft). For the mint sugar: Put the granulated sugar and mint in a food processor or mini processor, and process until the mint is finely chopped and the sugar is green. To assemble: Pipe or spoon the filling onto the flat side of half the cakes, leaving a small border. Place another cake, flat-side down, on top of each iced cake to create sandwiches, and gently press in place. Roll the edge (with exposed filling) of each whoopie pie in mint sugar. Refrigerate them in a single layer until the filling is set, about 30 minutes. (Whoopie pies can be made the day before, refrigerated in an airtight container in a single layer and served the next day.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40354,&quot;Cajun Omelet 3 eggs 2 to 3 links pre-cooked sausages, sliced 1/2 green pepper, chopped 2 slices chopped onions 3 slices chopped tomatoes 1 tablespoon chicken Cajun spice 2 slices mozzarella cheese Home fries, optional Instructions: In a bowl, mix eggs. Then add sausage, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and Cajun spice. In a large frying pan, heat oil over medium high heat. Pour mixture into pan. Flip over when browned. Then add mozzarella cheese.

Drain and set aside. Heat the stock to a gentle simmer in a saucepan. In a large saucepan, gently saute the shallots and pumpkin in the oil for about 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook for a further 2 minutes to toast the grains. Pour in the wine and cook until reduced right down. Now pour in one-fourth of the stock and stir well. Cook gently until the liquid has been absorbed, then stir in another ladleful of stock. Continue cooking and stirring, gradually adding the stock, until the rice grains are just tender and the risotto is creamy. The whole process should take about 15 minutes. About 2 minutes before the end of cooking, stir in the pancetta, mascarpone, and half the Parmesan. Check the seasoning, then serve in warm bowls, sprinkled with the remaining Parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti Classico, Rioja]&quot; 40356,&quot;Ricotta With Balsamic Berries 1 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1 sprig mint<br> Sliced strawberries and/or blackberries, for serving<br> Fresh ricotta, for serving<br> Instructions: Boil the vinegar, honey and mint sprig in a small saucepan until syrupy, about 7 minutes.

Cover and cook over medium-high heat until the kernels pop. Add the remaining kernels, cover, and remove from the heat for 30 seconds. Return the pan to the heat; within a minute you should hear the kernels start to pop. Cook, gently shaking the pan occasionally, until the popping sound slows down, about 2 minutes. Towards the end of popping, lift up the lid slightly to let out the steam to help keep the popcorn crisp. Wait 5 seconds and pour the popcorn into a large paper bag. Melt the butter in the popcorn saucepan and drizzle it over the popcorn. Shake the bag, then add the gorgonzola powder, salt, pepper and hickory smoke powder. Shake the bag once more to coat all the kernels.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40358,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Very Peri Grilled Chicken 2 pints cherry tomatoes 6 Thai bird chiles<br> 2 small red onions, peeled and quartered<br> 2 orange bell peppers, halved<br> 2 red bell peppers, halved<br> 2 red jalapeno peppers, halved<br> 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons light brown sugar<br> 4 cloves garlic, smashed<br> Kosher salt<br> 4 bone-in, skinless chicken legs 4 bone-in, skinless chicken thighs<br> 2 bone-in, skinless chicken breasts, cut in half<br> 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> Instructions: For the sauce: Preheat half of a grill to 400 degrees F. Using an upside-down wire cooling rack or a grill basket over the direct-heat side of the grill, add the tomatoes, Thai bird chiles, onions, bell peppers and jalapeno peppers. Roast, tossing and flipping until everything is charred, 20 to 25 minutes. Boil vegetables: Add the charred vegetables to a medium pot along with the vinegar, sugar, garlic, a pinch of salt and enough water to just cover the vegetables. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then blend until smooth. Pass the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer. For the chicken: Add the chicken, 1/2 cup sauce and vegetable oil to a large resealable bag. Mix and seal, then marinate for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature. Preheat half of a grill to 400 degrees F. Remove chicken from bag, discard marinade and pat chicken dry. Place chicken, smooth-side down, over direct heat to char, then flip and finish cooking over indirect heat for a total of 10 to 15 minutes depending on piece and heat. Brush the chicken with sauce the last few minutes of grilling. Serve with more sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 40359,&quot;Healthy Slow Cooker Chili 8 ounces cage-free boneless chicken breasts, cubed 8 ounces ground lean turkey 3/4 cup canned small black beans 3/4 cup canned great Northern white beans 4 cups no-sodium/MSG chicken or vegetable broth 2 cups canned organic low-sodium tomato sauce 1 cup canned no-sodium stewed tomatoes 1/4 cup lime juice 3/4 cup chopped celery 3/4 cup corn (frozen, canned or fresh) 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped 1/2 orange bell pepper, chopped 1/2 red bell pepper, chopped 1/2 yellow bell pepper, chopped 1/2 fresh jalapeno, minced 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 tablespoons chili powder 2 teaspoons ground cumin Instructions: Place the chicken and turkey in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook until slightly browned.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Beat the sugar, butter and eggs with a mixer for about 30 seconds. Add the vanilla and beat for 30 seconds more. Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, alternating with the milk and beating until smooth. Using an ice cream scoop, drop mounds of the batter (about 1/2 cup for each) onto the lined baking sheet (6 per sheet as they will spread when baking). Bake for 15 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining batter. For the marshmallow filling: Whisk together the sugar, honey, vanilla, egg whites and 2 tablespoons water (30ml) in a large heatproof bowl using a hand mixer. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Beat with the mixer until the mixture is thick, creamy and stands in peaks, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and beat for a minute or so more, then let cool completely. (You can keep the marshmallow filling in the refrigerator until ready to use.) Spread a generous amount of filling on the flat side (bottom) of a chocolate cake. Sandwich with another cake, pressing down gently to spread the filling evenly. Repeat to make 8 whoopie pies. Serve immediately or wrap the whoopie pies individually in plastic wrap (they can be frozen). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40361,&quot;Cream Cheese Roll-Ups Two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened 4 ounces jarred salsa (hot) 4 green onions, finely sliced<br> 4 large flour tortillas<br> 10 slices bacon, cut into small pieces and cooked till crisp<br> 16 thin slices deli ham<br> Instructions: In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, salsa and onions until fully combined. Spread the tortillas with the mixture, leaving a 1/2-inch edge. Top each with bacon and ham, then roll into tight cylinders and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least one hour. Remove from fridge, discard the plastic wrap and cut each roll into 1-inch pieces, discarding the uneven ends (or eating them while preparing, like I did!). Each roll should yield eight pieces. If you like, before cutting, stick toothpicks in the rolls at 1-inch intervals; it makes serving a snap. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 40362,&quot;Jalapeno Poppers 20 fresh jalapenos, 2 to 3 inches in size Two 8-ounce packages cream cheese, slightly softened<br> 1 pound thin (regular) bacon, slices cut in half<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Set a wire rack over a baking sheet. If you have them, slip on some latex gloves for the pepper prep. Cut the jalapenos in half lengthwise. With a spoon, remove the seeds and white membranes (the source of the heat; leave a little if you like things HOT). Smear cream cheese into each jalapeno half and then wrap with a bacon piece (1/2 slice). Secure by sticking a toothpick through the middle. Place on the rack in the baking sheet. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes. (You don&#39;t want the bacon pieces to shrink so much they start to squeeze the jalapenos.) If after 45 minutes the bacon doesn&#39;t look brown enough, just keep cooking until the bacon is sizzling. Serve immediately, or they&#39;re also great at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 40363,&quot;Sweet and Spicy Couscous Salad with Grapes 2 cups chicken stock 1 1/2 cups instant couscous 1 cup seedless California grapes 1/2 cup pine nuts or slivered almonds 1/2 cup dried apricots, sliced 1/2 cup green onions, sliced 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped 1/8 cup fresh mint, chopped 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 cup olive oil 1/2 cup lemon juice Instructions: Bring stock to a boil in a medium saucepan and stir in couscous.

Toss with the oil, dill, vinegar, salt and pepper. Refrigerate and let the flavors meld while you make the rest of the components. For the horseradish-pickle mustard: Combine the mustard, horseradish and pickle in a small bowl. For the latke bun: Peel the potatoes and onion and shred them in a food processor fitted with the grater attachment; transfer to a dish towel-lined strainer fitted over a large bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes, and then squeeze the veggies using the towel to get out the excess moisture. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the matzo meal, egg and a pinch each of salt and pepper and use your hands to mix them together. Fill a large cast-iron skillet with 1/2 inch oil. Heat over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot but not smoking. Working in batches, scoop the potato mixture by 1/3-cupfuls and form a bun shape. Carefully add the latkes to the skillet, flattening each slightly with a spatula. Fry, turning the latkes once, until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Remove any loose bits of potato mixture from the oil in the pan between batches with a slotted spoon. You should have 12 bun halves. For the corned beef burger: Pulse the corned beef in a food processor fitted with the blade attachment until a coarse burger-like consistency. Add the egg and matzo meal and pulse just to combine. Form into 6 burger patties (about 1/4 cup each). Add enough oil to a large cast-iron skillet to coat the pan and heat over over medium heat. Working in batches, cook the burgers until the outsides are brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per side. The insides will still feel on the rare side, and that&#39;s ok...and delicious. To build, schmear 6 latke buns with applesauce. Top each with a corned-beef burger, then a pile of slaw. Schmear some horseradish-pickle mustard on the remaining 6 latkes, and place on top of the slaw.

This will reveal the beans in their thin skin from which they must also be removed. Do this by bringing a pot of water to a boil, add the beans to the pot and blanchcook for 2 to 3 minutes before straining the favas and shocking in an ice bath of cold water. The thin skin can now be peeled entirely off by hand to reveal the sweet fava bean. It is now ready to be added to any dish and only requires a few moments of additional cooking time. Clean the morels carefully and trim off the bottom of the stem. Remove all dirt and debris by soaking them in several changes of clean cold water. Next, lay the morels out on paper towels to absorb the excess moisture and air dry. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. In a saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the morels and saute 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shallots and cook for 3 additional minutes. Add the fish stock and braise the morels for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the fava beans and white wine to the morels and continue to cook another 3 minutes. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper and add the fresh thyme leaves. Swirl in the cold butter to allow the butter, which adds a creamy texture to the dish, to melt but not separate. Remove promptly from the heat and place the morels and fava beans on a warm serving platter. While the morels and fava beans are cooking begin to cook the whitefish by seasoning the fish with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining olive oil in a second saute pan. Add the fish fillets to the hot oil, skin side down and cook the fillets 2 1/2 to 3 minutes on each side, before removing and placing on the serving platter with the morels and favas. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 40377,&quot;Slow Cooker Chili 3 tablespoons canola oil 2 pounds ground beef chuck, broken apart Kosher salt 2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped 8 medium cloves garlic, minced 1 Fresno cl, halved, seeded, cut into 1/2 inch slices 1 red bell pepper, halved, seeded, cut into 1/2 inch slices 3 tablespoons tomato paste 1 (28 ounce) can whole, peeled tomatoes 2 tablespoons chili powder 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon allspice 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed Shredded cheddar Sour cream Sliced avocado Thinly sliced scallions Lime wedges Tortilla chips Instructions: Brown the meat: In a large saute pan heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat.

Butter two 8-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper, butter the parchment and dust with flour, tapping out excess. Whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the melted butter, buttermilk, egg, vanilla and 1/2 cup water together in another bowl until smooth. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking until just combined. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans, smoothing the tops. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through cooking, until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Transfer the cakes to a rack and let cool 15 minutes. Invert the cakes on the rack, discard the parchment paper then flip the cakes right-side-up again. Move the rack with the cakes over a baking sheet and let the cakes cool completely. Make the raspberry mousse: In a small saucepan, mash the raspberries with the sugar and salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until thickened and jammy, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, press the raspberry mixture through a sieve into the bowl of a food processor and let cool completely. Combine the gelatin with 1 tablespoon cold water in a small bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Heat the gelatin in the microwave until it melts completely, about 10 seconds, stirring to dissolve. Add the gelatin mixture, cream cheese and sour cream to the food processor and process until smooth. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and refrigerate, checking every 5 minutes, until the mousse is just set enough to spread, 5 to 15 minutes. (Do not let the mousse firm up too much.) Place one cake layer on a cake stand and pile the raspberry mousse in the center, spreading it in a thick layer almost to the edge. Top with the remaining cake, aligning the layers directly on top of each other so the cake does not lean. Refrigerate the assembled cake for 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the chocolate ganache: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan then remove from heat. Add the chocolate, shaking the pan gently to submerge it. Allow the pan to stand, off the heat, for 3 minutes to melt the chocolate. Whisk the ganache smooth, then refrigerate until it is just thick enough to spread (like mayonnaise), about 5 minutes. (Do not let the ganache harden too much.) Stir the ganache again and scoop it on top of the cake, spreading it over the top and sides. Refrigerate the cake until the ganache is set, at least 2 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Port]</p><p>Note: The wine pairing suggestions are based on general guidelines and may vary depending on personal taste preferences.&quot; 40389,&quot;Fettuccine with Mustard Greens and Mushrooms 10 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little more as necessary, divided 6 cups roughly chopped fresh mushrooms such as shiitake or morel Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoon minced garlic 2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 4 cups double-strength chicken broth or 4 cups canned low-salt chicken broth boiled until reduced by half 6 cups packed roughly chopped mustard greens, green chard, or spinach 1 1/2 pound dried fettuccine 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley About 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions:</p><ol><li>Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush a sheet pan with oil, then line it with parchment paper. Place the phyllo vertically in front of your on your work surface. Using a sharp knife, cut lengthwise into 4 equal columns. Stack and cover with a dry kitchen towel and immediately on top of that place a damp kitchen towel. Remove the first phyllo sheet and place it vertically in front of you. Brush lightly with olive oil. Place another sheet on top and brush that lightly, too. Place a teaspoon of the filling on the bottom right-hand corner of the phyllo and fold up like a flag in order to form a small triangle. Place on the baking sheet seam side down. Cover with a kitchen towel as you continue with the remaining filling and phyllo. Brush all the triangles with olive oil. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the triangles are lightly golden and puffy. Remove and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 40394,&quot;Spicy Red Lentil Salad with Pickled Vegetables 1 pound red lentils 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 bay leaf Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 12 ounces giardiniera 6 cups lightly packed baby arugula 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon sugar Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: For the lentils: Set a large saucepan over high heat. Add the lentils and toast in the dry pan until they just turn in color a little (this will give the finished lentils a little texture), 20 to 30 seconds. Add 3 1/2 cups water, the cumin, red pepper flakes, bay leaf and some salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the lentils are tender and all the liquid has been absorbed, about 12 minutes. Pour the lentils out onto a flat platter in a thin layer so they cool faster and don&#39;t get too soft. Cool in the refrigerator for 5 minutes. For the salad: Drain the giardiniera, reserving 1 tablespoon of the pickling juice, and roughly chop. Wash the arugula and dry well. For the vinaigrette: In a large mixing bowl, make a quick vinaigrette by combining the reserved pickling juice with the red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sugar, and some salt and pepper. While whisking, add the olive oil to emulsify. Assemble the salad in a large bowl by folding the giardiniera in with the lentils. Dress lightly with the vinaigrette and serve immediately over the arugula. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 40395,&quot;Quick and Easy Muffin Tin Cheesesteaks Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the muffin tin 1 pound pizza dough in a can<br> 8 slices sharp provolone cheese<br> 1 pound thinly sliced rare roast beef, such as Boar&#39;s Head Caramelized Onions, recipe follows Sliced pickled banana peppers, for topping 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 yellow onion, sliced thin<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray. Roll out the pizza dough into a flat rectangle (12 by 14 inches) and cut the dough in half, making two 7-by-12-inch rectangles. Layer half the provolone on one of the rectangles in a single layer, leaving 1 inch around the edge. Then layer half the roast beef, followed by half the Caramelized Onions and some banana peppers. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings. Tightly roll up each portion of dough into a long log. Cut each log into 6 pieces and place each piece into a cup of the prepared muffin tin. Bake until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool, then pop out using a butter knife. Serve! Set a skillet over medium-low heat and add the oil. Add the sliced onions and stir to combine with the oil. Season the onions with salt and pepper and cook, undisturbed, until the bottoms of the onions begin to caramelize, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir only once and then continue to cook, undisturbed, until the onions are golden and soft, another 5 minutes. Add water if necessary to help deglaze the pan throughout the cooking process. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 40396,&quot;Strawberry Meringue Clouds 3 large egg whites, at room temperature 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch fine sea salt 3/4 cup superfine baker&#39;s sugar 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 cup sliced freeze-dried strawberries, coarsely chopped Zest of 1/2 large lemon Instructions: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 200 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt until the mixture holds soft peaks, about 1 minute. With the machine running on medium-high speed, add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture is thick and holds stiff peaks, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the vanilla extract. Using a spatula, fold in the strawberries and lemon zest, taking care not to deflate the batter. Using a 1/4-cup-size ice cream scoop, scoop heaped mounds of batter onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing each about 2 inches apart. Bake for 2 hours. Turn off the oven and allow the meringues to cool completely while still in the oven, about 2 hours. The meringues can be stored in an airtight plastic container for up to 4 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 40397,&quot;Conch Fritters 8 ounces all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons cornstarch 3 eggs 3 egg whites 1/4 cup milk 2 ounces red pepper, finely diced 2 ounces green pepper, finely diced 2 ounces yellow pepper, finely diced 2 ounces red onion, finely diced 2 ounces cilantro, leaves chopped 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 1 pound conch meat, diced small Peanut oil, for frying Instructions: Sift together flour and cornstarch.

Crush corn cereal in your hands (or in a re-sealable plastic bag) and top the ice cream. Sprinkle with cinnamon and drizzle with honey. &quot;,&quot;[Tinto de Verano, Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 40399,&quot;King Cake 1/2 cup milk 1 envelope active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 1/3 cup granulated sugar 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus up to 1/2 cup more if necessary 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 4 large eggs Zest of 1 lemon, minced 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons butter, melted 1/3 cup light brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 large dried bean or whole almond 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2-3 tablespoons water Green, yellow, red, and blue food coloring Instructions: To make the dough: Gently heat the milk in a small saucepan to slightly warmer than body temperature (105 to 110 degrees F). Pour the milk into a bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the surface, and add a teaspoon of the sugar and a tablespoon of the flour. Stir to combine, and let the yeast plump with the milk before whisking. Set aside to proof for about 10 minutes.<br> In a mixing bowl, with the paddle attachment on a heavy-duty mixer, cream together 11 tablespoons of the butter and the remaining sugar until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the yeast mixture and mix for 1 minute. Add an egg and mix thoroughly; follow with a third of the flour. Repeat with the remaining eggs and flour. Add the lemon zest and salt, and continue to mix on low speed for 8 to 9 minutes, until the dough is smooth, shiny, and elastic, and pulls away from the side of the bowl. If very soft, add up to 1/2 cup of flour. Scrape the dough from the mixing bowl and knead lightly to form a ball. Butter a medium-size bowl with the remaining tablespoon of softened butter. Transfer the dough to the bowl and turn it in the bowl to coat with the butter. Cover with plastic and set in a warm spot to proof for 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.<br> After an hour, turn the dough out of the bowl, punch it down, and knead lightly to form into a ball. Put the dough back in the bowl, covered, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or for up to 24 hours.<br> To form the cake: flour a clean work space and roll the dough into a 20-x-10-inch rectangle, keeping the thickness consistent throughout. If the edges get thin, trim them to keep consistent. Cut the dough lengthwise into 3 strips. Paint each strip of dough with the melted butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border clean along the length of each of the strips. (Reserve any leftover butter for brushing on the cake before baking.) Sprinkle the butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon.<br> Line a baking sheet with parchment. Fold each strip over, lengthwise and toward the clean edges, to enclose the cinnamon and sugar, and pinch the seam to seal the dough closed. Braid the 3 rope like pieces together. Transfer the braid to the baking sheet, and form the braid into a wreath by pressing the ends together. Cover with a towel, and set aside to proof for 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Brush the cake with the reserved melted butter, and bake for 20 minutes, until golden brown. Tent the cake with foil and continue baking for 25 minutes. Keeping the cake on the baking sheet, cool on a rack. After the cake has cooled, carefully tuck the bean or almond into the underside of the cake.<br> To make the icing: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar with the water in a medium saucepan and heat very gently to dissolve the sugar. Divide the icing into 3 small bowls and add the food coloring to make a mild green, a golden yellow, and a purple (1/2 drop red and 1/2 drop blue). Brush the ridges of the dough while it is still warm with alternating Mardi Gras colors. Cool and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40400,&quot;Ugly Christmas Sweater Pie 5 pounds sweet cooking apples (such as Gala, Honeycrisp, Braeburn), peeled, cored and cut into 1/4-inch slices (about 12 cups) 1 cup dried cranberries 1 cup light brown sugar 6 tablespoons cornstarch 1 1/2 tablespoons orange zest 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon All-purpose flour, for dusting 2 batches Pie Dough, recipe follows (see Cook&#39;s Note) Gel or liquid food coloring, for coloring the dough Red, green and white sanding sugar, for decorating 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes 1/4 cup very cold or frozen vegetable shortening, cut into 1-inch cubes 6 to 8 tablespoons ice cold water Instructions: Combine the apples, cranberries, brown sugar, cornstarch, orange zest and cinnamon in a large bowl and gently toss together until combined. Set aside. Line a large work surface with parchment paper and lightly flour the paper. Roll out one batch of Pie Dough to a 14-by-19-inch rectangle. Gently roll the dough up around your rolling pin and transfer it to a 10-by-15-by-1-inch baking pan. Unroll the pastry over the pan. Alternatively, fold the pastry in half, and then again into quarters (moving quickly), transfer to the pan and then unfold. Gently fit the pastry into the pan and up the sides. Don&#39;t worry if the pastry rips or tears. You can simply patch it back together with your fingers as it will not be seen in the final product. Tuck the edges under the side of the pan and trim. Place the pastry shell in the refrigerator while you create your knit pastry columns. For the purl stitches: You can knit your pie in a fine or chunky knit pattern, depending on the length and thickness of the dough stitches. The pie in this recipe was created using stitches that were about 4 inches long and 1/4 inch thick. Whatever size and thickness you choose, take a few minutes to practice a few and see what style you like best. Remove the second batch of Pie Dough from the fridge. Pull off a 1- to 2-inch round piece and roll it to the desired length and thickness. Form it into a horseshoe shape (an upside-down u-shape). Roll another piece of dough the same size. Lay it across the bottom of the horseshoe, leaving about 1/4 inch of the horseshoe ends visible. Tuck the two ends of the horseshoe up and over the straight piece, keeping the ends turned in slightly. Curve the straight piece downward into a horseshoe. Continue to build your column of purl stitches until you have a 10-inch long column that will fit across your pie. Measure the width of your column and then create enough purl stitch columns to cover the pie. Once you have assembled all your purl stitch columns, place them in the fridge for 15 minutes. For the decorations: Roll out your remaining dough into a 10-by-15-inch rectangle. To create the front panel: Use a ruler and sharp knife to cut a 12-by-1-inch long strip of dough. Press the tines of a fork gently into the dough, moving down the length of the panel to create a ribbed effect. Set aside. To create the front collar: Use a 4-inch round cutter to create a circle from a piece of dough. Position a 2-inch round cutter approximately 1 inch inside the outer circle and press down to create a donut shape. Cut the donut shape in half to create a u-shaped band. The remaining half can be added back to your batch to make other decorations. Press the tines of a fork gently into the dough, moving around the edge of the collar to create a ribbed effect. To create the sweater decorations: Use 1- and 2-inch cookie cutters with a holiday theme to create a variety of holiday shapes. To color the dough, use either gel or liquid food coloring mixed with a small amount of water. Apply with a small paint brush (available in craft stores). To add sparkle to your pie, after painting, and while your dough is still slightly damp, sprinkle with colored sanding sugar. To make a candy cane, roll out two pieces of dough to approximately 6 inches in length and 1/2 inch in diameter. Paint one roll in red food coloring and sprinkle with red sanding sugar. Paint the other roll with a bit of water and sprinkle with white sanding sugar. Twist the two pieces of dough together gently and curve at the top. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. To assemble: Remove the pie shell from the fridge. Transfer the apple mixture to the pan and evenly distribute so you have a flat surface. Remove your purl stitch columns from the fridge and assemble across the top of your pie. Add your decorations on top of the pie. Bake for 12 minutes. Then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until the pie is golden and the filling bubbles thickly through the knit pattern, another 60 to 70 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and let cool for at least 2 hours before serving. For the dough: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor fitted with a metal blade until combined, 2 to 3 times. Scatter the butter and shortening over the flour mixture. Pulse 4 to 5 times until the mixture resembles small pebbles with a few larger pieces. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of the ice water over top. Pulse until the mixture starts to clump and come together, 6 to 8 times. If the mixture does not clump, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing 1 to 2 times between additions. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough to bring it together in a ball. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40401,&quot;Biblos Grilled Tuna Nicoise 4 tuna steaks 1/4 cup olive tapenade 1 teaspoon crushed garlic (recommended: Christopher Ranch) 1 tablespoon capers, drained 1/2 cups Italian dressing (recommended: Newman&#39;s Own) 4 cups mixed salad greens (recommended: Fresh Express) 2 hard-boiled eggs, quartered 1 cup frozen French cut green beans, thawed 2 tomatoes, quartered 1 (15-ounce) can sliced potatoes Instructions: Cut a pocket into the side of the tuna steaks; set aside.

Brush both sides of the tortillas with butter and sprinkle with 1/4 cup cinnamon sugar. Cut each tortilla into 8 wedges. Place the tortilla chips on foil-covered baking sheets. Bake in oven until golden, turning halfway through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Meanwhile, heat the chocolate chips with 2 tablespoons heavy cream in microwave until smooth and melted, stirring every 15 seconds. It should take about 45 seconds total. In a small bowl, beat the remaining 1/4 cup heavy cream to soft peaks. Once the chips are done, place them on a platter. Drizzle with chocolate sauce and top with small spoonfuls of the whipped cream. Sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of cinnamon sugar and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 40416,&quot;Sexy Swedish Buns 1 (.25 ounce/7 g) packet of yeast 1 1/2 cups/375 ml warm milk 1 heaped teaspoon ground cardamom (or about 20 cardamom pods) 2 large eggs, preferably free-range or organic A pinch of sea salt 7 ounces/200 g caster sugar (superfine) 3 1/2 tablespoons/50 g melted butter 1 3/4 pounds (28 ounces)/800 g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 1 tablespoon/15 g unsalted butter 2 1/2 ounces/75 g demerara sugar (raw sugar) For the filling 14 ounces/400 g blueberries 2 1/2 ounces/75 g caster sugar (superfine) 1 orange Instructions: ; For the dough:; Stir the yeast into the warm milk in a bowl, then put it aside.; If using cardamom pods, lightly bash them in a pestle and mortar, then pick out the husks and pound the seeds to a fine powder. Beat the eggs and salt in a large bowl, then add the cardamom, sugar, melted butter, 18 ounces/500 g flour, and the milk and yeast mixture. Whisk constantly as you add everything so you end up with quite a thick, gluey consistency. Mix in the remaining 10 ounces/300 g flour until you have a dough. Use clean, floured hands to bring the dough together, then dust the top with flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or clingfilm and leave in a warm place to prove or rise for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size and is full of air pockets. For the filling: Meanwhile, put the blueberries and caster sugar (superfine) into a bowl. Finely grate the orange zest and add most of it to the bowl, along with a good squeeze of orange juice, then mash together with a potato masher. Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper, then dot the paper with a few knobs of the butter and sprinkle over 1/2 the demerara sugar (raw sugar). Dust a clean surface and your hands with flour and gently stretch and pull the risen dough out until it&#39;s a bit bigger than a 8 1/2 by 11-inch letter-size/A4 (210 mm by 297 mm) piece of paper. Cook&#39;s Note: This next bit is pretty messy, so have a bowl of flour on hand to help you handle the dough and don&#39;t be alarmed if it seems quite wet. Use a slotted spoon to move 1/2 the mashed blueberries onto the dough. Try not to include too much juice. Use the back of the spoon to spread the blueberries around the dough. Pull the sides of the dough up and into the middle like an envelope, and keep turning and pushing the dough together. Cut the dough into 8 equal portions, then pull and stretch each one into a long, thin sausage shape, twisting them around on themselves so you get a sort of rough knot. Arrange them on the tray, leaving enough room between for them to spread as they cook. Push your fingers into the top of each one to make a little well, then spoon in a few of the remaining mashed berries and gently push them down. Spoon over a little of the blueberry juice from the bowl, then sprinkle with the rest of your demerara sugar (raw sugar) and the reserved orange zest. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove or rise for about 20 minutes in a warm place. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C/gas 4. Once the buns have risen, put them into the oven and cook for 25 minutes, until golden and crispy.

Line a 9-inch-square baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Lightly spray the foil with cooking spray. Pulse 1 cup pretzel pieces in a food processor until finely ground (you should have about 1/2 cup crumbs). Transfer to a bowl. Whisk in the flour, baking powder and salt. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the brown sugar. Let cool slightly, then stir in the eggs and vanilla. Stir the pretzel crumb mixture into the butter mixture in two additions. Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Scatter the remaining 1/2 cup pretzel pieces on top. Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean with a few crumbs, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan on a rack, then lift the foil to remove the bars from the pan and transfer to a baking sheet. Preheat the broiler. Press the marshmallow halves, cut-side down, in even rows on top of the bars. Broil, rotating the baking sheet as needed, until the marshmallows are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes; let cool. Put the peanut butter chips and 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until melted and smooth. Repeat with the chocolate chips and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil in another bowl. Drizzle the melted peanut butter and chocolate mixtures over the bars.

Using a warmed sharp knife, or unflavored dental floss (See Cook&#39;s Note 1) cut the wheel of brie in half horizontally and separate the top half of the wheel from the bottom half. Sprinkle the bottom half of the brie with the dried cherries, toasted almonds, and brown sugar. Replace the top half of the brie and apply pressure to secure the stuffing. Working on a well-floured surface, roll out the puff pastry so that it will fully cover the brie. Place the brie in the middle of the puff pastry and fold the excess pastry around the wheel. Put the wheel aside. Roll out another piece of puff pastry and cut out a circle the same circumference as the top of the brie. Save the trimmings for decorations. Using a pastry brush, brush the egg on top of the brie in the puff pastry and place the circle on top. Brush the top of the circle with egg. Cut out decorations using cookie cutters or a small knife on top of the brie. Brush the entire top side of the brie with the egg and place the brie on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the pastry begins to turn golden brown, then turn the temperature down to 325 degrees F and bake for another 20 minutes. Serve on a pretty platter. See Cook&#39;s Note 2. Cook&#39;s Note 1: Instead of using a knife to cut the brie, use a piece of unflavored dental floss. Make an initial cut half way down, along the outer side of the brie with a pairing knife. Then, take a long piece of dental floss and wrap it around both hands. Starting at the front of the wheel at the initial cut, work through the wheel with the floss, separating the top half of the wheel from the bottom. Cook&#39;s Note 2: The brie can be made, wrapped securely and stored in the freezer up to a month ahead of time. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 40422,&quot;Homemade Schnitzel 6 ounces pork tenderloin 1 cup flour 1 cup corn oil 3 ounces chopped onion 3 ounces sliced mushrooms 1 ounce red wine 1/2 ounce sour cream 3 ounce brown gravy 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Instructions: Pound the pork tenderloin until it is flat.

Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Drain, then return the potatoes in the pot to the stove over medium heat and shake occasionally until all the excess water is evaporated, about 10 second. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl. Add the vinegar, season with pepper and roughly mash with a potato masher or large fork (some small lumps should remain). Spread the potatoes up the sides of the bowl so they cool faster and set aside for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a small pot of water to a boil and season generously with salt. Toss together the cucumbers and a pinch of salt in a small bowl. Let sit for about 10 minutes, then rinse and firmly squeeze to remove any excess liquid. Add the corn and carrots to the boiling water and simmer until the carrots are almost tender, about 2 minutes. Drain in a small colander or strainer, then rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Transfer to a small bowl lined with a folded paper towel to absorb any excess water. When the potatoes are ready, add the corn, carrots, cucumber and ham and gently stir to combine. Add the mayonnaise, season with salt and gently stir until thoroughly combined, adding a little more mayonnaise, if you like. Check the seasonings, adding more vinegar, salt and/or pepper, as needed.

Remove from the heat and set aside. Cook the chicken. In a medium skillet, bring the chicken stock to a simmer over medium-high heat. Submerge the chicken breasts in the stock, then reduce the heat to low and poach until the meat is completely cooked through and the internal temperature in the thickest part of the chicken breast registers 165 degrees F on a meat thermometer, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Use a sharp knife to cut the meat into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Set aside. Let the chicken stock cool and reserve for another use. Make the pasta. In a medium pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Line a sheet pan with a clean kitchen towel and set aside. Season the water with salt until it tastes like sea water. Plunge the pasta in the water and cook until cooked but still chewy (\\u201cal dente\\u201d), 4 to 6 minutes. Place a colander in the sink. Reserve a little pasta water, then drain the pasta thoroughly. Shake the colander a few times to remove excess water. Spread the pasta on the towel so it cools more quickly. Gently use a second towel to cover and pat the pasta dry. (Removing the excess moisture assures that the sauce will have a full flavor effect on the noodles.) Make the sauce. In a large bowl, combine the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, vinegar and hot sauce. Adjust the seasonings. Stir in half of the scallions. Set aside. Add the pasta to the sauce and toss to coat evenly. Add some of the reserved water if necessary. Transfer the pasta and sauce to a large serving bowl. Set aside.

Season the garlic mixture with salt, and pepper, to taste. Let sit for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prep the chicken breasts. Rinse and dry the chicken thoroughly. Find the ridge along the side of the chicken breast, and carefully pull off the tender. Take each breast and pound gently to an even thickness. Do not pound too thin; the breast will not be completely uniform. If there is a skinny little triangular tip, go ahead and cut off and discard. Prep the tenders by slicing off any jagged edges. Liberally salt and pepper the chicken and allow to sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes. Preheat the grill to hot. Once the chicken has rested, brush liberally with the garlic-infused vegetable oil. Place the chicken breasts on the hot grill, with the thicker portion facing the hotter part of your grill (usually the back). Allow the chicken breasts to cook undisturbed until char marks are made, about 4 minutes. Flip the chicken, keeping the thick part of the chicken toward the hot part of the flame, and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the chicken reads 155 degrees F, about 3 more minutes. Place the chicken tenders on the grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes total, turning halfway through. Allow the grilled chicken to rest for 5 minutes, covered, before serving. Serve with Roasted Onion Tomato and Onion Dipping Sauce, if using. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Place the halved tomatoes, onions, and garlic cloves on a baking sheet. Drizzle with half the olive oil and sprinkle with thyme, salt and pepper. Toss to coat well. Place the tomatoes cut-side down, and cook for 2 hours turning the tomatoes after 1 hour. After the second hour, remove the baking sheet, and set aside the unpeeled garlic. Place the rest of the vegetables and the pan juices in a food processor or blender. Add a tablespoon or two of water to the pan to scrape up any bits of flavor stuck onto the baking sheet and add to the food processor. Squeeze out the soft flesh of the roasted garlic into the food processor and add the remaining olive oil. Pulse the mixture until chunky, or puree until smooth, depending on desired consistency. Taste the sauce and season with salt, and pepper, if necessary.

Heat the oil in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat until a thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Drain the artichokes and pat dry. Working in 2 batches, add the artichokes to the hot oil and cook until they are tender and golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the fried artichokes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with salt while artichokes are still warm and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 40438,&quot;Inside-Out Caramel Apples 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons sugar 1 egg 1 tablespoon water 4 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled 1/2 cup prepared caramel sauce 1/2 of a 17.3-ounce package Pepperidge Farm? Puff Pastry Sheets (1 sheet), thawed Vanilla ice cream Instructions: Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Stir the cinnamon and sugar in a shallow bowl. Beat the egg and water in a small bowl with a fork or whisk. Using a melon baller, scoop the cores out of the apples from the top, making sure to leave the bottoms intact. Coat the apples with the cinnamon mixture. Spoon 2 tablespoons caramel sauce into each apple. Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry sheet into a 10x9-inch rectangle. Cut into 9 (1x10-inch) strips. Press the ends of 2 pastry strips together to make 1 (1x20-inch) strip. Repeat with 6 of the remaining pastry strips. Cut 8 leaf shapes from the last pastry strip. Starting at the bottom, wind 1 pastry strip around 1 apple, slightly overlapping the edges of the pastry. Repeat with the remaining pastry strips and apples. Top each with 2 pastry leaves. Brush the pastries with the egg mixture. Place the pastries onto a baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown. Serve the pastries with the ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40439,&quot;Chocolate Spiral Cookies 1/2 vanilla bean 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed 1 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons powdered sugar 4 large egg yolks 1/2 orange, zested Pinch baking powder Pinch salt 2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed 1/2 vanilla bean 1 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons powdered sugar 4 large egg yolks 1/2 orange, zested Pinch baking powder Pinch salt 1 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder Instructions: For the Plain Dough: Using a sharp knife, slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Place the vanilla bean seeds, butter, sugar, egg yolks, and orange zest in a medium-sized mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until the ingredients are combined, about 1 minute. Combine the baking powder, salt, and flour and add to the butter mixture all at once. Beat on low speed just until combined, about 1 minute. Do not overmix the dough or it will become tough. Remove the dough from the bowl. Form it into a 4 by-9-inch rectangle, wrap in plastic, and place in the refrigerator. For the Chocolate Dough: Repeat the exact same procedure as for the plain dough, combining the cocoa powder with the flour and adding it to the butter mixture.<br> Let each dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. (I prefer to make the dough a day in advance and let it rest overnight.) Overnight, all of the flavors (orange, vanilla, chocolate, butter) mature and the flour and butter absorb the flavor of the cocoa. The next day, the chocolate dough will be darker in color.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. It will be hard, so give it a few quick raps with a rolling pin to make it easier to roll. Lightly flour both sides of each dough. Roll both doughs into a 7 by 6-inch rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Place one rectangle on top of the other and roll it out to an 8 by 20-inch rectangle. Brush the rectangle with a thin coat of water to help the dough stick to itself. Roll the dough into a cylinder that is 20 inches long and 1 1/2 to 1 3/4-inches in diameter. Cut the cylinder into 1/2-inch thick round slices. Lay the cookies, cut side down, on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet about 1/2-inch apart. Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes and cool on a wire rack. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 40440,&quot;Mannish Water 2 pounds goat head, organs and feet (2 pounds lamb meat may be substituted) 1 1/2 gallons water 5 green bananas, sliced 1 pound yams, diced 1 1/2 christophenes (also called chayotes), seeds and skin removed, chopped 1/2 pound taro root, diced 1/2 pound carrots, diced 1/2 pound turnips, diced 1 1/2 bunches scallions, chopped 2 scotch bonnets or habaneros, chopped 3 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped Salt Instructions: Chop the meat into small pieces, rinse and place into a large stockpot.

Bring to a rapid boil, and boil-without stirring!-until the water level reaches the level of the rice. Stir the rice once and reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the spinach mix: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic, stirring so it doesn&#39;t stick, and cook until fragrant. Stir in the spinach and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook until the spinach is just heated through. Don&#39;t overcook or the spinach will discolor. Once the rice has finished cooking, fold the spinach into the pot. Fluff the rice so that the spinach is evenly distributed. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if necessary. If you like, add a couple of drizzles of olive oil to give the rice a little gloss. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 40464,&quot;One Recipe, Two Meals: Chicken Stir-Fry 4 to 5 tablespoons sesame oil 1 pound chicken breast, thinly sliced Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup frozen mixed veggies, thawed 1 box (14 ounces) stir-fry rice noodles 3 scallions, finely sliced Sesame seeds, for garnish 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon freshly minced ginger root 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced 1 bag (6 ounces) snow peas, sliced on the diagonal 3 tablespoons soy sauce Juice of 1 lime Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons of the sesame oil in a large saute pan.

Nestle the rosemary under the steaks and set aside at room temperature 2 hours, turning the steaks halfway through to infuse both sides with rosemary. Make the rosemary butter: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the butter and 1 teaspoon salt. Melt the butter, stirring to dissolve the salt, then add the garlic and rosemary. Continue cooking over low heat until the butter is fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the garlic and rosemary; set the butter aside. Grill the steaks: Preheat a grill or grill pan to high. Remove the steaks from the dish, discard the rosemary and place the steaks on the grill. Cook about 5 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove from the grill, tent with foil and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, make the eggs: In a large bowl, vigorously whisk the eggs and add a splash of water (nothing more than a teaspoon). Melt the butter in a large nonstick pan over low heat but do not let it brown. Add the eggs and cook, whisking to release the cooked egg from the pan, until almost done but still wet, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat; add half of the cheese, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper and continue whisking until done. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. To serve, cut the steaks off the bone and slice against the grain; drizzle with the rosemary butter. Serve with the eggs. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 40467,&quot;Tomato Basil Elephant Ears 1 1/4 cups sun-dried tomatoes, chopped 3 tablespoons chopped garlic (9 cloves) 5 cups basil leaves, packed 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup good olive oil 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1 sheet puff pastry, defrosted (recommended: Pepperidge Farm) 1 egg mixed with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. To make the paste, place the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process for 30 seconds. Add the basil, salt, and pepper. With the processor running, slowly pour the olive oil into the bowl through the feed tube and process until pureed. Add the Parmesan and puree for 15 seconds. Set aside. Unfold 1 sheet of puff pastry and place it on a lightly floured board. With a rolling pin, lightly roll the dough until it&#39;s a 13-inch square. Using a knife, spread the paste over the top of the puff pastry. Fold the sides of the square toward the center so they go halfway to the middle. Fold them again so the 2 folds meet exactly at the middle of the dough. Then fold one half over the other half as though closing a book. You will have 6 layers. Slice the dough into 3/8-inch slices and place the slices, cut side up, on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Brush each piece with egg wash and place in the oven. Bake for 6 minutes. Turn each pastry slice over and continue baking an additional 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 40468,&quot;San Francisco-Style Cioppino 1/4 cup olive oil 1 small carrot, chopped 1 small yellow onion, chopped 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped 2 ribs celery, chopped 5 cloves garlic, chopped 1 small serrano cl 1/2 bunch fresh basil, chopped 1/2 bunch fresh oregano, chopped 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 1/2 teaspoons black peppercorns 1 bay leaf 1/2 bottle good red wine 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco) 10 cups canned pureed tomatoes, about five 15-ounce cans (recommended: Di Napoli, San Marzano-style) Fish Stock, recipe follows 3 whole Dungeness crab legs and bodies, with the crabmeat intact 18 littleneck clams, scrubbed clean 18 black mussels, bearded and scrubbed clean 1 1/2 pounds fresh sea bass or other firm fish, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces 12 peeled and deveined prawns (shells reserved for stock) 1 pound fresh fish bones, plus the head if you can get it 2 ribs celery, coarsely chopped 1 small carrot, coarsely chopped 1 small yellow onion, coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, mashed 1/4 bunch parsley stems 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds Shells from the prawns 11 to 12 cups clam juice Instructions: For the tomato base: In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat and add the carrots, onions, peppers, and celery, and saute until tender, about 5 minutes.

Trim off any excess skin or fat from the chicken. Cut off and discard the wing tips. Place the chicken pieces in an 11 by 13-inch baking pan, or any pan that that they fit in without crowding. Season the chicken pieces generously with salt, pepper, olive oil, the herbs, and the lemon zest. Toss through all the seasonings and then arrange the chicken piece skin side up in the pan. You can season the chicken pieces and set them up in the roaster up to a day before you cook them. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Roast until the skin is nicely browned and there is no pink near the thigh bone and the juices run clear, about 35 to 40 minutes. Check both white meat and dark meat. If the white meat is done before the dark meat, take it out and set it on the serving plate until the dark meat is done. For the parsley drizzle, wash and dry the parsley. Remove the leaves from the stems and chop the leaves finely. Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl and use immediately to garnish the roast chicken. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 40471,&quot;Sweet Potato Soup with Matchstick Fries and Frizzled Leeks 3 large sweet potatoes (about 2 pounds) 3 leeks 6 cups chicken stock 1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger (about 1 tablespoon peeled and grated) Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Matchstick Fries and Frizzled Leeks, recipe follows Canola oil, for frying 2 large Yukon Gold or russet potatoes (about 1 pound) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (3-inch) piece leek, julienned 2 tablespoons potato starch Instructions: Peel and quarter the sweet potatoes. Wash the leeks well, and drain. Remove any damaged outside peel, remove the hairy white tips from the end, and cut the leeks into 1-inch slices. Leave 1 (3-inch) section aside to be fried for the garnish. In a large pot, cook the leeks with the butter until soft. Do not brown. Add the stock or water. Add the sweet potatoes, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, and boil until cooked through, just softer than fork tender. Using an immersion blender, puree the ingredients until they are thoroughly blended. Add the grated ginger, and test for consistency. If too thick, add a bit more water. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt or pepper, as needed. Ladle the soup into warm bowls, and garnish with a mound of hot crispy matchstick potatoes and frizzled leeks. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. (If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, a cube of bread will brown in about 3 minutes.) To make matchstick fries: Peel and cut potatoes into matchstick slices. Rinse them under cold water in a strainer to remove the excess starch. Let drain well, and pat dry. Fry for 3 to 5 minutes submerged in canola oil, until they are a nice deep golden brown. Drain the potatoes on a paper towel or absorbent cloth. Sprinkle with salt and pepper while hot. To make &#39;frizzled leeks&#39;: Cut the 3-inch piece of leek into matchstick slices similar to the potato. Place the potato starch in a small bowl, lightly dust the leek pieces in it to help prevent them from burning. Fry the strips of leek in the same hot oil used for the potatoes, until they are just golden, about 1 minute Add to the bowl of matchstick fries. Mix them together. Garnish in a little mound on top of the soup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 40472,&quot;Roasted Braeburn Apple Jam 3 pounds Braeburn apples (about 6) 1/4 cup clover honey 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 cups apple cider 2 3-inch cinnamon sticks 8 cloves 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar Grated zest and juice of 1 large lemon Instructions: Peel and core the apples. Cut them in half and then into thin slices. In a large skillet, heat the honey over low heat until it begins to foam and turns a very light brown, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the ground cinnamon and apple slices. Return the skillet to medium heat and cook, stirring from time to time with a wooden spoon, until the apples are soft, 30 to 35 minutes. While the apples are cooking, flavor the cider: In a medium saucepan, combine the cider, cinnamon sticks, cloves and vinegar and bring to a simmer over high heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced by half, 10 to 12 minutes.<br> Make the jam: Strain the cider mixture over the cooked apples (discard the cinnamon sticks and cloves). Simmer the apples over medium heat until all of the flavors meld and the liquid is almost completely absorbed, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the lemon zest and juice.

Lightly dust the scallops with flour on one side only; shake off excess. When hot, add the scallops, floured side down, and saute, over moderate high heat, without moving for 2 to 3 minutes or until one side develops a crust. Put a lid on the scallops to help finish steaming the top or, if the heat is high enough, the scallops will cook from the bottom through to the top. Lightly season with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a skillet. When hot add the cabbage and garlic and saute for a few minutes just long enough to wilt it down. (You may need to add a touch of water to help it wilt down.) Remove from heat and add white wine to taste. Season with salt and pepper. To serve, pile some cabbage in the center of a plate and top the plate with scallops, putting the browned side up.

Use your fingertips to gently separate the turkey skin from the breast. Mix the chopped herbs with the softened butter and distribute evenly underneath the turkey skin. This will create a self basting turkey and keep it moist as it cooks slowly. Preheat oven to 450 or 500 degrees F. Place the chopped onion, celery, apples, oranges, and carrots inside the cavity of the turkey and then sprinkle the turkey all over with salt and pepper, to taste. Place the turkey on a rack (the reason we place the turkey onto a rack is so we don&#39;t get a mushy bottom on the turkey) in a roasting tray, cover with aluminum foil, and place in a preheated oven at 450 to 500 degrees F for the first 25 minutes then reduce the heat to 325 degrees F for a further 4 hours checking every 20 to 30 minutes throughout the day. About 1 hour from finishing remove the foil and allow to get golden brown. You should roast the turkey until an instant-read thermometer registers 180 degrees F (this is the temperature for a whole turkey) and the juices no longer run pink when you cut into the center of the thigh (it should be clear). The drumstick should move easily from the socket when lifted or twisted. When the turkey has finished cooking remove from oven and let it rest for at least 30 minutes - longer is better. It will not go cold!!! Note: I personally don&#39;t like to baste because every time you open the oven you lose at least 25 degrees F of heat, so this means that you keep the turkey in the oven longer therefore drying it out. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40480,&quot;Crispy Kale Canola oil, for deep frying 1 bunch kale (about 1 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt 1 bunch fresh cilantro, leaves removed Instructions: In a large heavy pot (like a Dutch oven), heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to 350 degrees F.<br> Thoroughly wash the kale and remove the stems.

Tenderize steaks with meat mallet to break down the muscle and integrate spices into the meat. Place them in a bowl and pour 1/2 cup of the wine over them, letting them marinate, for a minimum of 25 minutes. Prepare demi-glace by melting the butter over medium heat in a saucepan and sauteing onion until tender. Whisk in flour with a fork to make a roux, then add 1/2 cup red wine and veal stock. Let simmer over medium heat until reduced by 1/3, stirring occasionally. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, coat potatoes with 1/2 cup of the canola oil and toss with 2 tablespoons salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, fresh thyme, and fresh rosemary. Place the potatoes in a baking pan and roast them in the oven until tender, about 35 to 45 minutes. In a hot skillet, heat the onions (heat them dry with no oil) for about 3 minutes. The idea is to remove the liquid from the onions, by \\sweating them down.\\ Add the honey, vinegar, remaining 1/2 cup wine, hot sauce and grape jelly, and stir well. Reduce over medium low heat until there is no liquid left in the pan and marmalade mixture is tacky. When the potatoes have been roasting for about 1/2 hour, heat 1/4 cup canola oil in a saute pan. Sear both sides of the steak in the hot pan until golden brown, but do not cook beyond medium, or the steak may become tough. To finish the demi-glace, remove from heat and whisk the butter into the warm reduction. Arrange potatoes around the meat and top meat with marmalade. Drizzle with demi-glace sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Barolo]&quot; 40488,&quot;Spaghetti Squash with Meat Sauce 1 pound Ground Beef (93% lean or leaner) 1 medium yellow onion, chopped 1 tablespoon minced garlic 1 can (15 ounces) no salt added or regular tomato sauce 1 can (14.5 ounces) Italian-Style diced tomatoes, un-drained 1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 1 medium spaghetti squash (about 3 to 3-1/2 pounds), cut in half lengthwise, seeds removed Toppings (optional): Thinly sliced fresh basil and grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: 1)Heat stockpot over medium heat until hot.

Color is not a reliable indicator of ground beef doneness. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 40489,&quot;Root Vegetable Cassoulet 2 cups rinsed cannelini beans, picked over and rinsed 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/2 onion, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 1/4-inch dice 3 large cloves garlic, peeled, split, germ removed, and finely chopped Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 tablespoon tomato paste 2 tomatoes, 1 peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch dice, the other just cut in half 7 cups unsalted Vegetable Stock (page 348) or store-bought low-sodium vegetable broth 6 stalks celery, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 3-inch lengths 3 medium carrots, peeled, trimmed, and cut into 3-inch lengths 2 large turnips, peeled, trimmed, and quartered 1 medium fennel bulb, trimmed and quartered Bouquet garni (3 sprigs Italian parsley, 2 sprigs sage, and 2 sprigs thyme, tied together with kitchen twine) 1 cup fresh bread crumbs 2 large cloves garlic, peeled, split, germ removed, and very finely chopped 1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley leaves 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Instructions: The night before you want to make the cassoulet, put the dried beans in a pot with enough cold water to cover them by at least an inch. Let the beans soak overnight in the refrigerator, then rinse and drain them. (Or, if you&#39;re in a rush--or you haven&#39;t planned far enough in advance--bring the water with the beans to a boil, boil for 2 minutes, pull the pot from the heat, and soak the beans for an hour. Rinse the beans under cold water and drain.)<br> Warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small saute pan or skillet over medium heat. When it&#39;s hot, add the onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the onion and garlic are tender but not colored, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and, when it&#39;s incorporated evenly, add the diced tomato; pull the pan from the heat and set aside.<br> Put the beans in a Dutch oven or large casserole. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Add the celery, carrots, turnips, fennel, split tomato, and the bouquet garni. Cut a parchment paper circle to fit inside the pot (see Glossary, page 369) and press the paper gently against the ingredients. Lower the heat so that the liquid bubbles at a steady simmer, and cook, stirring now and then, until the beans are tender, about 1 hour. Season the casserole with salt and pepper shortly before the beans are cooked through. When the beans are done, pull the pot from the heat and remove and discard the bouquet garni and whatever is left of the tomato. Drain the liquid from the pot into a pitcher and keep close at hand. Working gently, transfer the vegetables to a bowl.<br> Spoon the beans into a baking dish--a pottery casserole would be perfect--and stir in the onion-tomato paste mixture along with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add enough of the reserved cooking liquid to just cover the beans. Top with the vegetables and moisten with more of the cooking liquid. Reserve the remaining liquid if you are going to reheat the cassoulet. (The cassoulet can be made up to this point a day in advance, cooled, and stored tightly covered in the refrigerator. Bring it to room temperature, then reheat it for about 1 hour in a 350 degree F. oven, adding some of the reserved cooking liquid if the casserole seems dry. Fifteen minutes before the cassoulet&#39;s ready, put on the crust and turn up the oven temperature, as directed below.)<br> The Crust: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Toss together the bread crumbs, garlic, and parsley and stir in the melted butter. Spread the mixture evenly over the cassoulet and slide the casserole into the oven. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the crumbs are golden brown and crusty.<br> To Serve: Bring the casserole to the table and serve immediately, spooning crust, vegetables, and beans into warm soup plates. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 40490,&quot;Blueberry Crostata 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 6 tablespoons cold butter, diced<br> Ice water (about 2 tablespoons) 3 cups fresh blueberries 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch Juice and zest of 1/2 lemon 1 large egg, beaten Sparkling sugar, optional Instructions: For the crust: Put the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor fitted with a steel blade; pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until it is in small pieces and distributed throughout the flour. With the machine running, add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough comes together in a ball. Turn out onto a floured surface and gently form into a disc. Wrap in plastic wrap and put in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 10-inch circle and transfer to a rimmed baking sheet, then refrigerate 20 minutes.<br> For the filling: Meanwhile, combine the blueberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice and zest in a medium bowl; mix gently until the berries are evenly coated and glossy.<br> To finish: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Pour the filling into the center of the dough, leaving a 2- to 3-inch border. Gently fold in the edges of the crust all along the circle. Brush the crust with egg and sprinkle with sparkling sugar, if using. Bake until the crust is golden and the filling just begins to bubble, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool 20 minutes and serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40491,&quot;Tortellini With Pumpkin Alfredo Sauce Kosher salt Two 9-ounce packages cheese tortellini 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 small shallot, finely chopped 1/2 cup canned pure pumpkin Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 1 1/4 cups heavy cream 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping Freshly ground pepper Chopped fresh parsley, for topping (optional) Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tortellini and cook as the label directs. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain the pasta. Meanwhile, heat the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring, until slightly soft, about 2 minutes. Add the pumpkin and nutmeg and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in the cream and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat to medium low; simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cheese and cook until thick, about 1 more minute. Season with salt and pepper. Add the tortellini to the skillet and toss with the sauce, adding some of the reserved cooking water to loosen, if needed. Divide among bowls and top with more cheese and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Barbera]&quot; 40492,&quot;Sweet-Hot-Beet Soup 3 to 4 medium beets, unpeeled, roots trimmed 3 tablespoons vegetable oil or clarified butter 3 medium onions, peeled and sliced (4 cups) 3 jalapenos, seeded and diced (2 tablespoons) 3-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced (3 tablespoons) 1 tablespoon cumin seeds, freshly ground 2 tablespoons coriander seeds, freshly ground 1 teaspoon turmeric 3/4 teaspoon dried Thai chilies, freshly ground, or ground red pepper flakes 1/4 cup basmati rice, rinsed and drained 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 quarts vegetable or chicken broth 3/4 cup coconut milk 1 tablespoon honey (optional) 3/4 teaspoon garam masala 10 tablespoons yogurt or sour cream 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, picked and washed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Wrap the beets individually with aluminum foil and roast them in the oven until easily pierced by the tip of a paring knife, about 60 to 70 minutes. When the beets are cool enough to handle, trim the ends, and gently rub off their skins with a paper towel. Cut into 1/4-inch slices, place them in a food processor and pulse, scraping down the sides often, until they are finely chopped, but not completely pureed. Set aside. Place the vegetable oil or clarified butter in a 6 quart soup pot over medium heat and add the onions. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are wilted and translucent, but not browned, about 15 minutes. Add the jalapenos and ginger and continue to cook 5 more minutes. Follow with the ground cumin, coriander, turmeric and chilies and continue stirring until the spices are well cooked, about 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the basmati rice until well coated with the oil, season with the salt and pepper, and add the vegetable stock to the pot. Bring the stock to a boil and immediately reduce the heat until the soup just simmers. Allow the soup to cook, covered, until the rice is very tender, about 20 minutes. Using either a blender or an immersion blender process the soup until you have a rich puree. Whisk in the coconut milk and the chopped beets, and return the soup to the fire. Bring the soup slowly back to a boil and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper as required. Finish the soup with the honey, if desired, and the garam masala, and serve in warmed bowls with a dollop of yogurt or sour cream and a few sprigs of fresh cilantro.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 40493,&quot;Captain Jack&#39;s Fried Fish Sandwich with Homemade Tartar Sauce Oil, for frying 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1 teaspoon paprika<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne<br> 2 eggs, beaten<br> 1 cup panko breadcrumbs<br> Four 6- to 8-ounce white fish fillets<br> 4 hoagie rolls<br> 2 cups shredded lettuce<br> 1/2 cup pickle slices<br> 1/2 cup Homemade Tartar Sauce, recipe follows 1/2 cup good mayonnaise 2 tablespoons chopped chives<br> 2 tablespoons roughly chopped cornichons<br> 2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves 1 tablespoon capers<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> Pinch freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan about a third of the way.

Remove from the heat, cover and let stand 1 hour, then drain. Stick the whole cloves into the onion halves; add to the pot along with the carrots, celery and pancetta. Wrap the thyme, parsley and bay leaves in a piece of cheesecloth, tie with kitchen twine and add to the pot; cover with water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer 1 hour. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Nestle the sausage in the beans; add water to cover, if necessary. Add the garlic heads, cut-side down. Cover and cook until the beans are just tender but still hold their shape, turning the sausage halfway through, 20 to 30 minutes. Uncover and let cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate overnight. Meanwhile, make the meat: Toss the lamb in a bowl with the sugar, oregano, cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, cayenne, 1 tablespoon each olive oil and salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook the lamb until browned, about 3 minutes per side; transfer to a plate. Add the pancetta to the pot; cook, stirring, until the fat renders, about 2 minutes. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly golden, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, wine, tomato paste, porcinis and orange zest, then return the lamb to the pot. Cut out a round of parchment paper and put directly on the surface of the meat. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover with the lid and cook until the lamb is tender, about 2 hours. (Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer.) Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate overnight. Skim off any fat from the bean and lamb mixtures. Remove the sausage and garlic heads from the beans. Slice the sausage into pieces and squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins; set aside. Discard the herb sachet, carrots, celery and onion halves from the beans. Discard the orange zest from the lamb. Using a slotted spoon, transfer about half of the beans to a large Dutch oven and top with the lamb (just the beans and lamb, not the liquid). Add the sliced sausage and garlic cloves, then the remaining beans. Pour in all the liquid from the lamb mixture. Add enough of the bean cooking liquid to cover, if necessary. Put the Dutch oven over medium-low heat and bring the mixture to a simmer, uncovered, about 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Pulse the bread in a food processor to make coarse crumbs. Toss with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle on the cassoulet, transfer to the oven and bake until golden brown, about 1 hour, 30 minutes.

Stir to combine and set aside. For the tagine: Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat until hot, then add the chicken, skin-side down, and sear until browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Meanwhile, place a large, family-sized cast-iron tagine on a low heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil plus the spice mix. Cook until the spices have bloomed and the oil is hot, 2 to 3 minutes, then add the carrots and onions and allow them to slightly soften, about 3 minutes. Add the chickpeas, sausage, garlic and seared chicken. Carefully add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Nestle in the olives and preserved lemon, then lower the heat and cover the tagine. Continue cooking over low heat for about 1 hour. Add more chicken broth slowly if needed (see Cook&#39;s Note). For the couscous: Meanwhile, in a large metal bowl add the couscous, raisins, olive oil, turmeric and salt and mix together. Bring the broth to a boil, then add to the couscous until it is covered and the liquid is a little more than 1/2 inch above the couscous. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit until the liquid is absorbed, preferably in a warm part of the kitchen, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the couscous onto a very large platter. Remove the chicken from the tagine to a work surface. Pour the vegetables from the tagine around the couscous. Put the chicken on top of the vegetables and garnish the whole platter with the toasted almonds and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 40536,&quot;Roast Pike with Piquant Herb Butter 1 whole pike (about 4 pounds) with head and fins, scaled and cleaned 2 to 3 thyme sprigs 2 to 3 oregano or marjoram sprigs Olive oil Salt and pepper, to taste 2 lemons cut into wedges, for serving 1/2 - ounce watercress 1/2 - ounce spinach leaves 1/2- ounce parsley 1/2 - ounce chervil or chives 3 anchovy fillets, soaked in milk 1 medium gherkin pickle 1 tablespoon capers, drained 1 garlic clove, peeled 6 tablespoons butter, softened 1/4 cup olive oil 2 teaspoons Dijon-style mustard Squeeze of lemon juice Instructions: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Wash the pike inside out and dry it on paper towels. Cut 2 or 3 diagonal slashes in both sides of the fish so the oven heat can penetrate and cook the fish more evenly. Tuck herb sprigs into each slash. Trim the tail into a neat v shape. Set the fish in an oiled baking dish or roasting pan and sprinkle it with olive oil, salt and pepper. Roast the fish, brushing regularly with more olive oil, until the skin is brown and crisp, 30 to 40 minutes. The fish eye will have turned white and the flesh should no longer be transparent; check it by flaking a bit from the backbone with a fork. Herb Butter: Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Discard the stems from the large watercress and spinach and the large stalks from the parsley and chervil. Add the herbs to the boiling water and blanch them by simmering for 2 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water and pat dry on paper towels. Drain the anchovies and work them in a food processor with the pickle, capers garlic and butter until finely chopped. With the blades turning, slowly pour in the olive oil. The herb butter will be creamy and a lovely shade of green. Add the mustard and season the butter to taste with lemon juice, salt and pepper. To finish, transfer the whole fish to a warm platter and decorate it with lemon wedges. Serve the herb butter in a separate bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 40537,&quot;Polpettone Two Ways 2 cups diced day-old bread, crust removed 2 1/2 cups milk, at room temperature<br> 1 large or 2 small shallots, minced<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 large egg, at room temperature<br> 1/4 pound thinly sliced prosciutto di Parma, finely chopped 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 pound ground turkey<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/2 cup white wine<br> 1 1/2 cups store-bought marinara Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the bread with 1/2 cup of the milk and break apart with your fingers. Mix well and allow the bread to soak for 5 minutes. Add the shallots, garlic, egg, prosciutto, Parmesan and 1/4 teaspoon salt and mix with a wooden spoon to evenly distribute the prosciutto. Add the turkey and parsley and mix well. Divide the mixture into 2 even oblong loaves. Heat 2 medium skillets over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter to each pan. Add a loaf to each pan and cook on all sides until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Divide the white wine between the two pans and cook until reduced by half. Add the remaining 2 cups milk and 1/4 teaspoon salt to one of the pans and bring to a simmer. Add the marinara to the other pan and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat under each pan to medium low and cover the pans. Braise until an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees in the center of each loaf, about 25 minutes, carefully flipping the loaves about halfway through. Remove the loaves from the pan and allow them to rest 10 minutes before slicing. Remove the marinara from the heat and stir with a wooden spoon. Simmer the remaining milk, uncovered, until it reduces by half. It will be slightly brown and look broken. Using an immersion blender, blend the milk until fully emulsified and creamy. Serve each polpettone with its respective sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 40538,&quot;Sausage Scrambles and Cheese 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil, 1 turn of the pan 1 pound bulk breakfast sausage, such as maple sausage 8 large eggs A splash half-and-half or whole milk A few drops hot sauce Salt and pepper 6 ounces (1/3 pound) Cheddar, diced 1 plum tomato, seeded and diced Instructions: Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil, 1 turn of the pan, add sausage and brown and crumble the meat, 5 or 6 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan and drain off some of the fat. Return pan to heat and reduce the temperature to medium low. Whisk together the eggs, half-and-half or milk, hot sauce, salt and pepper. Scramble the eggs until soft, then add cheese and continue to scramble another minute or so to finish cooking eggs and to begin to melt the cheese bits. Remove pan from heat and combine sausage and eggs. Garnish servings of the eggs with a few pieces of diced fresh tomato. Serve plates of sausage scrambles with pancakes, or for a simple supper, serve with toasted whole grain bread, buttered and drizzled with honey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 40539,&quot;Stuffed French Toast with Gruyere, Mustard Greens and Double-Smoked Bacon 1/4 cup creme fraiche 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br> Few dashes hot sauce<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 slices double-smoked bacon<br> 1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced<br> 1 pound mustard greens, ribs removed, coarsely chopped<br> 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1 large egg yolk<br> 2 cups half-and-half<br> 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan Eight 1/2-inch slices sourdough or pain de mie bread 8 slices Gruyere or Swiss cheese<br> 2 tablespoons canola oil<br> 2 tablespoons butter<br> Instructions: Whisk together the creme fraiche, mustard and hot sauce in a small bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Set a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, turning once, about 8 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel-lined plate, and then cut the slices into thirds. Add the red onions to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and starting to caramelize, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the mustard greens, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook until just starting to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, and then transfer the greens to a bowl. Whisk together the eggs, egg yolk and half-and-half in a baking dish until smooth. Add the Parmesan and some salt and pepper; whisk until combined. Spread the bread slices with some of the creme fraiche mixture, and top with a slice of Gruyere. Top half of the slices with 3 or 4 pieces of bacon and a little mound of greens. Turn the remaining slices, cheese-side down, on top of the greens and press down to make sandwiches. Working in batches of two, soak the sandwiches in the egg mixture on both sides until just soaked, about 2 minutes per side. Heat 1 tablespoon of the canola oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. (If you have a skillet large enough to cook all four sandwiches at once, add all of the oil and butter now.) Add two sandwiches to the skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low, and fry until crisp, golden and cooked through on both sides, about 5 minutes per side--cover the pan if needed to help the cheese melt, and adjust the heat to prevent the French toast from burning. Repeat with the remaining oil, butter and sandwiches. Halve the cooked sandwiches on the diagonal and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 40540,&quot;Three Bean Pasta e Fagioli 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 carrot, peeled and chopped 3 to 4 ribs celery from the heart, chopped 1 medium onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 stems fresh rosemary 1 bay leaf, fresh or dried Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans 1 (15-ounce) can chick peas 3 tablespoons tomato paste 3 cups chicken stock 3 cups water 1 cup mini penne with lines or ditalini 1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into thirds on an angle 1 lemon, zested and juiced A handful fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped Grated Romano cheese, for topping Instructions: Heat extra-virgin olive oil in a soup pot over medium to medium-high heat.

Mash up half of the blueberries in a small bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, salt and tapioca flour. Add the mashed blueberries, orange juice and orange zest and stir to combine. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. Fold in the whole berries. Line a 9-inch pie plate with aluminum foil. Place the blueberry mixture into the foil and place in the freezer until solid, approximately 6 to 8 hours. Once the filling is frozen, remove from the aluminum foil and wrap in plastic wrap and store in a freezer bag for up to 3 months. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Unroll first piece of dough and place into a 9-inch pie pan, making sure the dough reaches to the lip of the pie pan. Trim excess, if necessary. Prick the bottom and sides with a fork and set aside. Unroll second piece of dough and cut into 1 1/8-inch wide strips that are at least 10-inches long. Using a ruler that is 1 1/8-inches wide, lay the ruler on the dough at 1 edge and roll across dough using the edge of the ruler as you go to cut through the dough. Remove the frozen pie filling from the freezer and place into the prepared dough in the pan. Lightly brush the edge of the crust with the egg yolk. Lay 4 strips of dough across the top of the filling horizontally, leaving an even amount of space in between each strip. Fold back 2 alternating strips and lay down another strip in the middle of the pie, perpendicular to the other strips. Return the strips that are laid back to their original position. Next, fold back the other 2 strips and lay down a strip to the left of the center perpendicular strip. Return the strips that are laid back to their original position and repeat on the other side of the perpendicular strip, folding back the same 2 strips as you did on the other side. Once you have a lattice, brush all the strips of dough with the egg yolk, trim excess dough and pinch strips and edge of crust in order to seal. Place on the bottom rack of the oven and bake for about 1 hour 15 minutes. The pie should be bubbling lightly around the edges. If the lattice is not browned enough in the center, place under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes. Place the pie on a rack and allow to cool to room temperature before serving, approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 40542,&quot;Creamy Herbed Three Bean Pasta Salad Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 3 tablespoons sour cream 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 cup trimmed chopped green beans 8 ounces pasta shells 1 cup canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1 cup canned kidney beans, rinsed and drained 1/4 cup finely chopped shallots Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the romaine in the salted water for about 30 seconds, or until the central rib is just tender enough to bend. Remove and plunge into ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and pat dry. Lay romaine leaves out on a counter, outer rib side down. Cut out the wide rib section, or flatten it with your hands. Place a piece of cheese in the middle of each leaf. Top with about 1 tablespoon of the prosciutto. Season with salt and pepper. Make a neat package by folding the leaves around the cheese like an envelope. Place them seam side down. Run a skewers through each package. Brush each with olive oil. Refrigerate if not grilling immediately. Grill cheese packages over medium heat or broil about 4 inches from the heat. Cook 2 to 3 minutes and turn over. The cheese should begin to weep.

Arrange the rolls in the steamer, put the hot dogs in the boiling water, and cover with the steamer and lid. Cook until the hot dogs are heated through and the rolls are warm and soft, about 5 minutes. Be careful not to over steam the rolls as they can become soggy. While the dogs are cooking, cut the onion into 6 smaller pieces, put them into a food processor, and pulse until they are finely chopped. Remove the onions to a bowl and do the same with the cabbage. Crush the potato chips into very fine pieces. Remove a roll from the steamer. Put a hot dog into it and top with some onion, cabbage, and crushed chips. Squirt on some mayonnaise, mustard, and ketchup and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 40558,&quot;Meringue Clouds 3 cups superfine or caster sugar (1 pound 5 ounces) 9 extra-large egg whites, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Candied rose petals, for decoration Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange two oven racks evenly in the oven. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and spread the sugar in an even layer on the paper. (Leave a small border of paper around the sugar so the sugar doesn?t spill onto the pan.) Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 250 degrees F. Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When the sugar is almost ready, whisk the egg whites on high speed for 1 minute, until the whites are frothy. With the mixer still on high, slowly add the hot sugar to the egg whites. (I use a large spoon to start and then pick up the paper and pour the sugar in slowly.) Add the vanilla and continue to whisk on high for 10 minutes, until the meringue is at room temperature. It will be very thick and glossy. Using two large serving spoons, scoop 12 very large oval dollops of meringue onto two sheet pans lined with parchment paper. You should be able to get 6 meringues on each pan; space them well because they will expand while they bake. Place 3 candied rose petals on top of each meringue. Bake for 2 hours, until the outsides of the meringues are crisp and the centers are still soft. Set aside to cool on baking racks. Allow to sit uncovered and serve at room temperature. (Don?t refrigerate or store covered or they will lose their crispness.)

When cooking rice, for 1 cup of rice add just a little less than 1 cup water in a rice cooker. 45 minutes after rice has been started, remove into a big mixing bowl (plastic or wood is best, metal is also OK) to speed the cooling process. Add 1-ounce of sushi su seasoning and mix well into rice. Let stand to cool. Periodically turn your rice to cool evenly. Do this for about 20 to 30 minutes, then cover.<br> Place a full sheet of nori (rough side up), on the bamboo rolling mat. Cover the whole sheet except for about 7/8-inch at far end with rice, pressing rice with damp hands into an even layer. Sprinkle sesame seeds on rice from left to right. Place bands of Unagi, cucumber, and kaiware sprouts across leading edge of nori. Roll closest edge to you, up and away from you, very carefully tuck in the roll and continue until you reach the bare end, to seal your roll. Make sure when rolling all ingredients are tightly secured, this will help to keep ingredients intact when cutting. Compress the roll with the bamboo mat. You may shape your roll making it slightly oval or squared off. To serve, slice into 12 even slices. Place Unagi glaze on plate or serve as side dish. Fan out sushi on plate, garnish with pickled ginger and wasabi. Serve with soy sauce.<br> Sushi hints: Nori has 2 sides, 1 rough and 1 smooth and shiny. The rough side holds the rice better and the smooth side is more presentable on the outside. Also, water is your best friend when making sushi. Keep you hands wet when handling rice so the rice will not stick to your hands. This is important when slicing or cutting sushi rolls, keep your knife wet at all times so the knife can glide through the rice. Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Cook just until sugar completely dissolves. Remove from the heat and cool completely. Combine all ingredients and set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40571,&quot;Steve&#39;s Killer Bread Pudding 1 cup raisins 1/4 cup dark rum (recommended: Myers&#39;s) 1 1/2 loaves stale French or Italian bread, torn into pieces 3 cups milk 3 eggs, slightly beaten 1/2 cup butter, melted 2 teaspoons cinnamon 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup heavy cream or 1 cup evaporated milk 1 cup sugar 3/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons molasses 2 teaspoons lemon zest 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups sugar 5 ounces evaporated milk 4 tablespoons margarine 1 egg, beaten 2 egg yolks, beaten 3 tablespoons dark rum (recommended: Myers&#39;s) Instructions: Place raisins in a small bowl with rum and soak for a couple of hours.

Published by William and Morrow, 1993. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 40573,&quot;Homemade Bacon 5 pounds pork belly, skin on 1/4 cup kosher salt 2 teaspoons pink curing salt 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/4 cup honey (preferably chestnut honey) 2 tablespoons red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons smoked sweet paprika 1 teaspoon cumin seeds Instructions: Rinse the pork belly and pat dry. Transfer to a resealable 2-gallon plastic bag. To make the spice rub, mix the kosher salt, pink salt, brown sugar, honey, red pepper flakes, paprika and cumin in a bowl. Coat the pork belly all over with the mixture. Close the bag and refrigerate 7 to 10 days, flipping once a day, until the pork belly feels firm. It should take 7 days for a thin belly that is about 11/2 inches thick, longer for a belly that&#39;s 2 to 3 inches thick. Remove the pork belly from the bag, rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Refrigerate the belly on a rack, uncovered, 48 hours. Set up your smoker according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions using applewood chips, and set to 200 degrees F. Smoke the pork belly 3 hours, or until the bacon reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. Remove the rind (optional), then slice and cook as desired. To store, wrap the bacon in plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 1 week or freeze up to 2 months. Pink curing salt is a mix of salt and sodium nitrite. It keeps the meat pink and protects it from bacteria. You can find it at specialty food stores or online. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 40574,&quot;White Chocolate Orzo Pudding 4 cups whole milk 3 tablespoons sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1 cinnamon stick<br> 1 cup dried orzo pasta<br> 3/4 cup white chocolate chips, such as Guittard<br> 1 teaspoon orange zest (1/2 orange)<br> 1/2 cup crushed amaretti cookies<br> Instructions: Bring the milk, sugar, salt, vanilla and cinnamon stick to a simmer over medium heat in a medium saucepan or Dutch oven. Stir in the orzo and reduce the heat to low, just to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring often, until the orzo is cooked and the liquid is beginning to thicken slightly, 12 to 14 minutes; there will still be a good amount of liquid. Add the white chocolate chips and orange zest and stir until the chocolate is melted. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin from forming over the surface. Discard the cinnamon stick. Spoon the pudding into serving vessels of your choice and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour and up to overnight. Serve with crushed amaretti cookies sprinkled on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 40575,&quot;Jamaican Jerked Chicken 5 pounds chicken pieces 2 cups distilled white vinegar, plus 1 teaspoon 2 cups finely chopped scallions 2 Scotch bonnets, seeded and minced (please wear gloves) 2 tablespoons soy sauce 4 tablespoons fresh lime juice 5 teaspoons ground allspice 2 bay leaves 6 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon salt 2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme, crumbled 1 teaspoon cinnamon 2 cups Jamaican Barbecue Sauce, to serve, recipe follows 5 pounds chicken pieces 2 cups distilled white vinegar, plus 1 teaspoon 2 cups finely chopped scallions 2 Scotch bonnets, seeded and minced (please wear gloves) 2 tablespoons soy sauce 4 tablespoons fresh lime juice 5 teaspoons ground allspice 2 bay leaves 6 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon salt 2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme, crumbled 1 teaspoon cinnamon 2 cups Jamaican Barbecue Sauce, to serve, recipe follows 1 1/4 cups ketchup 1/3 cup dark brown sugar 1/3 cup distilled white vinegar 1/3 cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons Jamaican hot pepper sauce 3 tablespoons dark rum 2 tablespoons Jerk marinade (reserved from associated recipe) 3 cloves garlic, minced 3 scallions, minced 3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 1 1/4 cups ketchup 1/3 cup dark brown sugar 1/3 cup distilled white vinegar 1/3 cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons Jamaican hot pepper sauce 3 tablespoons dark rum 2 tablespoons Jerk marinade (reserved from associated recipe) 3 cloves garlic, minced 3 scallions, minced 3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger Instructions: Rinse chicken pieces well in 2 cups of the vinegar, drain, transfer to 2 sealable plastic bags and set aside.

Soak at room temperature overnight. Drain. Split each seed if whole, then remove and discard any green core, which will be bitter. Discard any dark lotus seeds. Combine the lotus seeds with 4 cups cold water in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer over low heat. Cook, partially covered, until the seeds are soft and easily break apart, about 1 hour, adding more water if the level falls below the seeds. Drain. Transfer the lotus seeds to a food processor. Add the warm water and process on high speed, stopping to scrape down the sides occasionally, until very smooth, about 1 minute. Pass through a mesh-strainer into another medium bowl, pressing on the solids. Scrape the bottom of the strainer and discard the solids (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Combine the lotus puree, confectioners\\u2019 sugar and a small pinch of salt in a medium nonstick saute pan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a flat-edge wooden spoon or firm rubber spatula, until the paste has thickened and slowly comes back together when you run a spatula across the bottom of the saute pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the oil 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly after each addition, until incorporated. Add the corn syrup and stir until smooth. Spread the lotus paste evenly in a shallow bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes, then refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours (see Cook\\u2019s Note). For the dough: Meanwhile, stir the wheat starch and boiling water in a medium heatproof bowl until a dough forms. Knead for 30 seconds until all the starch is hydrated.
