Liberally sprinkle the entire roast with salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides until golden and caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes per side; reduce the heat if the fat begins to smoke. Transfer the roast to a plate and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and saute, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper and garlic and saute until fragrant, another minute. Deglaze with the red wine, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Simmer until reduced by about half, another 2 to 5 minutes. Add the stock and thyme and bring to a simmer. Adjust the seasoning of the liquid. Put the roast back in the pot with any accumulated juices and place in the oven, covered. Cook the roast, turning every 30 minutes and uncovering the pot for the last 30 minutes of cooking, until very tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Transfer the roast to a cutting board and tent with foil. Increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F for the peppers and bread. For the sweet peppers: Toss the pepper strips with the olive oil, granulated garlic and some salt and pepper on a baking sheet. Bake, stirring halfway through, until lighter in color and softened, about 45 minutes. Strain the pot roast jus through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and return to the pot. Bring to a simmer and simmer until reduced slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Adjust the seasoning if necessary. Keep warm. Once the meat has cooled a bit, remove the twine. Pull the meat into smaller chunks and return to the reduced jus until ready to build the sandwiches. For the sandwich build: Rub the rolls with some of the giardiniera oil and toast in the oven until golden brown and crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Place some beef on a roll, then some sweet peppers (with some of the oil they were cooked in), followed by some hot giardiniera. Pour a small dish of reduced jus. Quickly dunk the whole sandwich in the hot jus, then wrap in deli paper or parchment paper and wait for 2 to 3 minutes while the magic happens. Repeat with the remaining rolls and toppings. When ready, open up and eat! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 1844,&quot;Silver Dollar Tropical Pancakes with Mascarpone Whipped Cream 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon light brown sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons buttermilk<br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for the griddle<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Pineapple-Mango Syrup, recipe follows Mascarpone Whipped Cream, recipe follows Confectioners&#39; sugar, for serving<br> Mint sprigs, optional, for serving<br> 2 cups fresh mango, chopped, plus 1/4 cup finely diced 2 cups fresh pineapple, chopped, plus 1/4 cup, finely diced<br> 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest<br> 1 to 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 8 ounces mascarpone, at room temperature 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1/2 to 2/3 cup very cold heavy cream<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Instructions: Whisk together the flour, granulated and brown sugars, the baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.

Combine 3/4 cup sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons water in a 10-inch ovenproof skillet; stir until the mixture looks like wet sand. Cook over medium-high heat, gently swirling the pan occasionally but not stirring, until light amber, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Toss the cherries with the lemon juice and arrange over the caramel; set the skillet aside. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and the remaining 1 cup sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour, and mix until just incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips. Pour the batter over the cherries and spread evenly. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. (Cover loosely with foil if the cake is browning too quickly.) Let sit 15 minutes, then invert onto a platter and let cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 1852,&quot;Salsa Roja 1 dried ancho cl, stemmed and seeded 1 dried Anaheim cl, stemmed and seeded 2 dried chipotle chiles, stemmed and seeded 1 tablespoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican 1 tablespoon cumin seeds 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 cup hot water 8 plum tomatoes, quartered 1 medium Spanish onion, sliced 3 garlic cloves 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 sprigs cilantro 1 tablespoon sugar 1 lime, juiced Instructions: Tear all the chiles into large pieces and toast them in a large dry skillet over medium heat until they change color a bit, about 2 minutes. Add the spices and continue to toast for 2 to 3 minutes until everything is fragrant. Remove from heat and carefully add about 1 cup of hot water to just cover the chiles. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes. Preheat the broiler. Put the quartered tomatoes, sliced onion, and whole garlic cloves onto a roasting tray, spreading out evenly. Drizzle with plenty of olive oil and season well with salt and pepper and sprinkle with cilantro sprigs. Broil until everything is nicely charred, about 10 minutes (you want lots of deep rich color so don&#39;t be afraid if some of the edges get pretty black). Add the cl mixture to a blender and puree. Remove the tomato/onion mixture from the roasting pan and carefully add it to the blender, (it will be hot). Blend until smooth (you may need to work in 2 batches). Once everything is pureed, pour the mixture back into the pot over low heat adding a little water if the salsa is too thick. Stir in the sugar and lime juice and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer to a large serving bowl and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 1853,&quot;Bonfire Skewers 1/2 pound frozen raw shrimp, thawed 2 zucchini, cut in 1/2-inch pieces 1/2 pound andouille sausage, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 tablespoon Creole seasoning Instructions: Special equipment: bamboo skewers, soaked in water for a minimum of 15 minutes Preheat grill to medium.

Meanwhile, thoroughly pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Lightly coat each side of the steaks with canola oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons canola oil to the skillet (this will help create a great crust on the steaks) and add the steaks. Do not crowd them; if you cannot leave room between the steaks, use 2 skillets. Without moving them, cook the steaks 3 minutes. Using tongs, flip them and cook 1 more minute for rare, 2 more minutes for medium rare or 4 more minutes for medium. Transfer the steaks to a plate and cover loosely with foil. Let rest at least 5 minutes before cutting into them. Pour out the used oil from the skillet and add a glug of new oil. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the shallots and garlic to the skillet and cook until they just begin to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce and sherry vinegar and bring the sauce to a boil. Cook until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and whisk in the butter until it has melted and the sauce has thickened. Stir in the olives, if using. Put each steak on a plate; spoon the sauce over the top and sprinkle with chives. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 1856,&quot;Clarified Butter 1 1/2 pounds unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces Instructions: Place the butter in a 2-quart saucepan and set over medium heat. Once the butter has liquefied, decrease the heat to lowest setting then adjust to maintain a low boil. Cook for approximately 45 minutes or until the butter reaches 260 degrees F, is clear, and the foam on top is slightly browned. Strain the clarified butter through 4 layers of cheesecloth set into a hand strainer into a heatproof vessel. Cool completely before refrigerating in an airtight container for up to six months. Can be frozen for up to a year. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1857,&quot;Pizza Pizzas 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon pure olive oil 3/4 cup warm water 2 cups bread flour (for bread machines) 1 teaspoon instant yeast 2 teaspoons olive oil Olive oil, for the pizza crust Flour, for dusting the pizza peel 1 1/2 ounces pizza sauce 1/2 teaspoon each chopped fresh herbs such as thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, for example A combination of 3 grated cheeses such as mozzarella, Monterey Jack, and provolone Instructions: Place the sugar, salt, olive oil, water, 1 cup of flour, yeast, and remaining cup of flour into the mixer&#39;s work bowl. Using the paddle attachment, start the mixer on low and mix until the dough just comes together, forming a ball. Lube the hook attachment with cooking spray. Attach the hook to the mixer and knead for 15 minutes on medium speed. Tear off a small piece of dough and flatten into a disc. Stretch the dough until thin. Hold it up to the light and look to see if the baker&#39;s windowpane, or taut membrane, has formed. If the dough tears before it forms, knead the dough for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Roll the pizza dough into a smooth ball on the countertop. Place into a stainless steel or glass bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil to the bowl and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours. Place the pizza stone or tile onto the bottom of a cold oven and turn the oven to its highest temperature, about 500 degrees F. If the oven has coils on the oven floor, place the tile onto the lowest rack of the oven. Split the pizza dough into 2 equal parts using a knife or a dough scraper. Flatten into a disk onto the countertop and then fold the dough into a ball. Wet hands barely with water and rub them onto the countertop to dampen the surface. Roll the dough on the surface until it tightens. Cover one ball with a tea towel and rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the steps with the other piece of dough. If not baking the remaining pizza immediately, spray the inside of a ziptop bag with cooking spray and place the dough ball into the bag. Refrigerate for up to 6 days. Sprinkle the flour onto the peel and place the dough onto the peel. Using your hands, form a lip around the edges of the pizza. Stretch the dough into a round disc, rotating after each stretch. Toss the dough in the air if you dare. Shake the pizza on the peel to be sure that it will slide onto the pizza stone or tile. (Dress and bake the pizza immediately for a crisp crust or rest the dough for 30 minutes if you want a chewy texture.) Brush the rim of the pizza with olive oil. Spread the pizza sauce evenly onto the pizza. Sprinkle the herbs onto the pizza and top with the cheese. Slide the pizza onto the tile and bake for 7 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown. Rest for 3 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 1858,&quot;Chocolate Banana Ice Cream 3 large ripe bananas, peeled 3 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder 1 tablespoon virgin coconut oil Instructions: Cut each banana into 6 chunks and freeze until rock solid, preferably overnight. Put the banana chunks, cocoa powder and coconut oil in a food processor and process. Hang on, your food processor may jolt in the very beginning! The bananas will look crumbly at first, then gooey and eventually light and creamy- just like ice cream. Stop the food processor frequently to scrape down the sides of the bowl and break up any clumps. Serve right away or scrape into a container and freeze until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Port]&quot; 1859,&quot;Souvlaki with Merguez Sausage and Piquillo Pepper Yogurt Sauce 1 cup Greek olive oil 6 cloves garlic, chopped 1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves 3 pounds lamb tenderloin, cut into 1 by 1-inch strips 1 pound merguez sausage Wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes Salt and freshly ground pepper 8 pocket pita breads Grilled onion, sliced Grilled red pepper, sliced Piquillo Pepper Yogurt Sauce, recipe follows 2 cups thick Greek yogurt 4 piquillo peppers, or 2 roasted red peppers 6 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest 2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano leaves Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Whisk together the oil, garlic, onion, and oregano in a large bowl. Add the lamb and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or up to 4 hours. Preheat the grill to medium-high. Grill the sausage until golden brown on all sides and just cooked through. Remove the sausage from the grill, let rest for 5 minutes, and then cut into 1-inch pieces. Skewer the lamb and sausage onto the presoaked wooden skewers, and season with salt and pepper. Grill for 2 minutes on each side, or until the lamb is golden brown and cooked to medium-rare doneness. Remove from the grill and let rest until cool enough to touch. Meanwhile, grill the pita on both sides for about 20 seconds to warm through. Slice off 1- inch from the top of each pita. Remove the lamb and sausage from the skewers into the pitas. Add sliced grilled onions and peppers to pitas, and drizzle with the yogurt sauce. Put all ingredients, except salt and pepper, in a blender and blend until smooth. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Transfer to a small serving bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 1860,&quot;Grouper Ceviche with Jicama and Avocado Slaw 12 ounces skinless grouper fillets 1/2 cup fresh-squeezed lime juice 1 cup freshly squeezed grapefruit juice 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro leaves 1 jalapeno, minced Kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons minced red onion 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves 1/4 teaspoon freshly toasted and ground cumin Kosher salt and ground black pepper 1 cup jicama, peeled and sliced into matchstick size pieces 1 avocado, peeled, pitted and diced into 1/4-inch pieces Instructions: First, thinly slice the fillets and then cut them into 3/4-inch bite-sized squares. Keep them very cold while you prepare the rest of the recipe. Combine the ingredients for the marinade in a bowl. Set that bowl inside a larger one, filled with ice. Now prepare the salad. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, onion, cilantro, cumin, and salt and pepper. Then, in a larger chilled bowl, toss the vinaigrette with the avocado and jicama. Set aside. Gently mix the grouper and the marinade/dressing and let stand for about 10 minutes. Into 4 chilled bowls, spoon the ceviche with its liquid. Serve the salad, family-style, and encourage the guests to top their ceviche with salad. If you can get Cancha (Latin American corn nuts) and toast, they make a fantastic and authentic addition to this dish. I sometimes like to drizzle coconut milk onto the citrus juices. Or, I season the dish with tiny dots of soy sauce and sesame oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]</p><p>&quot; 1861,&quot;Herb and Garlic Roast Pork Loin with Honey Mustard Sauce 1 1/2 pounds boneless pork loin Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary 1 clove garlic, minced 1 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 whole heads garlic 3 tablespoons honey Instructions:</p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Add the onions, bell pepper and carrots and cook, stirring until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add the cayenne, black pepper, garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in the sweet potato, broth, and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. *Puree the soup in the pot using an immersion blender or in a regular blender in 2 batches and return the soup to the pot. Add the peanut butter and honey and stir, over low heat, until the peanut butter melts. Serve warm, garnished with the scallions. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</li></ol><p>&quot; 1864,&quot;Lowcountry Shrimp and Sausage Muscadine Skewers 1 cup muscadine wine or cider 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper<br> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon onion powder<br> 2 cloves garlic, grated<br> 1 tablespoon honey<br> 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika<br> 2 pounds jumbo shrimp (16/20), cleaned and shelled<br> 4 smoked sausage links, sliced into medallions 1/2 inch thick<br> Neutral oil with a high smoking point, for the grill Instructions: Fill a baking dish with water and place ten 12-inch-long wooden skewers in it to soak for 30 minutes.

Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Separate the 2 eggs and put all the whites in a large bowl. In a large liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks, milk, vanilla, and 1/4 cup melted butter. Whisk the milk mixture into the flour mixture until a batter is formed. Take care not to over mix the batter. Whip the egg whites with a hand-held electric mixer or whisk, until they just begin to hold a loose peak. Scatter the sugar over the whites and continue beating until they hold a soft peak. Fold a third of the egg whites into the batter to lighten the base, then fold in the remaining whites. Gently fold in the chocolate chips. Brush the inside surface of the iron with butter. Pour in enough batter to barely fill each hole of the waffle iron; the amount will vary depending upon the size of the iron. (Take into consideration that the batter will spread once the lid is closed.) Close and cook until crisp and the waffle iron stops steaming, about 5 minutes. Serve as the waffles come off the iron or transfer to a rack set on a pan in preheated 200 degree F oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter. (If the waffle iron is well seasoned or nonstick it is not necessary to brush the inner surface each time before cooking the waffles.) Serve the waffles with syrup, jam, fresh fruit, or yogurt.

Whisk the ketchup, 1 cup water, the vinegar, mustard, molasses, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce in a separate bowl. Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the garlic mixture and cook, stirring, until the oil turns brick red, about 1 minute. Add the ketchup mixture and bring to a gentle simmer; cook, whisking occasionally, 30 minutes. Make the ribs: Soak 1 heaping cup hickory, mesquite or apple-wood chips in water, at least 30 minutes. Prepare a grill for indirect cooking over medium-low heat (about 250 degrees F): On a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side; on a gas grill, turn on only one side of the burners. Cover the grate on the cooler side of the grill with aluminum foil. Close the grill lid. Position the ribs on a cutting board, meat-side down. Slip a small knife between the bone and membrane, then gently pull off the membrane. Sprinkle the racks with 1 teaspoon each salt and black pepper on both sides. Drain the wood chips. For a charcoal grill, scatter the chips directly over the hot coals; for a gas grill, put the chips in a smoker box and position over direct heat. Put the ribs meat-side up on the foil on the cooler side of the grill. Close the grill lid; bring the temperature back up and cook the ribs, undisturbed, 3 hours. (For a charcoal grill, adjust the vents, or add more hot, ashed-over coals as needed to maintain consistent heat.) Remove the ribs and close the lid. Wrap each rack tightly in foil, then return to the cooler side of the grill, meat-side down; close the lid and grill 2 more hours. Remove the ribs and carefully unwrap. Return to the cooler side of the grill, meat-side up; cook, basting generously with the sauce halfway through, until the meat is tender, about 1 more hour. Remove the racks and let rest a few minutes before slicing. Serve with the remaining sauce.

Heat four 10-inch oven-proof dinner plates in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes. To ensure the success of the raclettes, the plates must be very hot. When ready to serve, remove the plates from the oven. Working as quickly as possible, arrange four slices of cheese in the center of each plate, overlapping them slightly. The cheese should begin to sizzle once it comes into contact with the plate. At once, place the four plates on the floor of the oven. Let cheese melt in the oven for about 2 minutes, being careful not to let it brown. Remove from the oven, place a potato and one or two gherkins and pickled onions on the side of each plate and serve at once.

Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch pie pan. Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly and trim the excess around the rim. Place the pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easy to move in and out of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To make the filling: melt the butter and chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, remove from heat and let cool. Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl until frothy and then blend in the sugar. Stir in the syrup, vanilla, bourbon, salt, and the melted butter mixture until well blended. Arrange the pecans on the bottom of the pie crust and carefully pour the egg mixture over them. Bake until the filling is set and slightly puffed, about 45 minutes. Test for doneness by sticking a thin knife in the center of the pie, if it comes out pretty clean, you&#39;re good to go.

Add the sliced beef and toss to make sure all the beef is coated in the marinade. Cover and marinate in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight. Heat 3 tablespoons of the canola oil in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining 2 cloves chopped garlic and continue to saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the miso paste and cook another 2 minutes. Add the beef broth, 3 tablespoons of the butter, cayenne and lime juice. Stir until combined and bring to a gentle bubble, 2 to 3 minutes. Place the liquid in a blender and blend to emulsify. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Remove the beef from the marinade and place on a paper-towel-lined plate. Pat dry. Heat 3 tablespoons of the canola in large saute pan set over high heat.

Spread the hazelnuts and almonds on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Shake the pan halfway through baking to ensure that the nuts toast evenly. Allow the nuts to cool. Gather the hazelnuts into a kitchen towel and rub them together to remove the skins. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the hazelnuts and almonds with 1/4 cup of the sugar and the cinnamon, and process until it&#39;s the consistency of a fine meal. Add the flour and pulse a few times to combine. Separate and discard the whites of the eggs. Push the egg yolks through a fine-mesh sieve, scraping the yolks off the bottom of the sieve and into the flour mixture. Pulse on and off a few times to combine. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and lemon zest on low 2 to 3 minutes, until softened. Add the remaining sugar and mix on medium, 3 to 4 minutes, until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the almond extract and mix to combine. Turn the mixer off, add the nut mixture, and mix on low until just incorporated. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and flatten into a rectangle, about 1-inch thick. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, 1 to 2 hours or overnight. Divide the dough in 1/2 and return one 1/2 to the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thickness, flouring the surface of the dough as necessary. Using the shaped cutter, cutting as closely together as possible, cut out the cookies. Place them 1-inch apart on 1 to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets to chill until firm, 30 to 45 minutes. Set the scraps aside. Roll and cut out the remaining dough in the same manner. Gather all the scraps together, chill, roll, and cut to make the tops. Using the small cutter, cut out the center s of 1/2 of the cookies and chill until firm, 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust the oven racks to the upper and lower positions and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until firm to the touch and lightly browned, rotating the baking sheets halfway through to ensure even baking.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Combine the pears, fig preserves, cornstarch, cinnamon and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Set aside. For the apple cranberry filling: Place a large nonstick pot over medium heat. Add the apples, frozen cranberries, sugar and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring aggressively to burst the cranberries as they soften, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the cranberry juice and cornstarch together in a small bowl to form a slurry. Pour the slurry into the fruit and stir to combine, then cook until a thick sauce has formed, 1 minute more. Turn off the heat and set aside. For the blueberry filling: Combine the blueberries, honey, cornstarch and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl and stir to combine. Set aside. For the pie: On a lightly floured surface, stack 3 rounds of pie dough, then roll out to a 20-by-15-inch rectangle. Place the rectangle on one of the parchment lined baking sheets. Use scissors to trim to a 1-inch overhang on all 4 sides and save any excess dough for later use. Place in the fridge to firm up for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, stack the remaining 3 rounds of dough, then roll out to an 18-by-13-inch rectangle. Use a pizza cutter or knife to slice the rectangle lengthwise into twelve 1-inch-wide strips. Place the strips on the remaining lined baking sheet and chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes, or until it is time to create the lattice. Remove the bottom crust from the refrigerator and prick in several places with the tines of a fork. Pour the blueberry filling in one corner and spread diagonally to fill a third of the pan (the fruit layers should not have a perfect edge or stopping point). Next, pour the apple cranberry filling in the middle and spread diagonally to fill another third of the pan. Finally, pour the pear and fig filling in the remaining third of the pan. Using a basket weave method, create a diagonal lattice on top of the pie with the remaining dough strips: Arrange 6 strips down diagonally across the pie, leaving about 2 inches between each dough strip. Fold back every other strip and place a strip down perpendicularly. Unfold the strips over them. Repeat this process with the remaining 5 strips, alternating the strips that are lifted to create a woven pattern. Press the end of each dough strip along the rim of the baking sheet and trim off any excess. Use your fingertips or the tines of a fork to crimp the crust of the pie along the rim of the pan. Brush the lattice (but not the edges) with the beaten egg. Bake until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool completely before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1886,&quot;Jerk Fried Chicken 1 small frying chicken Jerk Marinade, recipe follows Salt and freshly ground black pepper Buttermilk, for coating Flour, for coating Canola oil, for frying 1/4 cup ground allspice 1 tablespoon dried thyme 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons rubbed sage 1 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 cup salt 1/2 cup garlic powder 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup olive oil 3/4 cup soy sauce 1 cup orange juice 1 cup rice wine vinegar 3 limes, zested and juices 3 Scotch bonnet peppers, stemmed 3 Spanish onions, chopped 3 garlic cloves 2 bunches fresh scallion, chopped Instructions: Quarter the chicken.

Let the mixture sit until it begins to foam, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, bread flour and salt and then make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture and the olive oil. Using a fork, incorporate the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients until a dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, continue to work and then knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Lightly coat a clean bowl with olive oil and then add the dough, turning once to coat the dough in oil. Cover and set in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; make sure the grill grates are clean. Have your pizza toppings standing by. Cut the dough in quarters, shape into balls and work with 1 ball at a time. Stretch each dough ball into a 9- to 10-inch circle by hand or roll into a bigger (and thinner) circle with a rolling pin. With a towel soaked in canola oil, coat the grill grates lightly in oil. Add the dough rounds and cook until grill marks form and the dough stiffens, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the crusts and cook for an additional minute. Remove the crusts to an inverted baking sheet (so they slide off easily). Load the crusts with the desired toppings. Return to the grill, cover and cook the pizzas until the toppings are warmed and the cheese is melted, 2 to 4 more minutes.

Salt the fish and cover it with the citrus paste; let sit in the refrigerator until the other components have been completed. For the beer blanc: Fill a medium pot about 3/4 full with water and place over low heat. The water should be warm to the touch but not hot. Sweat the shallots, fennel and olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat until the shallots are transparent, about 3 minutes. Pour in just enough canola oil to coat them, and then add the salt. This will ensure the vegetables don&#39;t brown as the salt pulls moisture out of them and creates a steaming effect. After about 1 minute, add the beer and vinegar and stir to combine. Simmer the mixture until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add a splash of water or fish stock and reduce the heat to low. Whisk in 12 tablespoons of the butter, one cube at a time, waiting until it is completely incorporated before adding more. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve. Discard the solids and transfer the liquid to a powerful blender (or use an immersion blender set to high) and process while adding the remaining 4 tablespoons butter a little at a time. The emulsion will not be stable for long, so transfer the mixture to a heat-proof bowl and place it over the pot of warm water on the stove to keep it warm. The sauce does not hold in the refrigerator, so discard after use. For the potato and fennel hash: Put the potatoes in a pot and cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Let the potatoes sit in the water until soft, about 10 minutes. Strain off the water and spread out in a single layer on a flat surface to cool. Sweat the shallots, garlic, carrot, celery and fennel with the oil in a saute pan over medium heat until soft but not colored. Add the cooled potatoes, the chicken broth, butter and pinch of salt. Reduce over medium heat until there is only enough liquid to glaze the vegetables. Remove from the heat, add the lemon juice and taste for salt, adding more if necessary. To serve: When the beer blanc sauce and potato and fennel hash are completed and holding, heat a grill or grill pan to high and and grill the fish skin-side down, until 70 percent cooked, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully turn over the fish and cook on the flesh side for only about a minute or so. Place some beer blanc on 4 plates. Place some potato and fennel hash in the middle of each plate. Top with the fish skin-side up.

Rub the beans between the palms of your hands to free the outer skins, which should float to the surface. Scoop off the skins and discard. Drain the beans. Puree the beans and onion in a food processor. Season with the chil and salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350 degrees F. Using 2 soup spoons, form the bean mixture into small egg shapes. Press a dried shrimp into the center of each one, and press the bean mixture round to secure it. The shrimp should still stand proud.

Process the flour, butter, granulated and confectioners&#39; sugars and salt in a food processor until the mixture resembles wet crumbs and holds together when squeezed in your palm, about 2 minutes (this takes longer than seems necessary, but be patient). Divide the mixture evenly between two 5-inch aluminum pie pans or pie tins. Press the dough very firmly into the bottoms and up the sides, making sure to press it into the corners very well. Smooth and flatten the tops with your fingers or the back of a small spoon. Bake the crusts on the hot baking sheet until the bottom and sides are golden brown (probably more in some spots than in others), about 12 minutes. Let cool completely on a cooling rack. For the filling: Whisk together the eggs, cream, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and allspice in a medium bowl. Whisk in the pumpkin puree and then the melted butter.<br> Put the filling in the pie shells. Bake until puffed and the centers still look slightly wet but not loose, 25 to 30 minutes.

Salt it and add the lobsters head first. Put the lid on the pot and boil until bright red and cooked, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water. While the lobster is cooking, peel the grapefruits to the quick, cutting first the top and bottom off, then cutting the skin off around them, removing all the pith. Cut the grapefruit sections with a knife into a large bowl to catch the juice, and squeeze the remaining juice out of the membrane into the bowl as well. To remove the lobster meat, twist off the claws. Use the back of a chef&#39;s knife to crack both sides of the claws. Pull off the shell and reserve the meat. Use a pick to pull the meat out of the tube-like limbs attached to the claws. Now, twist the tails off the bodies. Lay them flat on their side and press down to crack the center. Pull out the meat. Discard the bodies and shells, or use them to make lobster bisque. Chop the lobster meat into large chunks for the salad and add it to the grapefruit. Cut the avocado and add it to the bowl, along with a generous squeeze of lemon to keep its color. Chop the green onions, including the green parts, and add along with the parsley leaves. Add the oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss. Taste, adjusting the seasonings (and adding a little lemon zest if you like) and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 1906,&quot;Oven-Roasted Turkey 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon dried thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 14-pound turkey, giblets removed, washed and dried Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Fresh thyme, for garnish Instructions: Mix the smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, dried thyme, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper in a bowl.

June - Why We Love: Strawberries &quot;,[Prosecco] 1928,&quot;Pastel de Maiz 5 cups fresh corn kernels (from about 10 ears corn) 1/2 cup unsalted butter 2 teaspoons sugar 2 to 3 cups chicken stock, preferably homemade Leafy tops from 1 rib celery, coarsely chopped 1/2 small carrot, coarsely chopped 5 black peppercorns 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 large chicken breast, on the bone 10 prunes, pitted 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 onion, finely chopped 7 plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped 4 large egg yolks 1 large egg yolk, lightly beaten Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and butter a 5 cup souffle or baking dish. In a food processor pulse 4 cups of the corn kernels (reserving 1 cup) for 5 to 10 seconds, scraping down the bowl to get the mixture to move freely. Continue processing until the corn is pureed. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the pureed corn and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has thickened to coating consistency. Transfer the pureed corn to a large mixing bowl and set aside to cool. Fill a large deep saucepan about 1/3 full with chicken stock and add the celery, carrot, peppercorns, and salt (there should be just enough stock to cover the chicken breasts). Bring the stock to a boil over high heat. Season the chicken well, add it to the pan and reduce the heat. Partially cover the pan and simmer for about 12 minutes, then remove from the heat, add the pitted prunes to the pan to soak, and let the chicken cool until it is just warmer than room temperature. Remove the chicken and the prunes. Cut the chicken meat into 1inch cubes, discarding the skin and bone. Coarsely chop the prunes and set them both aside. In a large deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium low heat. Add the onions and saute for one minute, stirring. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar, cover the pan and let the onions cook for 4 or 5 minutes, until softened. Uncover the pan and increase the heat to medium. Continue cooking until the excess liquid has evaporated, without browning the onions. Drain the chopped tomatoes, then add them to the pan. Continue cooking until the excess moisture has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken, prunes, and the reserved cup of corn kernels to the pan and remove it from the heat. In the bowl of an electric mixer or with a hand mixer, beat the egg yolks until they are pale and thickened. Add the pureed corn mixture and mix to combine. Spread half of the yolk corn mixture over the base of the pan, then carefully spoon the chicken mixture over the corn in an even layer. Cover with the remaining yolk corn mixture in an even layer and brush the top lightly with the beaten egg yolk. Bake in the center of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Let rest for 5 minutes, then serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Garnacha]&quot; 1929,&quot;Chicken Breast with Crab and Artichoke Souffle 1/2 cup vegetable oil 4 pounds chicken breast, boneless and skinless, cut into 4-ounce portions Salt and pepper Crab boil seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 1/2 cup butter 1 pound crabmeat, picked through to remove remnants of shells 1(6-ounce) can artichoke hearts, cut into quarters 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup heavy cream Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat oil in a large skillet. Season chicken with salt, pepper and crab boil seasoning on both sides. Place smooth side of breast into pan and let brown, then flip over to brown on other side. In a separate 2-quart saucepan, melt butter over medium heat, add crab and artichokes, and saute. Stir in flour, add cream and then season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Let simmer until it begins to become cohesive. Place chicken breasts on a baking sheet and top each piece with some of the crab mixture. Bake in oven until \\souffle\\ is golden brown, about 7 to 8 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1930,&quot;Basic Sugar Cookie 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup vegetable shortening 1 cup sugar 3/4 cup white corn syrup 1 egg 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Royal Icing, recipe follows 5 tablespoons meringue powder (found in cake decorating stores) 1/2 cup minus 2 tablespoons water OR 2 egg whites*, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 2 teaspoons water 1 pound confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt and set aside.<br> In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, beat the shortening at low speed until fluffy. Add the sugar and corn syrup and beat until well blended, then add the egg and the vanilla, beating continuously on low. Slowly add the flour mixture, about 2 tablespoons at a time. (If you are not using a heavy-duty mixer, the dough may become too stiff for the mixer to handle. If so, you may have to add the last of the flour by hand, kneading the dough until all of the flour is fully incorporated.)<br> Put the dough in a large plastic bag and refrigerate for 2 hours.<br> To make decorated cutout cookies, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out the chilled dough to about 1/8-inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut out the dough using tree, snowflake, star, and bird patterns. Place the cookies on greased cookie sheets and bake until golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the cookies on racks before decorating.<br> To decorate, tint a recipe of Royal Icing to your desired colors. Keep the icing covered with a damp towel while you are working to prevent it from drying out. To cover a cookie with icing, thin some of the icing with a little water and spread it on the cookie with a knife or metal spatula. Leave some of the icing thick for piping borders or other designs, using the #2 tip. Add dragees, edible glitter, colored sprinkles, or other decorations to the wet icing. To attach candies to un-iced cookies, brush a thin layer of clear piping gel on the cookie with a small paintbrush and add decorations. Royal Icing is very versatile. It is pure white and dries very hard, so it is perfect for making flowers and bows and delicate piped work. It can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 weeks. You should stir the icing to restore its original consistency after storage, but do not rebeat. Royal Icing does not work well in high humidity. Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat slowly until they are all blended. Then beat at medium speed until the icing forms stiff peaks, about 5 minutes. Add more sugar if the icing is not stiff enough, or a few drops of water if it is too stiff. Use immediately or cover the bowl with a damp cloth to prevent drying when not in use. Allow at least 24 hours for royal icing decorations to dry, at room temperature.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 1931,&quot;Potatoes with Whole Spices 2 pounds potatoes, peeled 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder Coarse salt 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds 1/2 teaspoon nigella seeds 1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds 3 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves Instructions: Slice the potatoes into half-inch rounds, then dice these further into small, evenly-sized cubes. Using a wok or other non-stick pan, take the minimum amount of oil needed and fry these cubed potatoes over a high heat to start with and then turn the heat down and cover. When the potatoes are a little more than half done, add the turmeric, chili powder and some salt, closely followed by the whole spices, mixed together. Stir to combine and put the lid back on once again. When the potatoes are nearly ready (and you will have to be vigilant to ensure they don&#39;t get too soft), take the lid off, turn the heat up and stir-fry to enable any excess liquid to evaporate.

Stab the potatoes with a fork or paring knife a few times on all sides. Place on a baking sheet and bake until fork-tender, 60 to 80 minutes. Let cool slightly (but keep the oven on). Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and shallot and cook until softened but not browned. Set aside. Once the fully cooked potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them in half lengthwise. Using a spoon or melon baller, scoop out the flesh of the potatoes, leaving a 1/4-inch rim to preserve the shape of the shells. In a large bowl, mash the potato insides until mostly smooth. Add the butter mixture, sour cream, chives and 1 cup of Cheddar and mix together. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the mixture evenly into the 8 shells. Top with the remaining 1 cup cheese. Bake until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.

Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and drain off excess fat on a paper towel. Divide the chorizo mixture evenly between the scooped out tomatoes. Crack one egg onto each of the tomatoes. Place the tomatoes in a baking dish and bake for about 25 minutes or until the egg whites are fully cooked. Crumble queso fresco on top and sprinkle with cilantro.

Begin with by putting a slice of cake at the bottom of the glass. Spritz or drizzle the cake with a little peach liqueur.<br> Fill a pastry bag with the Passion Fruit Pastry Cream and pipe it on top of the cake.<br> Then add about 2 cups of the Macerated Tropical Fruit. Repeat this layering until you reach the top of the glass, finishing with a slice of cake.<br> Top with the Chantilly Cream and garnish with candied ginger. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Cream the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the extract and zest. Fold the dry ingredients by hand. Divide the batter into 2 greased 8-inch rounds, lined with parchment paper. Bake until golden brown and springy to the touch, about 1 hour. Mix the flour and the sugar together. In a heavy bottom saucepan start heating 3 cups of the milk and the vanilla bean over medium heat. In a bowl whisk together 1 cup of milk with the egg yolks, then add the flour and the sugar and whisk until smooth.<br> As soon as the milk comes to a boil, pour about a third of the milk mixture into the eggs. Stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Then add the mixture back into the pot. Stirring constantly until the custard thickens. As the custard starts to bubble, you should stir more vigorously to take out any lumps that form. Boil the custard for about 1 minute to allow the flour to cook out. Remove pasty cream from the heat into a clean bowl, and fold in the butter and the passion fruit puree. Put a piece of plastic wrap right on the top of the pastry cream and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 2 to 3 hours.<br> Whip all ingredients together until soft peaks form. Toss cut fruit with sugar and set aside for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 1948,&quot;Spaghetti Carbonara Pie 1 tablespoon butter 8 ounces pancetta 1 1/2 teaspoons coarse or kosher salt, plus more for the cooking water<br> 1 bunch broccoli rabe<br> 1 pound dried spaghetti<br> 2 large eggs<br> 2 to 3 large yolks<br> 1 1/4 cups whole milk 1 teaspoon black pepper<br> 8 ounces (about 2 cups) finely grated Parmesan and/or aged Pecorino-Romano<br> Instructions: Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch springform pan and wrap the outside tightly in aluminum foil. Place on a baking sheet. Chop pancetta into 1/2-inch cubes and saute over medium heat until well browned. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Boil the broccoli rabe for 1 to 2 minutes in the salted water until it has some give. Fish it out with a large slotted spoon and drain. Set aside. Now add the spaghetti to your boiling water and cook until 2 minutes shy of done, so very al dente. While the pasta cooks, use a towel to squeeze all excess moisture from the broccoli rabe. Separate out 1 cup of broccoli rabe and chop it finely. (Reserve the remainder for another use.) Drain the pasta well and let cool slightly. In large bowl, whisk eggs, yolks, milk, salt, pepper and all but 1/2 cup of cheese together. Add the spaghetti, chopped broccoli rabe and pancetta and toss to combine. Pour mixture into the prepared springform. Sprinkle last 1/2 cup cheese on top. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, until bronzed and the center is set. The best way to check is to tip your pan to the side and make sure no loose custard runs out. If it does, bake it for 5 minutes more. If the top of your pie browns too quickly before the center is set, cover it with foil for the remaining cooking time. Remove from the oven and let cool on a rack for 5 minutes before removing the foil, cutting around springform to loosen and releasing the pie onto a serving plate. Serve in wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 1949,&quot;Potato Latkes 6 medium russet potatoes, peeled 1 large onion, peeled 1 teaspoon sour salt (citric acid) 2 eggs 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons granulated onion Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil, for griddle and deep-frying Instructions: Grate the potatoes and onion into a large container. Add cold water to cover and the sour salt. Allow to rest for 5 minutes. Drain the grated potatoes, squeezing out as much liquid as possible. Transfer to a bowl and add the eggs, flour, granulated onion, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Mix until well combined. Add a small amount of oil to a griddle over high heat. Slide in the potato mixture in large oval-shaped spoonfuls. Cook for 3 minutes on each side. Cool in the refrigerator for 45 minutes. Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep, heavy pot to 350 degrees F. In batches, fry the latkes for about 5 minutes, until brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1950,&quot;Pumpkin Pie in Squash Cups 1 1/2 cups plus 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon allspice 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 4 eggs, slightly beaten 30 ounces pumpkin puree 1/4 cup cream 20 ounces evaporated milk 6 acorn squash (or mini pumpkins) 6 egg whites (200 grams) 1 cup plus 2 teaspoons granulated sugar (200 grams) 2 cups minus 1 tablespoon powdered sugar (200 grams) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the sugar, salt, cinnamon, allspice, ginger and cloves in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle and mix until combined. Add the eggs and continue mixing. Add the pumpkin and mix until combined. Gradually add the cream and evaporated milk. Use a sharp paring knife to cut out the top of the acorn squash (you could also use mini-pumpkins). Use a melon baller to spoon out the contents of the squash. Remove some of the meat from the side of the squash so the sides are about 1/2-inch thick. Fill each squash with the pumpkin mixture. Place the squash in a baking dish and add about 1-inch of water to the bottom of the pan. A water bath will protect the eggs from scrambling. Place in the oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for another 40 to 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 2 hours. Place the egg whites in a medium-size mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium speed until foamy. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and gradually add the granulated sugar. Whip to stiff glossy peaks. Use a rubber spatula to fold in the powdered sugar. Place the meringue in a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Top each squash opening with the meringue. Place the meringue-topped squash under the broiler until lightly browned (you could also use a mini-torch to lightly brown the meringue). Serve and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 1951,&quot;Creamed Peas with Fried Shallots 3 small shallots, thinly sliced into rings 1 cup half-and-half Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Pinch of cayenne pepper Vegetable oil, for frying 2 10-ounce packages frozen peas 1 5.2-ounce package soft cheese with garlic and herbs (such as Boursin) 1/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Instructions: Toss the shallots with 1/4 cup half-and-half and a large pinch each of salt and black pepper in a small bowl.

Add the sugar and mix. Add the egg and mix. Add the molasses and vanilla and mix. Sift the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves together. Working in batches, and mixing just until combined after each addition, add the dry ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture. Shape the dough into a thick disk, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 1 or 2 sheet pans. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out 1/4-inch thick. Icing decorations: Stir the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, and vanilla together until smooth. To make snowflakes: Use a snowflake-shaped cookie cutter to cut out the cookies, rerolling the scraps as needed. If you plan to hang the cookies, use a toothpick to make the holes in the dough about 1/8-inch wide, keeping in mind that the holes will shrink as the cookies bake. Bake until firm, 12 to 15 minutes, and let cool on the pan. Using only white icing and a pastry bag fitted with the smallest plain tip, pipe thin lines from the center of the cookie out to the points, like spokes of a wheel. Connect the spokes with thin lines in between them, making a spiderweb effect to make it look like a snowflake. Let the icing harden before threading the cookies onto wire, string or yarn for hanging. To make dreidel trios: Use a dreidel cookie cutter and cut out 3 cookies. Lay 1 on a greased sheet pan. Fanning out at an angle, with the handles overlapping at the top, lay 2 more dreidels next to the first one (it will look like a paper-doll effect). The handle is now 3 layers thick; press on it gently to thin it slightly and make it larger. Repeat with the remaining dough, rerolling the scraps as needed. If you plan to hang the cookies, use a toothpick to make a hole in the handle about 1/8-inch wide, keeping in mind that the hole will shrink as the cookies bake. Bake until firm, 12 to 15 minutes, and let cool on the pan. Color some of your icing blue with food coloring, or use blue colored sugar and white icing together. Using a pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip, pipe Hebrew letters or stars of David on the cookies&#39; faces. Sprinkle the sugar on the icing while the icing is still wet. Let the icing harden before threading the cookies onto wire, string, or yarn for hanging. To make ornaments: Use any holiday-themed cookie cutter to cut out the cookies, rerolling the scraps as needed. If you plan to hang the cookies, use a toothpick to make holes in the dough about 1/8 inch wide, keeping in mind that the holes will shrink as the cookies bake. Bake until firm, 12 to 15 minutes, and let cool on the pan. Meanwhile, color some of your icing in festive colors with food coloring, or use colored sugars. Using a pastry bag fitted with the smallest plain tip, pipe a few colorful borders and decorations on the cookies. When set, add more lines of icing in white. Let the icing harden before threading the cookies onto wire, string, or yarn for hanging. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1958,&quot;Individual Chocolate Raspberry Flourless Cakes 6 ounces sugar 3/4 cup water 12 ounces butter, unsalted 12 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 5 eggs, large 5 egg yolks, large 4 tablespoons Framboise liqueur Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Allow the cake to cool.<br> Once the cake has cooled, crumble the cake using the tongs of a fork and transfer to a large mixing bowl, making sure to break the cake apart really well. Add the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting to a bowl and mix thoroughly. Using a small cookie scoop or a tablespoon, portion out the cake truffles and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Once all the balls have been formed, chill the cake truffles for an hour in the refrigerator.<br> After an hour, melt the white chocolate over a double boiler by placing it in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of gently simmering water. Making sure the water doesn&#39;t touch the bottom of the bowl.<br> Once the chocolate is melted, dip the cake truffles into the chocolate and, using 2 forks, gently turn the cake in the chocolate. Place the chocolate covered cake truffles back on the wax paper and top with the chopped pistachios. Return them to the fridge to set, about 20 minutes. (See Cook&#39;s Note) Using a handheld mixer, or a stand mixer, cream the sugar and butter together until light and creamy. Add cream cheese slowly, one piece at a time, fully incorporating it after each addition. Add the grated ginger, juice, zest and vanilla and beat until fluffy and fully combined. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1967,&quot;Ganache Filling (for cake) 4 1/4 cups (35 ounces, 1000 grams) heavy cream 7 cups (42 ounces, 1200 grams) bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 1/2 cup (4 ounces, 120 grams) Grand Marnier or Stoli Instructions: Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Make sure you chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous. If the ganache separates, it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature. I usually make the ganache at the end of the day and let it cool overnight. As it cools, it will thicken and set. When the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste, use an offset spatula to cover the cake layer with the ganache. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 1968,&quot;Beach Goers&#39; Wraps 2 peaches 1/2 mango 6 slices fresh or canned DOLE?Pineapple Olive oil for brushing 2 teaspoons raspberry vinegar 1/4 teaspoon salt Ground black pepper, to taste 1 pkg.

For the steak: In a dry pan, toast the sesame seeds, peppercorns, poppy seeds and mustard seeds over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until fragrant. Transfer to a spice grinder or a small food processor along with the salt, brown sugar, dehydrated onion and granulated garlic and pulse until finely ground. Completely coat the steaks in the black powder rub. Place on wire-racked sheet pan. Place in the oven for about 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 115 to 120 degrees F. Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle pan over high heat. Sear each side of the steak (including the \\u201csides\\u201d) for 3 to 4 minutes a side, or until super charred. For the chimichurri: Pulse the parsley, cilantro, vinegar, red pepper flakes, black garlic, salt and pepper to taste in a food processor until roughly chopped, 8 to 10 pulses (scraping the sides of the bowl in between pulses). Transfer to a bowl and stir in the olive oil. Season to taste and set aside. For the melting potatoes: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a medium bowl, add the potatoes, butter, cinnamon and salt and toss to coat. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a sheet pan, then bake for 15 to 18 minutes. Flip the potatoes, then drizzle with the maple syrup and return to the oven for 15 to 18 more minutes; the potatoes should be golden brown with a nice crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. When ready to serve, arrange on a platter and sprinkle with the pecans and chives. For the crispy Fresnos: Bring the vinegar and water to a boil in a pot, then reduce to a simmer. Once at a simmer, take off the heat and add in the mustard seeds, sugar, red pepper flakes, salt and garlic. Whisk until the salt and sugar dissolve. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Combine in a glass bowl with the sliced chiles. Let cool and allow to sit for at least 30 minutes. Set up a deep fryer with vegetable oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Combine the flour and cream of tartar in a bowl, then toss in the pickled chiles to coat, dusting off any excess. Deep fry until crispy, 1 to 2 minutes.

Using clean hands, add butter and toss until just coated. Rub butter between thumb and forefingers to incorporate into flour mixture until butter is in lima bean-sized pieces and comes together in quarter-sized clumps when squeezed in palm, about 2 minutes. Add shortening, toss until just coated in flour, then rub into flour mixture until mixture forms pea-size pieces (some big chunks should remain) and comes together in fist-sized clumps when squeezed, about 1 minute. Drizzle in half ice water and rake through mixture with fingers until just moistened. Drizzle in remaining water 1 tablespoon at a time and comb through mixture with fingers to moisten. It will go from being a shaggy mess to coming together. Dough is moist enough when it is moistened through but is not wet when pressed. (Do not overwork the dough or it will become tough.) While rotating the bowl with 1 hand, push dough between other palm and side of bowl to gather into a ball. Turn dough onto a piece of plastic wrap, press it into a flat disk, then close in wrap. Place in coldest part of refrigerator (usually back bottom shelf) at least 30 minutes before rolling out and forming into a crust. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1973,&quot;Corned-Beef-and-Cabbage Pizza 2 teaspoons sugar 1 package active dry yeast 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowl 3 cups all-purpose flour, or 23/4 cups plus 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon fine salt 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan 3 cups sliced green cabbage Kosher salt 1 teaspoon pickling spices, tied securely in cheesecloth 1 large potato, peeled and thinly sliced Freshly ground pepper 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese 3/4 cup shredded monterey jack cheese 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese 6 ounces sliced corned beef Instructions: Make the dough: Whisk 1 cup warm water (105) with the sugar in a bowl; scatter the yeast over the top and set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the olive oil. Whisk the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Gradually stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients to make a rough, shaggy dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. (Add more flour to prevent sticking, if necessary.) Form the dough into a ball; place in a large oiled bowl, turning to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until the dough has doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the toppings: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cabbage, season with salt and cook until just soft, about 5 minutes. Add the pickling spices and just enough water to cover. Simmer over low heat, covered, until the cabbage is tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the cabbage and set aside (discard spices). Place a pizza stone in the oven, if you have one, and preheat to 500. Toss the potato with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in a single layer on a baking sheet until golden, about 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Roll one into a 14-inch round (keep the remaining dough covered). Place the round on a floured pizza peel (if baking on a stone) or a large oiled pizza pan; drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Scatter half of each of the cheeses, corned beef, cabbage and potatoes on top. Season with salt and pepper. Carefully slip the pizza onto the hot stone, if using, or place the pan in the oven. Cook until golden and crispy, 10 to 15 minutes.

Sift the flour together with 1/2 cup of the sugar and set aside. Put the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer. Be SURE that the bowl is clean and dry, any fat in the bowl can prevent the egg whites from whipping up fluffy fluffy fluffy! Add the salt and the cream of tartar to the egg whites. Beat the egg whites on a medium-high speed until they reach soft peaks, about 5 minutes. While the mixer is running, gradually add the remaining sugar. DO NOT plop the sugar in all at once or it will push the air out of the whites that we are trying to beat in. Add in the vanilla and zests and then stop the mixer. Add 1/3 of the flour/sugar mixture and fold gently fold, do this quickly but gently. Repeat the process 2 more times until all of the flour/sugar mixture is incorporated. Transfer the cake batter into an ungreased tube pan. Bang the cake pan on the counter a couple of times to release any air bubbles trapped in the cake batter. Bake the cake on a sheet tray in the preheated oven until it is light and springy, about 1 1/4 hours. Cool the cake for at least 1 hour before unmolding. Serve with the tropical fruit compote. For the compote: In a food processor or blender, puree the coarsely chopped mango and 1/2 cup orange juice. If this mixture needs a little more sweetness, add in the 2 teaspoons of sugar and puree for another 10 seconds or until the sugar has dissolved. Combine all of the fruit and remaining orange juice and let the mixture sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.

Sprinkle the chicken with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Turn them over and sprinkle them with one more teaspoon of salt. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large (11 to 12-inch) cast-iron skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, place the chicken in the pan in one layer, skin side down. Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes without moving, until the skin is golden brown. (If the skin gets too dark, turn the heat to medium low.) Turn the chicken pieces with tongs, add the onions to the pan, including under the chicken, and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring the onions occasionally, until the thighs are cooked to 155 to 160 degrees and the onions are browned. Transfer the chicken (not the onions) to a plate and allow to rest uncovered while you make the sauce. If the onions aren&#39;t browned, cook them for another minute. Add the wine, creme fraiche, Dijon mustard, whole-grain mustard, and 1 teaspoon salt to the skillet and stir over medium heat for one minute. Return the chicken, skin side up, and the juices to the skillet, sprinkle with parsley, and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 1992,&quot;Tray-Baked Meringue with Pears, Cream, Toasted Hazelnuts and Chocolate Sauce 4 large free-range or organic egg whites 1 1/4 cups raw sugar Pinch sea salt 4 ounces hazelnuts, skins removed 2 (14-ounce) cans halved pears, in syrup 2 pieces stem ginger, thinly sliced, optional 7 ounces bittersweet chocolate (minimum 70 percent cocoa solids) 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 2 ounces icing sugar, sifted 1 vanilla bean, halved and seeds scraped out 1 orange, zested Instructions: Preheat your oven to 300 degrees F and line a baking sheet with a sheet of waxed paper. Put your egg whites into a squeaky clean bowl, making sure there are absolutely no little pieces of egg shell or egg yolk in them. Whisk on medium until the whites form firm peaks. With your mixer still running, gradually add the sugar and the pinch of salt. Turn the mixer up to the highest setting and whisk for about 7 or 8 minutes, until the meringue mixture is white and glossy. To test whether it&#39;s done you can pinch some between your fingers - if it feels completely smooth it&#39;s ready; if it&#39;s slightly granular it needs a little more whisking. Dot each corner of the waxed paper with a blob of meringue, then turn it over and stick it to the baking sheet. Spoon the meringue out onto the paper. Using the back of a spoon, shape and swirl it into a rectangle. Place in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour or until crisp on the outside and a little soft and sticky inside. At the same time, bake the hazelnuts on a separate sheet in the oven for 1 hour or until golden brown. Drain the cans of pears, reserving the syrup from 1 can. Cut each pear half into 3 slices. Pour the pear syrup into a saucepan with the ginger, if using, and warm gently over a medium heat until it starts to simmer. Take off the heat and snap the chocolate into the saucepan, stirring with a spoon until it&#39;s all melted. Take the meringue and hazelnuts out of the oven and leave to cool. Place the meringue on a nice rustic board or platter. Whip the cream with the sifted icing sugar and the vanilla seeds until it forms smooth, soft peaks. Smash the toasted hazelnuts (in a kitchen towel) and sprinkle half of them over the top of the meringue. Spoon half the whipped cream over the top and drizzle with some of the chocolate sauce (if the sauce has firmed up, melt it slightly by holding the saucepan over a large pan of boiling water). Divide most of the pear pieces evenly over the top. Pile over the rest of the whipped cream and pears. Drizzle with some more chocolate sauce, then sprinkle over the remaining toasted hazelnuts with some grated orange zest. Serve straightaway. If you&#39;re making this in advance, get everything ready and assemble at the last minute. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 1993,&quot;Stuffed Baby Peppers Vegetable oil cooking spray 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 ounces thinly sliced pancetta, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped 3/4 cup ricotta cheese 1/3 cup grated Parmesan 1/2 cup frozen petite peas, thawed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 24 (2 to 3-inch long) sweet baby peppers Instructions: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

Add the egg yolks, beat in well, and add the Amaretto. Stir in the ground almonds and flour until evenly mixed. The mixture should be the consistency of a thick paste. To make the caramel sauce: In a small sauce pan, combine the brown sugar, butter and cream. Bring the mixture to a boil and boil vigorously for 2 minutes, remove from the heat. Cover and keep warm at the back of the stove. To make the tarts: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to a 1/8 inch thickness and, using a plate or cardboard circle as a template, use a very sharp knife to cut four 7 inch circles. Spread a circle of almond cream in the center of each, leaving a 1inch border. Fan the sliced pears out from the center of each tart, completely covering the almond cream but still leaving the border. Beat the egg yolk lightly with a fork and brush the border of the pastry with it (try not to let any yolk dribble down onto the cut edges of the pastry, otherwise it will not rise as high). Bake the tarts for about 20 minutes, until the edges are golden and the pastry is baked through. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes Place a sprig of mint in the center of each tart and sprinkle it with a little confectioners sugar. Serve warm, drizzled with the warm caramel sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 2012,&quot;Eclairs 1 1/2 cups water 8 tablespoons butter (1/2 cup or 1 stick) 6 tablespoons vegetable shortening 1 tablespoon powdered milk Pinch salt 2/3 cup pastry flour 6 eggs 1 pint whole milk 1/2 cup sugar 1 stick unsalted butter 1 vanilla bean, split, scrapings reserved 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch 2 eggs 2 egg yolks Instructions: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees In a saucepan add water, butter, shortening, powdered milk, and salt and bring to a boil.

Put the butter in a large, ovenproof, nonstick saute pan and place in the oven. Meanwhile, in a blender, combine the eggs, flour, warm milk, sugar, vanilla extract and pinch of salt, and blend on medium-high speed until uniform.

Rub the shortening into the flour mixture using your fingertips until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add the milk, 1-ounce at a time, just until you have a rough ball of workable dough. Knead the dough 3 to 4 times, until it is mostly smooth, but do not overwork. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough, using a floured rolling pin, to a sheet about 1/16-inch thick, on floured piece of waxed paper or parchment paper. Cover the dough, still on the waxed paper or parchment, with a tea towel, and dry for at least 8 hours. This can be done the night before or early in the morning. Two to three hours before the dumplings are ready to cook, put the hen, water, and the remaining tablespoon of salt in a 7-quart pressure cooker. Do not fill above the cooker&#39;s \\maximum fill\\ line, or 2/3 full. Cover and lock the lid. Bring to pressure over high heat, approximately 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, so that you barely hear hissing from the pot. Cook for 45 minutes. Release the pressure using the cooker&#39;s release device (read the manual!) or cool the cooker by running cold water over the lid for 5 minutes. Open carefully. Remove the hen from the broth and set aside to cool. The meat should be tender and falling away from the bone. Once the hen is cool enough to handle, pull the meat from the bones in small pieces, cover and set aside. Discard the skin and bones. Set a cheesecloth-lined colander in a large container and pour in the broth, discarding the solids. Taste and season the broth with additional salt, if needed. Return the broth to the pressure cooker, cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium to maintain a gentle boil. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch wide strips, break into 1 1/2-inch long pieces, and drop into the boiling broth. When all the dough has been used, gently push all of the dumplings down into the broth with a slotted spoon. Do not stir the dumplings. Cook the dumplings until they are cooked through, but not falling apart, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the meat. Serve in bowls with freshly ground black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2023,&quot;Strawberry and Tropical Fruit Smoothie Bowls 2 tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut 1 tablespoon unsalted pistachios, finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon matcha (green tea powder; optional) 2 tablespoons semisweet chocolate chips 4 small strawberries 4 blueberries 2 cups frozen tropical fruit blend (with strawberries) 1 banana 1 cup refrigerated coconut milk beverage 1 to 2 teaspoons honey Instructions: Combine the coconut, pistachios and matcha in a small bowl; set aside.

Wash the turkey inside and out, drain it well, and pat it dry with paper towels. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the salt mixture in the cavity of the turkey and rub the rest on the skin, including under the wings and legs. Place the turkey in a shallow dish to catch any drips and wrap the whole dish tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for one or two days. The day before you plan to roast the turkey, remove the plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge. The skin will dry out and turn a little translucent. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Be sure your oven is very clean! Place the onion, lemon, and thyme in the cavity. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tie the wings close to the body. Brush the turkey with the butter and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. Roast the turkey for 45 minutes, placing it in the oven legs first. Lower the temperature to 325 degrees F and roast it for about another hour, until 165 degrees F for the breast and 180 degrees in the thigh on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the oven, cover the turkey tightly with aluminum foil, and allow it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Carve the turkey and arrange it on a platter. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow the turkey to sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours. To reheat, pour a 1/4-inch layer of the gravy into a large (12 16-inch) ovenproof serving platter (make sure it&#39;s ovenproof!). Arrange the turkey artfully on top of the gravy. Place the platter uncovered into the oven for 15 to 30 minutes, until the turkey is very hot. Serve hot with extra gravy on the side.<br> Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute, stirring often, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the onion becomes browned and starts to caramelize.

Microwave the potatoes, turning once, until tender, about 12 minutes. Cut the hot potatoes in half and score the flesh to allow the steam to escape. Let the potatoes cool until cool enough to handle, then scoop the flesh into a ricer (see Cook&#39;s Note) and rice into a medium bowl. Spread evenly in the bowl to continue to allow the steam to escape. Discard the skins. Add the flour, salt and pepper and gently toss to combine. Form a well and add the egg. Starting in the center, mix well with your hand to combine. Place the dough on a clean counter dusted with flour. Knead the dough just until blended, 4 or 5 times. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece with your palms on the work surface into a 1/2-inch-diameter rope (about 20 inches long). Cut the rope into 1-inch pieces. Roll each piece over a wooden paddle with ridges or over the tines of a fork to form grooves in the dough. Place on a well-floured surface. Continue with the remaining dough, dusting the gnocchi with additional flour as you go. Cook the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat until it begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the thyme leaves. Set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season generously with salt. Add the gnocchi to the boiling water and stir with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking. Cook until the gnocchi rise to the surface, about 1 minute. Continue cooking until the gnocchi are tender, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the gnocchi to the hot thyme butter in the skillet. Toss to coat. Spoon the gnocchi and butter sauce into shallow bowls. Top with the Pecorino and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 2034,&quot;Herb Crusted Trout with Shiitake Sticky Rice and Shiso Oil 4 trout fillets, skinless 2 eggs All purpose flour 1 cup panko crumbs 1/3 cup shiso leaves, chiffonade 1 teaspoon ground coriander Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Mix the panko, coriander and shiso.

Alternatively, substitute a silicon loaf tin, no foil lining necessary. Instructions: Take whatever you need out of the refrigerator so that all ingredients can come room temperature. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, putting in a baking sheet as you do so. Put the flour, baking soda, cocoa, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla, and sour cream into the processor and blitz until a smooth, satiny brown batter. Scrape down with a rubber spatula and process again while pouring the boiling water down the funnel. Switch it off, then remove the lid and the well-scraped double-bladed knife and, still using your rubber spatula, stir in the chocolate chips or morsels. Scrape and pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin and put into the oven, cooking for about 1 hour. When ready, the loaf will be risen and split down the middle and a cake-tester will pretty well come out clean. Not long before the cake is due out of the oven (when it has had about 45 to 50 minutes), put the syrup ingredients of cocoa, water and sugar into a small saucepan and boil for about 5 minutes, to give a thick syrup. Take the cake out of the oven and sit it on a cooling rack, still in the tin, and pierce here and there with a cake tester. Pour the syrup over the cake. Let the cake become completely cold and then slip out of its tin, removing the foil as you do so. Sit on an oblong or other plate. Sprinkle the chocolate splinters over the top of the sticky surface of the cake &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 2037,&quot;Lamb Sandwich 1 1/4 pounds ground lamb 3 garlic cloves, minced Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 4 pita or flatbreads, preferably Greek style 1/2 cup crumbled feta 1/2 bunch fresh mint, leaves roughly chopped Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb with the garlic and season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Put a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Once heated, add the vegetable oil and heat until hot. Meanwhile, sprinkle the pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Add the pork chops to the hot pan and sear until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and put the whole pan in the oven to cook the pork until medium-rare, 140 degrees F, 5 to 6 minutes. Set the pork aside on a plate to rest 5 minutes and carry-over cook another 5 degrees. Top each chop with 2 slices of Grilled Jalapeno Compound Butter and serve. Preheat a charcoal or gas grill to medium-high heat. Skewer the jalapeno halves, weaving the skewer through like a needle. Drizzle with vegetable oil and season with salt. Put skin-side down on the grill over direct heat. Grill until charred on all sides and the skins start to bubble and char, about 1 1/2 minutes total. Put the jalapenos in a mason jar and allow to cool. When cool enough to handle, scrape off the skins and finely chop the jalapenos. Set aside. To a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add the butter and beat on medium speed until creamy. Add the honey, lime zest and 2 teaspoons salt, mixing until incorporated. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and fold in the chopped jalapenos. Lay out a piece of parchment paper the size of a baking sheet and add the compound butter to the short side of the paper.

Lay 2 candy canes in a heart shape around each stick, making sure the stick touches the inside of both candy canes at the top and bottom of the heart. Bake until the candy canes are slightly soft and malleable and very warm but not hot to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes. With your fingers, press the candy canes together, adhering them to the stick at the top and bottom. Gently bend the outer edges of the candy canes outwards to widen the heart shape. (If the candy canes harden too quickly, you may return them to the oven for 30 seconds and try again.) Let cool completely on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining candy canes and sticks, using the other baking sheet and rotating the use of the sheets while the others cool. Once all of the hearts are formed and cooled, line them up on a piece of parchment placed on a work surface. Microwave the white chocolate or candy wafers in a microwave-safe bowl on 50 percent power in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted, 1 to 2 minutes total. Transfer the melted chocolate to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off and pipe it into the center of the hearts, spreading it to the edges with a small spoon or spatula. Sprinkle with the decorations of your choice. Let the pops harden completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Ornament variation: Make the candy cane hearts without the lollipop sticks and let cool. Tie a decorative ribbon around the top of each heart, then fill with white chocolate and decorate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 2042,&quot;Monument Cafe Meatloaf with Creole Sauce 2 pounds ground beef 1 1/2 cup quick oats, such as Quaker 3/4 cup ketchup 1/3 cup milk 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons ground black pepper 2 onions, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick 1 clove garlic, minced 1 green bell pepper, cored and sliced lengthwise 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/3 cup red wine 1 can crushed tomatoes 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasonings 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Dash salt 1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Throw in the rinds and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, trim the artichokes, rubbing every cut surface with the remaining lemon as you go, so they don&#39;t turn brown. Using a bread knife, cut off the stems, then snap off any tough dark green leaves around the base. Slice across the artichokes about one-third of the way down, exposing their inner core. When the water boils, put in the artichokes and boil until a bottom leaf pulls off easily and the base of the artichokes are tender to a fork, about 40 minutes. Drain. Pull the inner core from the artichokes and clean out all the hair-like bits, scraping the cavity clean with a spoon. For the hollandaise: Melt the butter slowly in a saucepan, leaving it on the heat until it has turned brown (not black). Skim off any foam that rises to the top, and pour the clear butter into a bowl, leaving behind the milk solids. Wash the saucepan. Put the yolks, 1/4 cup/60 ml water and a pinch of salt into the clean pan. Whisk over medium heat until ribbony, 3 to 5 minutes. If the pan gets too hot, the eggs will scramble, so lift the saucepan on and off the heat occasionally to keep the temperature in check. Take the pot off the heat and slowly whisk in the clarified butter, adding it in a thin stream. Season with salt, pepper, and a few squirts of lemon. It will be thick, but still pour off a spoon. It should be globby, like mayonnaise. Spoon the sauce into the cavity of the artichokes. Eat, by peeling off the leaves and dipping them in the sauce. When you get to the heart, eat it with a knife and fork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 2064,&quot;Ricotta Gnocchi 1 pound fresh ricotta cheese (see recipe below) 1 egg 1 ounce grated parmesan 1 teaspoon kosher salt Flour, to roll gnocchi 2 quarts milk 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice Instructions: In a large bowl, whip the ricotta to break up the curds. Add the egg and stir until evenly combined. Add the grated cheese and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust seasonings.<br> Pour flour onto a large plate or shallow pie dish. As if you were making chocolate chip cookies, use a teaspoon to form oval shape gnocchi and drop into flour.

Dust flour off gnocchi and place on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Repeat. Refrigerate two hours or until gnocchi are firm. You can refrigerate overnight but fresh gnocchi is best eaten the day it&#39;s prepared. Drop gnocchi into salted boiling water. Adjust heat to a simmer. When gnocchi floats to the top and is slightly firm to the touch, about 3-4 minutes. Remove using a slotted spoon.<br> Serving suggestion: melted butter, peas and sage or a lean pasta topping of your choice, such as tomato sauce with basil and a shaving or two of parmesan cheese.

Roll out the puff pastry sheets into squares 12 inches by 12 inches; the pastry will become slightly thinner. Cover with plastic wrap and chill. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small mixing bowl, stir together the preserves, cornstarch, brown sugar, and lemon zest. Fold in the fresh blueberries and vanilla, and chill while you cut the dough. Using a sharp knife, cut each puff pastry sheet into 4 (6-inch) squares. Lay a pastry square on a work surface and brush the edges with egg wash. In the center of the square, place 2 heaping tablespoons of blueberry filling. Brush the edges of the pastry square with egg wash and fold it in half to create a triangle. Carefully press the edges together to seal them well with fork tines. Transfer to the cookie sheet and keep refrigerated. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, placing the turnovers 1-inch apart. Brush the tops with the egg wash and sprinkle with granulated sugar. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm or let cool to room temperature.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter and the oil to a large stock pot on medium-high heat. When the butter is melted and oil is hot, add the chicken thigh bones and cubed thigh meat. Brown on all sides, then remove the meat to a plate. Lower the heat slightly and add the onions, thyme and bay leaves. Season onions with salt and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic is tender, about 4 minutes more. Stir the chicken back into the pot and add the stock. Raise the heat, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the potatoes and frozen corn and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes more. Meanwhile, make a paste with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the flour, in a small bowl and set aside. When the potatoes are tender remove the thyme sprigs and the bay leaves. Lower the heat and add the milk, cream and the flour paste in bits. Stir to mix and allow the flour to blend into the chowder. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Transfer the chowder to a serving bowl and spritz with lemon before serving. Cook&#39;s Note: Don&#39;t remove the bones from the soup. They have tasty morsels of chicken that you&#39;ll want to savor for the entire chowder experience. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 2079,&quot;BBQ Burger Bites 1 lb. extra-lean ground beef 1/4 cup finely chopped onions 2 Tbsp.

For the cake batter: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line two 12-cup muffin pans with cupcake liners. Put 1 tablespoon of the cookie crumb mixture in the bottom of each cupcake liner. Set the muffin pans aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until light in color and fluffy, about 6 minutes. Add the sugar and continue beating until uniformly incorporated into the butter; stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Restart the mixer on low speed and add the eggs one at a time, waiting until each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Once the eggs have been added, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl to insure that all of the ingredients are incorporated.<br> Add the vanilla bean paste and blend uniformly. Add the gluten-free baking mix in three additions, alternating with the milk in two additions, fully incorporating each addition into the batter before moving to the next. If needed, stop the mixer after each addition, scrape down the sides of the bowl and resume mixing on low. Fill the cupcake liners two-thirds full with the batter and bake until the top of each cupcake is slightly springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 14 to 16 minutes. Immediately turn the cupcakes out of the pans onto a cooling rack and let cool completely. For the lime filling: In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon water with the lemon juice; sprinkle the gelatin over the liquid and let the gelatin bloom and hydrate.<br> In the bowl of a stand mixer, whip the cream on high speed to medium-firm peaks. Melt the bloomed gelatin in the microwave just until melted and clear, 15 to 20 seconds; do not overheat as this will kill the gelatin! Stir the key lime curd into the gelatin until all mixed in, and then pour the lime curd into the whipping cream. Mix completely and refrigerate until ready to use. For the meringue frosting: In a small saucepot, combine the sugar and 1/3 cup water and set over high heat. With a wet pastry brush, wipe down any sugar crystals on the sides of the pot. Cook until the sugar mixture registers 280 degrees F on a candy thermometer. While the sugar syrup is cooking, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment on medium-high speed until the mixture reaches the medium-peak stage. Turn the mixer down to medium low and very, very, very slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the whipping egg whites. Once all the sugar is added, add the vanilla bean paste and turn the speed up to high. Whip until the mixture is very light and fluffy and the mixing bowl is no longer hot to the touch, about 9 minutes. Fit an 18-inch piping bag with a star tip and twist and hold the bag right by the tip to prevent the frosting from leaking out. Fold the top of the piping bag over your hand and spoon the meringue frosting into the bag.<br> To assemble, use an apple corer or paring knife to core out the center of each cupcake. Fill each cupcake with some of the lime filling and top with some of the meringue frosting. Use a blowtorch to lightly toast the top of the meringue. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 2092,&quot;Siu Mai 0.75 ounces dried shiitake mushrooms (4 to 8 pieces) 1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 12 ounces peeled and deveined medium shrimp (41/50), tails removed 1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) skinless pork belly Kosher salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon chicken bouillon powder 2 teaspoons light soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 2 tablespoons lard or neutral oil One 16-ounce package round yellow wonton wrappers Flying fish roe, finely minced carrot or frozen peas, for topping, optional Instructions: Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the mushrooms, turn off the heat, cover and soak until rehydrated, about 30 minutes. Drain the mushrooms and remove and discard the stems. Finely dice the mushrooms; set aside. Whisk 4 cups of cold water and 1 tablespoon of the baking soda in a large bowl until the baking soda is dissolved. Lightly massage the shrimp in the baking soda water and let soak for 30 minutes. Drain the shrimp, rinse under cold running water, drain again and pat dry with paper towels. Roughly chop the shrimp into 1/2-inch pieces; set aside. Coarsely chop the pork belly into approximately 1/2-inch pieces (they don&#39;t have to be perfect). Continue to chop until it resembles coarsely ground pork (but don&#39;t chop it so finely that it becomes smooth). Transfer the pork to a large bowl and fill with enough cold water to cover. Let soak until the water turns pink, about 5 minutes. Drain the water and repeat the soaking process once more until the pork is a bit opaque. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Reserve the bowl. Transfer the pork back to the bowl, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon cold water and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and mix until the baking soda is absorbed. Mix in the reserved shrimp until combined. Add 1 tablespoon salt to the pork and shrimp filling and mix in one direction until the mixture is sticky and leaves streaks along the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Gather the filling in one hand, lift it up and away from the bowl and throw it back into the bowl. Repeat 9 additional times to help bring the filling together and produce the desired texture. Add the sugar, chicken powder, soy sauce and white pepper to the filling and stir until combined. Add the reserved mushrooms and lard and mix until combined. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Cover the wonton wrappers with a damp paper towel to prevent them from drying out. Using your nondominant hand, put your index finger and thumb together to form a circle and place 1 wonton wrapper on top of the circle. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the filling into the center of the wrapper and use the spoon to pack in the filling while gently squeezing on the sides to form the wrapper around the filling. Add a little more filling if it doesn\\u2019t reach the top of the dumpling (see Cook&#39;s Note). Place the siu mai on a parchment-lined plate or tray. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. If desired, top each siu mai with a pea-size scoop of flying fish roe or minced carrot (a little less than 1/8 teaspoon) or 1 frozen pea. Fill a 12-inch skillet or wok with about 2 inches of water and place a 10-inch bamboo or metal steamer basket in the skillet. Make sure the water doesn\\u2019t touch the bottom of the insert. If it does, remove some of it. Bring the water to a rolling boil, line the steamer basket with a perforated parchment circle and place 10 siu mai on the parchment, leaving an inch between each. Cover and steam until the filling is opaque and the wrapper is translucent, about 10 minutes. Enjoy while hot. Continue with the remaining siu mai. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2093,&quot;French Toast Cake Pop 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for buttering the cake pans 2 3/4 cups cake flour, plus more for dusting the cake pans 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon<br> 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 3/4 teaspoon fine salt<br> 2 cups granulated sugar<br> 4 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1 cup whole milk<br> 2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract<br> 4 cups powdered sugar 1/2 cup pasteurized egg whites<br> 8 sticks (4 cups) salted butter, at room temperature 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 2 pounds white melting wafers, such as Merckens or Clasen, or tempered white chocolate<br> 1/2 cup whiskey, such as Fireball Whiskey, optional (if using pipettes) Instructions: For the cake pop: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch cake pans, dust the inside with flour and tap out the excess. Line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper.<br> Mix the cake flour, cinnamon, baking powder and salt in a bowl and set aside. Beat the butter in a stand mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the granulated sugar and beat another 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time and beat thoroughly after each addition. Start adding the flour mixture 1 cup at a time, alternating with the milk and ending with the flour mixture, and beat to combine. Add the vanilla and mix well. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans and bake until a knife inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Immediately invert the cakes onto a cooling rack and cool to room temperature (or chill in the refrigerator). For the cinnamon Swiss meringue buttercream: Beat the powdered sugar and egg whites in a stand mixer on medium speed for 5 minutes. Add the butter and beat on medium speed for 10 minutes, scraping the sides of the mixer bowl as needed. Add the cinnamon and vanilla and beat for an additional 2 minutes. To make the pops: Break the cooled cakes into handful-size chunks and place in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. On low speed, mix until the cake is in crumbs. Add the buttercream to the cake crumbs 1/4 cup at a time, just until the mixture becomes a ball of dough that is moldable but not wet or sticky to the touch; you will not need much buttercream for this process. Form the dough into 1-inch balls using a cake pop roller, cookie dough scoop or tablespoon. Let the balls chill for a few minutes or sit at room temperature while you prepare the melting wafers.<br> Heat the melting wafers in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave at half power for 1 minute and then stir. Continue heating in the microwave at half power for 30-second increments until melted and only a few solid pieces remain. Stir until smooth. The warmth of the melting wafers will help melt the remaining pieces.<br> Line baking sheets with parchment paper. If using the pipettes and whiskey, fill the pipettes with whisky and wipe clean with a damp paper towel. Dip the pipette tips or cake pop stick tips about 1/2 inch into the melting wafers and then poke them into the tops of each cake ball. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.<br> Melt the remaining buttercream in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave at half power in 30-second increments until soft. You want this to be a similar consistency to the melting wafers without being greasy. Dip the cake pops into the buttercream and set aside for 5 to 10 minutes. Return the melting wafers to the microwave if needed at half power in 30-second increments. Dip the cake pops into the melting wafers, submerging them completely to the stick, making sure there are no holes where the cake is exposed. Place the dipped cake pops onto the parchment paper-lined baking sheets to set. Decorate as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2094,&quot;Oyster Foch Vegetable oil, for frying 6 tablespoons pate 6 slices bread, crusts removed, toasted Salt and pepper 2 cups yellow cornmeal 3 dozen raw oysters 3 cups Colbert Sauce, recipe follows 1 ounce parsley leaves, chopped 2 ounces (1/4 cup) sherry wine 8 ounces just-made hollandaise sauce 1 ounce tomato sauce 6 dashes Worcestershire sauce Caramel food coloring Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F.

Tie the shoulder in 4 places with kitchen twine so it will hold its shape while being cooked or ask your butcher to do this for you. Season the pork with salt, pepper, cumin and oregano. Set the base of a pressure cooker over low-medium heat and add a 2 count of olive oil. Add garlic and chili flakes and as the oil heats up it will become fragrant and infuse the oil. Add the pork. Add onions around the pork and brown slightly before adding orange juice, lime juice, stock and bay leaves. Secure the lid of the pressure cooker and cook for 20 to 25 minutes depending on the size of your pressure cooker. The pork should be tender when done. When done allow to cool in juices before removing twine and slicing. To prepare Cuban sandwiches, split bread in half then layer the sandwich with mustard, cheese, pickles, ham, pork then cheese again (the cheese glues everything together). Season with salt and pepper in between the ham and pork layers. (Optional: drizzle a little of the pork braising liquid over the meat as well). To cook, heat a large cast iron skillet or grill pan over medium heat and lightly coat with olive oil. Place the sandwiches on the skillet and top with another heavy skillet and a couple of heavy weights (bricks, or cans of tomatoes work well). Press down firmly and cook for 5 to 7 minutes per side until the sandwich has compressed to about a third of its original size and the bread is super-crispy. Serve with beans, rice and plantain chips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 2099,&quot;Vanilla Velvet/Chocolate Cake 12 ounces cake flour 1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 10 ounces sugar 4 egg whites 9 ounces milk 2 3/4 teaspoons vanilla extract 6 ounces butter, softened 3/4 cup cocoa powder 2 1/2 cups cake flour 1 3/4 cups sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/4 cups water 4 eggs 2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups butter, softened Instructions: For the Chocolate Cake:<br> Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and spray 2 (9-inch) cake pans with cooking spray.

Using a butter knife or small rubber spatula, spread 1 side of each slice with some of the softened butter. Use 1/2 of the butter for this and you&#39;ll need the rest later. Turn over 4 slices of the bread and spread the unbuttered sides of 2 of the bread slices with the mustard, and the other 2 slices with the honey. For each sandwich, fold 1 ham slice on top of the mustard spread and top with 1/4 of the sliced Gruyere cheese. Cover with the remaining 4 bread slices, making sure that the buttered sides face out. You will have 4 sandwiches. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in the skillet. Transfer the sandwiches to the skillet and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn and add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the skillet. Cook the sandwiches until the cheese has melted and the second side is golden brown, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.

Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large saute pan. Add the onions and some salt and pepper to taste; cook, stirring, over medium heat until very tender but not browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic powder, rosemary and cumin and cook 30 seconds more.<br> Remove the pan from the heat and add the dried plums and bourbon. Carefully return the pan to the heat and cook until reduced by half. Stir in the remaining tablespoon butter. Remove the pan from the heat and add the breadcrumbs. Stir well to incorporate, then set aside to cool to room temperature.<br> For the pork loin: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Combine the olive oil, garlic powder, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl and mix well to combine. Rub the mixture all over the pork loin and place on a cutting board with the fat side facing up. Starting on one side of the loin, insert a paring knife or thin fillet knife through the cut side of the loin toward the center of the meat, keeping both your knife and the meat centered. (You are trying to create a hole through the center of the loin while keeping the entire roast intact, like a tunnel.) If your knife is not long enough to reach all the way through the loin, make the same cut from the opposite end of the loin to connect the two cuts.<br> Lay a sheet of plastic wrap out on the cutting board. Arrange the stuffing in the center of the plastic wrap. Shape the stuffing so that it lays in a narrow rectangle, the same length as the pork loin. Tightly wrap the stuffing in the plastic wrap, maintaining the shape. Twist the ends of the plastic wrap to tighten the shape and tie a knot at each end as close to the stuffing as possible.<br> Insert a metal skewer with a looped end through the hole in the pork loin. Tie one end of the plastic wrap around the loop and use it to pull the stuffing into the center of the pork loin.<br> When the stuffing is centered, cut the knot off one end of the plastic wrap. Pull the plastic wrap from the other end while squeezing to extract the stuffing. As you pinch and pull, the plastic wrap should come out, leaving the stuffing behind inside the pork loin.<br> Line a baking sheet with foil and place the pork loin fat-side down on top. Roast the pork loin, 25 minutes. Flip the pork loin so that the fat side is now facing up. Cook until a thermometer inserted into the center of the pork loin registers 140 degrees F, about 20 minutes more. Transfer the pork loin to a rack to rest. (The internal temperature should reach a minimum of 145 degrees F as it rests.)<br> Slice into 1/2-inch thick and drizzle with good-quality olive oil before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 2123,&quot;Harira Ramadam: Soup of Fava Beans and Lentils 1 quart water 1 cup chickpeas 2 onions, finely chopped 1 teaspoon ground tumeric 2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 pound beef, preferably diced fillet 1/4 bunch cilantro 1/2 bunch flat leaf parsley 1/4 bunch chopped lovage, optional 10 vine tomatoes, peeled and seeded, grated or chopped finely 1/2 cup rice or crushed vermicelli 1 cup water flour mixture (1 tablespoon flour dissolved in 1 cup water) 1 cup fava beans, soaked and drained 1 cup lentils (optional) Salt 2 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: Place the following into a deep saucepan and cover with water; chickpeas, chopped onion, spices, meat. Bring to the boil and simmer until the chickpeas are tender. Chop the cilantro and flat leaf parsley, and lovage, if using, and grind in pestle and mortar to release the flavors. Then, add the herbs, pulped tomatoes, and rice. After about 5 minutes add the water flour mixture, this helps the soup thicken and lighten in color. Finally add the fava beans, and lentils, if adding. Simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt.

Submerge the cabbage in the salt water and place another heavy bowl on top to ensure the cabbage is submerged completely. Let soak, flipping every 10 minutes, until the cabbage leaves are slightly tender to the touch, about 30 minutes. Rinse, pat dry and set aside. This process will give the cabbage a flexible and crunchy texture with a slight briny taste.<br> For the daikon kimchi: Cut the daikon in half crosswise. Slice each half into 1/4-inch-thick planks, then cut each plank into matchstick-size strips. Mix the daikon with 1 tablespoon salt in a small bowl and let it sit for 10 minutes. Give it a toss and let it sit for an additional 10 minutes. Rinse well until all the salt is washed off. Pat the daikon dry with a paper towel. Whisk together the gochugaru, fish sauce, mirin, garlic, sugar, ginger and scallions in a medium bowl, then toss with the daikon until well incorporated. Transfer to a serving dish and set aside. For the dipping sauce (ssamjang): Combine the doenjang, gochujang, sesame oil, garlic and sugar in a small bowl and mix well. Transfer to a serving dish and set aside.<br> For the crispy garlic: Heat the vegetable oil in a small pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and fry until light golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and let cool.<br> When the pork belly is finished cooking, remove it from the poaching liquid and let it sit for a few minutes until slightly cooled. Slice into 1/4-inch pieces.<br> Arrange the pork belly, cabbage and lettuce neatly on a big serving platter. Serve with the daikon kimchi, dipping sauce and crispy garlic. To eat, put a piece of the pork belly in the middle of a lettuce or cabbage leaf, top with the daikon, sauce and garlic chips. Fold the leaf to enclose everything. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2157,&quot;Cat&#39;s Broccoli Slaw 1/3 cup Dijon mustard 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons hot sauce 1 teaspoon celery seeds Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 packages broccoli slaw Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk together the mustard and the sugar.

Cover the bottom of the pan with the cookies. Toss the berries with the sugar and bourbon in a medium bowl then layer them on top of the cookies. Scoop the strawberry and vanilla ice creams onto the berry layer, packing it in tightly and alternating the scoops to create a marbled or checkerboard effect. Spread with an offset spatula to make a smooth top. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Unmold the cake by running a knife around the edge, then unhinge the springform and remove. Invert the cake onto a sheet of plastic wrap and remove the bottom of the pan and the parchment. Place a plate on the bottom and invert once more. Add the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla to a large bowl and whip with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. This makes enough frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake with additional to pipe decorations if desired. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the whipped cream frosting and drizzle with the chocolate sauce. If the cake begins to get too soft, put it back into the freezer for a few minutes. Freeze another 1 1/2 to 2 hours or overnight. Before serving, let the cake sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 2163,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Cereal Confetti Cookies 4 sticks (32 tablespoons) unsalted butter 3 cups sugar 2 large eggs 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 to 3 tablespoons milk 2 cups multi-colored puffed rice cereal (I like Fruity Pebbles!) Instructions: Cream the butter, sugar and eggs: In a stand mixer or in a large bowl with a hand mixer on high, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy and smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the eggs one by one, completely incorporating the first one before adding the second, and making sure to scrape the sides between additions. Beat in the almond extract.<br> Add the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, stir to combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Lower the mixer speed to medium-low and pour the flour mixture into the butter mixture in four parts, taking time to blend in and scrape the sides of the bowl back to the center between each addition, until all is combined.<br> Finish the dough and chill: Add the milk 1 tablespoon at a time to the dough and blend until it becomes smooth but firm enough to form balls (you may not need all of the milk). Turn off the mixer and add the cereal, folding it in by hand using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Divide the dough in half and roll into logs 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.<br> Bake and cool the cookies: Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F; line two baking sheets with parchment. Remove the cookie dough from the plastic wrap and slice into 1/2-inch-thick discs. Place 6 discs at least 3 inches apart on each prepared baking sheet (refrigerate the remaining dough until ready to bake). Bake until golden and crispy around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheets. Once the baking sheets are cool, bake the remaining cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2164,&quot;Green Bean and Mushroom Bread Pudding Butter or nonstick cooking spray, for the baking dish 1 small onion, chopped 1 pound white button mushrooms, sliced One 8-ounce package frozen green beans, thawed 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 pound dried-out bread slices, cut into large bite-sized chunks, or unseasoned stuffing croutons 4 eggs 1 cup light cream or half-and-half 1 cup whole milk 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup canned French-fried onions 1 cup green bean chips or snap pea crisps Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking dish or a 2-quart casserole with butter or coat it with cooking spray. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the onions, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 3 minutes, then add the mushrooms. Continue to cook until softened, then add the green beans and garlic and cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> In a large bowl, toss the mushroom mixture with the stale bread until well mixed, then transfer to the baking dish and spread into an even layer.<br> Whisk the eggs in the bowl until pale yellow, then whisk in the cream, milk, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Slowly pour over the bread mixture 1 cup at a time, giving it time to absorb between additions. Cover with aluminum foil and bake until it is puffed and set, about 45 minutes. Crumble the fried onions and green bean chips together. Remove the foil from the pudding and spread the crumbs across the top. Bake until the onions are golden brown, about 5 minutes more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2165,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Smoky Bar Nut Mix 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke (I like hickory here)<br> 3 to 4 stalks fresh rosemary<br> 1 clove garlic, smashed<br> 1/2 cup almonds<br> 1 cup pecan halves<br> 1 cup walnut halves<br> 1/2 cup dried cranberries<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Flavor the oil. In a large pan on medium-low heat, add the olive oil, liquid smoke, rosemary and garlic. Cook until the oil is fragrant and the rosemary is crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove the rosemary to a paper towel-lined plate. Remove and discard the garlic. Toast the nuts. First, add the almonds to the pan and stir to coat in the oil, then toss to heat them until a taste of one reveals a tender creamy almond, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the pecans and them cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Finally, add the walnuts and let cook for 5 additional minutes. Each nut takes a different amount of time to toast, so this order is crucial. Finish. Add the cranberries to the nut mixture and season with salt and pepper. Crinkle in the rosemary, then use a slotted spoon to remove the mixture to a bowl. Serve warm or chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 2166,&quot;Salted Caramel Nuts 1 cup each whole roasted salted cashews, whole large pecan halves, whole unsalted almonds and whole walnut halves (4 cups total) 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon fleur de sel Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the nuts on a sheet pan, spread them out and roast them for 7 minutes, until they become fragrant. Set aside to cool. After the nuts are cooled, place the sugar and 1/4 cup of water in a medium (10-inch) saute pan and mix with a fork until all of the sugar is moistened. Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar melts; from this point on, don?t stir the caramel, swirl the pan! Don?t worry, the mixture may look as though it?s crystallizing. Continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture becomes a clear golden brown, swirling the pan constantly at the end. (Careful, the caramel is very hot!) Off the heat, quickly add the vanilla (it will bubble up!) and swirl the pan to combine. Working quickly (the caramel will continue to cook in the pan), add the nuts and the kosher salt and toss with 2 large spoons until the nuts are completely coated. Pour the nuts and any extra caramel in the pan onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Spread the nuts out in one layer, pulling them apart with two forks. Sprinkle with the fleur de sel and set aside to cool. When they?re completely cooled, carefully break the nuts into large clusters with your hands, trying not to break the nuts too much. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 2167,&quot;Stuffed Cornish Hens 2-1 1/2-pound cornish hens Salt and pepper 4 slices bacon 12 small whole button mushrooms 12 pearl onions, peeled 1/2 cup diced carrots 1/2 cup fresh peas 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cups chicken stock 2-1 1/2-pound cornish hens Salt and pepper 4 slices bacon 12 small whole button mushrooms 12 pearl onions, peeled 1/2 cup diced carrots 1/2 cup fresh peas 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cups chicken stock Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

This is the only time you can stir the sugar. If you stir it while it&#39;s cooking, it turns to rock candy. Place the saucepan over medium to low heat until the sugars start to dissolve, 5 to 10 minutes. Then turn the heat up to medium-high and cook until the sugar starts to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes. Do not stir while this is happening. You&#39;ve got to watch the pot, because it goes from caramel to burnt really quickly. And be careful, the mixture is extremely hot! Turn off the heat and stand back to avoid splattering. Slowly add the cream. Don&#39;t panic - the cream will bubble violently, and the caramel will solidify. Just give it more time to liquefy again-trust me! Simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature, at least 4 hours. It will thicken as it sits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Vin Santo]&quot; 2180,&quot;Balti Chicken Curry 4 tablespoons grapeseed oil 2 large onions, finely sliced 3 tomatoes, roughly chopped 2 teaspoons chopped green chiles, or to taste 1 teaspoon chopped ginger 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 2 teaspoons green peppercorns (brined in cans) 1 teaspoon red chili powder 1/2 teaspoons garam masala powder 4 large whole chicken breasts, or cut into small pieces 2 cups chicken stock 4 tablespoons tomato paste 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt 4 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves 2 lemons, juiced Salt and freshly ground black pepper Basmati rice and naan bread, for serving Instructions: In a large heavy bottomed skillet (cast iron preferred), heat the oil over medium heat until hot but not smoking.

When the peppers are black on all sides remove them from the heat and place them in an enclosed environment, either a paper bag or a bowl covered with plastic wrap. Let them sit until they are cool. This can be done a day ahead. Using your fingers scrape all the black off the outside of the peppers. Remove the stem and the seeds as well. This is a messy job, accept it and move on. If needed, you can use a damp paper towel. Rinsing the peppers washes away all of the sweet pepper juices. Once the peppers are clean, cut the peppers into strips that are about 1 inch wide. Place about a teaspoon of goat cheese at one end of each pepper strip. Sprinkle cheese with a pinch of the crushed red pepper, pimenton and salt. Roll up each pepper strip around the cheese and garnish with chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 2202,&quot;Lower Alabama BBQ Royal Red Shrimp 3 tablespoons spice seasoning, more or less to taste (recommended: J.O.

Once it&#39;s hot, add the onions and garlic and cook until the onions are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste and red pepper flakes and stir until the tomato paste is thoroughly incorporated. Add the crushed tomatoes to a food mill and process the tomatoes directly into the pot. Add the grated carrots and season with kosher salt. Reduce to low heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Adjust the seasoning as needed. Cover and put aside to keep warm. Heat the canola oil in a large Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Line a sheet tray with paper towels. Add the rice flour, semolina flour, pepper and 2 teaspoons kosher salt to a large shallow dish and mix until thoroughly combined. Working in 3 batches, toss the calamari, pickled pepper slices and rosemary sprigs in the seasoned flour, then scoop them out with a pasta spider and shake off the excess; transfer to the oil. Fry for 90 seconds, then remove to the paper towels and season with flaky sea salt. Repeat until all the calamari is cooked. Serve with the lemon wedges and spicy marinara on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 2205,&quot;Beef Short Rib Stew (Slow Cooker Kalbijjim) 1 cup light soy sauce 1/4 cup mirin<br> 1/4 cup sake<br> 1 tablespoon black pepper<br> 1/2 cup peeled and chopped daikon radish<br> 1 Asian pear, peeled, cored and sliced<br> 1 red apple, peeled, cored and sliced<br> 4 garlic cloves<br> 4 pounds bone-in short ribs<br> 1 teaspoon vegetable oil<br> Kosher salt and black pepper<br> 4 large Yukon gold potatoes, roughly chopped<br> 1 medium onion, quartered<br> 1 medium carrot, large dice<br> 6 dried shiitake mushrooms, chopped<br> 1 cup rice cakes, the disc-shaped variety used for soup<br> 1 cup beef stock<br> Instructions: In a blender, blend the soy sauce, mirin, sake, black pepper, daikon radish, Asian pear, apple and garlic until smooth. Rub the short ribs with the vegetable oil and season with ample kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set a large cast-iron pan over high heat, and, when very hot, sear the ribs until golden-brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Only sear as many ribs as will fit comfortably in the pan; work in batches if necessary. Resist the urge to turn the meat before each surface has formed a crust. Trust us, it will pay off in the end! Drain the seared ribs of their fat. Place the seared meat at the bottom of a slow cooker. Add the potatoes, onion, carrot and mushrooms on top. Cover with a layer of rice cakes then pour in soy sauce mixture and stock on top. The sauce may have settled, so give it a good stir before pouring. Cook on the slow cooker&#39;s low setting until the meat is fork tender and falls off the bone, about 6 hours. Alternatively, if not using a slow cooker: If you&#39;re not down with the electric cooker, that is very much OK. Sear the meat in a Dutch oven, drain the fat, and layer in the vegetables, rice cakes, sauce and beef stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to very low and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the meat is fork tender, about 2 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 2206,&quot;Drunken Chicken Noodles 1 pound pad Thai wide flat rice noodles (dried) 3 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 chiles, sliced 1 pinch dried chili flakes 1 onion, diced 1 pound chicken thighs, skin removed, sliced into 1/3- by 5-inch strips 1 tablespoon Shaosing rice wine 4 1/4 ounces mangteout (snow peas), julienne 2 Romano red peppers, julienne 1 medium carrot, julienned 2 tablespoons oyster sauce 2 tablespoons low-sodium light soy sauce 1 tablespoon fish sauce mixed with 1 teaspoon brown sugar 3 scallions, sliced on a sharp 45-degree diagonal Instructions: Cook the noodles to packet instructions. Drain and refresh under cold water, drizzle 1 tablespoon peanut oil over, mixing well to stop the noodles from sticking, and set aside. Heat a wok over high heat and add the remaining peanut oil. Add the garlic, chiles, chili flakes and onions and stir-fry for a few seconds to release their aroma. Add the chicken thighs and stir for 2 minutes. As the chicken starts to turn brown at the edges and turn opaque, add the Shaosing rice wine. Add the mangetout, Romano peppers and carrots and toss together and stir well for 2 minutes. Add the noodles and toss well for 1 minute, and then season with the oyster sauce, soy sauce and fish sauce with sugar; toss well for 1 minute. Garnish with the scallions and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2207,&quot;Chocolate White Chocolate Chunk Cookies 1/2 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup light brown sugar, packed 1 cup granulated sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 extra-large eggs at room temperature 2/3 cup good unsweetened cocoa 2 cups flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds good white chocolate, coarsely chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cream the butter and both sugars until light and fluffy in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the vanilla, then the eggs, 1 at a time, and mix well. Add the cocoa and mix again. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt and add to the chocolate with the mixer on low speed until just combined. Fold in the chopped white chocolate. Drop the dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, using a 1 3/4-inch ice cream scoop or a rounded tablespoon. Dampen your hands and flatten the dough slightly. Bake for exactly 15 minutes (the cookies will seem underdone). Remove from the oven and let cool slightly on the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 2208,&quot;Fresh Pasta with Parmesan Butter Sauce 2 1/3 cups (300 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2/3 cup (100 grams) durum flour 4 eggs, room temperature, whisked<br> Water (if necessary) Sea salt 1 cup vegetable stock<br> 4 tablespoons butter<br> Freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for garnish Fresh parsley, mint or basil leaves, for garnish<br> Instructions: For the pasta: You can prepare the dough either using a stand mixer or by hand. Using a stand mixer: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the hook attachment, add the flours and mix to combine. Add the eggs and mix on medium speed until the dough come together and forms a ball. If the dough is dry, add a little water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Reduce the speed to low and mix until the dough is smooth, about 6 minutes. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. By hand: On a wooden table or in a bowl, create a volcano shape with the flours. Then make a large hole in the middle. Break the eggs inside of the volcano. Whip the eggs with a fork to create a uniform color (until you can&#39;t see the difference between egg yolk and egg white). Then, little by little with the tips of your fork, start to incorporate the flour, starting from the center and moving out (never break or pass beyond the volcano). If the dough is dry, add a little water, 1 teaspoon at a time. When the mixture is uniform, use your hands and knead the dough until smooth. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let it sit for about 30 minutes. Flour the table and roll out the dough until very thin (until you can just see your hands through the dough). For pappardelle, roll the dough up into a log, lightly flouring the dough as you roll it. Slice into about 1-inch-thick slices. Unroll the slices and lay out the strips flat onto a floured sheet tray until ready to cook. For the sauce: When ready to cook the pasta, bring a pot of water to a boil and add salt. Cook the pasta for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, in a pan, bring the vegetable stock to a simmer. Add the butter and cooked pasta. Season it with freshly milled black pepper and salt. At the very end, add the Parmigiano-Reggiano little by little, stirring it in as you go. Garnish with fresh herbs and more cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 2209,&quot;Nutty Tropical Kale and Rice Salad 1 large firm ripe mango 3 tablespoons vegetable or extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons cider vinegar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound kale (1 to 2 bunches) One 14-ounce can hearts of palm, drained and sliced 1 1/2 cups cooked white rice, at room temperature 2 medium tomatoes, halved and sliced 1 cup salted roasted mixed nuts, roughly chopped Instructions: Peel the mango and cut the flesh from the pit. Cut half of the mango into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 cup) and transfer to a small bowl. Roughly chop the remaining mango and puree in a blender with the oil, vinegar, 2 tablespoons water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few turns of pepper.<br> Cut the thick center stem from each kale leaf and discard. Working in batches, mound a handful of kale on the cutting board and gather it together tightly. Slice crosswise to make very thin ribbons. Put the kale in a large bowl and toss with the mango dressing. Let stand at least 15 minutes and up to 45 minutes to wilt slightly.<br> Add the chopped mango, hearts of palm, rice and tomatoes; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Top with the nuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 2210,&quot;Pizza Pizzas 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon kosher salt* 1 tablespoon pure olive oil 3/4 cup warm water 2 cups bread flour (for bread machines) 1 teaspoon instant yeast 2 teaspoons olive oil Olive oil, for the pizza crust Flour, for dusting the pizza peel 1 1/2 ounces pizza sauce 1/2 teaspoon each chopped fresh herbs such as thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, for example A combination of 3 grated cheeses such as mozzarella, Monterey Jack, and provolone Instructions: Place the sugar, salt, olive oil, water, 1 cup of flour, yeast, and remaining cup of flour into a standing mixer&#39;s work bowl. Using the paddle attachment, start the mixer on low and mix until the dough just comes together, forming a ball. Lube the hook attachment with cooking spray. Attach the hook to the mixer and knead for 15 minutes on medium speed. Tear off a small piece of dough and flatten into a disc. Stretch the dough until thin. Hold it up to the light and look to see if the baker&#39;s windowpane, or taut membrane, has formed. If the dough tears before it forms, knead the dough for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Roll the pizza dough into a smooth ball on the countertop. Place into a stainless steel or glass bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil to the bowl and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours. Place the pizza stone or tile onto the bottom of a cold oven and turn the oven to its highest temperature, about 500 degrees F. If the oven has coils on the oven floor, place the tile onto the lowest rack of the oven. Split the pizza dough into 2 equal parts using a knife or a dough scraper. Flatten into a disk onto the countertop and then fold the dough into a ball. Wet hands barely with water and rub them onto the countertop to dampen the surface. Roll the dough on the surface until it tightens. Cover one ball with a tea towel and rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the steps with the other piece of dough. If not baking the remaining pizza immediately, spray the inside of a ziptop bag with cooking spray and place the dough ball into the bag. Refrigerate for up to 6 days. Sprinkle the flour onto the peel and place the dough onto the peel. Using your hands, form a lip around the edges of the pizza. Stretch the dough into a round disc, rotating after each stretch. Toss the dough in the air if you dare. Shake the pizza on the peel to be sure that it will slide onto the pizza stone or tile. (Dress and bake the pizza immediately for a crisp crust or rest the dough for 30 minutes if you want a chewy texture.) Brush the rim of the pizza with olive oil. Spread the pizza sauce evenly onto the pizza. Sprinkle the herbs onto the pizza and top with the cheese. Slide the pizza onto the tile and bake for 7 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown. Rest for 3 minutes before slicing. *This recipe&#39;s been on the web for some time now and although most of the reactions have been darned positive, some of you have commented that the dough was way too salty. At first we chalked this up to personal preference; some folks are just not as sensitive as others to this basic flavor. And of course salty toppings would definitley change the dynamic. Still, we didn&#39;t want to leave it at that. We went back to the lab and found that the flake size of kosher salt differs quite a bit from brand to brand. This could easily result in a too salty crust. So unless you&#39;ve had success with the recipe in the past, we suggest you cut the salt by one teaspoon, from a tablespoon to two teaspoons. So that the yeast doesn&#39;t go crazy, you should also cut back on the sugar by half a teaspoon.

Combine the butter, wine, celery, bell pepper, onion, Cajun seasoning, brown sugar, hot sauce and salt in a food processor or blender. Process until very smooth. Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and keep warm over low heat. Remove the giblets and neck from the turkey and save for stock or discard. Place the turkey breast-side down on a cutting board. Cut along one side of the backbone from the tail to the neck with a chef&#39;s knife or kitchen shears. Repeat with the other side and remove the backbone. (Save for stock!) Turn the turkey over, and press down on the breastbone with the heel of your hand until it cracks. Tuck the wing tips up and over the back of the turkey. (This prevents them from burning.) Place the turkey on a wire rack in a roasting pan. Fill a flavor injector with the butter mixture and inject as much of the butter into the turkey at different angles. Pour any remaining butter over the top of the turkey, then sprinkle with additional Cajun seasoning, if desired. Place the roasting pan on the middle rack in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, undisturbed. Baste the turkey with the pan juices and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Continue to bake, basting occasionally, until a meat thermometer reaches 165 degrees F when inserted in the thickest portion of the breast and thigh (avoiding bone), 45 minutes to 1 hour. (Add the chicken stock to the roasting pan if it starts to dry out.) Let rest before slicing.

Grease a half sheet pan and line it with parchment. In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the eggs for 5 minutes until light and frothy. With the mixer on medium speed, slowly add the sugar; increase to medium-high speed and beat to a ribbon consistency, another 5 minutes. Combine the butter and milk in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for about 2 minutes, until the butter is melted and the milk is hot. Set aside. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. With the mixer on low speed, add the vanilla and then slowly add the flour mixture; mix until combined, scraping down the sides. Whisk about 1 cup from the mixer in the hot milk-butter until smooth, then return to the mixer, whisking until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared half sheet pan and bake until an inserted toothpick comes out with just a few moist crumbs, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes, then remove the cake from the pan and use a 3-inch biscuit cutter to cut out 12 mini cake rounds. For the whipped cream: Bloom the gelatin in 2 tablespoons cold water to dissolve. In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the mascarpone until smooth and fluffy. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar, beating until smooth. Slowly add the cream; beat until smooth, then add the vanilla. Raise the mixer speed to high and beat to soft/medium peaks. Mix a dollop of the whipped cream into the gelatin, then add back to the mixer. Whip to medium peaks. Chill until ready to use. For the caramelized peaches: Toss the peaches, sugar and salt together in a bowl. Heat a medium-large skillet over medium heat until hot; add the butter. Place the peaches, cut side down, in the skillet and cook, turning once, until caramelized on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side; be careful to keep the peach skins intact. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet to cool for about 10 minutes. To assemble: Place a cake round on a plate and top with two peach wedges, skin-sides facing out. Scoop some whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a large round or star tip and pipe a swirl in the center of the round, between the peach wedges. Top with a second cake round and pipe another swirl of whipped cream in the center. Garnish with a peach wedge and a wedge of white chocolate if using. Repeat to make 6 shortcakes total. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2214,&quot;Bacon Wrapped Pineapple Nonstick cooking spray, for the wire racks 24 strips bacon (approximately 1 pound)<br> 1 fresh pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into forty to forty-two 1-inch cubes 3 tablespoons honey<br> 3 tablespoons Dijon or spicy brown mustard<br> 3 tablespoons hot sauce<br> Dash liquid smoke<br> Instructions: Line 2 baking sheets with foil, and set wire racks inside each.

Cut a small X in the bottom of each peach; add to the boiling water for 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool; drain and peel off the skins with a paring knife. (Or for harder peaches, remove skins with a vegetable peeler.) Chop the peaches. Combine with the sugar, salt and cl in a medium saucepan. Toss and let stand until the sugar dissolves and the liquid is syrupy, 10 to 20 minutes. Add the syrup to the pan and bring to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring frequently and skimming off any foam, until the peaches soften and the juices thicken, about 15 minutes. (Gently mash any large peach chunks.) Remove from the heat and let the jam cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Transfer the jam to a jar or other airtight container and refrigerate until cold and fully jelled, 1 to 2 hours.

Season generously with salt and pepper. In a heavy ovenproof casserole, heat the lard or bacon fat over medium heat. Add the salt pork and, stirring frequently, cook until it is crisp and golden and has rendered all its fat. With a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to paper towels to drain and add the chicken pieces to the casserole. Using heavy kitchen tongs, brown the chicken pieces quickly and evenly, turning to brown all sides. Transfer the chicken to a platter and set aside. Pour off and discard all but a thin film of fat from the casserole and add the butter. Increase the heat to medium and when the pan is hot, throw in the noodles. Cook them, stirring almost constantly, until they are browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Immediately reduce the heat to low and add the onion. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes more, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened. Add the garlic, paprika, and tomatoes and cook uncovered, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated and the mixture is thickened. Return the chicken pieces and salt pork to the casserole. Add the rice, peas, boiling water, saffron, and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir together gently but thoroughly and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer very gently for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and done all the way through with no trace of pink remaining. The rice will have absorbed all the liquid. Stir in the parsley, cover again and let stand for 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Rioja, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 2217,&quot;Pan Roasted Ostrich with Crispy Sweetbreads, Salsify Puree, Potato Puree, Oven-Dried Tomatoes, Pencil Asparagus, Enoki Mushrooms, and Glace Des Medoc 1 pound sweetbreads 1 gallon court bouillon 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons butter 1 lemon, juiced 1 lemon, juiced 8 fresh salsify roots 1 cup heavy cream, heated 1/2 pound butter, melted and warm 2 Yukon gold potatoes, peeled 1/4 cup heavy cream, heated 1/4 pound butter, melted and warm 4 Roma tomatoes 2 to 3 extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 pound butter, divided 3 shallots, sliced 3 cup Medoc wine 1 quart veal stock 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons butter 4 (8-ounce) ostrich steaks Cooked spinach, for serving Blanched asparagus, for serving Sauteed enoki mushrooms, for serving Instructions: Bring court bouillon to a simmer in a saucepan. Add sweetbreads and poach for approximately 9 minutes. Remove sweetbreads and discard liquid. Press sweetbreads between 2 sheet trays until completely cool. Peel membranes and separate into bite-size pieces. Just before serving, dust sweetbreads with flour, shaking off excess. Melt butter in a skillet over high heat, add sweetbreads, and sear until crispy. Add lemon juice to deglaze the pan. Keep warm. In a saucepan, bring several inches of water and the lemon juice to a simmer. Peel salsify and add to acidulated water; simmer until very tender. Strain and then transfer salsify to the bowl of a food processor. Add cream and melted butter and puree until smooth. The consistency should be more like a sauce than a puree. Keep warm. In a saucepan, simmer potatoes in water until tender. Strain and then put potatoes through a potato ricer. In a medium bowl, whip potatoes potatoes with hot cream and butter. Keep warm. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Slice tomatoes into 1/4-inch thick slices. In a medium bowl, toss tomatoes with olive oil. Arrange tomato slices on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Set aside. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan. Add shallots and saute until beginning to brown. Add wine and stir to deglaze the pan. Cook until wine is reduced to a syrup. Add veal stock and reduce until sauce consistency. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, and swirl to combine. Keep warm. Melt oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season ostrich with salt and pepper. When pan is hot, add ostrich and sear on both sides until cooked to a medium doneness; it will not take long, as ostrich cooks very quickly and is not good when over-cooked. Reserve and keep warm. It may be necessary to sear the ostrich in 2 batches, so as not to over-crowd the pan. To serve, layer potatoes with spinach and tomatoes in a 2-inch ring mold. Place a pretty oval of potato on top with another dried tomato. Spoon a thin line of salsify puree onto the plate. Slice the ostrich on a sharp bias and place it next to the potato stack.

Combine flour, salt and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Once yeast has bloomed, add to dry ingredients along with corn oil. Gently combine with a rubber spatula until a rough ball is formed. Knead on low speed with the dough hook for 90 seconds. Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl and proof until doubled in size, about 6 hours. Punch down and let dough settle for 15 more minutes. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Coat bottom and sides of a 12-inch cake pan or traditional Chicago style pizza pan with melted butter. Using your hands, spread out about three-quarters of the dough across the bottom and up the sides of the pan (save the remainder for another use). Cover entire bottom in mozzarella, all the way up to the edge. Cover half with a thin, even layer of raw sausage. Cover the other half with the pepperoni. Top with a couple handfuls of crushed tomatoes. Spread out with hands to the edge. Sprinkle top evenly with grated Parm. Bake, rotating halfway through, until golden around the edge, about 25 minutes. Let rest for about 5 minutes, then either gently lift pizza out of pan or just cut your slice out of the pan like a pie! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 2221,&quot;Lemon Bundt Cake with Chocolate Glaze and Candied Lemon 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 1/2 cups water<br> 2 lemons, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rounds<br> Nonstick vegetable oil spray 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature<br> 2 cups sugar 4 eggs, room temperature<br> 1 cup buttermilk, room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Zest of 2 lemons<br> 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons) 3 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br> 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup whipping cream<br> Instructions: For the candied lemon: Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the lemon slices and simmer until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain. Let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Finely chop the candied lemon slices. Set aside. For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray a nonstick Bundt pan with vegetable spray. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or using a hand mixer, beat together the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Mix in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. On low speed, slowly add the buttermilk and the vanilla. Stop the mixer, add the lemon zest and juice, and mix to incorporate. With the mixer on low, add the flour, one cup at a time, until combined. Finally, add the baking powder, baking soda and salt. Raise to medium speed and mix for 1 minute, until the batter is fluffy and smooth. Mix in the chopped candied lemons. With a spatula or wooden spoon, transfer the batter to the prepared Bundt pan and smooth out the top. Set the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake until golden and a cake tester comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Let the cake cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes before turning it out onto a plate. For the glaze: Place the chocolate chips in a medium bowl. Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Once bubbles have formed around the edges of the cream, pour it over the chocolate.

For the chicken and roasted vegetables: Put the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag, add the marinade and marinate for at least 8 hours and up to overnight. When ready to roast, position an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven (to leave clearance for the bundt pan and chicken) and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the peppers, sweet potatoes and half of the fennel and onions in a bowl with the olive oil and some salt and pepper. Spread the vegetables out on a baking sheet, leaving the center clear for the bundt pan. In the bottom of a bundt pan, add the wine, garlic, rosemary and remaining fennel and onions. Remove the chicken from the marinade (discard the marinade) and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Using a square of foil, cover the hole of the bundt. Stand the chicken upright on the bundt center over the foil. Roast until the chicken registers 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 50 minutes. Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes before serving. Meanwhile, strain the residual juices in the bundt pan and pour into a medium skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the butter. Carve the chicken and place over the roasted vegetables on a platter.

To make the dressing for the salad, combine the mustard, vinegar and honey and whisk in the olive oil to create an emulsion. Remove the quail from the marinade and grill over an outdoor barbecue for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or cook over medium heat in a cast iron skillet for 10 to 12 minutes, turning frequently to avoid burning. Remove from the heat and let the quail rest for several minutes before serving. Toss the salad greens with the dressing and divide among 4 plates. Top each salad with 2 quail for a main course and garnish each with several slices of papaya and mango and sprinkle with toasted pumpkin seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 2227,&quot;Gravy 1 Good Eats Roast Turkey 24 ounces reduced-sodium chicken broth (this is in addition to the pan drippings) 8 ounces red wine 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs, oregano, thyme or rosemary Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Remove the turkey from the roasting pan, cover loosely with foil and set aside to rest. Place the pan over medium heat and add the broth and wine at the same time. Whisk to combine and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Once all of the bits have come off the bottom of the pan, cook in order to reduce slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the liquid to a fat separator and allow to sit for 5 minutes to allow fat to separate. Return the fat to the roasting pan and place over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook, whisking continuously until the mixture starts to thicken and become smooth, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Once this happens gradually add the liquid back to the pan and whisk until smooth and you have reached your desired consistency, approximately 5 to 6 minutes. Add the herbs and whisk to combine. Remember, your gravy should be slightly thin in the pan as it will thicken once you serve it. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barolo]&quot; 2228,&quot;Pickled Citrus Shrimp 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 3 pounds medium shrimp (16/20), peeled and deveined with the tails on 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon celery seed 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1 teaspoon mustard seeds 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon ground white pepper 14 bay leaves 6 cloves garlic, sliced very thin 3 dried hot cl peppers, like arbol chiles 2 small Spanish onions, sliced very thin 2 lemons, sliced very thin Instructions: For the shrimp: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Mix the seafood seasoning, salt and pepper together in a small bowl. Place the shrimp on a sheet tray and drizzle with the olive oil. Sprinkle with the seafood seasoning mixture. Put in the oven and bake for 8 minutes. For the marinade: Toast the seeds in a dry pan over low heat for a few minutes, until just toasted and giving off a nutty aroma. Let cool.<br> Whisk the toasted seeds with the vinegar, lemon juice, olive oil and white pepper in a large glass bowl. Stir in the bay leaves, garlic, chiles, onions and lemons.<br> When the shrimp come out of the oven, put them into the marinade to let cool. Wrap the bowl tightly with two layers of plastic wrap. Put the bowl in the refrigerator and marinate, turning the shrimp in the bowl occasionally to mix well, for at least 8 hours and for up to 24 hours before serving. Also put a large glass bowl in the fridge to chill, for serving the shrimp. To serve: Strain and reserve the liquid from the shrimp using a medium sieve or strainer so the seeds can pass through (but it&#39;s ok if some remain in the shrimp).<br> Put the shrimp in the chilled glass bowl. Add some of the marinade back to the shrimp and toss. The shrimp should not be swimming in the marinade. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 2229,&quot;Ingrid&#39;s Spinach and Cheese Blintz 4 cups frozen spinach 3 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil 2 cups scallions, chopped 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, grated 1 cup mozzarella, grated Salt and pepper Instructions: Completely defrost the spinach and squeeze out any excess liquid.

Add the sesame oil, cheddar, and mozzarella, folding the spinach over the cheese until it melts. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the filling from the pan and cool before stuffing your blintz crepes. If you refrigerate the mixture, it is best to bring the spinach to room temperature, and drain again before stuffing or your blintzes will be soggy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2230,&quot;Crispy Whole Gulf Fish 3 roasted red peppers, peeled and seeded 2 pounds roasted Roma tomatoes, skinned and seeded<br> 1 bulb garlic, roasted<br> 1 jar guava paste<br> 1/2 white onion, chopped<br> 2 cups sugar<br> 2 cups white vinegar<br> 1/2 tablespoon crushed red pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup thinly sliced sweet red or Vidalia onions 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons brown sugar, light or dark<br> 2 teaspoons cane vinegar<br> Salt and pepper 1 1/2 pounds baby red potatoes 1/2 cup seafood boil seasoning<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter or olive oil 2 teaspoons minced garlic<br> 8 ounces mild baby braising greens or leaf spinach<br> 1 teaspoon cane vinegar<br> Four 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-pound whole snapper 8 cups canola or fryer oil<br> Creole seasoning Salt and pepper 8 cups seasoned seafood breading<br> Fresh chopped herbs, for garnish Instructions: For the ketchup: To a small saucepot add the peppers, tomatoes, garlic, guava paste, onions, sugar, vinegar, crushed red pepper and salt. Simmer until the liquid begins to thicken to a hot syrup consistency. Add to a counter-top blender or use an immersion blender and puree. For the onions: You can make these on a grill over open flame with a perforated pan. You can also make them in a saute pan. To make over a grill, toss the sliced onions in a bowl with oil, sugar, vinegar and some salt and pepper. Allow to marinate for about 20 minutes. Pour into a perforated pan and place directly on the grill over the flame. Stir constantly until all the onions are cooked and golden brown. To make in a saute pan, add the oil to a hot pan and then add the onion. Stir occasionally to allow the onions to caramelize, then deglaze with the cane vinegar. Remove from the heat and finish with the brown sugar and some salt and pepper. Let cool. For the potatoes: Rinse and quarter the red potatoes. Season 8 cups water with the seafood boil spice and bring to a rapid boil. Add the potatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes. Remove from the water and let cool. For the greens: In another shallow saute pan, add the butter and place over medium-high heat. When the butter is melted and sizzling, add the minced garlic. Let the garlic toast to a light golden brown, and then add the greens. Stir to coat the greens with the garlic. Add the cane vinegar. Season with salt and black pepper. Toss just to wilt the greens and remove from the heat. For the fish: To clean the snapper, the first thing you want to do is scale and gut the fish. Then use a pair of scissors to remove the gills and all the fins from the outside of the fish. Cut an \\X\\ on both sides of the snapper. Place the vegetable oil in a shallow frying pan and place on medium heat. The oil should reach about 350 degrees F. While the oil is heating, sprinkle both sides of the fish with the Creole seasoning and some salt and pepper. Then dredge in the seafood breading. Be careful not to bread too heavily. Bend the fish so it will look like it is swimming when it comes out the fryer. Cook the crab boiled potatoes in the oil with the fish until crisp and golden brown. To serve, quickly heat the barbequed onions in the pan. Toss with the garlic wilted greens and crab boiled potatoes. Place the onions, greens and potatoes on the bottom of the plate and fish in the center of the plate and drizzle with the guava ketchup. Garnish with fresh herbs and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 2231,&quot;Spiedini Hoagies with Caprese Relish 12 ounces hot Italian sausage 12 ounces sweet Italian sausage Canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pint yellow and red cherry tomatoes, quartered 1 pint bocconcini, or 1 pound fresh mozzarella cut into 1/2-inch dice 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon capers, drained 1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bread 1/4 cup red wine vinegar French baguette or soft hoagie rolls 2 cloves garlic, halved Special equipment: 12-inch metal skewers or wooden skewers (if wooden, soaked in cold water for 30 minutes) Instructions: Heat the grill for high direct grilling. Skewer a few sausages onto each skewer, brush with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the sausages until golden brown and slightly charred on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the sausages to a platter and let rest 5 minutes before removing to a plate. Toss the tomatoes with the bocconcini, basil, parsley, capers, onions, olive oil and red wine vinegar. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Slice the bread open and put on the grill, cut-side down, and grill until lightly golden brown. Remove and rub the surface with the garlic cloves, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Put a whole sausage on each roll and top with the caprese relish. Alternatively, cut the sausage into 2-inch chunks before putting on the rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]&quot; 2232,&quot;Pavlova Fruit Tart 4 extra-large egg whites, at room temperature Pinch of kosher salt 1 cup sugar 2 teaspoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Sweetened Whipped Cream (recipe follows) 1/2 pint fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced 1/2 pint fresh blueberries 1/2 pint fresh raspberries Small bunch of red grapes Triple Raspberry Sauce (recipe follows) Mint leaves, for garnish 1 cup cold heavy cream 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 pint fresh raspberries 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup seedless raspberry jam (12-ounce jar) 1 tablespoon framboise liqueur Instructions: Preheat the oven to 180 degrees F. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a sheet pan. Draw a 9-inch circle on the paper, using a 9-inch plate as a guide, then turn the paper over so the circle is on the reverse side. (This way you won&#39;t get a pencil mark on the meringue.) Place the egg whites and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat the egg whites on high speed until firm, about 1 minute. With the mixer still on high, slowly add the sugar and beat until it makes firm, shiny peaks, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer, sift the cornstarch onto the beaten egg whites, add the vinegar and vanilla, and fold in lightly with a rubber spatula. Place about half of the meringue into the circle on the parchment paper and smooth it within the circle, making a disk. Place the remaining meringue in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and pipe the edge with kisses. If you have any meringue left over, pipe it into the middle of the disk and smooth it with a rubber spatula. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off the oven, keep the door closed, and allow the meringue to cool completely in the oven, about 1 hour. It will be crisp on the outside and soft inside. Using a large metal spatula, carefully transfer the shell to a flat serving plate or cake stand. Fill the center of the shell with the whipped cream. Combine the strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and grapes in a bowl and toss with about 1/2 cup of raspberry sauce, or enough to coat the fruit lightly. Spoon the fruit carefully into the middle of the Pavlova and garnish with mint leaves. Serve immediately in large scoops with extra raspberry sauce. Whip the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (you can also use a hand mixer). When it starts to thicken, add the sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until firm.

Combine the granulated sugar, water and salt in a medium saucepan; set over medium heat. Cook, swirling the pan a few times, until the sugar dissolves. Continue to cook until the sugar is a light amber color, 5 to 6 minutes; brush down any crystallized bits of sugar around the edge using a wet pastry brush. Add the pecans and cook, stirring, until a few shades darker, about 1 minute, then immediately pour onto the baking sheet and spread into an even layer. Transfer the pan to a rack and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Make the cookies: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350? F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Break the cooled praline into large pieces. Roughly chop enough to make 1 1/4 cups, then put the remaining praline in a food processor and pulse until finely ground. (You should have about 2/3 cup ground praline.) Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and ground praline in a medium bowl. Put 1 stick butter in a large heatproof bowl and microwave until just melted. Let cool slightly, then add the brown sugar, egg and vanilla bean paste and whisk to combine. Stir in the flour mixture just until combined, then stir in 1 cup of the chopped praline. Divide the dough into 12 pieces (about 3 tablespoons each). Roll each into a ball and arrange about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cookies are firm around the edges and the centers are puffed but still soft, 12 to 15 minutes (it\\u2019s OK if the praline starts to melt). Let cool 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then remove the cookies to a rack to cool completely.

With the palm of 1 hand firmly steadying a cutlet on the cutting board, and with your knife blade parallel to the meat, slice almost all the way through the meat (horizontally), leaving the last 1/4-inch uncut. Open up the cutlet like a book, season it with salt and white pepper, and set it aside. Repeat with the remaining pork steaks.<br> Next, sprinkle the cut side of each cutlet with a tiny pinch of minced garlic, a couple pinches parsley, and a generous tablespoon provolone cheese and Parmesan cheese. Roll the cutlets into tight logs and set aside, seam-side down.<br> Tie each rolled up pork steak with 2 or 3 pieces butcher&#39;s twine.<br> In a large pot, bring the tomato sauce to a steady, gentle simmer. Place the braciola into the pot of tomato sauce and let simmer 3 hours, or until tender.<br> To serve: Remove the braciola from the sauce and snip off the twine. Arrange, whole or sliced, on a platter with a generous blanket of sauce.<br> Transfer the remaining sauce to a serving bowl. Serve hot or at room temperature. Garnish with grated Parmesan and serve. To make the Tomato Sauce: Combine the olive oil and garlic in a large deep saucepan and cook over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is deeply colored and fragrant. Cook&#39;s Note: If the garlic starts to smell acrid or sharp or is taking on color quickly, pull the pan off the stove and reduce the heat.<br> While the garlic is getting golden, pour the tomatoes into a large bowl and crush them with your hands. Remove the stem end and any basil leaves from the canned tomatoes as you crush them.<br> When the garlic is just about done, add the red pepper flakes to the oil and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, to infuse their flavor and spice into the oil.

This will make it easy to unmold the pudding. Remove the crusts from the brioche and cut it into about 1-inch thick slices. Arrange the bread slices in the prepared bowl, cutting as necessary, to cover the bottom and sides. You should have some leftover slices. In a heavy bottomed saucepan, over medium heat, combine the cherries, sugar, 1 3/4 bunches of fresh mint sprigs, water and pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the berries begin to soften and release their juices, about 20 minutes. Spoon about half of the cherry mixture into the prepared bowl. Put a layer of brioche slices on top of the cherries and press down gently. Spoon more of the cherry mixture over the brioche layer. Reserve a little of the cherry liquid for the sauce. Look at the brioche slices at the bottom of the bowl they should be nicely colored with the liquid but not too saturated or too wet. Next, cover with the last layer of brioche slices and add more of the cherry mixture. If you run out of brioche slices, you can always use your crust trimmings. Tightly wrap the whole pudding and bowl with plastic wrap and put a plate, smaller than the top of the bowl, on top of the pudding to weigh it down. Put a heavy weight on top of the plate to compress further, such as heavy canned goods or even an iron skillet. Refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours. Simmer the reserved cherry liquid in a small saucepan over low heat. Reduce the liquid by half, then discard the mint sprigs, cool down and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. When ready to serve, whip the cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form, then add a teaspoon of the reduced cherry syrup. Whip to incorporate. Unmold the pudding onto a serving plate. Brush some of the syrup over the pudding to add a nice sheen. Cut into wedges and serve with dollops of the flavored whipped cream. Drizzle some of the syrup over each serving and a garnish a fresh mint sprig. You can even put a fresh cherry on top if you have the urge! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 2246,&quot;Ribs on the Grill Spice Rub, recipe follows 2 racks spare ribs (about 3 pounds each) 2 cups yellow mustard<br> 1 cup white vinegar<br> Homemade BBQ Sauce, recipe follows 1/4 cup ground black pepper 1/4 cup paprika<br> 1/4 cup garlic salt<br> 1/4 cup seasoned salt<br> 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 2 fresh habanero peppers 4 cups tomato sauce<br> 1/2 cup brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup hot sauce<br> 1/4 cup lemon juice<br> 1/4 cup molasses<br> 1/4 cup dry mustard<br> 1/4 cup onion powder<br> 1/4 cup paprika<br> 1/4 cup ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce<br> Instructions: Rub the Spice Rub on all sides of the rib racks and place on a sheet pan.

To make cookie combine 8 ounces butter and sugar in mixer and cream until smooth. Add flour and almond powder to butter and sugar mixture. The dough should not be smooth, but a sandy texture. Remove batter from bowl and roll out to 1/8-inch thick. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Let the sandy cookie completely cool. Place back in mixing bowl, and add remaining butter and olives until a paste is formed. Roll out dough, place on cookie sheet, and refrigerate for 1 hour. When dough is firm remove, and cut into desired shape. Place cookies on pan and bake for 10 minutes. Let cool and set aside. Place lemon juice and zest in a pot. Add the cornstarch and sugar to lemon juice while still cold. Mix together and cook on stove. While lemon mixture in cooking, whisk eggs in separate bowl. When lemon mixture has come to a boil temper with the eggs slowly, continuously whisking. This will prevent eggs from curdling. The mixture will thicken quickly. Once it is thick, remove from heat to avoid overcooking. Add remaining butter to lemon custard. Remove custard from pot into plastic container. Cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin to form, and refrigerate for 2 hours. To assemble: Take a cookie and place in center of plate. Heat spoon with hot water, and scoop custard onto cookie.

Remove the backbone by cutting 1 1/2 inches to the left and right of the backbone (opposite side of breast) from front to back. Remove the backbone and reserve for stock if desired. Place the turkey breast-side up on a large flat surface. Place a clean kitchen towel on top and press down firmly on the breast to flatten. Season both sides of the spatchcocked turkey with 1 tablespoon each of the celery salt, granulated garlic, granulated onion and pepper. Season the whole turkey inside and out with 1 tablespoon black pepper and the remaining celery salt, granulated garlic and granulated onion. Allow both turkeys to sit in the refrigerator overnight, uncovered, to dry the skin. The next day, allow the turkeys to come to room temperature for 1 1/2 hours. Arrange one oven rack in the bottom lowest position of the oven and one in the top third. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Combine the minced parsley, tarragon, oregano, minced thyme, lemon zest and shallots with some salt and pepper in a small bowl. The salt will help to draw the moisture and flavor from the mixture. Add the olive oil to form a paste. Divide the mixture between the turkeys and spread all around both sides of each turkey. Season again with salt and pepper. Halve 3 of the lemons. Stuff the cavity of the whole turkey with the lemon halves and parsley and thyme sprigs. Divide the carrots, onions and fennel between 2 roasting pans or baking sheets. Arrange the spatchcocked turkey skin-side up on the vegetables in one pan. Put the whole turkey breast-side up on the vegetables in the second pan. Divide the stock and wine between the 2 pans. Put the whole turkey on the bottom oven rack and the spatchcocked turkey on the top rack and roast, basting every 30 minutes with the pan juices and adding a little more liquid to the bottom of the pans as needed to prevent burning. Keep an eye on the turkeys: when the spatchcocked turkey is nicely browned, remove the roasting pan and carefully move the top oven rack to the middle position (see Cook&#39;s Note). Move the whole turkey to the middle rack and the spatchcocked turkey to the bottom rack and continue to roast until the thickest part of the thighs registers 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 2 hours total (10 minutes per pound) for a 12-pound spatchcocked turkey and 2 hours 25 minutes to 3 hours total (12 to 15 minutes per pound) for a 12-pound whole turkey. Allow the turkeys to rest for at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2294,&quot;Homemade Gravy 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onion (2 onions) 1/4 cup flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Defatted turkey drippings plus chicken stock to make 2 cups, heated 1 tablespoon Cognac or brandy 1 tablespoon white wine, optional 1 tablespoon heavy cream, optional Instructions: In a large (10 to 12-inch) saute pan, cook the butter and onions over medium-low heat for 12 to 15 minutes, until the onions are lightly browned.

Rinse the chicken with cool water and pat dry. Place the chicken in a roasting pan on a rack, breast side up. Sprinkle the cavity of the chicken with salt and pepper. Tuck the wing tips under the back of the chicken.<br> Combine 4 tablespoons butter, parsley if using, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Loosen the skin on the breast of the chicken by gently wriggling fingers under the skin. Rub outside of the chicken with about 1 tablespoon of the butter mixture. Rub the remaining mixture under the skin of the chicken breast. Sprinkle chicken with additional salt and pepper. Roast the chicken for 1 hour 15 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Spoon the garlic out of the saucepan and discard. Add the apricot preserves, mustard and vinegar and cook, stirring, until warmed through and combined, about 2 minutes. Set aside to cool until ready to glaze the chicken.<br> Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the oven and brush evenly with the apricot glaze.

Add them to a large pot, cover them with cold water, and add salt. Bring them to a boil, cook for 10 minutes, drain and cool for 20 minutes. The potatoes will now be only partly cooked and should be completely dry before you roast them. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the potatoes with the oil and salt and pepper, to taste, and spread them in one layer on a baking sheet. Roast until crispy and cooked through, about 45 minutes. While the potatoes are roasting, make the herb butter: Mix the softened butter with the parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme and season it with salt and pepper, to taste. When the potatoes are done, put them into a large bowl (reserve 1 cup for the Round 2 Recipe) and toss with the herb butter.

For the crust, place the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, until light and creamy. Sift the flour and salt together and, with the mixer on low, slowly add to the butter-sugar mixture, beating until combined. Scatter two-thirds of the dough in clumps in a 9 x 13-inch baking pan and press it lightly with floured hands on the bottom and 1/2 inch up the sides. Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the crust is golden brown, and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, put the mixing bowl with the remaining dough back on the mixer, add the walnuts and cinnamon, and mix on low speed to combine. Set aside. Reduce the oven to 350 degrees. For the filling, combine the Granny Smith and Golden Delicious apples and lemon juice in a very large bowl. Add the granulated sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix well. Melt the butter in a large (10-inch-diameter) pot, add the apples, and simmer over medium to medium-low heat, stirring often, for 12 to 15 minutes, until the apples are tender and the liquid has mostly evaporated. Spread the apples evenly over the crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Pinch medium pieces of the remaining dough with your fingers and drop them evenly on top of the apples (they will not be covered). Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the topping is browned.

Reduce the rutabaga juice to 1/4 cup or until it reaches the consistency of maple syrup. It is essential to skim the foam from each juice as they reduce. Slowly add the golden beet to the rutabaga juice - this is important as the rutabaga juice is very tannic and the beet juice very sweet. It is easy to overpower the sauce with the sweetness of the beets. Once you have achieved a good balance, add the reduced pork glace and cardamom pods. Simmer until the flavors meld - about 2 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh strainer, then blend in lemon oil with an emersion blender. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place the pre-roasted beets and rutabaga in a pre-heated 375 degree oven. Heat a medium saute pan over a medium flame. Season each tenderloin with salt and pepper. Roll the loins in the mustard seed and oil lightly. Add the tenderloins to the pan and sear each side. Transfer to a pre-heated 375 degree oven for 8 to 12 minutes, depending on the size of the tenderloin. For medium doneness, cook to an internal temperature of 140 degrees. Remove the tenderloins from the pan and rest 5 minutes before slicing. Place the pan back on the fire and deglaze with the Armagnac. Reduce the Armagnac until nearly dry, then add the rutabaga/golden beet sauce. Remove the beets and split in half. Remove the rutabaga and cut into wedges. Arrange the beets and rutabagas in the center of 2 hot plates. Slice each pork loin and arrange against the vegetables on each plate. Sauce each plate, sprinkle with sunflower seeds and top with sunflower sprouts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 2314,&quot;Hines&#39; Classic Burger 8 slices bacon 1 pound ground beef 1/4 cup chopped red onion 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt, such as Lowry&#39;s Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 slices Cheddar 4 slices pepper Jack cheese 4 hamburger buns 12 pickle slices 4 leaves Bibb lettuce 4 slices tomato Mustard, mayonnaise and ketchup, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Place the bacon in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until crispy, about 15 minutes.<br> In a large bowl, combine the beef with the red onions, cilantro and seasoning salt.

Spread the hazelnuts and almonds on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Shake the pan halfway through baking to ensure that the nuts toast evenly. Allow the nuts to cool. Gather the hazelnuts into a kitchen towel and rub them together to remove the skins. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the hazelnuts and almonds with 1/4 cup of the sugar and the cinnamon, and process until it&#39;s the consistency of a fine meal. Add the flour and pulse a few times to combine. Separate and discard the whites of the eggs. Push the egg yolks through a fine-mesh sieve, scraping the yolks off the bottom of the sieve and into the flour mixture. Pulse on and off a few times to combine. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and lemon zest on low 2 to 3 minutes, until softened. Add the remaining sugar and mix on medium, 3 to 4 minutes, until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the almond extract and mix to combine. Turn the mixer off, add the nut mixture, and mix on low until just incorporated. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and flatten into a rectangle, about 1-inch thick. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, 1 to 2 hours or overnight. Divide the dough in 1/2 and return one 1/2 to the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thickness, flouring the surface of the dough as necessary. Using the shaped cutter, cutting as closely together as possible, cut out the cookies. Place them 1-inch apart on 1 to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets to chill until firm, 30 to 45 minutes. Set the scraps aside. Roll and cut out the remaining dough in the same manner. Gather all the scraps together, chill, roll, and cut to make the tops. Using the small cutter, cut out the center s of 1/2 of the cookies and chill until firm, 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust the oven racks to the upper and lower positions and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until firm to the touch and lightly browned, rotating the baking sheets halfway through to ensure even baking. The cookies with the holes may bake more quickly than the others. Allow to cool and dust the perforated cookies with powdered sugar. Flip over the cookies without holes, placing the darker side of the cookie underneath. Spoon about 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of the raspberry jam into the center. Place the perforated cookies, powdered sugar side up, on top of the jam, matching up the edges and pressing gently to spread the jam. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2316,&quot;Turkey Meatballs with Spaghetti Squash in Tomato Sauce 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 pounds spaghetti squash 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 onion, chopped One 16-ounce can San Marzano diced tomatoes One 16-ounce can San Marzano tomato sauce 2 pounds ground turkey meat 1 loaf Italian bread, chopped 1 cup milk 1 cup grated Parmesan 1 bunch fresh basil, large stems removed, chopped 1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Put a rimmed sheet pan on the grill to preheat. Pour the broth into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Add the saffron and keep hot. When the grill is preheated, add the olive oil to the sheet pan. Add the chorizo and cook, tossing occasionally, until browned on the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the onion and bell pepper and sprinkle with some salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to wilt, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, 30 seconds. Add the rice and stir to coat the rice in the oil. Spread the rice with the back of a wooden spoon to make a flat even layer. Add the broth and adjust the heat so the edges are just simmering. Cover with a second inverted sheet pan, making sure the edges line up to create a tight seal. Weight the sheet pan down with the saucepan or a cast-iron skillet. Close the grill and let the rice simmer for 18 minutes. (If your grill has a thermometer, try to keep it between 350 and 375 degrees F.) Check the rice. It should be cooked but still rather al dente. If not, give it a stir and cook a few more minutes. Uncover the grill and increase the heat to medium-high. Scatter the mussels and shrimp over the rice. Cover the grill and cook until the mussels just begin to open, 5 to 7 minutes. (This requires some attention: the rice should crust at the edges but not burn. Stir so that you can look at the rice to make sure, and adjust the heat accordingly.) Scatter the peas and scallions over the top. Cover and grill, checking occasionally, until the mussels and shrimp are cooked through, 8 to 12 minutes more.

Set them on a parchment-lined sheet tray. Lightly score the tops of the puff pastry with a 4-inch round cutter. This will help remove the top of the puff pastry after it is cooked, to create a \\cup. Beat egg then use a pastry brush to brush the tops. Season with sea salt and place into the preheated oven. Bake in oven for 12 to 15 minutes until golden and crispy. Once cooled, cut the \\tops\\ of the \\cups\\ and lay bases out on plates. While the \\cups\\ are baking, make the beurre blanc. In a large, clean saucepan add shallots, white wine, white wine vinegar, fresh thyme and bay leaves. Simmer until reduced by half then season well with salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Strain the sauce, place back over low heat and reduce. Add the cream and stir. Add butter several cubes at a time while stirring until the sauce thickens. Keep warm and set aside. Blanch the peas and carrots. Set a pot of salted water over high heat and bring to a boil. Add carrots first to give them a head start then add the peas briefly to cook the vegetables until tender but still firm - about 2 minutes. Drain and set aside. Clean scallops and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set a large saute pan over high heat and add olive oil. Once heated, add scallops and cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until well browned. Set aside on paper towels. Increase the heat and add the chanterelles and saute. Add carrots and peas to the pan and saute for 1 to 2 minutes until heated through. Add the scallops back to the pan, on top of the vegetables, to heat through. To serve, portion out amongst the pastry cups. Top with a matching pastry lid - rest it just off center so you can see the filling and garnish with chives and a stem of fresh parsley. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 2323,&quot;Toasted Spice Rub Almonds 1 pound shelled almonds, preferably unsalted 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons sea salt, preferably gray salt 3 tablespoons Toasted Spice Rub, recipe follows 1/4 cup fennel seeds 1 tablespoon coriander seeds<br> 1 tablespoon black peppercorns<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes<br> 1/4 cup (1-ounce) pure California chili powder<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon<br> Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Blanch the almonds in boiling water, until the skins peel off.<br> Melt the butter in a large ovenproof skillet over moderate heat and cook until it turns light brown and smells nutty. Add the almonds and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, over moderate heat until the almonds begin to color, about 5 minutes, coat and toss in the spice mix thoroughly. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the almonds are medium-brown, about 15 minutes.<br> Remove from the oven, taste for flavor, add more spice mix or salt, if necessary. Return to the oven for another 5 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a sheet pan; they will crisp as they cool. Store the cooled almonds in an airtight container at room temperature. (See Cook&#39;s Note) Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put in a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients.<br> Toasting freshens spices, releases their oils, and makes them more fragrant, as well as adding a new dimension of flavor. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze.<br> Taste your chili powder and, if too spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chiles are almost sweet, not hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 2324,&quot;Cinnamon Sugar Graham Cupcakes 3 1/4 cups cake flour, sifted 1 tablespoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 1 cup or 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature 1 1/2 cups sugar 5 large egg, separated into 5 yolks and reserving only 3 egg whites, room temperature 2 teaspoons Madagascar bourbon vanilla extract 2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1 1/3 cups whole milk, room temperature Cinnamon Sugar Graham Cream Cheese Icing, recipe follows 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature 1 teaspoon Madagascar bourbon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted Graham cracker crumbs, for garnish Cinnamon sugar graham crackers, for garnish Ground cinnamon, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

With your fingertips, mix until a coarse meal forms. Add the water, all at once, and knead by hand until a ball forms. Transfer to a bowl of an electric mixer with a dough hook and knead until smooth and moist, about 5 minutes, or knead by hand about 15 minutes. Press dough into a 6 by 4 inch rectangle. Wrap with plastic and chill 4 hours or overnight. Soften butter block with your hands or with an electric mixer until pliable enough to roll like doughnut not too soft. The key to rolling butter and dough is they must be warm enough to roll, but not warm enough to combine. The two parts should always remain separate. On a floured board, roll cold dough, from center out, to form a 9 by 6 inch rectangle, keeping the thickness uniform, about 1/2inch thick. Align dough so the length is parallel to the counter. Imagine the dough divided in thirds along its width and spread butter over middle and right thirds, leaving a 1/2 inch margin uncovered on all sides. Fold dough in thirds, first left over middle, then right over left. Press edges together to seal in butter and press out any air. Turn folded dough clockwise a quarter turn. You have now completed one turn. To make second turn, roll dough out again to a 9 by 6 inch rectangle. Fold in thirds again. As a reminder of turns completed, press 2 dots in dough with your fingertips. Wrap in plastic and chill 1/2 hour. Roll, fold, and turn dough two more times. Press the dough with four dots, wrap, and chill 1/2 hour. Repeat the same procedure 2 more times, for a total of 6 turns. Wrap well in plastic and store in refrigerator overnight. Puff pastry may be frozen as long as 3 weeks. To make almond cream, process sugar and almonds in a food processor until fine. Add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, processing after each addition until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and process until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble. The almond cream may be made up to 4 days in advance. 1 egg, lightly beaten Divide puff pastry in half. On a lightly floured board, roll each piece to a 10 inch square. Set aside in refrigerator 1/2 hour. After chilling, assemble tart on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Lightly roll each piece so it returns to a 10inch square. Place one pastry square on pan. Mound softened almond cream in a 5 inch circle about 2 inches high in center of square. Brush egg on exposed pastry. Place second pastry square over almond cream, so corners align. Pressing out from center to release any air, seal in cream by pressing together top and bottom pastry. Cut a small hole in center of top layer using a paring knife. Press out excess air. Chill an additional hour or, preferably, overnight. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place in a 10 inch round bowl over tart and, using a sharp paring knife, trim excess pastry to form a 10 inch circle. Do not drag knife. Press edges again to seal and carefully brush top with egg.

Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet over moderate heat and cook until it foams. In a large bowl, pour the butter over the 12 cups cubed bread and toss to coat. Sprinkle with Parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. Toss to season all of the bread. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet. Bake, stirring once or twice, until the croutons are crisp and lightly colored on the outside but still soft within, about 15 minutes. Let cool. Croutons can be made 1 day ahead and stored in an airtight container. *Michael&#39;s Notes: I use a serrated knife to remove the crust from day-old bread, then switch to a chef&#39;s knife to cut the cubes because it doesn&#39;t tear the bread. Also note that I recommend grating the Parmesan finely so that it will stick to the bread better. For the dressing: Melt the butter in a small skillet over moderately low heat. Add the yellow onion and saute until soft, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the vinegar and stir with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the skillet. Transfer to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. With the machine running, slowly add 1/2 cup of the olive oil, then the water. Transfer to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. For the salad: Heat a large skillet over high heat. When hot, add 1/4 cup olive oil. When the oil begins to smoke, sprinkle in the mushrooms. Don&#39;t stir! Let them sizzle until they have caramelized on the bottom, about 2 minutes. If you toss them too soon, they will release their liquid and begin to steam. When the bottoms are caramelized, toss the mushrooms, reduce the heat to moderate, and continue to cook until well browned. Stir in the thyme and garlic and cook for about 1 minute to release their fragrance. Season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine the croutons, the mushrooms, and the onion dressing. Toss well to coat. Add the celery, red onion, and arugula or spinach and toss again gently. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Grate fresh Parmesan on top and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2365,&quot;J J&#39;s Smoked Gouda Vegetable Soup 10 strips bacon, diced 1 1/2 cups sliced onion 2 or more cloves garlic, mashed and chopped 2 carrots, cut in half lengthwise and sliced 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can diced (or crushed) tomatoes (do not drain) Salt and pepper to taste 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini or Great Northern beans (do not drain) 2 roasted red peppers, sliced 2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans chicken broth 1 small zucchini, sliced and chopped in large pieces 1 small yellow squash, sliced and chopped in large pieces 2 large leaves fresh basil, chopped 12 leaves fresh oregano, chopped 12 (1/2-inch) slices French baguette Vegetable cooking spray Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, to taste Hungarian paprika to taste (optional) 1/2 cup smoked Gouda cheese, diced Instructions: Render bacon slowly in nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until crisp.

Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the beaten yolks, then pour back into the saucepan, whisking, and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, coats the spoon and reaches 180 degrees F on a thermometer, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl or measuring cup; discard the solids. Stir often until the mixture cools to room temperature. Lightly press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. (For faster chilling, set the bowl of custard in a bowl of ice water and stir until cold.) Freeze the mixture in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. (Take care not to over-churn the ice cream or it can have a grainy texture.) Place the ice cream in the freezer to set up for at least 1 hour. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 2372,&quot;\\21\\ Apple Pie 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 6 ounces cold, unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus butter for the pie tin 1/4 to 1/3 cup ice cold water 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 12 large apples such as Granny Smith, peeled, cored, and sliced into eighths (about 14 cups) Juice of 2 lemons (about 1/4 cup) 1/4 cup loosely packed dark brown sugar 1/4 cup loosely packed light brown sugar 1/4 cup Southern Comfort 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 large egg beaten with 2 tablespoons water Instructions: To prepare the dough by hand, combine the flour and salt in a stainless steel bowl and mix well. Add the cold butter cubes and, with a pastry blender, blend in the butter until the mixture begins to resemble a mealy mixture where butter forms peas-size nuggets plainly visible in the flour. Add only enough water to pull the dough together. The water should be added to the flour slowly to ensure that only the minimum amount of water is used. Do not over-mix the dough. When the dough has been mixed just sufficiently to combine the ingredients, form it into a ball and wrap in a piece of plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours. To prepare the filling, melt the butter in a large saute pan until it begins to brown. Add the sliced apples and cook over medium heat until they begin to soften, about 2 to 3 minutes. In a bowl, combine the lemon juice, sugars, Southern Comfort, and cinnamon. Add this mixture to the apples and cook 2 to 3 minutes over medium-high heat until the apples are completely caramelized and covered with all the sugar. Remove filling from the heal and allow to cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. When ready to use, remove the dough from the refrigerator, lightly flour a pastry board and a rolling pin, and unwrap the dough. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and begin to roll out into a circle by rolling evenly outward from the center and turning the dough in small 1/8th turns to keep the rolling even. When the dough is rolled out to an even thickness and is about 12 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick, it is ready to be transferred to a 10-inch pie tin. Lightly butter the tin, partially roll the dough up on the rolling pin, lift the dough and center it in the pie tin and unroll. Roll the second half of the pie dough into a round slightly larger than the pie pan. Fill the bottom crust with the cooked apples using a slotted spoon to drain the apples. Reserve juices if desired, for sauce. Brush an egg wash coating over the lip of the dough. This is where it will be sealed to the top crust. Cover the apples with the top half of the pie dough. Trim any excess from the top crust before using both hands to crimp the edges of the two crust together to seal. With a sharp knife, make several crosshatch slits in the top crust. Brush with the egg wash and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool 20 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream. Reserved juices can be reduced with heavy cream for a sauce for the pie. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2373,&quot;Peach Raspberry Shortcakes 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon sugar, plus extra for sprinkling 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), diced 2 extra-large eggs, lightly beaten 1/2 cup heavy cream, chilled 1 egg beaten with 2 tablespoons water or milk, for egg wash 1 cup heavy cream, chilled 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 ripe peaches, peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced 1 pint raspberries 1 orange zest removed in long strips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Sift the flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, the baking powder, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Blend in the butter at the lowest speed and mix until the butter is the size of peas. Combine the eggs and heavy cream and quickly add to the flour and butter mixture. Mix until just blended. The dough will be sticky. Dump the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Flour your hands and pat the dough out to 3/4-inch thick. You should see lumps of butter in the dough. Cut 6 or 7 biscuits with a 2 3/4-inch fluted cutter and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Brush the tops with the egg wash. Sprinkle with sugar and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the outsides are crisp and the insides are fully baked. Let cool on a wire rack. To assemble, whip the cream and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until soft peaks form. Add the vanilla and continue to beat until the peaks are stiff. Split each shortcake in half crosswise and place the bottom half on a plate. Spoon whipped cream on top, then place the sliced peaches and raspberries on the whipped cream. Garnish with the orange zest, then place the other half of the shortcake on top and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 2374,&quot;General Tso&#39;s Crispy Chicken Sandwich 1/2 cup hoisin sauce 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar or rice vinegar<br> 3 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 3 tablespoons granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch<br> 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs 1 1/2 quarts (6 cups) vegetable oil 1 cup buttermilk<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups cornstarch<br> 1/2 cup self-rising flour<br> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger<br> 3 to 5 dried Szechuan peppercorns, crushed<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 4 large Hawaiian rolls Butter, for the rolls 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds<br> Chinese Slaw, recipe follows Chinese Hot Mustard, recipe follows 2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions 2 carrots, julienned<br> 1 medium head napa cabbage, shredded<br> 1 red Fresno cl, seeds and ribs removed, julienned<br> 1/4 cup rice vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil<br> 1/4 cup boiling water 1/4 cup dry English-style mustard, such as Coleman&#39;s 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1 clove garlic, grated on a rasp grater Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, optional Instructions: For the marinade and chicken: In a bowl, whisk together the hoisin, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar and cornstarch.

Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface; pat and roll out into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on one long side. Brush the clean edge with water, then tightly roll up the dough into a log, starting with a long side and rolling toward the clean edge; pinch the seam to seal. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Slice the dough log into 12 pieces with a sharp knife and arrange cut-side up in the dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350? F. Uncover the rolls and bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the icing: Mix the cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and lemon juice and mix until smooth.

Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and simmer for 7 minutes (for medium-soft yolks). Remove to an ice bath to cool. Peel and set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sugar, chili garlic sauce, star anise and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a simmer and remove from the heat. Add the eggs and let cool until evenly colored a light brown, about 1 hour. (The eggs will keep a day or 2 in the refrigerator.) For the broth: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the neck bones and cook, tossing occasionally, until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ginger, chili garlic sauce, scallions, garlic and 10 cups water. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until slightly reduced (about 8 cups) and flavorful, about 1 hour. Remove the solids with a spider or slotted spoon and discard. For the pork cutlets: Put the cutlets between plastic wrap and pound to between 1/4 and 1/2 inch thick. Season the cutlets with salt and pepper. Put the flour, eggs and panko separately in 3 shallow bowls. Dredge the pork first in the flour, then in the egg and finally in the breadcrumbs. Set the cutlets on a baking sheet, without touching. Heat a large skillet with about 1/2 inch vegetable oil over medium-high heat until an edge of a cutlet sizzles on contact. Add half of the cutlets and cook, turning once, until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove to a wire rack, seasoning lightly with salt and repeat with the remaining pork. Cut into 1-inch slices. For the miso ramen: When ready to serve, combine the miso, mirin, sake, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce and sesame oil in a small bowl and whisk until combined and creamy. Add the mixture to the broth and simmer. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the ramen noodles according to the directions on the package. Drain and divide the ramen among 4 bowls. Ladle the broth over the ramen. For the garnishes: Top with the shredded cabbage and carrots, scallions, sesame seeds, pork cutlets and eggs.

In a small bowl, whisk together the oregano, thyme, 1/2 cup of the olive oil, the juice of 2 lemon halves and a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside. Place a kitchen towel over the top of a cutting board. Place the chicken on the towel breast-side down and locate the backbone. With sharp kitchen shears, cut along one side of the spine followed by the other, then remove the backbone and discard or reserve for stock. Flip the chicken over and lay flat. Press down firmly with your hands on the center of the breast. The breastbone should pop and the chicken should sit relatively flat. Season the chicken all over with 2 tablespoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of pepper. Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to a rimmed sheet pan and distribute evenly. Place the chicken skin-side up in the middle. Rub the chicken&#39;s skin with 3 tablespoons of the oil and herb mixture. Toss the potatoes with 3 tablespoons of the oil and herb mixture. Distribute the potatoes around the chicken on the sheet pan. Roast for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 400 degrees F and continue roasting for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the zucchini, cherry tomatoes and garlic in the remaining oil and herb mixture. Scatter around the sheet pan and roast until the chicken is totally cooked through, an additional 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board. Let it rest while you arrange the potatoes and vegetables on a platter. Separate the chicken into 6 pieces: 2 breasts with wing, 2 thighs and 2 legs. Arrange in the middle of the platter.

Use a ladle to fill the heart shaped molds with chocolate. When the molds are full, empty the chocolate into a bowl. The inside of the molds should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean and place the mold upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, use a wide pastry scraper to clean the edges of each cavity. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Place the cream, corn syrup and fresh passion juice in a pan and scald the mixture. Pour the hot cream mixture over the chopped chocolate and blend until smooth with an immersion hand blender. Add the Alize and the butter and blend until smooth with an immersion hand blender. Allow the mixture to come to 84 degrees. Place the mixture in a piping bag and pipe it into the chocolate filled molds. Let set overnight. To close the bottoms of each cavity, apply tempered chocolate with an offset spatula. Scrape clean and allow to set. When the chocolate has set, invert the mold over a clean dry surface. It may be necessary to rap the mold against the counter to encourage the chocolates to release from the mold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2418,&quot;Clarified Milk Punch 8 Earl Grey tea bags 85 grams granulated sugar<br> 1 cup ruby port<br> 4 fluid ounces aged dark rum (not spiced)<br> 2 fluid ounces Allspice Dram, recipe follows 2 fluid ounces freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1 cup whole milk<br> 1/2 cup allspice berries 2 1/2 cups navy-strength rum 200 grams granulated sugar<br> Instructions: Heat 2 1/4 cups of water to 208 degrees F. If you have an electric kettle with a temperature setting, great. If not, bring the water to a boil in a saucepan, kill the heat and count to 20. Pour the water over the teabags into a quart vessel and steep 3 minutes before removing the bags. (Do not wring out or squeeze the bags.) Add the sugar to the hot tea and stir to dissolve. Then add the port, rum, Allspice Dram, and lemon juice. Cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Pour the milk into a glass pitcher and then follow with the tea mixture. (Yes, it will curdle.) Park on counter for 1 hour. Do not shake, stir or molest in any way. Just let the magic happen. Oh, and make sure the tea goes into the milk, not the other way around. Line a large, fine-mesh sieve with a commercial-sized coffee filter (we like those made for 1.5-gallon machines) and strain the mixture into a wide, 4-quart container. Once completely filtered, typically about 1 hour, transfer to a quart jar or pitcher and chill to serve. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) Store tightly sealed in the refrigerator for up to 2 months. Heat a heavy skillet over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Toast the allspice berries until fragrant, about 1 minute, then roughly crush. Combine the rum and crushed allspice berries in a quart-sized glass jar, seal the lid tightly and give it a good shake. Steep for 10 days. Strain the allspice-infused rum through a fine-mesh sieve into a small saucepan and add the sugar. Heat over low, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is fully dissolved, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature before storing in a glass jar or bottle. Note: Any overproof rum will work here, meaning any rum over 50 percent ABV. But navy-strength rum, typically bottled at 57 percent ABV, is my favorite. Just remember: The higher the ABV of the rum, the higher the ABV of your resulting dram. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 2419,&quot;Bacon Cheeseburgers 4 ounces bacon 1 1/4 pounds ground beef chuck (80/20 blend preferred) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ounces farmhouse Cheddar, dry Jack or Comte, sliced<br> 4 potato buns or kaiser rolls, toasted if desired Lettuce and tomato slices, for topping Instructions:</p><ol><li>Pulse the bacon in a food processor, or chop with a knife, until ground.

Swirl the pan slightly over the heat, until the sugar turns golden. Pour the sugar into an 8-inch metal cake pan, swirl to coat the bottom and sides. The sugar will harden in about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the coconut milk, eggs, rum and remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Strain the custard over the hardened caramel. Scatter over the lime zest and toasted coconut, and swirl a bit with a spoon to blend evenly. Set the cake pan in a roasting pan and add enough boiling water to come halfway up the cake pan. Bake in the water bath until set, about 40 minutes. Cool. Refrigerate the flan at least 4 hours before serving. When ready, dip the bottom of the pan in warm water, place a large plate over the top of the pan, and invert.

Stir frequently, scraping the bottom occasionally, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. (The oil will get very foamy and bubble up from time to time, especially when you first add an ingredient, since a lot of moisture is cooking off.) Add the shrimp and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Add the ham and cook, stirring often, until crisp and slightly darker, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shallot mixture and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Finally, add the liquid mixture to the oil and bring to a boil; adjust the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until mostly dry and the oil separates to the top, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool completely. Transfer to a heatproof airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 2427,&quot;Steamed Striped Bass with Ginger and Scallions One 2- to 3-pound whole striped bass, scaled and gutted (fins and gills removed) Nonstick cooking spray Kosher salt and white pepper<br> 4 Chinese black mushrooms, soaked in warm water until softened, sliced thin<br> 2-inch piece ginger, finely sliced like blades of grass<br> 4 baby bok choy, quartered<br> 1/4 cup (60 ml) water 3 tablespoons (45 ml) thin soy sauce<br> 1 tablespoon (15 ml) chicken bouillon powder<br> 1 tablespoon (15 ml) Shaoxing rice wine<br> 2 teaspoons (10 grams) sugar<br> 1 teaspoon sesame oil<br> 3 scallions, finely sliced like blades of grass 2 tablespoons (30 ml) sesame oil<br> 2 tablespoons (30 ml) canola oil<br> Instructions: For the striped bass: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Spray the bottom of a large baking dish with the cooking spray. Rinse the fish with cold water and pat it dry. Place it in the prepared baking dish. Season the fish with salt and white pepper. Scatter the sliced mushrooms in the dish. Sprinkle the sliced ginger over the fish and arrange the baby bok choy pieces around the fish, like a frame.<br> For the sauce: Stir together the soy sauce, chicken bouillon powder, Shaoxing rice wine, sugar and sesame oil in a small bowl. Pour this sauce over the fish, which will convert to aromatic steam, cooking the fish.<br> Pull a tight layer of plastic wrap over the baking dish and cover tightly with aluminum foil.<br> Bake until the fish reaches an internal temperature of 130 to 135 degrees F; the fish should flake apart gently, and the center should just be turning opaque, 15 to 18 minutes.<br> For after steaming: Check to see that the fish is done. Place the scallions on top of the fish and replace the foil to retain heat and moisture.<br> Combine the canola and sesame oils in a small saucepan and heat them to high until just smoking, about 2 minutes. Remove the foil and carefully drizzle the hot oil over the scallions and fish--it will sizzle. Finish by spooning the sauce over the fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 2428,&quot;Biscuits 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/3 cup powdered milk<br> 5 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 2 teaspoons cream of tartar<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold butter, cut into bits, plus 4 tablespoons butter, melted 1/2 cup shortening<br> 1 1/2 cups buttermilk<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Stir together the flour, powdered milk, baking powder, sugar, cream of tartar and salt in a medium bowl. Using a pastry cutter, cut the chilled butter bits and shortening into the dry mixture until blended thoroughly. Fold in the buttermilk until the dough comes together. On a lightly floured surface, turn out the dough and use your hands to press it into a circle measuring 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut out circles with a biscuit cutter or a glass. Place the biscuits in cast-iron skillets, then brush the tops with the melted butter. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2429,&quot;Crispy Salmon Fillets One 1.5-kilogram/3.3-pound salmon side 1/4 cup unsalted butter (56 grams) 4 cups panko breadcrumbs 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons dried herbs (such as Herbs de Provence or Italian seasoning) Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 eggs 3/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Nonstick cooking spray Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Prepare the side of salmon by cutting away the thinner belly fat and picking out any pin bones. To remove the skin, cut the meat away from the skin with a long knife starting at the tail end. Firmly hold the skin in one hand, hold the knife at a low angle, and continue slicing between the skin and meat until you reach the end. Cut the salmon into 8 to 10 equal portions and set aside in the fridge. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and add in the panko, garlic powder and herbs. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the panko is golden brown. Transfer the panko into a shallow dish and allow to cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, in a separate shallow dish, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and Dijon with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Retrieve the salmon from the fridge and, using a paper towel, dry off the outside of each fillet. Dip the salmon into the egg mixture, being sure to coat the entire surface, then press into the panko to coat and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. At this point, you can cook the salmon or cover lightly with plastic and place the full baking sheet in the freezer. Once the salmon is frozen, transfer to a heavy-duty freezer bag and store in the freezer for up to 3 months. To cook the fillets, either fresh or frozen, preheat your oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and lightly grease a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or line with parchment paper. Arrange the fillets on the prepared pan, leaving a few inches of space between each and bake the fresh fillets for 15 to 18 minutes, or the frozen for 22 to 25 minutes, or until cooked through and the fish flakes easily with a fork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 2430,&quot;Killer Inside Out Burger with Worcestershire Tomato Ketchup 1/4 pound bacon, chopped 1/2 cup minced red onions 3 tablespoons fresh uncooked chorizo, casing removed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds ground chuck, 80/20 mix 1/2 pound Swiss cheese, thinly sliced, about 8 slices 4 kaiser rolls, split and toasted Worcestershire Tomato Ketchup, recipe follows 3 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup diced red onion 8 Roma tomatoes, skinned, seeded, cut into 1/4-inch pieces 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh dill Salt and freshly ground black pepper Pinch allspice Pinch celery salt Pinch mustard seed Instructions: In a medium pan over medium to high heat, add bacon and onions and cook until the bacon is rendered but not crisp. Add the chorizo and cook until done. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Divide ground chuck into 8 equal parts. Form into a loose ball, and create 4-inch patties. Layer 1 piece of cheese onto the center of 1 patty. Top with 1/4 bacon mixture, another slice of cheese, then add another patty on top and gently seal edges and form into a patty, about 4 inches wide and 1 1/2 inches high. Repeat with the remaining patties to make a total of 4 large patties. Heat a medium saute pan over medium heat. Place all 4 patties in the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on 1 side, then gently turn over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, cover and pop it in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven, place burgers onto rolls and serve with Worcestershire Tomato Ketchup. Worcestershire Tomato Ketchup: In medium saute pan over medium heat, add oil and onions. Cook until brown and caramelized.

Remove the potatoes from the water. Grate the potatoes and onion with a food processor fitted with the grating blade. Don&#39;t press too hard on the potatoes going in -- just enough to get them through. Transfer the potatoes and onion to a fine-mesh strainer; squeeze out all the water into a bowl. Let the potato starch settle, then pour out as much water as possible, leaving the starch in the bowl. Add the potato-onion mixture to the bowl and mix in the egg, flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet with a thin layer of vegetable oil over medium heat. Scoop large spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the pan and flatten them out (thin pancakes yield crispy ones). Fry until golden on the bottom, then gently flip and fry the other side, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. (If you have to wait to serve, re-crisp them on a baking sheet lined with clean paper towels in a 350 degrees F oven.) Serve with applesauce, or try my family&#39;s favorite toppings: My great-grandmother put cinnamon in applesauce to serve with hers. My grandfather loved his with heaps of cold sour cream. My grandmother served them with poached pears. My mother tops them with tart, chunky homemade applesauce. My brother, Willie, loves his plain with sugar.

Add the oil, lemon zest, and cumin (dividing equally if you are using bags). Give a good stir and then add the lamb. Cover the dish or tie up the bags and leave, turning or squishing respectively at half time, as long as you&#39;ve got; frankly, though, it should be for at least 10 minutes and preferably not in the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put a non-stick or cast-iron pan on the stove. Remove the noisettes from the marinade; you don&#39;t need to wipe then dry, just brush off the bits of onion. Sear each side for 1 to 2 minutes, then transfer to a baking pan and then to the preheated oven for 10 minutes. The meat should be right for pink, but not bloody, you may need a bit longer if the meat started off very cold. You will need to check for yourself and when cooked as you want, remove to a warmed plate. For the sauce, put the tahini in a bowl and add the garlic and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon, adding the lemon juice as you do; it will seize up here, but don&#39;t worry because it will loosen later. Slowly add some water ( I find I can use about 1/2 cup), pouring from the measuring cup so that only a little goes in at a time, and keep stirring. When you have a smooth mixture the consistency of heavy cream, stop adding water. Put into a bowl with a spoon and sprinkle with the additional ground cumin. For the spinach: Thaw it in the microwave according to the package&#39;s directions and then cook briefly to warm, about 1 minute more. Remove from the microwave and place onto a clean plate. Drizzle with the olive oil and then top with the toasted sesame seeds. Serve the lamb noisettes with the spinach and the garlicky tahini on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 2445,&quot;Breakfast Frittata Squares 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 pound bulk sausage<br> 10 ounces fresh spinach<br> 1 dozen large eggs<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces Cheddar, grated<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Place remaining ingredients in saucepan and place over high heat. Cook to a caramel color while continuously stirring with a wooden spoon. The mixture will become very thick. Pull out the vanilla beans and set aside. Lightly spray the work surface with vegetable cooking spray. If you would like to use metal rulers so the brittle will be rolled to an even thickness, set them into place now. Immediately pour the mixture onto the marble or granite slab (you can also use a parchment paper lined baking sheet). Place a piece of parchment paper over the hot brittle and use a rolling pin to roll the peanut brittle into a 3/8-inch thick flat layer. Use a sharp chef&#39;s knife to partially cut the brittle while it is still warm. Allow it to cool completely before coating it with chocolate. It is ready to eat now or you can add chocolate to the outside of the brittle. To cover with chocolate: You can use a variety of methods to apply chocolate to the brittle. You could simply place some chocolate into a cornet and drizzle the chocolate over the cool brittle. You could also use a dipping fork to dip each piece of brittle in the chocolate. Whatever method you use, allow the chocolate to set and it is ready to serve. From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations. Cut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of 1 hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side. Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2453,&quot;Nougat Montilimar 2 2/3 cups almonds, toasted 1 cup pistachios, toasted 2 1/2 cups sugar 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons corn syrup 9 tablespoons water 1 3/4 cups honey 1/3 cup egg whites (or 1 1/2 whites) Cornstarch, for dusting 8 to 12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered Instructions: Toast the almonds and pistachios at 325 degrees F for 20 minutes on a baking sheet. Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan and cook to 330 degrees F. When the sugar reaches 265 degrees F, start to heat the honey in a separate pan and bring it to a low boil. Simultaneously, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks with an electric mixer, being careful not to overwhisk. With the mixer still on high, gradually add the honey, pouring it down the side of the bowl. Continue to whisk. When the sugar reaches 330 degrees F, pour it over the honey meringue. Mix for 5 minutes at medium speed. Switch to the paddle and continue mixing for another 5 minutes. Using a spatula, incorporate the warm nuts. This will be sticky. Apply cooking spray to parchment lined sheet pan. Pour the nougat onto the parchment paper and flatten or spread to 3/4-inch thick with cornstarch-dusted hands or rolling pin. Rest overnight at room temperature. Cut to desired sized pieces and dip half in chocolate or drizzle chocolate over the top. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 2454,&quot;Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cereal Treats Nonstick cooking spray, for the parchment and spatula 6 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> One 10-ounce bag mini marshmallows<br> One 18-ounce box peanut butter crunch cereal, such as Peanut Butter Cap&#39;n Crunch<br> 1 cup honey-roasted peanuts<br> 6 ounces semisweet chocolate chips, melted<br> Instructions: Line a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with a piece of parchment paper, leaving 1 inch of paper hanging over each side of the dish. This will help with removing the treats later. Spray the parchment paper with nonstick spray. In a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the marshmallows and cook, stirring continuously, until the marshmallows are melted and the butter is incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and quickly add the cereal and peanuts; stir to combine. Transfer the cereal mixture to the prepared baking dish. Lightly coat a spatula with cooking spray, then use it to spread out the cereal mixture evenly. Put the melted chocolate in a plastic sandwich bag (or pastry bag), cut off one corner and drizzle over the top of the cereal treats. Refrigerate, uncovered, until set, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cereal treats using the parchment paper and cut into 24 bars. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 2455,&quot;The Cuke Cocktail 2 large cucumbers, peeled, seeded and rough chop (reserve peels for garnish) Ice 1 cup vodka 1 lemon, juiced Dash salt 3 sprigs mint Instructions: In a food processor or blender blitz the cucumbers until a smooth puree.

Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl and set aside. Generously season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of the oil to the skillet and fry the steak over medium heat, turning once, until browned, about 6 minutes per side for medium. Transfer the steak to a serving platter and cover to keep warm. Add the bourbon to the skillet and, over medium heat, scrape up any bits that cling to the pan. Allow the liquor to simmer until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add the onions and the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and stir until the butter is melted. Reduce the heat and gently simmer until the onions are heated through, about 2 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and stir in any juices that have run off from the steak. To serve, cut the steak into 1/4-inch-thick slices and top with the onions. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 2457,&quot;Baked Teriyaki Wings with Blue Cheese Dressing 1/2 stick of butter 2 pounds pre-cut chicken wings Garlic salt 1 1/2 cups Teriyaki sauce Blue cheese dressing Pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
