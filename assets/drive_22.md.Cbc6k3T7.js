on here, and it's all good.","designation":"Cardinal Richard"},{"country":"us","description":"made from a mix of vineyards across the napa valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity.","designation":"Founding Farmers"},{"country":"cl","description":"initially, this carmen√®re smells green and minty, with a heavy herbal blast. airing settles things down in front of a fresh palate with thorough body and build. oak and salted-meat flavors with black fruits finish woody, toasty and herbal.","designation":"Envero Gran Reserve"},{"country":"pt","description":"this super-rich wood-aged wine is ripe with tropical fruits and packed with toast flavors. it is already mature with an attractive oxidative edge from the new barrels that adds complexity to the fruitiness. it is impressive‚Äîmaybe too powerful‚Äîbut certainly a serious expression of what the douro can do with white wines. drink now.","designation":"Ant√≥nia Adelaide Ferreira"},{"country":"es","description":"flower petal, mineral and blackberry aromas solidify the bouquet on this excellent tempranillo. the palate is big and chewy, with fine balance and driving flavors of cherry, plum, vanilla and oak resin. with a finish that's bone dry and focused, this ribera wine is ready to drink but can last another 5‚Äì8 years in a good cellar.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"pt","description":"oily-textured wine, flavored with mango and peaches. it's so soft and unctuous that freshness seems to have been left behind. in its place is the ripest fruit giving an open texture and an opulent aftertaste.","designation":"Fitapreta Branco"},{"country":"it","description":"aromas of toast, underbrush and mature plum lead the nose on this medium-bodied red. the palate delivers black cherry, roasted coffee bean, black pepper and grilled herb alongside bracing tannins. the fruit is already dried up so drink this soon.","designation":"Otre"},{"country":"us","description":"lovely aromas of bramble berries, cassis, fennel and baking spice give way to similar notes on the palate. there is also a lovely cedar flavor that comes into play. the tannins are smooth and well integrated, while the medium-length finish offers a bright acidic lift.","designation":"Adagio"},{"country":"fr","description":"like the la louv√©e, this wine is plummy and superripe, wrapped in toasty, cedary oak. it's savory as well, with meaty notes carried along by waves of richness. the finish is lined with mouthcoating tannins, suggesting a few years of cellaring are warranted. drink 2018‚Äì2030.","designation":"Les Ruchets"},{"country":"us","description":"dried red cherries, turned earth and wild herbs show on the nose of this bottling from the vineyard that winemaker stephen dooley shares with the talley and kynsi wineries. tangy montmorency cherries show strongly on the sip along with a thyme-lavender-rosemary potpourri touch, which is an intriguing combo that lingers long on the finish.","designation":"Stone Corral Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"here's a cortese-based white wine that rests on the lees for extra texture and richness. the wine is redolent of peach, apricot, honey and exotic fruit. it feels fresh and linear on the close.","designation":"White Label"},{"country":"us","description":"this wine shows unusually prominent aromas and flavors of dried rice that are followed by wilted flowers, dried leaves, cocoa and dark fruit. it doesn't all come together.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"de","description":"beautifully aromatic, this kabinett abounds with luscious peach and honeysuckle perfumes. on the palate, the flavors veer toward peach marmalade. it packs a punch, but stays brisk and delicate in texture, making it refreshingly easy to savor.","designation":"√úrziger W√ºrzgarten Kabinett"},{"country":"us","description":"whiffs of nuts, dusty mineral and lemon are demure on the nose, but become more concentrated on the palate of this dry white. a blend of chardonnay, riesling and gr√ºner veltliner, it's more minerally than fruity, but refreshing and brisk.","designation":"Gratitude"},{"country":"us","description":"a dark color and big, brooding flavors make this wine bolder than most pinots. the aromas are full of toasty, spicy oak, with more meaty, rich and almost earthy flavors that are very concentrated. with more sips, more complex accents of tea and forest floor add complexity.","designation":"Split Rail Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"note the vintage‚Äî2009. this is already moving into maturity, loaded with berry-pie fruit flavors, especially blueberry. it's soft and drinking well, with cinnamon and baking spices in abundance. don't delay‚Äîenjoy it over the next couple of years.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"cl","description":"spicy, toasty, blackened aromas of cassis and blackberry feed into a fresh, agile, free-moving palate. this bordeaux-modeled blend tastes of herbal cherry, plum and pepper, while the finish is zesty and blackened in flavor, with crisp acidity creating length. drink through 2022.","designation":"Rivalta Limited Selection"},{"country":"us","description":"sourced principally from the excellent artz vineyard on red mountain, this blend of 78% sauvignon blanc and 22% s√©millon is ripe and lush, almost to the point of tasting sweet. no residual sugar was listed, but in terms of flavor, it's hard to ignore. if you like that richness, there is a creamy, milk-and-honey flavor, along with toasty notes.","designation":"Mistura Blanco"},{"country":"us","description":"charred oak, barbecue smoke and a hint of prune detract somewhat in this tart, herbal wine that offers a suggestion of cola. it finishes somewhat flat.","designation":"Mounts Family Vineyard Old
