Unroll and press the pie crusts into two 9-inch tart pans. If using rectangular pans, just trim one-third of each crust and press the pieces together to fit. Then, use your pointer finger to press the dough into the sides of the tart pan. Use a knife to remove the excess crust along the top edges and discard the scraps. Using a fork, prick the bottom of the crust a few times to allow for venting (maybe 3 pricks per quadrant). Chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Prebake the crusts. Spray the shiny side of 2 pieces of aluminum foil with a bit of nonstick spray and press into the tart shells, sprayed side down. Fill with dried beans or pie weights and bake until the edges are golden and the sides are set, about 15 minutes. Remove the foil and beans and bake another 10 to 12 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Make the pesto. Blend the parsley, basil, thyme, garlic, Parmesan, almonds, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a food processor until the ingredients resemble a rough paste. Taste the pesto and season with salt and pepper, if needed. To finish, slowly drizzle the olive oil into the feed tube while blending. Assemble and bake the tarts. Divide the pesto equally and, using a rubber spatula, evenly spread it over the bottom of each prepared crust. Starting around the outer edges, place the tomatoes over the pesto, overlapping each slice slightly as you move around the tart pan. Then make a smaller circle of overlapping slices within the starter ring. Continue until the entire pan is covered in circles of tomato slices. Repeat for the second tart. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over the top of each tart and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the tomatoes appear roasted in texture and the edges of the crust are golden brown. If the dough browns too quickly, tent the edges with foil. Garnish the tarts and serve. Remove the tarts from their rings and sprinkle Parmesan on top. Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 32482,&quot;SL&#39;s Spaghetti 4 tablespoons olive oil 4 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1 package pre-sliced mushrooms 1 jar pre-peeled garlic cloves 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef 1 jar mushroom marinara sauce 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning 2/3 cup red wine (Merlot or Cabernet) 1 box spaghetti noodles Salt Instructions: Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl to remove the ground caramel corn. Whisk in the butter and vanilla until smooth. Pour the mixture into 8 small bowls. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of each pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours. Top with the remaining caramel corn and the peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32484,&quot;The Best Cornbread Dressing Nonstick cooking spray 2 cups stone-ground yellow cornmeal 2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1/4 cup granulated sugar 4 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 3 teaspoons kosher salt 14 tablespoons (1 3/4 sticks) unsalted butter 2 cups buttermilk 1/2 cup whole milk 4 large eggs, lightly beaten 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for the pan 1 large onion, medium dice 4 stalks celery, medium dice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 large eggs, lightly beaten Chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves, for serving Instructions: For the cornbread: preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish generously with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a large bowl until combined. Put the butter in a 4-cup liquid measuring cup or a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30 second intervals until completely melted, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool slightly, then whisk in the buttermilk, whole milk and eggs until smooth. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and stir until just combined with no lumps remaining. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking dish. Bake until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. (The cornbread can be made one day in advance. After cooling completely, wrap the pan tightly with plastic wrap and store at room temperature.) Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Once the cornbread is completely cool, run a small offset spatula around the edges of the pan, then invert it onto a cutting board and cut into 1-inch cubes. Transfer to 2 rimmed baking sheets and spread into an even layer. Bake, rotating the trays halfway through, until the cornbread cubes are crisp at the edges and almost completely dried out, about 40 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and let cool completely. (This step can be done up to 24 hours in advance. Store the cooled cornbread cubes in an airtight container or resealable plastic bag until ready to use.) Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish generously with butter. For the dressing: melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic, sage, thyme and poultry seasoning and cook until fragrant, 2 minutes more. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the cornbread cubes, chicken broth and eggs to the bowl and toss gently until the vegetables are evenly dispersed and the bread is very moist (do not overwork or the cornbread will fall apart). Transfer to the prepared baking dish and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake until warmed through, about 30 minutes. Uncover, then return to the oven and bake until lightly browned and crisp at the edges, about 20 minutes more. Let sit for 10 minutes, then top with chopped parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 32485,&quot;Disco Fries 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup beef stock<br> 1 tablespoon sherry<br> 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds frozen crinkle-cut French fries, such as Alexia 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br> 3/4 cup milk<br> 2 ounces white Cheddar, shredded<br> 2 ounces Gruyere cheese, shredded<br> 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the gravy: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook the flour until dark brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the stock and cook, whisking, until the mixture is smooth and thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in the sherry, Worcestershire, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper, adjusting the seasoning to taste. Remove from the heat and cover by pressing a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the gravy, taking care to cover it completely to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside. For the fries: Bake the French fries according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. For the cheese sauce: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook until the mixture resembles sand, about 3 minutes. Add the milk and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture begins to boil and thicken, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the Cheddar and Gruyere and continue to cook, stirring, until the cheese is fully melted, another 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Worcestershire, 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste and remove from the heat. Cover in the same fashion as the gravy and set aside until the French fries are ready. When the French fries are ready, transfer them to a serving platter. Drizzle the fries with the warm gravy and then with the warm cheese sauce.

Butter the bottoms and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans; dust with flour, and tap out the excess. Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, making sure the batter is well mixed before adding the next egg. Beat in the vanilla until blended. Alternate folding the flour mixture and the milk into the butter mixture with a spatula, adding the flour in three additions and the milk in two, starting and ending with the flour, until just smooth. (The batter may look slightly curdled as you mix it, but this is not a problem.) Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are golden and the centers spring back to the touch, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pans about 10 minutes, turn out onto cooling racks and let cool completely. Turn the cakes over, and poke the tops all over with the tines of a fork. Generously brush the tops with the liqueur, letting it soak in before brushing on more. For the frosting: While the cakes cool, bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Set a large heatproof bowl over it (do not let the bowl touch the water), add the egg whites and sugar and whisk until the mixture is warm and the sugar has dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan, and beat the mixture with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, 4 to 7 minutes. Beat in the butter a few pieces at a time, and continue beating until the frosting is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. (Don&#39;t worry if the mixture becomes soupy or looks separated; keep beating and it will come together.) Stir the Kahlua and instant coffee together until dissolved, and beat into the frosting with the mixer running on low speed. Increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. To assemble: Place 1 cake layer right-side up on a cake plate or stand, and spread with 1 cup of the frosting. Top with the second cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32497,&quot;Chocolate Doughnut Glaze 1/2 cup unsalted butter 1/4 cup whole milk, warmed 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted Instructions: Combine butter, milk, corn syrup, and vanilla in medium saucepan and heat over medium heat until butter is melted.

Serve with berries, plain yogurt and drizzle with additional honey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 32504,&quot;Fish Taco Wraps 1/2 cup sour cream 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> Juice of 2 limes (1/4 cup) 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 green cabbage, sliced (about 8 cups)<br> 1/2 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves, chopped<br> Canola oil, for frying<br> 1 pound catfish or other firm white fish fillets, cut into 1-by-2-inch pieces (about 24 total)<br> 3 teaspoons taco seasoning<br> 1 cup breadcrumbs<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 large egg<br> 1/4 cup pilsner or lager beer<br> 1/4 cup hot sauce, plus additional for assembly and serving<br> Four 10-inch tortillas, such as flour, spinach or sun-dried tomato 1 avocado, sliced<br> 1 cup crumbled tortilla chips<br> 1/2 cup thinly sliced radishes<br> Instructions: Combine 1/4 cup sour cream, the mayonnaise, lime juice, cayenne, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the cabbage and cilantro and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat 1/2 inch of the oil in a cast-iron skillet to 345 degrees F. Lay out the fish pieces and pat dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle them with salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon taco seasoning. Combine the breadcrumbs, flour and baking powder in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Combine the egg, beer, hot sauce and remaining 2 teaspoons of taco seasoning in a second bowl. Dip the fish in the egg mixture, letting any excess drip off, and dredge in the flour mixture. Working in batches, fry in the hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes total. Remove with a slotted spoon or tongs and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt. Lay out 1 tortilla on your work surface. Pile the following ingredients on top of each other in the middle of the tortilla in this order: 1 cup slaw, 6 pieces of the fried fish, a quarter of the avocado slices, a quarter of the crumbled tortilla chips and a quarter of the radishes. Smear 1 tablespoon of the remaining sour cream on the tortilla next to the avocado and add a few dashes of hot sauce; this will act as the glue to keep help keep everything together. Carefully roll up the tortilla into a burrito and place seam-side down on your work surface. Insert 6 evenly-spaced skewers crosswise through the roll. Using a serrated knife, trim and discard the very ends of the roll (or eat them), and then slice between the skewers to create 6 skewered rounds. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 32505,&quot;Chicken Cordon Bleu 4 chicken breasts skinless and boneless 4 thin slices prosciutto di Parma 1/2 pound Gruyere, grated 1/4 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup panko bread crumbs 4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only 1 clove garlic, peeled and finely minced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 eggs Extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay the chicken breast between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet, gently pound the chicken to 1/4-inch thickness. Remove the top sheet of plastic and lay 2 slices of prosciutto neatly over the top to cover the breast and sprinkle a quarter of the cheese over the prosciutto. Tuck in the sides of the breast and roll up tight like a jellyroll inside the plastic wrap. Squeeze the log gently to seal and twist both ends tight to form a nice log. Repeat with remaining chicken. Season the flour with salt and pepper. Mix the bread crumbs with thyme, garlic and kosher salt, pepper, and melted butter. The butter will help the crust brown. Beat together the eggs and season so the flour, the eggs and the crumbs are all seasoned. Remove the plastic wrap. Lightly dust the chicken with flour, dip in the egg mixture and gently coat in the bread crumbs. Lightly coat a baking pan with olive oil and carefully transfer the roulades onto it. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until browned and cooked through. Cut into pinwheels and serve on top of Brussels Sprout Hash with Chicken Jus and Cranberry Chutney, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32506,&quot;Venetian Seafood Salad: Insalata di Frutti di Mare Veneziana 1 celery stalk 1 medium carrot 1 small onion, halved 1 bay leaf 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 1 lemon) 1 teaspoon kosher salt 2 quarts water 1 pound cleaned calamari, cut into 1-inch-thick rings 1/2 pound sea or bay scallops, foot removed 1 pound medium to large shrimp 1 pound octopus 1 cup julienned tender celery 1 cup julienned carrots 1/2 cup seeded and julienned red bell pepper 1/2 cup seeded and julienned yellow bell pepper 1 scallion (white part only), julienned 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves 2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped 6 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 2 lemons) or lime juice (about 3 limes) 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 6 to 8 cups baby lettuce Instructions: To poach the seafood, you will need a large saucepan fitted with a colander insert. In the bottom of the pan, combine the celery, carrot, onion, bay leaf, lemon juice, salt, and water. Bring to a boil. Place the calamari in the colander and cook in the simmering water for 2 minutes. Remove from the water, transfer to a large bowl, and set aside. Place the scallops in the colander and cook until opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the water and transfer to the bowl with the calamari (large sea scallops may be cut in half horizontally after cooking; bay scallops may be left whole). Place the shrimp in the colander and cook until pink, about 3 minutes. Remove from the water. Peel, devein, and cut in half horizontally, adding them to the bowl with the calamari and scallops. Remove the colander from the pan and place the octopus directly in the saucepan, adding more water if necessary to completely cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and gently simmer until tender, about 40 to 50 minutes. Transfer the octopus to a bowl and rinse under cold running water until octopus is completely cooled, about 5 minutes. Use your fingers and a small paring knife to remove the outer skin. Discard the hard mouth and head sac. Cut the tentacles and octopus on the bias into 1-inch pieces and add to the bowl with the other seafood. To prepare the salad, toss the julienned celery, carrots, bell peppers, scallion, parsley, basil, and garlic together in a serving bowl. Add the seafood and toss. Add the lemon juice, vinegar, and olive oil and toss well. Season with the salt and generous grindings of pepper. Arrange 1 cup of lettuce on each serving plate. Top with equal portions of the seafood and vegetable mixture, and serve immediately. Variations: 6 to 8 steamed mussels may be added to the basic recipe and tossed with the other seafood. To extend the recipe and add a new texture dimension, 1/2 cup cubed, peeled, cooked Idaho potatoes and/or 1/2 cup cooked or canned (drained and rinsed) cannelini beans may be added to the basic recipe. Although it isn&#39;t traditional, I like this salad with a hint of chopped cilantro, about 2 teaspoons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 32507,&quot;Artichoke Pasta Salad 4 cups cooked bow tie pasta, cooled 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 3 tablespoons Herb Oil, recipe follows 1 cup grape tomatoes, split 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano 1 cup roughly chopped roasted chicken 1 cup roughly chopped marinated artichokes Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 bunch parsley 1/2 cup packed fresh basil 1/2 bunch fresh thyme 1/2 cup packed fresh oregano 1/2 orange, zested 1 whole dried arbol cl 1 teaspoon whole black pepper corns 2 cups canola oil 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: In a large bowl toss all of the ingredients. Serve or store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. In a 1-quart mason jar, place all of the herbs, zest, cl, and peppercorns. Pour both oils into a saucepan and heat to 200 degrees F. Pour the hot oils into the jar and cover with a kitchen towel. Let stand overnight. Place cheesecloth over the top of the jar and replace the outer rim of the lid. Invert and strain oil into desired container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 32508,&quot;Crawfish Beignets with Spicy Remoulade 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 lemon, zested 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped or minced 1 1/2 cups cooked and chopped crawfish tails 3 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley leaves 3 dashes hot sauce (recommended: Louisiana, Tabasco or your favorite) 1 to 1 1/2 cups water or shrimp/seafood stock Canola or peanut oil 1 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup Creole mustard 1/4 cup prepared horseradish, drained 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon salt, plus more for seasoning 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Dash cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley leaves 1/4 cup chopped capers 2 green onions, chopped (green and white part) Instructions: Mix together all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add the lemon zest, garlic, crawfish, parsley and hot sauce. Mix gently to combine. Add the water or stock slowly until a loose dough is formed. Set aside for 15 minutes. In a deep-fryer or heavy-bottomed pot, heat enough canola or peanut oil to come halfway up the sides of the pot, to 350 degrees F. Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon dough into hot oil and cook in batches until deep golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt while still hot. Let temperature of oil return to 350 degrees F between batches. Whisk the mayonnaise, mustard, horseradish, lemon juice, salt, pepper and cayenne together in a medium bowl until well blended. Stir in the parsley, capers and green onions and mix well. Refrigerate until ready to use. Transfer the beignets to a serving platter and serve with the remoulade sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32509,&quot;Compound Butter 1 pound butter 3 to 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped 1 tablespoon thyme, chopped 1 tablespoon sage, chopped 1 tablespoon rosemary, chopped Instructions: Chop the butter into uniform chunks using the dough scraper.<br> Place the oil into the food processor and add the chives. Process until the chives are finely chopped. Add the remaining herbs and blend until the herbs have colored the oil. Using the whisk attachment, whip the butter in the mixer?s work bowl at medium speed until it softens and lightens in color, about 5 to 7 minutes.<br> Add the herb oil to the butter and beat for another 2 minutes until oil is fully incorporated. Remove butter from bowl and spoon onto parchment paper or plastic wrap. Roll into a log, using the edge of a baking sheet to form a tight log.

Coat a shallow roasting pan with nonstick cooking spray. Season chicken all over with salt and black pepper and place in prepared pan. Brush mustard all over tops of chicken. Then spread with goat cheese. Place macadamia nuts in a plastic bag and smash with the flat side of a meat mallet or bottom of a heavy skillet until finely crushed. Sprinkle nuts over goat cheese. Cover pan with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake 5 to 10 more minutes, until cheese is golden brown and chicken is cooked through. While chicken is baking, cook couscous according to package directions. Fluff with a fork, and stir in pimentos, parsley and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve half of the chicken and all of the couscous. Reserve remaining chicken for the chopped salad, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 32511,&quot;Pina Colada Scallop Brochettes 12 large sea scallops 1 (10-ounce) can frozen pina colada mix, thawed (recommended: Bacardi) 1/2 cup light rum 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon crushed garlic (recommended: Christopher Ranch) 12 ounces fresh pineapple wedges, cut into 1-inch pieces 1/2 cup shredded sweetened coconut, toasted Instructions: Soak 8 bamboo skewers in water for at least 1 hour. In a large zip-top bag, combine scallops, thawed pina colada mix, rum, salt, pepper, and garlic. Squeeze out air and seal bag. Gently massage to thoroughly combine ingredients. Marinate in refrigerator 15 minutes or up to 30 minutes. Do not marinate longer then this or the marinade will begin to cook the scallops. Set up grill for direct cooking or a grill pan over medium heat. Lightly oil the grate when ready to start cooking. Remove scallops from marinade and discard marinade. Thread 3 scallops through 4 skewers and thread the pineapple wedges onto the remaining skewers. Season with salt and pepper. Note: If grilling indoors on a grill-pan, pat the scallops dry before grilling. Spread toasted coconut on a plate; set aside. Place brochettes on hot oiled grill and cook until scallops are opaque and just cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Grill the pineapple until there are nice grill marks and fruit softens a bit, about 4 minutes. Remove from grill and immediately press both sides of brochettes into toasted coconut. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros, Vermentino]&quot; 32512,&quot;Bistecca Fiorentina 1 3/4 pounds beef cut from loin with fillet and bone steak Instructions: Prepare the grill so that the charcoal is well lit and red hot without flames. When the grill, slightly inclined, is very hot, put on the meat and grill it without turning and without piercing it in any way. Another secret is to cook it very quickly so as to sear and seal in the meat juices. After 5 to 6 minutes, turn the steak over using a spatula and season with salt and pepper. At the end, the meat should be very well done on the outside. It does stay tasty and tender on the inside. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec]&quot; 32513,&quot;Steak au Poivre with a Mushroom, Green Peppercorn, and Dijon Sauce and Pommes Frites with a Garlic Aioli Dipping Sauce and a Fresh Vegetable Relish 1/4 cup whipping cream 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons green peppercorns, packed in brine Salt Pommes Frites, recipe follows 2 (12 to 16-ounce) boneless New York cut shell steaks, tenderized 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard Coarsely ground black pepper, to cover both sides of steak Olive oil, for sauteing Salt, to taste 4 tablespoons whole, unsalted butter 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup shallots, minced 8 ounces white mushrooms, sliced 1 cup beef stock Garlic Aioli Sauce, recipe follows Fresh Vegetable Relish, recipe follows 2 to 3 large russet potatoes Vegetable oil, for frying Salt and pepper to taste 1 to 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 lemons, halved 4 to 6 egg yolks* Olive oil 1 to 2 celery stalks, diced 4 Roma tomatoes, diced 1 cucumber, diced 1 red onion, diced 1 to 2 carrots, diced Feta cheese, crumbled Fresh dill, chopped Instructions: Use a meat mallet to slightly reduce the thickness of each steak. Spread both sides of each steak with a thin coating of Dijon mustard. Sprinkle with salt and cover both sides with coarsely ground black pepper. Heat olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat and cook the steaks 3 to 4 minutes on each side. The steaks should be rare at this point. Set them aside and lightly cover them so they stay warm. Do not wash out the pan.<br> Mushroom, Green Peppercorn and Dijon sauce: Heat the butter in a medium sized saute pan over medium-high heat and saute the garlic and shallots for approximately 1 minute. Add the mushrooms, raise the heat to high, and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Add beef stock, cream, and mustard, and then reduce the sauce by 1/2. Once the sauce is made, reheat the skillet, in which the steaks were cooked, to medium-high heat. Add the steaks and cook for another 2 minutes on each side for a medium-rare steak. Transfer them to dinner plates, which have been coated with the mushroom Dijon sauce. Once you plate the steaks, spoon more of the sauce on top of each steak. Serve with Pommes Frites, Aioli, and Vegetable Relish. Thoroughly clean the outer surface of the russets and peel the skin using a vegetable peeler. Slice the potatoes lengthwise into thick strips. Pour enough vegetable oil in a pot to cover the potato slices. Once the oil is hot, carefully put the potato strips into the pot and fry them until they are brown and crispy. Remove the potatoes from the pot and drain the excess oil onto paper towels. Salt and pepper, to taste, while the potatoes are still hot. Serve with a fresh Garlic Aioli Dipping Sauce. Finely mince 1 or 2 cloves of garlic in a food processor. Add in the egg yolks and then squeeze the juice from a couple of lemons into the processor bowl. Blend the ingredients together until they fully integrate. While the mixture processes, slowly drizzle in olive oil until the sauce emulsifies. Dice all of the ingredients and combine them in a medium sized bowl. Stir the diced vegetables together, until they are fully integrated. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah]&quot; 32514,&quot;Sugared Sirloins 3/4 cup dark brown sugar 5 tablespoons grill seasoning blend (recommended: Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick) 6 (1 1/4 to 1 1/2-inch thick) sirloin steaks, 10 to 12 ounces Cooking spray Instructions: Heat grill or grill pan to high.

Lightly coat one side of each of the 16 slices of bread with Rosemary Butter. Set aside. Slice chilled Pot Roast into finger-width slices using a sharp non-serrated knife. Set to the side. Divide Pot Roast into 8 equal portions on a large cookie sheet. Top each portion of Pot Roast with 1/4 cup Caramelized Onions. Remove reserved Pot Roast liquid from fridge, then skim the fat from the top into a shallow dish. (Return remaining liquid to fridge and save for a soup or gravy base.) Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 to 2 tablespoons Pot Roast fat to the pan. When melted, add the pot roast/onion portions, two at a time, to the skillet. Cook, undisturbed, pot roast-side down, until lightly crispy and browned, about 3 minutes. Flip over and cook until onions are heated through lightly browned, an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a second cookie sheet and keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining portions. Wipe out the nonstick skillet and return to medium heat. Add bread, buttered-side down, 2 slices at a time. Spread 2 tablespoons Horseradish Sauce on the exposed sides of the bread. Divide 2 ounces cheese between the two slices as you would for a grilled cheese sandwich. Cook until bread is browned and lightly toasted and cheese has begun to melt, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and place on a cutting board. Place 1/4 cup arugula on one side of the bread. Remove one portion of the pot roast/onion from the oven and place on top. Close sandwich. Cut in half and enjoy! Repeat process with remaining ingredients to make 7 more sandwiches. Place butter, rosemary, salt and white pepper in a small bowl and whisk together with a fork until fully combined. Leave out so that it will remain soft for spreading on bread for sandwiches. For the pot roast rub: Put granulated garlic, smoked paprika, salt, pepper, crushed red pepper and tarragon in a mason jar and shake until blended. (Unused rub may be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 month.) For the pot roast: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Add carrots, celery, onion, garlic and butter to a large roasting pan. Roast until butter is fully melted, about 5 minutes, then stir veg to coat with butter and return to oven. Roast until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven and reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F. Coat all sides of pot roast with rub, spanking it into the meat to make sure it properly adheres and helps form a crust. Set to the side. Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat until beginning to sizzle but not smoking. Sear pot roast on all sides until lightly browned. Take your time with this step, as it is important to build flavor. Transfer roast to pan with prepared vegetables. Arrange vegetables so half are below roast and half are on top. Lay sprigs of rosemary on top of roast. Slowly pour wine over top of roast so as not to displace vegetables and herbs. Scrape remnants of skillet on top of roast. Add just enough beef stock to submerge roast halfway in liquid. Cover pan first with plastic wrap, then top with heavy-duty foil and seal all edges to keep moisture in. (At this low a temp, plastic wrap will not melt and is perfectly safe.) Place back in oven and cook, undisturbed, for 6 hours. Remove from oven and carefully pull back corner of plastic wrap and foil to let steam release. Remove pot roast from pan and place on a board to rest. Roast should be fork-tender at this point. Using a fine sieve, strain solids from remaining liquid in roasting pan. Discard solids and reserve liquid. Chill roast for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. Pot roast may be made one day ahead of time so that it may be easily sliced for sandwiches. Add the olive oil or butter to a large nonstick skillet and let melt over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onions and use a wooden spoon to lightly coat with melted fat. Spread the onions out in a fairly uniform layer and reduce the heat to medium to medium-low, depending on the strength of your stovetop. The idea is to cook the onions slow and fairly low so that the natural sugar in the onions will release and create a caramelization instead of a standard saute. This will develop a sweet flavor which will contrast beautifully with the other ingredients in the sandwich. This portion takes patience but not a ton of active work. After about 10 minutes, sprinkle salt over onions and stir. Continue cooking, stirring regularly, until the onions are soft and browned completely, about an hour more. (You are looking for the color of a caramel apple, hence the name of the onions.) If you find the onions are sticking, it is perfectly fine to add a bit of water or a little bit more oil or butter so as to prevent burning. Remove from stove and transfer to a small bowl. Whisk together mayonnaise, horseradish, lemon juice, white pepper, salt and black pepper in a small bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 32516,&quot;Turkey Shepherd&#39;s Pie with Sweet Potato 4 to 5 medium sweet potatoes, cooked 1 cup heavy cream<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened<br> 1 teaspoon ground coriander<br> 1 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 2 large egg yolks<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan 1/4 cup grated Pecorino-Romano<br> 1/4 cup breadcrumbs<br> 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 4 strips bacon or pancetta, diced 2 pounds ground dark meat turkey 1 Spanish onion, chopped<br> 1 leek, washed and small diced<br> 6 sage leaves, minced<br> 1/4 cup pine nuts<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br> 2 cups chicken stock<br> 1 cup frozen diced carrots, thawed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley Instructions: For the mashed sweet potatoes: Scoop sweet potato flesh into a large bowl and mash with a fork or potato masher.

Allow the porcini to soak for a few minutes or until soft. Then finely chop the porcini to a paste-like consistency. On a work table, peel and mash the potatoes with the back of a fork or use a potato ricer. Add the porcini to the mashed potatoes and then add the flour, Parmigiano, salt, and pepper. Combine together and knead until the mixture becomes regular dough consistency, smooth and slightly sticky. Add more flour if needed, which will absorb any excess moisture. On a lightly-floured work surface, take pieces of the dough and roll them out into thin logs, approximately 1/2-inches thick. Cut them 1-inch long. Make the ridges on each gnocchi by using the back of a fork in a rolling action. Cook&#39;s Note: The imprints will allow the sauce to get trapped on the surface of the gnocchi. Put the gnocchi on a tray in a single layer and place a cloth over the top to prevent them from drying out. They may also be set in refrigerator or freezer until needed. Cook the gnocchi in a pot of boiling salted water for about 1 to 2 minutes or until they float to the surface. For the sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the fresh sage leaves. Remove the gnocchi from the boiling water with a slotted spoon or drain and add them directly to the saucepan with about 1/2 cup pasta water. Cook the gnocchi with the sauce for about 30 seconds and then remove them from the heat. Add the Parmigiano and mix well.

Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes (scrape down the sides of the bowl, as needed). Beat in the molasses until combined, then the egg (the mixture will look curdled). Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in 2 pieces, flatten each half into a disk and wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to overnight.<br> Position 2 racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Keeping one disk refrigerated, roll the other disk on a well-floured work surface to 1/4 inch thick, sprinkling flour on and under the dough as needed and sliding a spatula underneath every so often to prevent sticking (If the dough looks crackly or breaks apart, press it back together from the outside edge in). Using cookie cutters, cut out gingerbread shapes as close together as possible. Pull away the extra dough around each shape then use a small offset spatula to transfer the shapes to the prepared cookie sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart. Reroll the scraps and cut out more cookies. Freeze the cookies until firm, about 15 minutes.<br> Bake the cookies, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom and from front to back halfway through cooking, until they are slightly firm to the touch but not browned at the edges, about 12 minutes. Repeat the rolling, cutting and baking with the remaining dough disk.<br> Cool the cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet then transfer them to a cooling rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes (The cookies will continue to firm as they cool).<br> Make the icing: Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar, meringue powder and 3 tablespoons water in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until the frosting thickens, trying not to incorporate too much air. (The icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly.) Scrape the icing into a resealable plastic bag and snip the corner to the desired size. Pipe the icing onto the cookies to decorate, as desired, sticking the candy onto the icing while it is still wet. Let the cookies stand at room temperature until the icing hardens, at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32565,&quot;Small-Batch Sweet Potato Casserole 2 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 4 medium large), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon half-and-half 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon light brown sugar 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, optional Kosher salt 1 ounce cream cheese 1 1/3 cups mini marshmallows Instructions: Combine the sweet potatoes, half-and-half, butter, brown sugar, nutmeg if using and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, covered and stirring occasionally, until the sweet potatoes begin to break down, 15 to 20 minutes.

Unfold the lamb and examine how the butcher butterflied it. You may need to further cut it so the meat is of fairly uniform thickness. You may also have to cut it into 2 to 3 smaller, easier to handle portions. Add lamb to plastic bag and marinate in fridge for at least 2 hours. Place lamb on grill over well-heated coals or low-medium flame gas grill. Turn lamb 2 to 3 times while grilling and remove once degree of doneness is achieved (measure with instant-read thermometer). Allow meat to rest 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Serve with any/all of the following: 1. Reduced marinade (cook down while grilling meat); 2. Fresh garlic aioli; 3. Raspberry jalapeno sauce (recipe below) Serve this to someone who thinks they don&#39;t like lamb. It&#39;s a huge hit at our annual July 4th barbecue. Sweat the garlic, onions and peppers in the butter. Add preserves, stirring constantly until liquefied. Add wine and reduce to syrupy consistency. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 32592,&quot;Twice-Baked Potatoes with Bacon and Eggs 4 large russet potatoes 6 slices bacon 1/4 cup milk, warmed 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (about 4 ounces) 2 scallions, thinly sliced, plus more for topping 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 large eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pierce the potatoes in a few places with a fork; place on a microwave-safe plate and microwave, turning halfway through, until tender, about 16 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain on paper towels, reserving the drippings. Roughly chop 4 slices and break the other 2 slices in half; set aside. Slice off the top 1/4 inch of the potatoes lengthwise. Scoop the flesh from 3 potatoes into a medium bowl, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell. Repeat with the remaining potato but discard the flesh. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon drippings and the warmed milk to the bowl and mash with a potato masher or fork until smooth. Stir in the cheese, scallions, parsley, chopped bacon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Season the inside of the potato skins with salt and pepper. Divide the filling among the skins, then press the back of a spoon down the center of the filling to create a long, deep well. Brush the outside of the skins with the remaining bacon drippings and transfer to the baking sheet. One at a time, crack an egg into a ramekin or teacup, then carefully pour into each potato (it&#39;s OK if some of the egg white overflows). Transfer to the oven and bake until the whites are set, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and top with more scallions and the halved bacon strips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 32593,&quot;Shrimp Spring Rolls 16 shrimp (16 to 20 count), peeled and deveined, tails removed 3 cups dry white wine 2 bay leaves Juice from 1 lime 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 ounces thin rice vermicelli 1 cup shredded carrots 1/2 English cucumber, peeled and julienned 1/2 red bell pepper, thin julienne 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 2 teaspoons soy sauce 8 large rice paper wrappers (8 1/2-inch rounds) 1 jalapeno, cut into 1/8-inch slices 8 fresh Thai basil leaves, chiffonade Peanut Dipping Sauce, for serving, recipe follows 1 tablespoon peanut oil 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 cup peanut butter 1/4 cup hoisin sauce 1 to 2 teaspoons sambal olek Chopped roasted peanuts, for garnish Instructions: Score the shrimp on the underside in three equally spaced horizontal cuts. Press firmly on the shrimp to straighten. In a soup pot, combine 4 cups water, the wine, bay leaf, lime juice and salt and bring to a simmer. Turn off the heat, add in the shrimp and cover until the shrimp are pink, about 4 minutes. Scoop out the shrimp and shock in ice water to stop the cooking. Then drain and dry. Reserve the poaching liquid, keeping it hot but not simmering. Add the vermicelli to the hot poaching liquid (no need to simmer or boil the water because that may over cook the noodles). Cook until just al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain. Toss the carrots, cucumbers and red bell peppers with the rice wine vinegar and soy sauce. Dip each rice paper wrapper in warm water, one at a time, for a second (no longer or they will get too soft). The wrapper should still feel somewhat hard when you first start working with it. By the time you finish getting all of your fillings in, the wrapper will have continued to soften. Layer the first one with 2 shrimp, a basil leaf, jalapeno slice, some vermicelli and vegetables. Gently wrap like a tiny burrito and cut on the sharp bias. Serve with Peanut Dipping Sauce. Add the peanut oil to a small saute pan over medium heat and add the garlic. Cook for 1 minute, and then turn off the heat. Then add the peanut butter, hoisin, sambel olek and 3 tablespoons water and mix together. You may need to add a little extra water if the mixture is too thick. Garnish with the chopped peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 32594,&quot;Crabcakes and Seafood Sausage 1 pound fresh jumbo lump crabmeat 1 sweet red pepper, seeded and finely diced 1 sweet yellow pepper, seeded and finely diced 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh garlic 1 to 2 jalapeno peppers, finely chopped 1/3 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1 cup fresh white bread crumbs 3 tablespoons Maryland style \\Old Bay\\ brand seasoning powder 1 teaspoon each of salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil or vegetable oil for sauteing Instructions: Even though crab meat is packaged fresh and clean of shell there are always some shell fragments remaining. Open the crab meat, dump into a clean dish, and with scrupulously clean hands, pick through and clean the crabmeat of all shell fragments. Be careful of the delicate nature of such a high quality product and try not to crumble the large lumps of crab. Mix the crabmeat with the sweet peppers, garlic, jalapeno, cilantro leaves, and mayonnaise. Add the seasoning powder, 4 tablespoons of the bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well then refrigerate the mixture for twenty minutes. A cold mix is easier to work with and form into cakes. Cover a work surface with waxed paper and sprinkle with half of the remaining bread crumbs. Scoop up and divide the crabmeat into 6 equalsize portions and place each mound on the work space. With the a portion of crab in the palm of one hand pat the crab with the fingers of your other hand into a diskshaped cake approximately 3/4-inch thick. It is important for the crab cakes to be the same thickness so that they will cook uniformly. Pat each cake with the bread crumbs, turning them so they coat evenly on all sides. Refrigerate for at least an hour so that the firm enough to cook and in this way prevent them from crumbling. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Not more than half an hour before you plan to serve the crab cakes add enough oil to cover the bottom of a saute pan. Heat until just before it begins to smoke. Add the crab cakes gently, being careful not to crowd the pan. (Cook them in two batches if necessary.) Turn the cakes and brown the second side. When the crab cakes are well browned to a rich golden on both sides, place on a heat proof platter and into a 375 degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes to ensure that they are fully cooked and hot at the center. Serve with chili mayonnaise and a mango salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 32595,&quot;Oyster Stuffing 20 oysters, shucked, plus their liquor (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3 cups coarsely crumbled cornbread, recipe follows 3 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 medium shallots, thinly sliced 2 celery stalks (with leaves), thinly sliced 2 teaspoons kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 2 tablespoon white dry vermouth 1 cup stone-ground cornmeal 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 large egg 1/2 cup whole milk 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, plus more for the brushing the pan Instructions: Put the oysters in a strainer over a medium bowl to catch their liquor.

Measure 2 tablespoons lemon juice into a large non-reactive bowl. Add the fruit to the bowl and toss to coat. Melt the butter over medium heat in a non-reactive roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. Cook until it stops foaming and turns light brown. Add the rosemary, bay leaves, vinegar, remaining lemon juice, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil, stir well until the sugar has melted, and simmer until slightly reduced. Season the cut fruit with a pinch of salt and pepper and pour into the roasting pan. Stir well until evenly coated. Spread the fruit into a single layer and place in the oven. Let cook slowly about 6 hours, turning the pieces over every hour for at least the first 3 hours. To test whether the fruit is ready, remove a piece after 2 hours and let cool for a few minutes. Taste to see if the flavor is intense enough for your palate. Do not let the fruit get as dry as a fruit leather. It should still be moist and flexible. Remove any pieces that are done before the rest. Remove from the oven, let cool completely, and store in a tightly sealed container. Refrigerate, if not consumed within 2 days. Let come to room temperature or warm gently before serving, if refrigerated. The fruit will keep a week or more in the refrigerator. Cook&#39;s Note: Oven-drying is a technique for intensifying flavor. If the fruit is watery, it may take up to 8 hours to dry. If the fruit is at its peak, ripe, and firm, it may take far less time. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 32621,&quot;Roasted Corn, Zucchini and Jalapeno Salad 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (from 2 or 3 limes) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 4 ears corn, roasted, kernels cut off (see below)<br> 4 large zucchini, chopped into small pieces<br> 1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded and finely chopped<br> 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro<br> 1 cup chicharron (pork cracklings), for serving<br> Instructions: Place the olive oil and lime juice in a small bowl.

Cut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Brush the halves with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and cayenne pepper. Arrange them on a sheet pan and roast them, flesh side down, until the outside of the squash can be easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and keep in a warm place. Add olive oil to a large saute pan until it is about 1/4-inch deep, and put over high heat. While the oil is heating, pat the skate dry with paper towels. Season the fish with salt and the ground coriander seed. When the oil is very hot but not yet smoking, dredge the skate wings in flour and shake of the excess. The fish should go IMMEDIATELY from the flour to the oil, no pausing! If all the fish will not fit in the pan at the same time, only flour the ones that will fit in the pan. Premature flouring will result in a gummy gritty skate wing. The oil should be hot and sizzling when the fish goes in. Cook each piece of fish until golden brown and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove from the oil and blot immediately on paper towels. Season with salt, to taste. If working in batches, keep the cooked fish warm in a preheated 225 degree F oven. While the fish is cooking, coat another large saute pan with olive oil, add the smashed garlic cloves and a pinch of crushed red pepper and put the pan over medium-high heat. When the garlic is golden brown and aromatic, remove it and discard. Add the Brussels sprouts to the pan and season them with salt. Saute the sprouts until they get very brown and crispy. Using a large fork, scrape the flesh out of the spaghetti squash, it should look like...spaghetti! Add it to the frizzled sprouts and season again with salt. Stir together and toss in the chopped cilantro, reserving a little to garnish the fish. Arrange some of the squash/and sprout mixture on each serving plate. Lean the crispy skate next to it and sprinkle with the remaining cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice.

Working quickly and with one pint at a time, turn each pint of ice cream on its side and cut off the cardboard container. Starting with the wide end, slice off three or four 1/2-inch-thick rounds from each pint. Cut out stars from the ice cream using a 3 1/4-inch star-shaped cookie cutter, transferring the cutouts to the baking sheet in the freezer as you go. Freeze until solid, about 2 hours. (Transfer the ice cream trimmings to a resealable container and reserve for another use.) Position a rack in the upper third of the oven; preheat to 325 degrees F. Butter a rimmed 13-by-18-inch baking sheet and line with parchment paper; butter the parchment, dust with flour and tap out the excess.<br> Stir the vanilla and red gel food coloring into the milk in a liquid measuring cup. Whisk the flour, malted milk powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, shortening, granulated sugar and brown sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on low speed until combined. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, and beat, scraping down the bowl as needed, until just combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture, then gradually beat in the milk mixture. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat until smooth.<br> Spread the batter in the prepared pan and sprinkle with nonpareils. Bake on the upper oven rack until just set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

In a bowl, whisk together the ginger conserve, mustard, garlic flavored oil and soy sauce. Turn the sausages in the mustardy mix and then arrange them on either a large, shallow-sided tin or 2 smaller tins. The height of the tin&#39;s sides will determine how quickly the sausages color and cook. If you are using high-sided tins, they will need about 45 minutes in the oven; cooked on a shallower tray, 30 minutes should be fine. And do line with foil or use throwaway foil trays, or washing-up will be a nightmare. To serve the sausages in their bread bowl, cut a circle around the top of the bread to take off a \\lid. Put this lid on one side for a moment, and tear and pull out the doughy filling with your hands, leaving the crust intact so that you have a hollow bowl. Fill this emptied-out loaf with as many sausages as you can - you may have to top up with a few as you go - and then you can balance the lid at a jaunty angle for maximum effect and your guests&#39; amusement. Serve with a small pot of cocktail sticks to spear the sausages, but if you&#39;re skipping the bread bowl option, let the hot sausages cool slightly before handing them out. Make ahead note: Put coating mixture in a resealable bag, add sausages and refrigerate for up to 2 days - put bag in bowl or on plate in case of leakage. Cook as directed in recipe. Freeze note: The sausages can be frozen in bag with coating for up to 3 months. Defrost overnight in fridge - put bag in bowl or on plate in case of leakage. Cook as directed in recipe. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 32643,&quot;Cous Cous Upma 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 teaspoon minced gingerroot 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 onion, minced 1 cup chopped green bell pepper 2 cups green beans 4 firm, ripe tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces Salt 2 cups water 1 chicken bouillon cube 1 2/3 cups cous cous Fresh lemon juice Minced fresh cilantro Instructions: In a deep nonstick skillet set over moderate heat, warm the oil until it is hot.

Place steak in a plastic storage bag, add the marinade, remove as much air as possible and refrigerate overnight. Preheat grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove steak from marinade bag and remove as much of the marinade as possible. Reserve 1/2 cup marinade for barbeque sauce. Season the steak with kosher salt and pepper. Brush grill pan lightly with canola oil, grill steak for 2 1/2 minutes, rotate on same side 45 degrees (to create grill marks) and grill for another 2 1/2 minutes. Flip steak and cook for an additional 5 minutes on the other side, rotating 45 degrees after 2 1/2 minutes. Remove from grill pan and allow the steak to rest for 10 minutes under a foil tent. Slice steak against the grain as thinly as possible. To serve, toss salad and optional red onion, tomato and avocado with vinaigrette of your choice and arrange on a serving platter. Place a heap of fennel slaw in the center of salad, then place sliced meat around the sides (I fold the sliced meat in a slight V shape to show as much of the caramelization of the outside of the meat). Drizzle meat with barbeque sauce and mango puree carefully ensuring that the sauce gets onto the salad greens and slaw (use more barbeque sauce than mango puree). Puree mangos in a blender. Add rice wine vinegar and chili garlic paste and blend until all ingredients are incorporated (the color should be a bright orange-red). Bring marinade to a boil. Lower heat to medium-low and reduce to about half (about 10 minutes over medium-low heat). The sauce can be strained at this point to remove the bits of garlic and ginger (the flavor is slightly less intense but it makes for a nicer presentation). Add about half of the mango puree (approximately 2/3 cup) and cook for another 2 minutes. Set aside. Save the other half of the mango puree for garnish. Place lemon juice in a bowl and whisk in olive oil to create an emulsion. Add honey, zest, salt and pepper and whisk until combined; set aside. Slice fennel very thinly with a mandolin.

Heat the milk long enough to remove the chill and raise the temperature just slightly so that it is just warm. Place the yeast in a small bowl with 1 tablespoon of the sugar and pour the heated milk over the yeast. Stir the milk into the yeast and allow it to bloom for 5 to 10 minutes. In a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment, combine the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar, butter, salt, mace, and powdered milk and mix until just well combined. Do not overmix. Add the egg and mix gently. Add the remaining 3/4 cup of milk and mix briefly. Add the flours and yeast mixture and mix to form a smooth dough, about 6 to 8 minutes at second speed. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Set aside to rise in a warm, draft free place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Sprinkle the dough lightly with flour and, using a rolling pin, roll to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Let dough sit undisturbed for 5 minutes to allow the dough to relax. Using a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass, cut doughnuts into rounds about 3 inches in diameter. Add enough solid vegetable shortening to a large saucepan or deep-fryer to come halfway up the sides of the pan when melted. Heat over medium heat to a temperature of 350 degrees F. Fry the doughnuts, a few at a time so as to not overcrowd, turning once midway through the cooking, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. While donuts are still warm, place them in a paper bag with some sugar and shake to coat. Transfer the cooked doughnuts to a cookie rack set over a sheet pan to cool. When cool, place the jelly in a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip and, using the tip, poke a small hole in the side of the doughnuts and fill the centers with 2 tablespoons of the jam.

Bake until the centers of the cupcakes spring back when gently pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then remove to a rack to cool completely. Make the glaze: Combine the brown sugar, corn syrup, butter and salt in a small high-sided saucepan over medium heat. Add the water and stir, then bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, swirling the pan occasionally but not stirring, until the mixture is a rich brown color and thick enough to slowly drip off the end of a rubber spatula, 12 to 15 minutes. (The caramel should stay in a loose ball when swirled in the pan.) Meanwhile, combine the cornstarch and heavy cream in a small bowl. Remove the glaze from the heat and carefully add the cream mixture. (It\\u2019s OK if it stiffens at first.) Return to the heat and cook, carefully stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the bourbon (or vanilla).

Set aside to cool slightly. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and butter and line a 9-inch springform tin. Beat together the sugar and soft butter until airy and creamy, and then add the honey. Add 1 of the eggs, beating it in with a tablespoon of the flour, and then the other egg with another tablespoon of flour. Fold in the melted chocolate, and then the rest of the flour and baking soda. Add the cocoa pushed through a tea strainer to ensure you have no lumps, and last of all, beat in the boiling water. Mix everything well to make a smooth batter and pour into the prepared tin. Cook for up to 1 1/2 hours, though check the cake after 45 minutes and if it is getting too dark, cover the top lightly with aluminium foil and keep checking every 15 minutes. Let the cake cool completely in the tin on a rack. To make the glaze, bring the water and honey to a boil in a saucepan, then turn off the heat and add the finely chopped chocolate, swirling it around to melt in the hot liquid. Leave it for a few minutes, then whisk together. Add the sugar through a sieve and whisk again until smooth. Choose your plate or stand, and cut out 4 strips of baking paper and form a square outline on the plate. This is so that when you sit the cake on and ice it, the icing will not run out all over the plate. Unclip the tin and set the thoroughly cooled cake on the prepared plate. Pour the glaze over the cold honey bee cake; it might dribble a bit down the edges, but don&#39;t worry too much about that. The glaze stays tacky for ages (this is what gives it its lovely melting gooiness) so ice in time for the glaze to harden a little, say at least an hour before you want to serve it. Keep the pan of glaze, (don&#39;t wash it up), as you will need it to make the stripes on the bees. Divide the marzipan into 6 even pieces and shape them into fat, sausage-like bees&#39; bodies, slightly tapered at the ends. Using a wooden skewer, paint stripes with the sticky honey glaze left in the pan from icing the cake. About 3 stripes look best, and then very carefully attach the flaked almonds at an angle to make the bees&#39; wings, 2 on each one. They might snap as you dig them into the marzipan bodies, so have some spare. I&#39;m afraid to admit, I also like to give them eyes by dipping the point of the skewer in the glaze and thence on the bees: they look more loveable with an expression, which is somehow what the eyes give them, but then this is where the Disney effect comes in. If a more imperial dignity is required, forgo the dotting of the eyes and present this as your Napoleonic Chocolate Cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 32702,&quot;Hue Lemongrass Skewers: Nem Lui Hue 3 1/2 ounces/ 100 g minced (ground) beef 7 ounces/ 200 g minced (ground) pork 1 1/2 tablespoons/20 g cooked and shredded pork skin* (See Cook&#39;s Note) 1 1/2 tablespoons/20 g minced pork fat 3 cloves garlic, finely diced (1 tablespoon) Chopped shallots 1/2 tablespoon sugar Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon fish sauce 12 lemongrass stalks, trimmed 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 6 baguettes, warm 3 tablespoons cl sauce 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce Instructions: In a mixing bowl, combine the beef, minced pork, pork skin, pork fat, garlic, shallots, sugar, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and fish sauce.

Butter and line the bottom of 2 (8-inch) cake pans. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugars, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl or wide-necked measuring cup whisk together the eggs, sour cream and vanilla until blended. Using a standing or handheld electric mixer, beat together the melted butter and corn oil until just blended (you&#39;ll need another large bowl for this is using the hand mixer; the standing mixer comes with its own bowl), then beat in the water. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix together on a slow speed. Add the egg mixture, and mix again until everything is blended and then pour into the prepared tins. And actually, you could easily do this manually; I just like my toys and find the stand mixer a comforting presence in itself. Bake the cakes for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a cake-tester comes out clean. Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 15 minutes, and then turn the cakes out on the rack to cool completely. For the icing: Melt the chocolate in the microwave - 2 to 3 minutes on medium should do it - or in a bowl sitting over a pan of simmering water, and let cool slightly. In another bowl beat the butter until it&#39;s soft and creamy (again, I use the stand mixer here) and then add the sifted confectioners&#39; sugar and beat again until everything&#39;s light and fluffy. I know sifting is a pain, the 1 job in the kitchen I really hate, but you have to do it or the icing will be unsoothingly lumpy. Then gently add the vanilla and chocolate and mix together until everything is glossy and smooth. Sandwich the middle of the cake with about a quarter of the icing, and then ice the top and sides, too, spreading and smoothing with a rubber spatula. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]&quot; 32724,&quot;Bacon Jack and Jalapeno Quesadillas 1 ripe Hass avocado, halved, seeded and peeled 1 small tomato, diced 2 scallions, finely chopped 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced 1 small garlic clove, minced Salt, to taste 4 strips turkey bacon (about 3 ounces) 6 scallions,(white and green parts) thinly sliced 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced 1 garlic clove, minced 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander 3 (8-inch) multi-grain tortillas 3/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Monterey jack cheese 1/4 cup reduced-fat sour cream, optional Cilantro, for garnish Instructions: Guacamole: Coarsely mash the avocado in a large bowl.

In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix together the granulated sugar and vegetable oil on medium speed. Add the eggs, vanilla and food coloring and mix until well combined. Mix in the cocoa mixture. Mixing on low speed, add the a third of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Add half the buttermilk. Add another third of the dry ingredients, mix until combined, and then add the remaining buttermilk. Stop the mixer. Stir the baking soda and vinegar together in a small bowl (it will bubble up). Immediately add it to the batter along with the remaining dry ingredients and mix for 15 seconds. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan, set the pan on a baking sheet tray and bake until the top springs back when gently pressed and a toothpick comes out clean, 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes, then remove the sides and slide the cake off the bottom to cool completely on the rack. Once completely cool, use a large serrated knife or a cake knife or cake leveler to trim off any doming on top of the cake. Slice the cake horizontally into 2 even layers. For the filling: Sprinkle the gelatin over 2 tablespoons of cold water in a small bowl. Set aside to bloom for 5 minutes. Mix the cream cheese, confectioners\\u2019 sugar, vanilla and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high until creamy and smooth. Transfer 3/4 cup of the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip and set aside in the refrigerator. Microwave the bloomed gelatin until melted, about 20 seconds. Beat the gelatin into the remaining cream cheese along with the sour cream. Mix until smooth. Set aside 5 of the prettiest strawberries for decorating the top of the cake. Remove the green tops from the rest of the strawberries. Trim the berries if necessary so that they are similar in height when standing up on the trimmed end. To assemble the cake, set one layer of cake on a cake board or flat serving platter. Unlock the clean ring of the springform pan and place it around the cake layer. Take the second strip of parchment and wrap around the cake inside the ring so that it is standing up, then lock the cake ring so that it hugs the parchment against the cake. Spread 1/3 cup of the cream cheese filling over the cake layer. Slice a strawberry in half vertically and press the cut halves up against the parchment so that they touch at the bottom. Repeat until you have a ring of berries around the inside of the parchment. Take the remaining whole berries and fill in the interior of the ring, trimmed side down (you may not use all the berries, depending on their size). Spread the rest of the filling over the berries, making sure that it fills in the gaps between them. Gently tap the cake on the counter to eliminate any air pockets. Place the second cake layer on top, making sure the parchment is around the sides, and gently press down. Wrap the cake in plastic wrap and refrigerate until the filling is chilled through and set, at least 3 hours and up to 8 hours. When ready to serve, unlock the springform ring and lift it off the cake. Peel off the parchment strip, being careful not to pull it straight out but rather peel it gently away from the sides of the cake. With the reserved frosting, pipe 14 stars in a circle around the top edge of the cake, then pipe 10 stars in a smaller circle, and then 2 large rosettes in the center. Cut the reserved 5 strawberries in half vertically, leaving the green tops on, and place 7 strawberry halves in every other gap between the 14 piped stars. Arrange the remaining 3 strawberry halves on the rosettes in the center of the cake. Slice and enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 32727,&quot;Cherry Coke Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the cake pan One 15.25-ounce box devil&#39;s food cake mix, such as Duncan Hines<br> One 3.9-ounce package instant chocolate pudding mix<br> 4 large egg whites<br> 3/4 cup cherry cola, such as Cherry Coke ?<br> 1/2 cup vegetable oil<br> 1/2 cups finely chopped maraschino cherries<br> 5 1/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 6 sticks (1 1/2 pounds) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 5 tablespoons maraschino cherry liquid plus 1 cup finely chopped maraschino cherries<br> 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> 1 1/2 cups whole maraschino cherries with stems<br> Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray, then line with parchment and spray the parchment. Combine the cake mix and pudding mix in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on low speed to blend. With the mixer still running, add the egg whites, cherry cola and vegetable oil and mix until combined. Raise the speed to medium and mix until increased in volume, lighter in color and smooth, about 5 minutes. Fold in the maraschino cherries. Divide the batter between the prepared baking pans; smooth into even layers using an offset spatula.<br> Bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean and the edges pull away from the sides of the pan, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool in the pans, about 10 minutes, then turn out onto racks and let cool completely, about 1 hour.<br> For the frosting: Mix the confectioners&#39; sugar, butter and salt together in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on low speed until well blended, then increase the speed to high and whip until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the maraschino cherry liquid and continue to whip until bright pink and spreadable. Add the chopped cherries and mix on low speed until evenly distributed.<br> Using a serrated knife and sawing in long, even strokes, carefully halve the cake layers horizontally. Place 1 layer, cut-side up, on a platter or cake stand; spread 1 1/2 cups frosting on top. Stack another cake layer on top and spread another 1 1/2 cups frosting on top. Repeat with the remaining 2 cake layers, then cover the top and sides with a thin layer of frosting (this is the crumb coat) and use a bench scraper or large offset spatula to smooth out the sides and top (it&#39;s okay if some cake shows through). Refrigerate 15 minutes, then add another 1/2-inch layer of frosting to the top of the cake and smooth out to make a perfectly flat top. Refrigerate until ready to cover with ganache.<br> For the ganache: Meanwhile, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until beginning to boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is completely smooth and the chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Let cool 30 minutes, then pour over the chilled cake so that the top is completely coated and chocolate drips decoratively down the sides. Let set at room temperature 30 minutes, then top with the whole cherries in the center of the cake and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 32728,&quot;Slammin&#39; Sausage Pancakes with Honey Maple Syrup 1 pound bulk breakfast sausage 2 cups self-rising flour 3 tablespoons sugar Pinch salt Pinch baking powder 1 3/4 cups buttermilk 2 large eggs, separated 1/4 cup melted butter, plus 2 tablespoons, for frying pancakes Honey Maple Butter, recipe follows Powdered sugar, to garnish 1/4 cup maple syrup, for serving 1 stick butter, softened 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons maple syrup Pinch salt Pinch ground cinnamon Instructions: In a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat, brown the sausage while breaking it apart, for approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan to paper towels. Discard excess grease or keep 2 tablespoons for frying the pancakes. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and egg yolks until smooth and velvety. Reserve the egg whites in a third bowl. Add buttermilk and egg yolks to the flour mixture. Stir with a spoon until well incorporated. Add the melted butter and stir until well incorporated. Using an electric hand mixer, beat the egg whites in a bowl until stiff peaks are formed, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Fold the egg whites into the batter using a rubber spatula. Batter should be fluffy. In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons butter or 2 tablespoons of the reserved sausage fat. Working in batches, ladle the batter in the pan to form 4-inch pancakes. Sprinkle a heaping tablespoon of cooked sausage onto each pancake. Batter should puff up around sausage. Cook each pancake for 2 to 3 minutes then flip, cooking for an additional 2 to 3 minutes until nicely browned and cooked through. Repeat with remaining batter and sausage. Once finished, remove the pancakes from the pan onto a platter. Spread liberally with the Honey-Maple Butter and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve with maple syrup. Put the butter, honey, maple syrup, salt and cinnamon into a bowl. Mix well with a wooden spoon until well incorporated.

Put the almonds in the bottom of each muffin cup and set aside. For the caramel: In a 3-quart, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the cream, butter, sugar, and water. Stir over medium heat until the mixture is smooth. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, about 5 to 7 minutes. Let the mixture cool for 30 seconds. Using a long-handled, metal spoon, carefully spoon the caramel over the nuts. Allow the caramel to harden, at room temperature, for 1 hour. Put the chocolate chips in a medium stainless steel or glass bowl. Set the bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted, about 4 minutes. Spoon the chocolate over the caramel and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Using a thin-bladed spatula, remove the turtles from the pan (caramel will be hard). Let the turtles stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour (to allow the caramel to soften) before serving. Store in an airtight container at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 32731,&quot;Pasta with Pecorino and Pepper 1 tablespoon whole black Tellicherry peppercorns Kosher salt 1/2 pound dried Italian egg pasta, such as tagliarelle 1 cup freshly grated aged Pecorino cheese (4 ounces), plus extra for serving 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves Instructions: Place the peppercorns in a mortar and pestle and crush them until you have a mixture of coarse and fine bits. (You can also grind them in a small food mill or coffee grinder.) Set aside. Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt and the pasta and cook according to the directions on the package until al dente. Ladle 1 cup of the pasta cooking water into a glass measuring cup and reserve it. Drain the pasta quickly in a colander and return the pasta to the pot with a lot of the pasta water still dripping. Working quickly, with the heat on very low, toss the pasta with 1/2 cup of the grated Pecorino, the crushed peppercorns, cream, butter, parsley, and 1 teaspoon salt, tossing constantly. If the pasta seems dry, add some of the reserved cooking water. Off the heat, toss in the remaining 1/2 cup Pecorino. Serve immediately with a big bowl of extra grated Pecorino for sprinkling. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Gavi, Barbera]&quot; 32732,&quot;Classic French Toast 8 slices Texas Toast or other 3/4-inch-sliced white bread 8 large eggs 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 4 tablespoons butter Confectioners&#39; sugar, for serving Maple syrup, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Lay the bread slices in one layer (it&#39;s OK if they overlap a little) on a baking sheet. Bake the slices (to dry them out a little) for 6 minutes, then flip and bake for 6 minutes more. Set aside to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F. Whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, granulated sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and salt in a large casserole dish. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low to medium heat. Place 2 slices of bread in the egg mixture. Let the bread completely soak in the egg mixture on both sides, about 30 seconds to 1 minute total, checking after 15 seconds. (Bread should feel heavy and soaked through but hold its shape without breaking apart.) Melt a tablespoon of butter in the skillet and add the 2 soaked slices; cook until the outside is golden brown and crisp and the inside is cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. You will need to watch and adjust the temperature between medium and medium-low if the bread is browning too quickly or not browning fast enough. Keep finished French toast slices warm on a rack nested in a rimmed baking sheet in the oven. Repeat with the remaining slices. Serve with a dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar and drizzle of maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32733,&quot;Apple Cake with Pale Ale Sabayon 5 cups apples, any type, peeled, cored, and diced 1/4 cup rum 2 1/4 cups flour 2 1/4 cups sugar 2 teaspoons baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 3 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3/4 cup canola or vegetable oil 2 cups walnuts, chopped 5 large egg yolks 1/2 cup pale ale 1/3 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: To prepare cake: Soak the apples in the rum for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour and 11-inch springform pan. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg into a bowl and make a well in the center. Beat the eggs slightly and stir in the vanilla and oil. Pour the oil mixture into the dry ingredients all at once and stir until just blended. Fold in the walnuts. Drain the apples and fold them in, stirring just enough to evenly distribute the nuts and apples. Pour the batter into the cake pan. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 3 to 5 minutes, then turn cake out onto a wire rack to cool to room temperature. To prepare the sabayon: Place the egg yolks and ale in a stainless steel or copper bowl and whisk in the sugar and vanilla. Cook the sabayon for 6 to 8 minutes over medium to high heat, whisking constantly. It may be necessary to remove the bowl from the heat from time to time if the sabayon gets too hot or the eggs will begin to scramble. To test for doneness, let a drop of the sauce fall from the tip of the whip. If it stays pronounced on the surface, then the sauce is done. To serve: Cut the cake into wedges and pour the warm sauce over the tip of each slice as you serve it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 32734,&quot;Maryland Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes 1 egg yolk 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper 1 teaspoon dry mustard 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon mayonnaise 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1 pound Maryland jumbo lump crab meat Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

Add small shell pasta and cook the pasta to al dente doneness which means that the pasta will still have a bite to it or be a little chewy. The pasta will soak up more juice and keep on cooking after we drain it, so we need it to be a little under cooked. The shells will probably cook about 9 or 10 minutes. Preheat a deep, big skillet or a medium sauce pot over medium heat. Place garlic on the cutting board and place the flat of your knife on top of each clove. Carefully give the garlic a whack with the palm of your hand to separate the cloves from the skins. Throw out the skins and chop up the garlic. Remember to keep your fingers curled under and the edge of your sharp, chef&#39;s knife tilted slightly away from your body. Add extra-virgin olive oil to the pan by pouring a slow stream of it twice-around-the-pan. This will be about 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil just enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Do not let the oil pour out too fast. You are looking for a slow, steady stream. Add the garlic to the oil. To chop the onion, cut the ends off and cut the whole onion down the center. Wrap half and save it. Cut the other half into thin slices then twist the slices a quarter turn and chop them again. Hold the tip of knife on the cutting board and lift the back of the knife up and down over the onion to make the pieces really small. Add the chopped up onion to the garlic and oil. Cook, stirring a lot, 5 minutes until the onions are mushy and look cooked. Add the tomatoes to the onions and stir. When the tomatoes come to a bubble, reduce the heat under the sauce to low. Stir in basil pieces to wilt them. Season the sauce with salt and peppe, to your taste. Preheat your broiler to high and place a rack in the center of the oven. Drain pasta shells. Add them to a flameproof casserole dish. Add pesto sauce, 1 cup of ricotta cheese and a handful of grated Parmigiano, too. Stir carefully and coat the hot pasta with the pesto and cheeses. Pour the hot tomato and basil sauce over the pasta, as much as you like. You can always serve a little extra at the table, to pass around. Shred up some mozzarella cheese with a grater and scatter it over the pasta. Add a final sprinkle of Parmigiano to the mozzarella as well. Place the casserole under the broiler in the middle of oven, 10 to 12 inches from the heat. Let the cheese melt and bubble on top, 3 to 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 32744,&quot;Corn and Green cl Chowder 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter 3 slices bacon, chopped<br> 1 onion, sliced<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano<br> Two 7-ounce cans chopped green chiles<br> 5 ears corn, kernels sliced off (2 1/2 to 3 cups)<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 3 1/3 cups chicken stock or broth<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br> 1 heaping cup grated Monterey Jack<br> 1 heaping cup grated pepper jack<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/3 cup sliced green onions<br> Instructions: Set a 6-quart multi-cooker to the saute setting and add the butter.

Spread the apple butter over the entire surface of the pastry. Place the other piece of pastry on top. Flour a rolling pin and roll the pastry out until it is pressed into a flat, cohesive square sheet. A little apple butter will squeeze out; just make sure not to press it all out! Use a large jar lid or measuring cup to score the center of the pastry square to keep an uncut center. Make 4 cuts from the center (keeping the lid in place); there should be 4 even quadrants. Cut each quadrant into 4 equal strips, all making a sunburst pattern from the center. Twist the strips twice around, bringing the tips back to their original position. Transfer the parchment to a baking sheet. Remove the lid from the center and place a stencil in the center (if using). Brush the puff pastry with the egg and sprinkle it evenly with the turbinado sugar. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the stencil if using. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32750,&quot;Cheddar Crust Apple Pie 1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1/4 cup cake flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 stick unsalted butter, frozen solid, slightly thawed 2 tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening, frozen solid, slightly thawed 1 cup grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese 2 teaspoons white vinegar mixed with 1/3 cup very cold water 6 to 7 large Delicious apples (3 pounds), peeled, cored and sliced thinly into 1/16-inch thick slices 2 tablespoons freshly-squeezed lemon juice 1 cup sugar, plus additional for sprinkling 1/3 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon 3/8 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water, for glaze Instructions: Make dough: In workbowl of a food processor fitted with metal blade combine flours and salt. Cut butter and lard into small pieces, add to workbowl and process 5 seconds. Add cheese and pulse on-off 2 times to mix. With motor running, pour in enough vinegar mixture in a slow steady stream for dough to form a ball; process 10 to 15 seconds. Turn dough out onto work surface. If dough appears too dry, work in 1 to 2 more teaspoons water. Specks of butter and cheese will be visible in dough. Shape dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours or overnight before using. Make filling: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. As you slice apples, toss them gently with lemon juice. Whisk together sugar, flour, cinnamon and salt, add to apple slices and toss gently to coat evenly. Divide dough into 2 unequal pieces, making piece for top crust slightly larger. On a lightly-floured work surface roll smaller piece into an 11-inch round. Line pie plate with bottom crust and fill with apples. Using your hands shape them into a firmly-packed mound slightly higher in center than at sides; dot with butter. Trim edges of bottom crust to a 3-inch overhang. Roll out remaining dough to an 11-inch round and arrange over filling. Trim edges of top crust to a :-inch overhang, fold top crust under edge of bottom crust and flute edges decoratively, pressing together with your thumb and forefinger. Cut 3 1 3/4-inch slashes in center of top crust. Bake pie 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F and continue to bake 30 to 40 minutes more, until pastry is golden brown and juices are bubbling. Ten minutes before end of baking, brush top with egg glaze and sprinkle with sugar.

Set the blossoms aside. For the filling, combine the ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, basil, lemon zest and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Transfer to a sandwich-size resealable plastic bag and snip a small corner from one point at the bottom. Open the leaves of a blossom and pipe in about 1 tablespoon of filling (don\\u2019t overfill). Gently twist the top of the blossom to enclose the filling. Repeat with the remaining zucchini blossoms and filling. Pour about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet and heat to 360 degrees F. (If you don\\u2019t have an oil thermometer, you\\u2019ll know the oil is ready if you drop in a scrap of bread and it sizzles on contact and begins to brown after a few seconds.) Line a baking sheet with paper towels. For the batter, whisk the flour, baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Whisk in the seltzer to make a smooth batter. When the oil is ready, dip the zucchini flowers in the batter one at a time, letting excess batter drip back into the bowl. Add as many as will fit in the skillet without crowding. Fry, turning once, until the batter is light, crisp and golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon to the lined baking sheet to drain and repeat with the remaining blossoms.

Rinse the fish and dry thoroughly with a paper towel. Score each side of the fish 3 to 4 times on a bias, about 1/2-inch deep. Combine the parsley, tarragon and thyme into 1 large bunch with the stems attached, and separate out one-third of the bunch. Finely chop the separated, smaller bunch. Mix with one-quarter of the fennel slices, one-third of the fronds, garlic and capers and 2 of the lemon slices, making a sort of herby citrus marinade. Mix the chopped herb mixture with the olive oil and rub the mixture inside and outside of the fish as well as inside the slits. This will allow the herby citrus flavors to permeate through the fish. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Place half of the remaining herbs, fennel, lemon slices, garlic and capers in a bed on the bottom of a roasting pan and the other half inside the cavity of the fish. Place the fish in a roasting pan. Evenly distribute the wine and butter pats in the pan, and place in the oven. The wine will help keep your fish moist and help steam it, as well as making a great sauce with the butter. Roast until the fish has cooked through, or until the skin is crispy and the fish is flaky, 25 to 30 minutes. Carefully transfer the fish to a serving platter with a bed of the Israeli Couscous (be careful, the fish is tender and can break). Pour the sauce from the pan over the fish and fillet to serve. Bring 3 cups salted water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the couscous, cover and remove from the heat. Allow the couscous to sit until the water is absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the currants, fresh herbs, lemon zest and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper and stir in a small glug of olive oil before serving. Yield: 6 servings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 32755,&quot;Cacio e Pepe e Zucca Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound spaghetti 1 1/2 cups finely grated Pecorino-Romano, plus additional for serving 1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns, lightly toasted and ground 2 tablespoons heavy cream 3 tablespoons pumpkin puree Instructions: Place 2 quarts water in a pot and bring to a boil.

Set aside to cool. Add the onions to a medium mixing bowl along with the ground chuck, ground pork, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper, the allspice and nutmeg. In a small bowl combine the breadcrumbs with the milk and 1/4 cup of the cream and allow to sit until bread crumbs are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the bread crumb mixture and the egg to the meat mixture, and, using your hands, mix well to thoroughly combine. Using a tablespoon measure as a guide, scoop the meat mixture into small portions, each about 1 heaping tablespoon. Using lightly damp hands, roll the meatballs until they are smooth and round. Transfer to a large plate or baking dish while you form the remaining meatballs. In a medium skillet heat 1/2 tablespoon of the remaining butter until foamy. Add one third of the meatballs and cook, turning frequently, until the meatballs are browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer the meatballs to a Dutch oven or other heavy large saucepan and repeat with the remaining meatballs, adding an additional 1/2 tablespoon of butter to the skillet before each addition. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter and the remaining 1/2 cup of chopped purple onions to the skillet and cook until the onions are soft, about 4 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Whisk in the beef broth little by little and cook until the sauce is smooth and thick, about 4 minutes. Transfer the sauce to the Dutch oven and add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, a pinch of black pepper, 3/4 cup heavy cream and the currant jelly. Be careful when stirring, to not break up the meatballs. Bring the contents of the Dutch oven to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat so that the sauce simmers. Cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meatballs are very tender and the sauce is thick and flavorful. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 32772,&quot;Grilled Gulf Shrimp 16 medium shrimp, shell on Salt and freshly ground pepper Barbeque sauce (your favorite brand) Instructions: Preheat your grill to medium heat.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over high heat. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, brown the pork on all sides, about 4 minutes per side. Remove the pork to a plate and set aside. While the pork is browning, tie the thyme, rosemary and bay leaf into a bundle using butcher&#39;s twine. Once all of the pork has been browned, reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil no oil remains in the pot. Add the onions and the remaining 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt. Cook for about 8 minutes, stirring and scraping up any browned bits. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 or 3 minutes. Deglaze with the white wine and cook until reduced to nearly dry, 6 to 10 minutes. Add the chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, Parmesan rind, cl flakes and the herb bundle and bring to a simmer. Return the pork to the pot, tucking it in under the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the pork is fork tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes. Remove the pork and shred into bite-size pieces using two forks. Remove the herb bundle from the sauce and add the pork back to the pot. Stir in the olive oil and half of the grated Parmesan. Keep warm over low heat. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the penne for about 1 or 2 minutes less than the package directions.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium ovenproof saute pan set over medium heat. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook until just starting to brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until just tender, 5 minutes. Set aside and keep warm for a later use. In a 4-quart saucepan, heat 1/2 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat. Add the guanciale and cook until crispy. Remove the guanciale with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels, and reserve the rendered fat in the saucepan. Discard all but 3 tablespoons of the rendered guanciale fat and heat the saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the shallots, garlic, thyme, some crushed red pepper and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat if the garlic starts to brown. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly, to lightly toast, 2 minutes. Increase the heat to medium, add the wine and cook until it mostly evaporates. Add 1 cup of the Capon Mushroom Stock and cook, stirring until the liquid is absorbed. Add another 1 cup of the stock and increase the heat to a gentle bubble (the agitation helps release the starch as the rice cooks). Add another 1 cup of the stock and continue to cook, stirring. To see if it&#39;s time to add more stock, drag a spoon through the rice; if liquid doesn&#39;t immediately fill in the space, it&#39;s time to add more. Continue cooking, adding stock as needed, up to 8 cups, until the risotto looks creamy but the rice is still al dente, about 18 minutes. Remove the risotto from the heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the butter, and mix, then add in the cheese. Taste and adjust the salt. Divide the risotto into serving dishes and top with Brussels sprouts, crispy guanciale and the chopped chives to serve. Place the bones in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a simmer, skimming off the scum that comes to the surface. Add the celery, onions, carrots and garlic. Return to a boil, and then reduce the heat to a simmer for 4 to 6 hours, breaking up the bones and skimming the fat throughout. Add the rosemary and thyme in the last hour of cooking. Add the dried porcini and steep for the last 15 minutes of cooking. Strain the stock into a large bowl set over an ice bath and reserve. Yield: 4 to 5 quarts. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 32777,&quot;Potato Crisps with Goat Cheese and Olives 1 to 2 cups vegetable oil 3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup fresh goat cheese, room temperature 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese, room temperature<br> 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest (1/2 orange) 1/2 cup pitted Castelvetrano olives 1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives<br> 1 tablespoon capers, drained and rinsed<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> Instructions: For the crisps: Fill a medium saucepan with 1/2 inch of vegetable oil. Heat over medium heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Slice the potatoes 1/8-inch thick, using a Japanese mandoline. Working in batches so as not to crowd the pan, fry the potatoes until crispy and golden brown, about 4 minutes per batch. With a spider or slotted spoon, remove the potatoes to a paper-towel-lined tray and drain well. Season with a few grinds of black pepper. For the goat cheese: Using a rubber spatula, mix the goat cheese, mascarpone and orange zest together until well combined and smooth. Set aside at room temperature. For the olive spread: Add the olives, capers and rosemary to a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Add the olive oil and pulse to puree; the finished spread should still have a little texture but be cohesive. To assemble: Place a dollop of the goat cheese mixture on each potato crisp and top with a spoonful of the olive spread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 32778,&quot;Mile-High S\\u2019mores Pie 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (from 10 to 12 crackers) 3 tablespoons sugar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 cups whole milk 4 large egg yolks 1/2 cup sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon salt 8 ounces milk chocolate, finely chopped 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 5 large egg whites 3/4 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Pinch of salt 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: Make the crust: Preheat the oven to 350? F. Mix the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter in a medium bowl until combined. Press evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Bake until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes; set aside to cool. Make the filling: Heat the milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat until almost simmering. Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium bowl to make a thick paste. Whisk about one-third of the warm milk into the egg mixture until smooth. Add this mixture to the remaining milk in the saucepan and cook, whisking constantly, until it starts to bubble and thicken, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking, whisking, until thick like pudding, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the chocolate until melted and combined. Whisk in the butter until combined. Pour the filling into the graham cracker crust and refrigerate until completely cool, about 2 hours. Make the meringue: Whisk the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and salt in a large heatproof bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer) until combined. Set the bowl over a medium saucepan with 1 inch of simmering water (don\\u2019t let the bottom of the bowl touch the water). Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is just hot to the touch and the sugar is completely dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the saucepan. Add the vanilla. Beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4-inch-wide tip. Pipe large marshmallow-size mounds on the surface of the pie, leaving a small border of the filling exposed. Pipe another layer of mounds on top in a slightly smaller circle, then pipe a third layer on top, using the rest of the meringue. Use a kitchen torch to toast the meringue (or toast under the broiler). Refrigerate the pie until cooled before slicing, at least 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 32779,&quot;Candied Nuts 6 cups sugar 3 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon 2 teaspoons ginger powder 1 teaspoon nutmeg 2 teaspoons salt 6 cups whole pecans or walnuts Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: In a large bowl combine sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt.

Add the garlic and onion and cook until the onion is softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the artichoke hearts and stir. Pour in the cream and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and let the mixture thicken for 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the cream cheese and Parmesan and mix until smooth. Add the spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, until the spinach is fully wilted. Set the mixture to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Melt the remaining 1 stick butter in a small saucepan. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. On a clean work surface, halve and trim the phyllo sheets into 18 rectangular pieces (5 1/3 inches by 9 inches). Layer 3 phyllo sheets, brushing the top of each layer with melted butter. (Cover the remaining phyllo dough with plastic wrap and a damp cloth to keep from drying out.) Place 1/4 cup of the filling about 1 inch from the bottom of the phyllo rectangle. Fold the corner of the phyllo dough over the filling, creating a triangular filled pocket. Continue to fold, keeping the triangle shape, until completely sealed. Place it sealed-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining phyllo sheets and filling until you have 6 hand pies. Brush the top of the phyllo triangles with the remaining butter and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 32789,&quot;Pumpkin Waffles with Maple Walnut Apples 1 cup cake flour 1/4 cup wheat germ 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup milk 1/2 cup pumpkin puree 1/4 cup melted butter 1/4 cup melted shortening (transfat-free) 1 large egg 1 large egg white 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 crisp apples, peeled and sliced thinly 1/4 cup pure maple syrup 1/2 cup toasted walnuts (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: For the waffles: Preheat a waffle iron to medium heat. Whisk the flour, wheat germ, sugar, baking powder, spice, nutmeg and salt together in a large bowl. Beat together the milk, pumpkin, melted butter, and melted shortening, egg and egg white, in a large measuring cup. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients. Whisk together to make a slightly lumpy batter. For the topping: Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the apples and let cook until slightly browned, but still crisp, about 4 minutes. Add the maple syrup and walnuts and toss to coat. Pour and spread about 1 cup batter into the waffle iron. Cover and cook until crisp and a rich golden brown, about 7 minutes. (Try to resist the temptation to open the waffle iron too soon. Steam will puff out of the iron while the waffles cook, when this stops the waffle is cooked.) Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve hot with the apples. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 32790,&quot;Wine Roasted Chicken 1/3 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 chicken thighs, bone in and skin on<br> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, preferably from California<br> One 10-ounce package sliced white mushrooms<br> 1 medium shallot, thinly sliced<br> 1 small head fennel, thinly sliced (about 3 cups)<br> 1/2 cup white wine, such as Chardonnay, preferably from California 1/2 cup chicken broth<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 sprigs fresh rosemary<br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 1 lemon, zested and juiced, plus thinly sliced lemon, for garnish Pistachio Pesto Pasta, recipe follows, for serving, optional Fresh basil leaves, for garnish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound fettuccine<br> 1 cup roasted shelled pistachios<br> 3/4 cup fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving<br> 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped<br> Zest and juice of 1 lemon<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season the flour with salt and pepper, then mix together in a shallow bowl. Lightly dust both sides of the chicken with the flour, shaking off any excess. Add the olive oil to a skillet and heat over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken skin-side down and cook until the skin is golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook on the other side until golden brown, about 4 more minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside. Add the mushrooms, shallot and fennel to the skillet and cook just until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the excess dredging flour and stir well. Add the white wine, chicken broth, garlic, rosemary, thyme and lemon juice, then bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the skillet. Add the chicken back to the skillet skin-side up and place in the oven. Cook until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Serve with Pistachio Pesto Pasta if desired and garnish with basil leaves, lemon zest and lemon slices. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions. While the pasta is cooking, make the pistachio pesto. Combine the pistachios, basil, olive oil, Parmesan, garlic, lemon zest and juice and some salt and pepper in a food processor and process until well combined. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta. Toss the pasta with the pistachio sauce, thinning with the pasta water for the desired consistency if necessary. Serve with more Parmesan and basil leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 32791,&quot;Pate a Choux 9 ounces water 4 ounces butter, cold cut into small pieces Pinch salt Pinch sugar 5 ounces all-purpose flour 4 to 5 eggs 1 egg, beaten, for egg wash Cream, for egg wash Instructions: Put the water, butter, salt and sugar in a stainless pan and bring to a boil. As soon as the mixture reaches the boil, and the butter is completely melted, take it off the heat and add all the flour at once. Place the pan back on a medium flame and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon for about 30 seconds, or until the mixture thickens and forms a mass that does not stick to the pan. The mixture should be dried out by stirring over heat for another 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the mixture to a clean bowl. Crack the eggs into a bowl \\before\\ adding to the dough. Add the eggs to the dough, 1 at the time, making sure that each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Use the mixer paddle tool for this job. The mixture should be firm but smooth. It has absorbed enough eggs when: -the spatula runs through the batter and leaves a channel that fills in slowly -a dollop of batter lifted on a spatula curls over on itself and forms a hook. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32792,&quot;Chocolate Chunk Cookies 1 cup (2 sticks) salted butter 1 cup packed brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla<br> 2 large eggs<br> 2 cups plus 2 rounded tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 2 heaping teaspoons instant coffee granules<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 8 ounces good semisweet chocolate, chopped into chunks, plus additional chunks for topping, optional<br> 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans, optional Instructions: Add 1 stick of the butter to a medium skillet over medium heat. Allow it to melt and bubble up for 3 to 4 minutes, swirling the skillet to keep the butter moving around. When the butter is a medium golden brown, remove from the heat (it will continue browning in the skillet over the next 30 seconds or so!). Pour the butter (and any solids in the bottom) into a heatproof bowl and allow it to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, allow the other stick of butter to soften. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream the softened stick of butter together with the brown sugar and granulated sugar until it?s nice and combined. Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until smooth, scraping the bowl if necessary to make sure everything is incorporated. With the mixer on medium low, very slowly drizzle in the cooled melted butter, making sure to add all the darker brown solids. Scrape the bowl and mix again until everything is combined, 20 to 30 seconds. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, coffee granules, baking soda and salt. Stir together, then add it to the butter mixture in 3 increments, mixing on low after each until it?s totally incorporated. Scrape the bowl and beat for a few more seconds. Stir in the chocolate chunks and the pecans if using. In batches, scoop the cookie dough by heaping teaspoons onto the prepared baking sheet. Press extra chocolate chunks into the tops of each cookie if desired. Refrigerate the scooped cookies for 15 minutes, then bake until golden brown, 9 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, then transfer the cookies to a cooling rack. Repeat with the rest of the dough.

Place an oven rack in the center position, without any racks above it. Place the cookies in a food processor; pulse to the texture of sand. Add the crushed cookies to a 10-inch springform pan and pour in the melted butter. Using your hands, mix together the cookie crumbs and butter until they are completely combined and hold together when pinched. Firmly press the cookie crust into the bottom of the pan. Press down on the crust with the bottom of a cup to ensure it is tightly packed. Bake the crust for 12 to 14 minutes, or until golden brown all over. Remove from oven and let cool. When the pan is cool enough to handle, wrap it in foil three-quarters of the way up the sides of the pan--this will prevent any water from getting into the cheesecake while it is baked in a water bath. For the cheesecake: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the cream cheese, granulated sugar, sour cream, eggs, lemon juice, lemon zest, vanilla extract and salt. Slowly turn the mixer up to medium-high speed; continue to mix for 2 minutes, until the ingredients are completely combined and smooth. Set aside 1/4 cup of the lemon curd and reserve it for the topping. With a rubber spatula, fold the remaining lemon curd into the cheesecake mixture. Pour the mixture over the cooled crust and spread it evenly, making sure to flatten the top. Gently tap the pan a few times on a flat surface to even out the mixture. Use the reserved lemon curd to make a fun design in the top of the cheesecake. For instance, you can dollop 15 small dots, about a heaping 1/2 teaspoon each, around the border of the cake and then 6 small dots towards the center of the cake and 1 dot directly in the center. Drag a skewer around the center of the first ring of dots to pull the lemon curd into a teardrop shape. Repeat with the interior circle of lemon curd drops. Place the foil-lined springform pan in a large roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches about 1 inch up the sides of the pan. Bake the cheesecake for 55 to 60 minutes, until the edges are set but the center still has a pudding-like jiggle. Remove from the oven and let sit 10 minutes before removing the pan from the water bath. Let the cheesecake sit another 30 minutes. While the cheesecake is still warm, run a paring knife around the inside edge of the pan and then release the sides of the pan. (If you do this after the cheesecake has cooled completely, the cake may tear slightly.) Let the cheesecake cool completely before slicing and serving. Refrigerate any cheesecake not being served immediately. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13-by-9-inch baking pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides. Lightly grease the foil and sides of the pan with butter. In a food processor, pulse the sugar with the lemon zest and rosemary until well combined. Remove 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture and reserve. Add the butter, vanilla and salt to the food processor with the sugar and pulse until combined. Add the flour, about 1 cup at a time, pulsing to combine after each addition. After the last addition, you may have to stir and scrape down the sides of the food processor to help incorporate all of the flour. Continue to pulse until the dough comes together. Turn the dough out into the prepared baking pan and press it in evenly. Poke the dough all over with a fork and sprinkle it with the reserved sugar. Use a knife to cut the dough into approximately 3-by-1-inch rectangles (or whichever shape you prefer). Bake until golden brown at the edges and golden in the center, about 25 minutes. As soon as the cookies come out of the oven, use a bench scraper or knife to re-cut the lines of the cookies. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then carefully remove the cookies with the foil and cool completely on a rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32799,&quot;Birthday Barbie - Mini Birthday Cakes 1/2 cup unsalted butter, plus softened butter for liners 2/3 cup granulated sugar 3 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 cup whole milk 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened 1 teaspoon pink food coloring 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1/2 cup colored granulated sugar, for decoration Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cover top of cream mixture completely with prepared popcorn. When popcorn starts to melt into mixture, sprinkle some more popcorn on top. When the mixture starts to bubble, remove off of heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the popcorn infuses its flavor into the cream mixture. Strain popcorn mixture through cheesecloth or a mesh strainer and squeeze the mushy popcorn flavor back into the cream mixture. Whisk together the 1 cup sugar, vanilla bean, butter extract, and eggs in a bowl. Still whisking, pour the cream mixture into the egg mixture and pour this back into the cleaned-out pan. Cook until cream thickens on medium-low heat (You don&#39;t want to over cook the eggs because it will leave an egg flavor. Do not leave unattended.) With a silicone spatula, scrape vanilla beans off of the pot and keep stirring all the flavors together. If vanilla beans clump up just break apart on the interior of the pot. When mixture thickens, remove from heat. Put pot into a bowl of ice water. Let cool completely. Churn in an ice-cream maker according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Take bucket and put into freezer for at least 5 hours. To prepare the Fleur De Sel Caramel sauce, mix butter, brown sugar, half-n-half, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat.

Skewer 3 clementine segments through the rounded side onto each of 3 skewers.<br> When the syrup is ready, transfer the saucepan to a heatproof surface or potholder. Carefully tip the pan forward so the syrup pools on one side. Working with one skewer at a time, dip and rotate the fruit in the syrup until completely coated, then gently shake the skewer over the pan to remove any excess syrup. Place the skewer on the prepared baking sheet and let harden, about 10 minutes.<br> Repeat with the remaining skewers. As the amount of syrup dwindles, use a spoon to help coat the fruit (see Cook\\u2019s Note).

Warm in the microwave for 30 seconds or on the stove to dissolve the gelatin and strain the mixture into a small pitcher. Divide among your serving glasses and chill until set, about 30 minutes. Repeat the process with the purple grape juice, pouring it on top of the strawberry-banana jelly, and chill to set. Repeat the process with the orange juice, chill to set, and serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 32830,&quot;Roasted Beets with Lemon-Thyme Dressing fleur de sel 5 large beets, rinsed 1 Tbs. olive oil 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 Tbs. chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 tsp. lemon zest juice of 1 lemon salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Trim stems off beets and place them onto the middle of a large piece of aluminum foil. Drizzle beets with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season them with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Wrap beets up in foil, making a tightly sealed but roomy package. Bake beets in foil package on a sheet pan for 45 minutes to an hour at 400 degrees F, until tender. Remove from oven and carefully open up foil package and let cool.<br> When cool to the touch, wrap one beet at a time in paper towels and rub skin off. Repeat with remaining beets. This may stain your hands red unless you wear gloves. Cut peeled beets into chunks and place in a mixing bowl. In a small container with a tight fitting lid, combine olive oil, thyme, lemon juice, lemon zest and some salt and pepper. Close container and shake vigorously. Pour dressing over beets and toss to coat.

Use kitchen shears to cut 3 shark fins from each strip, shaping each fin so it is rounded on one side, pointed at the tip and concave on the inside. Set on parchment to keep from sticking while you make the bark. For the bark: Line a baking sheet or pan with foil. Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water, and stir with a rubber spatula. Just before the chocolate is completely melted, add the oil and stir to blend. Remove from the heat and stir vigorously until completely smooth. Set aside and let cool until just slightly warm, about 8 minutes. Spread the chocolate mixture on the prepared baking sheet so it&#39;s about 1/2-inch-thick. Add about 20 drops of food coloring all over the chocolate and use a wooden skewer to swirl aggressively around to make the waves; make sure you swirl in multiple directions and drag the color out to the edges of the chocolate. Sprinkle several small pools of red sanding sugar over the chocolate. Add the gummy fish, pretzel fish and candy rings in a random patter. Add the marshmallows in clumps of 3 or 4 to make the surf. Put the bark in the refrigerator until it just begins to set, 5 minutes. Add the shark fins with the points facing up.<br> Set the bark aside at room temperature until firm, about 2 hours. Remove the bark from the foil and break into pieces. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 32833,&quot;Spiral-Cut Fillet of Beef with Pesto 2 pounds center-cut beef fillet (net weight after chain and silverskin are removed) Sea salt, preferably gray salt, and freshly ground black pepper Basil Pesto made with only half the oil, recipe follows Extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups firmly packed fresh basil leaves 1/3 cup olive oil 3 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic Sea salt, preferably gray salt, and freshly ground black pepper Pinch powdered ascorbic acid (vitamin C) 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: Ask the butcher to spiral cut or jelly-roll cut the fillet for you to create a flat, rectangular sheet of beef. Pound the meat with the heel of your hand to a thickness of about 1/2-inch. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the pesto evenly over the meat, leaving a 1-inch border along one of the long sides. Starting from the opposite long side, roll the meat into a log like a jelly roll. Using kitchen string and starting 1/2-inch from one end, tie the meat in 8 places at equal intervals of approximately 1-inch. Slice between the ties to create 8 pinwheels. Prepare a hot fire in a charcoal grill, preheat a gas grill, or preheat a stove-top cast-iron grill pan over high heat. Drizzle the meat with olive oil, then grill on both sides, turning once, until done, to your taste. Let rest for a few minutes, then remove the strings and serve. Prepare a bowl of ice water. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Put the basil in a sieve and plunge it into the boiling water, pushing the leaves down into the water and stirring them so they blanch evenly. Blanch for 15 seconds, then plunge the basil into the ice water to cool quickly. Drain immediately, squeeze the basil dry, and chop it roughly. In a blender, puree the basil with the oil, pine nuts, garlic, salt, and ascorbic acid. When well blended, add the cheese and whir briefly just to mix. Transfer to a bowl and adjust the seasoning. Yield: about 3/4 cup, enough for 1 pound pasta. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 32834,&quot;Bolognese Lasagne 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 8 ounces thick-cut bacon, cut into small pieces<br> 5 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 ribs celery, finely chopped<br> 2 large carrots, finely chopped<br> 1 medium sweet onion, finely chopped<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 3 pounds ground beef (80/20)<br> 4 cups chicken stock<br> 2 cups dry white wine<br> One 28-ounce can pureed San Marzano tomatoes 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 cups whole milk, heated 2 cups heavy cream, heated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup grated fontina cheese Pinch nutmeg 1 tablespoon butter, for the baking dish Two 1-pound boxes lasagna noodles, uncooked 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Instructions: For the Bolognese ragu: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Smear 1 tablespoon butter in an even layer over the bottom and sides of a Dutch oven. Set aside. In a large skillet over medium heat, render the bacon until cooked through but not crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat from the skillet. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and melt over medium heat. Add the garlic, celery, carrots and onion and saute until the onion is translucent and the vegetables are softened, about 8 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to the Dutch oven. Add the oil to the skillet and add the beef. Cook the meat, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon, until uniformly brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer the beef and bacon to the Dutch oven and pour in the chicken stock, wine and tomato puree. Transfer to the oven and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 4 hours. If there is a large amount of fat on top of the sauce, skim it off with a large spoon. Stir in the cream and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper if needed. For the cheese sauce: In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour, whisking for a minute. Add the milk and cream and cook, whisking, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. (The process goes more quickly if you warm the milk and cream beforehand.) Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat, add the fontina and nutmeg and whisk to combine. For the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish along the bottom and sides. Spread a thin layer of the ragu sauce on the bottom of the baking dish and top with a single layer of noodles. Top with another layer of the ragu sauce. Spoon a thin layer of the cheese sauce over the ragu in the baking dish. Top with a second layer of noodles and continue layering with the ragu, cheese sauce and noodles until you&#39;ve finished the noodles and reached the top. Finish with a last layer of ragu and cheese sauce and top with the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Bake until bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Dolcetto, GSM]&quot; 32835,&quot;Mini Thanksgiving Pressed Sandwiches 1 (5-pound) turkey breast Salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 sprigs fresh rosemary 6 sage leaves 1 (15-ounce) can chicken broth 1 stick softened unsalted butter 2 French baguettes, sliced into approximately 1/4-inch thick slices 1 cup Cranberry Mayo 1 (7-ounce) box stuffing mix, prepared according to box instructions 1/2 pound havarti cheese, sliced 1/2 cup cranberry sauce 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons sour cream 2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard 1 tablespoon hot sauce 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously season the turkey breast with salt and pepper. On a sheet pan fitted with a rack arrange the sage and thyme and put the turkey breast on top of the herbs. Put in the oven and pour the chicken broth into the sheet pan. Roast until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove the breast from the oven to a cutting board and cover with foil. Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing. For the Cranberry Mayo: In a small bowl mix together the cranberry sauce, mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, hot sauce and chives. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Lightly butter 1 side of a slice of bread and put the buttered side down, on a sheet pan lined with waxed paper. Spread a little of the Cranberry Mayo onto the bread and top with some of the sliced turkey. Top with a tablespoon of stuffing and spread a little bit more of the Cranberry Mayo on top of the stuffing. Top with half a slice of cheese. Lightly butter another slice of bread and put the buttered side up, on top of the sandwich. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Working in batches, put the sandwiches into a preheated panini press and cook until the cheese is melted and the bread is lightly browned and crispy, about 4 minutes. Stove Top Instructions: Working in batches, put the sandwiches in a large skillet over medium heat and cook until bread is browned and crispy and the cheese is melted, about 3 to 4 minutes per side, Arrange the sandwiches on a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 32836,&quot;Turkish Pide with Eggs and Sucuk 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 1 teaspoon instant yeast Kosher salt Vegetable oil, for the bowl 1 pound ka?ar cheese, shredded (about 5 cups; use mozzarella if ka?ar is not available) 4 ounces hot or mild sucuk (Turkish dry sausage), casing removed, sliced into 1/8-inch-thick pieces 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 5 large eggs Instructions: For the dough: Put 1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110 degrees F) in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Add the flour, sugar, yeast and 1 teaspoon salt to the water and mix on low until barely incorporated. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes for the flour to absorb the water. Attach the dough hook and knead the dough on medium high until smooth, about 7 minutes. Coat a large bowl with vegetable oil and transfer the dough to the bowl. Move the dough around so it\\u2019s coated with oil on all sides. Cover and let rise in a draft-free space, such as an unlit oven, until increased in size but not quite doubled, about 1 hour. Uncover the dough and place on a well-floured surface. Place a baking sheet upside down on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Turn a second baking sheet upside down and cover with a piece of parchment. Divide the dough into 5 pieces (see Cook&#39;s Note) and cover 4 with a damp cloth. Roll out the uncovered piece using a rolling pin into an oval about 20 inches long and 5 inches wide. Transfer the dough to the parchment on the back of the baking sheet. Repeat with a second piece of dough. For the toppings: Sprinkle about 1 cup ka?ar on each oval, leaving about a 1-inch border on all sides. Top the cheese with sucuk slices, leaving some space in the middle to add an egg later. Fold the dough up and over about 3/4 inch onto the cheese on all sides and pinch the ends. Brush with vegetable oil. Slide the pides with the parchment onto the baking sheet in the oven. Bake until the cheese is melted and starting to brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Crack 2 eggs into 2 small bowls. Add 1 egg on top of each pide in the middle. Continue to bake until the eggs are set to your preference, another 4 to 5 minutes.

Cut the top 1/2 inch from the 4 apples. Using a melon baller or spoon, dig out the insides of the apples and reserve, leaving 1/4 inch flesh next to the skin. Remove the cores and seeds and discard. Coarsely chop the scooped fruit and add it to a medium bowl; you should have at least 1 1/2 cups. If not, peel, core and dice the additional apple and add it to the bowl. Sprinkle the lemon juice over top and toss to coat. Add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt to the bowl and mix. Divide the filling among the hollowed-out apples. Roll out the pie crust and using a pastry wheel, cut it into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Brush a light coating of egg wash along the top edge of each apple. Weave the strips into a lattice atop each apple, using the egg wash to adhere (see Cook&#39;s Note). Lightly brush the top of each lattice with the egg wash.

A brine is a slower process where the rub, sugar and salt are diluted to penetrate the protein and break it down so that the meat is juicy, flavorful and tender after cooked. I love brined pork and chicken, but if I am cooking late and didn&#39;t think about it the day before, I will have to do a nice rub on the meat, which is just more concentrated and expedited, and that&#39;s what I have here. Pork chops go with so many accompaniments but I do love the acidity of apples or an applesauce with pork chops and the bite of mustard greens. You can use mizuna, or arugula if you cannot find mustard greens. Also, you can put a schmear of hot mustard mixed with a little honey or molasses on the plate instead for the kick. I like onion rings, in general. My other favorite accompaniment to pork chops is kimchee tossed with some fresh fruit such as peaches or plums. To cook the pork chops: Grind all the spices together with the sugar and rub all over the pork chops. Set aside for 30 minutes to an hour at room temperature. Preheat the grill on high or heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat on the stovetop and preheat the oven to 375 degrees (Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan if cooking in cast iron). Cook the pork on one side for 4 to 5 minutes on the grill or in cast iron. Flip over and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes on the grill; if cooking in cast iron, flip the chop and transfer to the oven for 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes. To cook the sauteed apples: In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar, 1 tablespoon water and a drop of lemon juice. Cook until sugar caramelizes to golden brown. Turn off the heat and add the apple slices and star anise. Return the pan to medium-high heat, stir in the butter and remaining lemon juice. Saute, stirring, for 2 minutes, adding the brandy in the last minute of cooking with a pinch of salt. Simmer briefly to burn off the alcohol and thicken the caramel. Set aside. To cook the onion rings: Bring the canola oil to 360 degrees F in a large pot. Combine the flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper in a bowl. Pour the buttermilk into a shallow dish or bowl. Dip the onion rings in the flour mixture to dredge, shaking off any excess. Dip in the buttermilk to coat, and then back into the flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour. Working in batches, fry the rings until light golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.

Refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours. Drain and discard the brine. For the stock: If you have the time, allow the chicken to drain and dry out about 30 minutes prior to searing. It will create a better crust on the chicken and more brown bits on the bottom of the pot, ultimately adding more flavor to the gumbo. Sprinkle the chicken pieces, including the reserved neck, back and wing tips, with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven (enameled cast iron preferred), heat the oil over high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken pieces and brown well on all sides, turning as needed. Add the celery, carrots, onions and jalapenos, and continue to brown for an additional 10 minutes. Add 1 gallon water and the liquid smoke and bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to maintain a strong simmer. Cook for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. After 1 1/2 hours, remove the chicken pieces, discarding the back, neck and wing tips. Strain the stock and reserve. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat and shred, discarding the bones and fat. For the gumbo: In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the sausages and cook until the fat has rendered down, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausages from the pan and set aside. Add the bacon fat and, when shimmering, add the onions, celery, bell peppers and Anaheim peppers. Saute, stirring frequently, until the onions are just starting to color, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes more, being careful not to let it burn. Add the flour, 1/4 cup at a time, stirring constantly. Stir until a dark golden roux has developed, 11 to 13 minutes. Add 1 cup at a time of the stock, incorporating well after each addition, to total 6 cups. Add the reserved sausages, shredded chicken, cayenne and white pepper into the pot. Heat through and add the salt and black pepper. If the gumbo is too thick, add a bit more stock to the pot, a little at a time, until the desired consistency is reached. Serve over rice and garnish with parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 32847,&quot;Spinach and Ricotta-Stuffed Chicken Breasts with Lemony White Wine Sauce 1 cup cooked, chopped, and drained fresh spinach 1/2 cup ricotta 1/2 cup Gorgonzola 4 slices cooked bacon, crumbled Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg 1/2 cup dry white wine 1/2 cup homemade chicken stock 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 lemon, juiced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Chopped parsley leaves, for garnish 2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast halves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Instructions: Make the Stuffing: In a bowl, combine the spinach, ricotta, Gorgonzola, and bacon and mix well.

Whisk in the mustard, lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside. Make the Chicken: Place each chicken breast between 2 doubled-up sheets of plastic wrap, and pound to an even 1/4-inch thickness with a meat-pounder or rolling pin. Divide the stuffing between the breasts, mounding it along the center of each. Fold the bottom edge of each breast over the stuffing, fold in the sides, and roll forward until completely wrapped, to form a tight rolled package. Secure each flap with a toothpick. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper, to taste. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Cover the skillet, turn the heat down to low, and cook until just cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the sauce into the skillet over high heat and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon. Slice the chicken into medallions, divide among plates, and spoon some of the sauce over each.

Put an oven rack in the lowest position with a 6-inch clearance above. Cut six 6-inch squares of heavy-duty foil and six 1-inch squares of heavy-duty foil. Using the larger foil squares, wrap each sugar cone, molding to the shape of the cone to cover completely and tucking in excess. Spray the outside of the foil generously with cooking spray and set aside. Brush the 6 tortillas on both sides using 2 tablespoons of oil. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of Parmesan over each side of each tortilla. Curl a tortilla into a cone shape with a closed point and a 3-inch-diameter top and secure the seam with a toothpick. Trim the top of the cone with scissors to make an even edge. Slip the sugar cone inside the tortilla cone to help hold its shape and put it on a large baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, oil, cheese, and cones. Bake for 5 minutes, then wrap the tip of each cone with the small foil squares to keep the tips from burning. Return to the oven until the cones are lightly browned and crisp and hold their shape, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove the foil tips, and gently remove the foil cone inserts and toothpicks. Discard the toothpicks. Unwrap and reserve the sugar cones for another use. If the tortilla cones are still soft, return them, empty, to the oven, to cook until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes more.<br> Meanwhile make the sausage filling. Add 2 teaspoons oil to a medium pan over medium-high heat, then add the sausage and peppers. Cook, stirring often and breaking the meat apart, for 1 minute. Continue to cook undisturbed to allow the sausage to brown, 1 more minute. Scrape up the browned bits and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is cooked through and browned, about 4 minutes more. Add the pizza sauce and cook until heated through, 1 minute. Set aside and keep warm until ready to use.<br> Cover the top of a deep pot with heavy-duty foil, wrapping it taut over the top. Using the tip of a knife, cut six 1-inch Xs in the foil spaced evenly apart. When the cones are cool enough to handle, place one cone in each of the slits.<br> Sprinkle a pinch of the mozzarella inside each cone. Add 1 tablespoon of sauce, followed by a pinch of cheese, another tablespoon sauce and another tablespoon of cheese in each cone. Repeat with the remaining cones. Bake the pizza cones on the lowest rack of the oven until the cheese is melted and the sauce is hot, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately with crushed red pepper, oregano and torn basil leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 32875,&quot;Fried Ring Bologna 1 large ring bologna Butter, for frying Extra-virgin olive oil, for frying Crackers, for serving Instructions: Heat a large, preferably cast-iron, pan over medium heat.

Line a sheet tray with a silicone mat. Make 4 even, very thin circles of Parmigiano on the mat. Be sure that the circles are not touching. Bake 7 to 8 minutes or until the cheese has melted, turned golden brown and looks like lace. Remove the tray from the oven and let the crisps cool for about 1 minute. Using a spatula, remove the crisps from the silicone mat and reserve on a plate. For the salad: Fill your sink with cool water. Toss in all the salad greens and gently swish until all the dirt and grit falls to the bottom of the basin. Gently lift the greens out of the water and put in a salad spinner. If the greens are especially dirty empty the sink, rinse to rid of dirt and repeat the process. Spin the greens until they are dry and still very fresh looking. If not using the greens right away, store them wrapped loosely in paper towels then sealed in plastic bags in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator. In a large bowl, place the greens and herbs. Add the tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers. Drizzle in half of the oil and vinegar and season with salt. Using your hands, gently toss the salad to combine. Taste!

Reduce heat to medium and simmer, covered, for about 30 to 45 minutes or until the sauce has thickened. Heat oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven or electric fryer. Rinse the chicken drumettes and pat dry with paper towels. Season chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper; Set aside. In a shallow bowl or resealable bag, combine remaining salt and pepper with the flour and paprika. In a separate dish, mix together the eggs and evaporated milk until well combined. Roll the seasoned chicken pieces in the flour, a few at a time, until well coated. Then, dip chicken in the milk and egg mixture, followed by another coat of seasoned flour. Allow the chicken to sit in the flour and dry out for about 5 minutes, ensuring that the coating will stay on better. Carefully add the chicken pieces to the fryer as will fit without touching. Do not crowd the pan or the temperature will lower, making the chicken greasy. Fry for 5 minutes, then turn the pieces over and fry the other side 5 minutes. Cook for about 10 minutes total, or until the pieces begin to float. Remove chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain, about 5 minutes. To serve, place the fried wings in a large bowl and toss with the barbecue sauce (or less, to taste).

With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil and water; once added, continue mixing for 1 minute. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until smooth. Divide the dough into 3 even pieces and form into balls. Spray with cooking oil and then place in a large resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate overnight or up to 4 days for best flavor. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) When ready to bake, transfer each dough ball to a lightly oiled bowl, cover and set aside until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Make the pizza pies: Preheat a gas grill to 500 degrees F or get a charcoal grill as hot as you can. Lightly dust a work surface with all-purpose flour. For each pizza: Gently flatten a piece of dough with the palm of your hand and then roll it into a 10- to 11-inch round, about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s not perfectly or even barely round; just make sure it&#39;s of uniform thickness (even if it&#39;s the shape of a beaver tail!). Sprinkle a pizza peel with semolina flour and transfer the stretched dough to the peel. (If you don&#39;t have a peel, use the back of an upturned sheet pan instead.) Slide the dough directly onto the grill. Cook until golden grill marks appear, about 1 minute per side; use tongs to flip. For the white pizza: In a small bowl, mix together the ricotta and fontina cheeses along with the thyme, rosemary, honey and some salt and pepper. Brush a grilled crust with olive oil. Spread with the cheese mixture in an even layer. Use the peel to return the pizza to the grill. Cover and cook for about 3 minutes, until the cheese is completely melted and the crust is fully browned. Remove from the grill and top with the prosciutto and arugula. For the margherita pizza: Brush a grilled crust with olive oil and spread evenly with the marinara sauce. Top with the torn mozzarella and sprinkle with the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Use the peel to transfer the pizza to the grill. Cover and cook until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown. Remove from grill and top with torn basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 32887,&quot;Buratta Truffle Pizza 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing<br> 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast<br> 3.55 cups pizza flour, preferably Caputo Nuvola Super 3.55 cups soft wheat flour, preferably Caputo Type 1 10 teaspoons kosher salt<br> Fine semolina, for dusting 80 leaves fresh basil<br> 20 grape tomatoes, halved 8 truffle burrata, preferably Belgioioso<br> Olive oil, for drizzling<br> 16 slices prosciutto di Parma<br> Instructions: For the pizza dough: Combine the sugar, oil, yeast and 2 cups cold water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let the mixture sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Mix the two types of flour and salt in a bowl. With the motor running, slowly add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture. Keep mixing until a smooth, elastic dough forms, about 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Divide the dough into four 12-ounce pieces and shape into balls. Transfer the balls to a lightly greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish and brush with oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours (see Cook&#39;s Note). For the pizza: Place a pizza stone under the oven broiler. Preheat the broiler for 30 minutes. Working in batches, dust a ball of dough heavily with semolina flour. Using your fingertips, press the dough from the center out into a 10-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick, leaving a 1-inch thick crust around the edges. Hold the dough straight up, and with your fingertips circling the crust, let the dough naturally fall. Slide your fingers around the crust in a circular motion (like you would turn a steering wheel), until the dough in the center is stretched to about 1/8-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining dough balls. Transfer the dough to a semolina-dusted pizza peel. Spread each pizza with about 20 leaves fresh basil, then layer on 10 cherry tomato halves and break 2 burrata on top of each pizza and spread it on. Drizzle with oil. Slide a pizza onto the stone and broil until the cheese melts and the crust is puffed and charred in spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat for the remaining pizzas. Top hot pizzas with 4 slices prosciutto and serve hot. Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Gavi, Tempranillo]&quot; 32888,&quot;Spaghetti with Arugula Pesto and Seared Jumbo Shrimp 2 cups fresh arugula 1 garlic clove 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound jumbo shrimp 1 pound spaghetti Lemon zest, for garnish 10 parsley leaves, chopped, for garnish Instructions: Blend the arugula and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. With the machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup of oil, processing until well blended. Transfer the pesto to a large bowl. Stir in the Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Prepare the grill (high heat). Using a knife, cut the back of the shrimp. Brush the shrimp with oil. Sprinkle with salt. Grill the shrimp until just cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the shrimp to a plate. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Toss the pasta with the pesto in the large bowl to coat, adding the reserved cooking liquid 1 tablespoon at a time to moisten. Top with the grilled shrimp. Garnish with the lemon zest and parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Ros]&quot; 32889,&quot;Curried Tuna Tartare on Pappadam 1 1/2 tablespoons water 1 1/2 teaspoons mayonnaise 2 teaspoons sour cream Salt and pepper to taste 12-ounce tuna steak 1/2 cup cucumber, peeled, seeded, cut into 1/8-inch dice 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives Juice of 1/2 small lemon 8 shots of hot sauce, or to taste 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil 1 package plain pappadams, 11/4-inches in diameter 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 2 teaspoons finely diced onion 1 teaspoon curry powder 2 teaspoons finely diced apple 1/2 banana, finely diced Instructions: Heat oil in small skillet over medium heat, add the onion, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the curry powder, apple, and banana, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes stirring continuously. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons water and cook for 4 minutes more, stirring. Remove from the heat and set aside until cool. (Make sure the curry sauce is cool before blending with the mayonnaise or it will separate. Add the curry mixture, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt, and pepper to the bowl of a food processor and blend until smooth. Add a little more water if the curry sauce is too thick. Set aside. Cut the tuna into 1/4-inch dice and place into a very cold bowl. Add the cucumber, 1 teaspoon of chives, 1/2 cup curry sauce, lemon juice, hot sauce and salt. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Cover and place into the refrigerator until ready to assemble. This can all be done up to 3 hours in advance. Heat 1/2-inch of oil in a small skillet over medium heat. When hot, add 2 or 3 pappadams at a time, turning them over when they start to curl. Cook until bubbles appear, or they start to turn golden brown, about 20 seconds. Do not allow them to get to dark or they will have a burnt flavor. Remove and drain on a paper towel. Keep them in a warm oven until ready to use up to 2 hours; this will dry them out and keep them crisp. Arrange 1 teaspoonful of the tuna tartare on each mini pappadam, and garnish with the remaining chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 32890,&quot;Corn-Acopia Soup 3 garlic cloves, minced 2 tablespoons corn oil 3 cups canned tomatoes, diced 3/4 cup green beans, diced 1/2 cup green bell peppers, chopped 5 ears fresh corn kernels, cut off the cobs 1 quart chicken broth 1 tablespoon lemon juice 2 teaspoons dried thyme 1 teaspoon celery seed 1 teaspoon Cajun spice blend Salt and pepper, to taste 2 dashes red pepper sauce 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, coarsely chopped, for garnish Instructions: In a large stock pot over low heat, saute the garlic in oil for 1 minute.

Combine flour and sugar in a separate large mixing bowl. Slowly add the yeast mixture. Continue mixing by hand until combined, about 6 minutes. (See Cook&#39;s Note.) (You may also use a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment.) Add sea salt. Mix for 2 to 3 minutes. Add olive oil and mix for 2 to 3 minutes. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rest at room temperature until dough starts to rise up the inside the bowl, about 3 hours. Transfer to the refrigerator to rise for at least 17 or up to 48 hours. For the Detroit style pizza sauce: Combine the ground tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, oil, salt and pepper in a bowl with a hand mixer or immersion blender. Refrigerate for at least 17 or up to 24 hours. Heat pizza sauce to 165 degrees F on the stovetop before applying to pizza. Use a knife to cut and portion the dough into 9-ounce portions. Coat a Detroit style pizza pan with vegetable shortening, butter or olive oil. Make sure to get the fat into the corners and up the sides of the pan. Push a portion of dough into pan, making sure to keep the dough even and push it into the corners. Be delicate with the dough during your push. (You can push your dough into shape on the kitchen countertop and then place the pushed dough into the pan.) (Save the remaining dough for another use.) Put the lid on the pan and allow the dough to rise in the pan for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F, preferably with a pizza stone in the oven.

Let the pork sit covered at room temperature for 30 minutes. Pat the pork dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle the pork generously with salt and pepper. Heat a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat with the oil, 2 turns of the pan. Place the pork in the pot and evenly brown the meat all over, about 10 to 12 minutes time in total. Remove the pork and reserve. Turn heat down to medium, add 3 tablespoons of the butter to the pot. When it foams, add the caraway, fennel and mustard seeds and stir for 1 minute. Add in the onions, apples, thyme, nutmeg and some salt and pepper. Cook to begin to soften, 5 minutes. Then deglaze the pot with the vinegar. Stir in the honey and beer, scraping up the bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add in the chicken stock and then the reserved pork, and bring to a simmer. Cover and place the pot in the oven until the meat is very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours, turning the meat halfway through cooking. Remove the pork from the pot, place on a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. When cool enough to handle, pull the meat apart with two forks. Return the meat to the braising liquid. The apples and onions will have almost completely melted into a chunky sauce. Cool and store in the refrigerator for a make-ahead meal. Place the potatoes and the parsnips in a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, salt the water and cook until tender. Drain and return to the hot pot. Mash the potatoes with the milk and the remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Then season with salt and pepper, and add the cheese and mustard. Taste to adjust the seasonings, cool and store for a make-ahead meal. To serve, reheat the pork, covered over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reheat the mashed potatoes and parsnips over medium heat covered with a little stock or milk to loosen. Mashed potatoes can be kept warm for hours by placing them in a covered saucepot inside of a larger pot filled with an inch of water at a low simmer. Serve the pork alongside or on top of the potatoes, and sprinkle chopped parsley on everything. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Ribera del Duero]&quot; 32910,&quot;Oyster and Bacon Stuffing 16 cups 1/2-inch cubes stale white bread (about 2 pounds) 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 pound applewood-smoked bacon, thinly sliced 1 large red onion, diced 3 stalks celery, diced 2 carrots, diced 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 3 cups chicken or vegetable stock 1/2 cup fresh marjoram or oregano leaves 2 large eggs 2 bunches scallions, thinly sliced 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley 2 teaspoons Old Bay Seasoning 1 pint raw shucked oysters with their liquor, roughly chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 cup grated parmesan cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured piece of parchment. With a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to a 1/4-inch-thick circle, about 12 inches in diameter. Cut out as many 3 1/2-inch rounds as possible. Gather the scraps and cut out more rounds. Repeat until you have 12 rounds. Arrange the cookies on the prepared baking sheets about 1/2 inch apart. Bake until just set on top, about 8 minutes. Cool completely on the baking sheets on a rack. Assemble the cookies: Working quickly, remove the plastic wrap from the ice cream and use a 3-inch cookie cutter to cut out a round of ice cream (lift the plastic wrap from the bottom to help you lift out the round). Sandwich the ice cream between 2 cookies. Sprinkle on red and blue sprinkles along part of the sides and immediately transfer the ice cream sandwich to a plate in the freezer. Repeat with the remaining cookies to make 6 ice cream sandwiches. (The ice cream scraps can be gathered and kept frozen in an airtight container). Freeze the sandwiches until firm enough to serve, 3 to 4 hours.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 32930,&quot;Tarte Tatin 6 large apples, preferably Golden Delicious juice of 1 lemon 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 6 tablespoons butter approximately 14 oz. puff pastry 8 ounces creme fraiche 1/4 cup sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions: Tarte Tatin Peel the apples, cut in quarters, remove the cores (cutting each quarter at the core so it has a flat side), and toss the quarters in a large bowl with the lemon juice and 1/2 cup of the sugar. Let rest for 1/2 hour. Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a round, 10\\ cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cover with the remaining cup of sugar, sprinkled over the butter in an even layer. Add the apple quarters to the pan, arranging them in a decorative pattern, rounded side down. Top the apples with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, cut into little bits. Cook the apples over medium heat for approximately 40 minutes, occasionally spooning the bubbling liquid over the apples. This part of the recipe takes almost constant surveillance. In a few minutes, you will begin to see brown caramel bubbling up in the part of the pan over direct heat. Immediately shift the pan so that other non-browned parts go over the direct heat. Over 40 minutes, you may have to shift the pan a dozen times or more to get things evenly browned. The apples are ready when the liquid in the pan has turned to a thick dark-tan ooze. The apples should still be slightly resilient. Do not allow the apples to get entirely soft, or the liquid to turn dark brown. This part of the tarte tatin can be prepared hours in advance, or you can proceed immediately with the recipe. Pre-heat an oven to 375 degrees. Flour a work surface and place the sheet of puff pastry on it. Roll out the pastry until it is slightly larger than the interior of the apple pan. Lay it over the apples, tucking any protruding edges under the apples in the pan. Place the apple pan in the oven and cook for approximately 30 minutes, or until the puff pastry has risen and cooked. The pastry should be dry and flaky inside. Remove from the oven, and let the tarte rest for a few minutes. Place a large, round platter over the tarte and flip it over, releasing the tarte from the pan. The browned apples will be on top, the pastry on the bottom. Serve hot, if desired. You can also serve this tarte warm--my preference--about one hour after cooking. You can also serve it room temperature, or cold. Serve with Vanilla Creme Fraiche, if desired. Vanilla Creme Fraiche Blend ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Pour along tarte tatin. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 32931,&quot;Carolina BBQ Sandwich 3 pounds bone-out Boston butt 1 tablespoon Cajun spice Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cups medium-dice mixed carrots, celery and onions 2 bay leaves Chicken stock, for covering pork 1/3 cup stone-ground mustard 2 tablespoons hot sauce 2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon paprika Six 4 1/2-inch brioche buns, halved and warmed 2 cups prepared coleslaw<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Place the ropes in the tart shell, one across the other at right angles, so that the shell is divided into 4 equal quadrants. Spoon the raspberry and apricot preserves, pastry cream, and cherries each separately into 1 quadrant. Brush the dough with the egg. Baking: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake until light golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Immediately brush the fruit with the glaze. Let cool, to room temperature, on a rack. By Mixer: Cream the butter and the sugar in a mixer bowl with the paddle until pale and creamy. Add the egg, egg yolk, vanilla, and lemon juice, 1 at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Add the flour and salt and mix until the dough comes together and is consistent but still soft. Be careful not to overmix or the pastry will be tough. At this point you may pat the dough into place in a buttered tart pan and bake it immediately after chilling. Otherwise, divide it into thirds or halves, depending on the size tart you are planning, or flatten the whole amount into a 4 to 5-inch disk. Chilling: Wrap the dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate at least 1 hour but no longer than 1 day. Shaping: Let the dough stand at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before rolling it out. Knead the dough briefly on a lightly floured surface to loosen it and make it supple enough for shaping. Roll the dough out 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick with a rolling pin and ease the dough into a lightly buttered pan. Trim the edge by running the rolling pin or a dough scraper over the edge of the pan to cut the dough neatly and then tidy the edge with your fingers. For 1 (9-inch) tart shell, use 9 to 10 ounces (250 to 300 grams) dough and roll into a circle. Line a buttered 9-inch tart pan with the dough. Storage: Store the remaining unrolled dough, including all scraps which may be used again, in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 days or the freezer up to 1 month. Let frozen dough thaw in the refrigerator for 24 hours before rolling it out. Resting: Refrigerate the dough-lined pan for 20 to 30 minutes to reduce shrinking when the pastry is baked. Baking. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. For partially baked shells: Line each shell with aluminum foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until set, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and let cool 5 to 10 minutes. Place the tart pan on top of a smaller can, such as a coffee can, and gently release the side of the pan from the baked tart crust. Let cool completely on a rack. Slowly heat the milk, 1 teaspoon of the sugar, and the lemon zest in the top of a double boiler over simmering water or in a small heavy saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining sugar, the egg yolks, and salt in a small bowl until thick but still golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Sift in the flour, a little at a time, whisking briskly to mix thoroughly. Whisk 1/4 cup of the boiling milk mixture. 1 tablespoon at a time, into the egg mixture; then pour the egg mixture into the remaining milk mixture. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. As it begins to reach a boil and look lumpy, whisk it vigorously to smooth it. When the cream is as thick as mayonnaise, reduce the heat and whisk or stir for another minute. Remove from the heat and discard the lemon zest. Beat in the vanilla and then the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Cool the cream quickly by placing the pan in a bowl of cold water or by spreading the cream out on 2 baking sheets. Smear a little butter on top and cover tightly with plastic wrap so that the cream doesn&#39;t develop a skin. Cool completely in the refrigerator. You may want to thin it with 1 or 2 tablespoons milk before using. This pastry cream will keep 4 to 5 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer up to 2 months. Heat the preserves and water in a small heavy saucepan over moderate heat until the mixture comes to a boil and strain through a sieve. Use the glaze while it is still warm. Any leftover glaze will keep indefinitely in a covered jar; heat again before using. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 32956,&quot;Grilled Summer Pizzette with Caramelized Peaches, Burrata, Arugula and Crispy Serrano 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 8 ounces thinly sliced serrano ham 2 pounds frozen pizza dough, thawed All-purpose flour, for sprinkling Olive oil, for brushing 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 peaches, thinly sliced on a mandolin slicer 1 teaspoon light brown sugar Salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 ounces baby arugula, washed (about 6 cups)<br> 2 pounds burrata cheese Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Lightly brush 2 baking sheets with vegetable oil.

Cooks Note: Can be sealed in storage bag or jar for up to 1 week. This will make about 6 cups. Combine all of the ensalada ingredients in a glass bowl and mix well. Set aside for tacos. Cut the salmon fillet into 3 equal parts and arrange on the pre-soaked cedar planks. Cover the salmon liberally with the spice rub (approximately 1 cup per pound). It is ok if some spice rub falls onto the plank. Heat the grill to high. Put the salmon planks over very hot mesquite/oak or hickory coals and cover the grill until the spice rub has melted to form a coating over salmon and plank, about 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the cover from the grill. If the planks flame up be sure the flames do not scorch the fillet, as the taste of burned sugar should not be the dominating flavor. Remove the salmon planks from the grill and loosely cover with foil. Allow the fillets to rest for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the fillets to a large bowl and set aside. In the meantime, toast the corn tortillas over the hot coals or on a preheated comal. Add the ensalada to the bowl with the salmon and stir lightly to combine. Using 2 overlapping toasted corn tortillas, scoop some of the salmon mixture onto the tortillas and top with some of the cheese. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.

Strain, reserving the broth for another use. When the meat is cool enough to handle, shred it into coarse strands with your fingers or 2 forks ? don&#39;t worry that there are bits of onion and garlic mixed with the meat. Wash and dry the saucepan, set it over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil is hot, add half of the remaining onions and cook until golden, about 6 minutes, then stir in the remaining garlic and cook for another minute. Add the tomatoes and chiles and cook until most of the juice has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in the shredded meat and simmer for a few more minutes, then taste and season with about 1/2 teaspoon salt. Remove from the heat and set aside. Forming, filling, and griddle-baking the gorditas: Heat a well-seasoned or nonstick griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat. Knead the masa (fresh or reconstituted) to make it pliable, adding a little water if necessary to achieve a soft-cookie-dough consistency. Knead in the flour, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll into balls; cover with plastic to keep from drying out. Line a tortilla press with 2 pieces of plastic cut to fit the plates (to be on the safe side, cut them from a food storage bag; the thicker plastic usually works better for beginners). Gently press out a ball of dough between the sheets of plastic to about 4 inches in diameter (it&#39;ll be about 1/4 inch thick). You&#39;ve now made a gordita, which is what you call a fat tortilla. Peel off the top sheet of plastic, flip the gordita, uncovered side down, onto the fingers of 1 hand, and gently peel off the second piece of plastic. In one flowing movement, roll the gordita off your hand and onto the heated griddle or skillet. Bake for about 1 1/2 minutes, then flip and bake for another 1 1/2 minutes on the other side. The gordita will be lightly browned and crusty on the top and bottom, but still a little uncooked on the sides. Remove to a plate. Continue pressing and griddle-baking the remaining gorditas in the same manner. Finishing the gorditas: When you&#39;re ready to serve, warm the shredded beef. Rinse the remaining onions in a small strainer under cold water and shake to remove the excess moisture. Have the cheese and cilantro at the ready. In a deep heavy medium skillet or saucepan, heat 1/2-inch of oil over medium to medium-high until the oil is hot enough to make the edge of a gordita sizzle sharply, about 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. One by one, fry the gorditas, turning them after they&#39;ve been in the oil for about 15 seconds, until they&#39;re nicely crisp but not hard, about 45 seconds total. When they&#39;re ready, most will have puffed up a little, like pita bread. Drain on paper towels. Once they all are fried, use a small knife to cut a slit in the thin edge of each one about halfway around its circumference, opening a pocket. As you cut them, fill each gordita with about 1/4-cup shredded meat and a sprinkling of the onions, grated cheese, and cilantro. Line up the filled gorditas on a serving platter and pass them around (with plenty of napkins) for your guest to enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 32976,&quot;Chicken Satay Salad 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1 pound) 7 tablespoons (about 1/2 cup) Thai peanut sauce 3 tablespoons vegetable oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1 head romaine lettuce, sliced 1/2 English cucumber or 2 Persian cucumbers, cut into matchsticks 1 medium carrot, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for topping 3 tablespoons chopped roasted salted peanuts Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium high.

Unwrap the leaves very carefully, trying to keep them whole, and trim off the points. Rinse the leaves and set them aside to drain. Cut the kernels from the cobs as near to the core as possible. You should have 4 cups of kernels. Put the kernels into the blender with the water and salt and grind them until they are very smooth. It will be much easier to do in 2 lots. You will have to keep stopping the blender and releasing the blades; but do not add more water. Making the uchepos: Smear a thin coating of the corn mixture over the broadest part of the cornhusk, allowing for turning down about 1 1/2-inches at the bottom broad part of the husk and about 3-inches high at the pointed top. Fold the sides of the husk together firmly. Turn up the pointed end of the leaf and fold the broader over it. Cooking the uchepos: The most convenient way to cook uchepos is with a conventional steamer. Fill the bottom of the steamer with water up to the level indicated and bring it to a boil. Line the top of the steamer with cornhusks, covering the bottom and sides well. Stack the uchepos upright. For the best results, they should be packed firmly but not too tightly, because the husks swell out as the dough cooks. Cover the uchepos with more cornhusks. Cover the top of the steamer with a thick cloth ? a piece of old toweling is best ? to absorb the condensation from the lid of the steamer. Cover the steamer with a tightly fitting lid. As the water in the bottom part comes to a boil, put a coin into it, put the top part of the steamer on, and let the uchepos cook for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours over a medium flame. Keep the water bubbling, but not boiling violently. That is the reason for the coin. You will be able to hear it dancing about, and it will tell you if the water goes off the boil or is getting dangerously low. It the water is allowed to go off the boil the uchepos will be heavy. Keep a kettle of water simmering so that you can refill the steamer when necessary. To test the uchepos for doneness, remove 1 from the center, and 1 from the side of the steamer. As you open the husks, the dough should come away easily from the husks and be completely smooth. To make doubly sure, open up the uchepos and see if they are spongy and well cooked throughout. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 32981,&quot;Homemade Cream Cheese 1 quart (4 cups) cream or whole milk (or a mix of both) One .05-ounce packet cream cheese starter<br> Kosher salt Instructions: Set up your grill for low, even heat. If using a charcoal grill, distribute the coals evenly. If using a gas grill, heat both sides. Slowly heat the milk/cream over low heat to 86 degrees F. Remove from the heat.

Place garlic cloves in a single layer in a small baking dish. Add 1/2 cup olive oil to cover cloves, cover with foil, and bake 45 minutes, until golden brown and fork-tender. Meanwhile, in another baking dish, toss tomatoes with enough oil to coat. Lightly season with salt and pepper and roast at same temperature until tomatoes blister, about 25 minutes. Strain garlic cloves and set aside in a small bowl, reserving infused oil separately. In a blender, add the roasted tomatoes, roasted garlic, Parmesan, and basil. Pulse until combined. While machine is running, drizzle in 1/2 cup olive oil until pesto comes together. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Remove to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and reserve. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the linguine and cook until al dente. Drain. Meanwhile, heat a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil.

A simple touch that makes the flavors more intense and the texture more inviting. Other simple touches that make the difference? Taking care that all the greens are thoroughly washed and dried. A mouthful with grit or excess moisture that dilutes the flavors of the dressing can make a great salad less than perfect. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a medium bowl, add the bourbon and the apple slices. Season with salt and black pepper and stir to combine. Set aside. Make the dressing: In a large bowl, or with a mortar and pestle, lightly crush the pecans until they are in small pieces and season with salt. Add the olive oil and whisk with the nuts to make a paste-like mixture. Stir in the cider vinegar and some black pepper. Set aside. When ready to serve, add the greens to a large bowl and stir in the dressing. Toss to coat the greens with the dressing. Transfer the salad to a platter (or individual plates). Put the platter in the oven with the door ajar until the greens wilt ever so slightly, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with the apple slices. Cook&#39;s Note: if there is any excess bourbon, leave it behind in the bowl as you top the salad with the apples.

I have a restaurant in Mumbai, so I visit India often, and here you can see how I&#39;ve been influenced by one of my favorite Indian dishes: Tandoori chicken. The bird is first marinated in spiced yogurt before being roasted in a very hot oven. For garnish, I make a zesty sauce from the marinade and serve the pieces of chicken with whole grilled fresh chiles. The secret ingredient here is the hot sauce. I always use Frank&#39;s, a Louisiana-based sauce with a distinct red pepper flavor, which is neither as hot nor as sharp as other brands. As a result, the marinated chicken is certainly spicy, but not incendiary. If you want more heat, I encourage you to eat the chiles. The noodle topping is dramatic, and you&#39;ll always see it at the restaurant, but at home you can consider it optional. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Trim any excess fat from the chicken. Rinse and pat dry. Place the chicken quarters in a large bowl. Measure out 1 cup of the Spicy Yogurt Marinade and reserve for the sauce; refrigerate in a small covered container. Pour the rest of the marinade over the chicken. Turn the pieces to make sure they are all well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 and up to 24 hours. Remove the chicken from the marinade and arrange the pieces on 1 or 2 half-sheet pans or large baking sheets. Discard the chicken marinade. Roast for 40 minutes, until the chicken is tender and lightly browned and the juices run clear when the thighs are pricked with the tip of a small knife. Transfer the pieces to a platter and tent with foil to keep warm. While the chicken is roasting, make the sauce. Boil the chicken stock in a medium saucepan over high heat until it is reduced to 1 cup. Whisk in the reserved 1 cup Spicy Yogurt Marinade and cook just until heated through. Do not boil, or the yogurt will separate. Keep the sauce warm. As soon as the chickens are done, preheat the broiler. Toss the chiles with the oil to coat lightly and spread them out on a broiler rack or small baking sheet. Broil the chiles about 4 inches from the heat, turning them a couple of times, until they are blistered and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. To serve, layer the chicken and chiles on a large platter. Pour the sauce around the chicken. Top with the Fried Rice Noodles. Serve with lime wedges to squeeze over the chicken. To make the marinade, grind the peppercorns, cumin, coriander seeds, and cardamom in a spice grinder or use a mortar and pestle. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add the chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Add the hot sauce, yogurt, cream, and soy sauce and whisk until smooth and well blended. Add vegetable oil to reach about 2 inches up the sides of a large saucepan or a wok. Heat the oil over high heat to 340 degrees F. Separate 1 bundle of thin rice noodles into 2 portions. Working with 1 portion at a time, add the noodles to the oil. They will puff up almost immediately. Using a large wire skimmer, transfer to paper towels to drain. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 33006,&quot;Fondant Glazed Petit Fours 4 egg whites 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract 2 cups sifted cake flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 2/3 cup milk, at room temperature 2/3 cup corn syrup 2/3 cup hot water 7 cups powdered sugar 6 drops lemon extract Food coloring 2 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted Silver dragee Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment whip the egg whites until stiff but not dry. In a mixer fitted with a whip attachment cream the butter until smooth. With the mixer running, slowly add the sugar and mix. Add the vanilla and almond extract and mix well. Sift the flour 3 times with the baking powder (this is to lighten the cakes). Add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix. Add 1/2 of the milk to the butter mixture and mix. Add another 1/3 of the flour mixture and mix. Add the remaining milk and mix. Add the remaining flour and mix until smooth. Fold in the egg whites. Pour the batter into a parchment lined jellyroll pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake until firm to the touch 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool in the pan then chill. To make the fondant: Whisk the corn syrup into the hot water until dissolved, then whisk in the powdered sugar until smooth. Stir in lemon extract. Divide into smaller bowls and color with food coloring, adding color until you achieve desired shade. To make the petit fours, cut the cold cake into small squares, rectangles, and circles using small cookie cutters. Place the cakes on a wire rack over a pan to catch the drippings, inverting them in order to have the golden layer on the bottom. If the fondant has become stiff, just whisk until smooth again. If the fondant is has not become to stiff, proceed to the next step. Either dip the cakes into the fondant and place on the rack to drain or ladle the fondant over the cakes, making sure all sides are coated. Once they are set, they should be coated again. Let dry, then with melted chocolate or colored fondant, pipe thin decorative lines or use silver dragees. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 33007,&quot;Mint Julep Granita 1/4 cup packed fresh mint leaves, plus more for garnish 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup bourbon Instructions: Put 6 or 7 glasses in the refrigerator to chill.

Allow the chips to soak for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile, assemble the dry rub for the ribs. In a small mixing bowl, combine the brown sugar, salt, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and chili powder. Cut the rib rack into 4 pieces. Put a cooling rack over a baking sheet and put the ribs on top. Let the ribs come to room temperature, then rub the meat all over with the dry rub. Set up a stovetop smoker: Make a shallow bowl out of heavy-duty aluminum foil that fits into a 5- to 7-quart Dutch oven, with the sides of the aluminum bowl coming 2 inches up the sides of the pot; put it in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Put the soaked and drained wood chips over the aluminum foil in an even layer. Put a small round of aluminum foil on top of the wood chips. Put a 6-inch steamer basket (make sure the handle is attached in the center for easy removal) on top of the aluminum round. Transfer the smoker to the stovetop. Put the ribs in the steamer basket; it is okay if the pieces overlap slightly. Cover the smoker and create a strong seal by wrapping the rim of the lid with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Turn the heat to medium high and smoke the ribs for 45 minutes. Turn off the heat and carefully remove the aluminum foil seal and lid. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Remove the ribs and steamer basket from the Dutch oven and set aside. Remove the remaining foil and wood chips carefully, as grease from the ribs may have dripped down; use tongs to lift the wood chips and foil bowl out and transfer them to a baking sheet to cool before discarding. Put the ribs back into the empty Dutch oven and cover with the lid. Slow roast until the ribs are completely tender, an additional 2 hours. The meat should pull away from the bones very easily. Meanwhile, pour the ketchup, maple syrup, molasses, vinegar, Worcestershire and soy sauce into a small saucepot and stir to combine. Place over medium heat and heat just until simmering. Keep warm. Remove the pot from the oven and brush the ribs generously with the BBQ sauce. Preheat the broiler to high. Broil the ribs until the sauce is caramelized and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, Syrah]&quot; 33014,&quot;Neely&#39;s Berry Parfait 6 ounces frozen raspberries, thawed 6 ounces frozen blueberries, thawed 6 ounces frozen blackberries, thawed 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon lemon juice 6 ounces frozen raspberries, thawed 2 tablespoons sugar 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 2 tablespoons sugar Instructions: Berry mixture: Add 6 ounces raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, sugar, and lemon juice to medium bowl.

Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Flatten and shape each piece of dough into a 3 1/2-inch round. Spread 1/4 teaspoon tomato paste in the center of a round, leaving a small border around the edge. Tear a basil leaf into pieces and add to the center, along with about 1 teaspoon of bacon. Top with 3/4-ounce (about 1 heaping tablespoon) mozzarella. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and some red pepper flakes. Very lightly brush the circumference of the dough with water. Bring the edges of the round towards the center, lightly pleating to form a tight enclosure, and pinch to seal. Using a metal skewer dipped in flour, make a hole in the center of the dough to create a steam vent. Place on a sheet of parchment and repeat with the remaining dough and fillings. Remove the hot baking sheet from the oven, then transfer all the dough balls to the hot baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart. Brush them liberally with the herb oil. Transfer the baking sheet to the pizza stone and bake, 5 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes more. Brush with herb oil and serve immediately with marina sauce and the remaining herb oil for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 33030,&quot;Seared Salmon with Confetti Chickpeas 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 cup diced onion 1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 1 small red bell pepper, diced (about 1 cup) 2 medium carrots, diced (about 1 cup) 1/2 pound yellow zucchini, diced 1/2 pound green zucchini, diced 2 (15 1/2-ounce) cans chickpeas 2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth 1/2 cup dry white wine 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 2 sprigs rosemary, plus 6 sprigs for garnish 1 bay leaf Canola oil, for searing 6 (6-ounce) pieces center-cut salmon fillets Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and cook 1 more minute. Add the bell pepper, carrots, yellow zucchini, and green zucchini and cook until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the chickpeas, broth, white wine, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 rosemary springs, and bay leaf and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the rosemary sprigs and bay leaf. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add enough canola oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Season salmon fillets with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Once the oil is hot, add the salmon (work in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan) and sear until the exterior is crisp and golden, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place salmon in the oven to finish cooking to medium doneness, turning once, about 4 to 6 minutes (depending on the thickness of the salmon). To serve, use a slotted spoon to scoop the chickpea mixture onto a serving dish. Place the seared salmon alongside the chickpeas and garnish with a sprig of rosemary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 33031,&quot;Icelandic Ponnokukur 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg<br> 2 eggs<br> 1 3/4 cups milk, plus more as needed<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Butter, for coating the pan<br> Instructions: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cardamom and nutmeg and set aside. In another bowl, beat the eggs until smooth. In alternating turns, add half of the flour mixture and half of the milk to the eggs, whisking until combined; repeat with the remaining flour and milk. Mix in the cream and vanilla. Let the batter sit 30 minutes, refrigerated. Preheat a crepe pan over medium-high heat. Rub with a stick of butter to lightly coat the pan--the butter should foam but not brown. Swirl up 3 to 4 tablespoons of batter into the pan, tilting the pan to thinly and evenly cover the entire surface. When the edges turn golden (after about 30 seconds), flip the pancake with an offset spatula or pie server, and brown the other side. Flip the pan upside down over a large plate, dropping the pancake onto the plate. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve immediately, or stack the pancakes with a layer of parchment between each. They can be wrapped tightly in plastic and frozen, or used within 2 days (stored wrapped at room temperature). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33032,&quot;Double Fried French Fries Peanut or other vegetable oil, for frying 2 pounds baking potatoes, like russets Salt, to taste Instructions: Pour oil in a deep fryer or heavy saucepan to reach halfway up the sides of the pan. Heat to 325 degrees F, use a deep fry thermometer to determine this. While the oil is heating, peel the potatoes and push through a French fry cutter to form uniform sticks. As you go, place the cut potatoes in a bowl of ice water to release some of the starch and to keep them from browning. Dry the potato strips thoroughly, this will keep the oil from splattering. Fry the potatoes in batches so the pan isn&#39;t crowded and the oil temperature does not plummet. Cook for 3 minutes until they are soft but not browned. Remove the potatoes with a long-handled metal strainer and drain on brown paper bags. Bring oil temperature up to 375 degrees F. Return the par-fried potatoes to the oil in batches and cook a second time for 4 minutes until golden and crispy. Drain on fresh brown paper bags then place in a serving bowl lined with paper towels. Salt and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33033,&quot;Opa! Burgers - (winning Alternative Burger) 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup roasted red peppers, chopped 8 ounces goat feta cheese, crumbled 1/2 cup chopped kalamata olives 1 cup Shiraz (recommended: Sutter Home) 1/2-ounce dried porcini mushrooms 2 pounds ground lamb 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing grill rack (recommended: Colavita) 6 Italian-style bolo rolls or other rustic buns, split 12 thin slices sopressata, Italian salami variety 1 cup loosely packed baby spinach leaves 6 large tomato slices Instructions: Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill with a cover, or preheat a gas grill to medium-high. For the mayonnaise-cheese mixture: Combine the mayonnaise and roasted peppers in a small bowl and mix well. Cover and chill until ready to use. In a separate small bowl, mash the cheese with a fork. Stir in the olives; set aside. Pour the wine into a small, heavy fire-proof saucepan and heat on the grill until the wine begins to simmer. Remove from the heat and add the dried mushrooms, stirring with a fork to ensure that all the mushrooms are moistened. Set the mushrooms aside to reconstitute for at least 30 minutes. Gently squeeze the excess liquid from the reconstituted mushrooms and chop, using a chef&#39;s knife. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the lamb, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Form into 6 equal patties in the shape of the rolls. When the grill is ready, brush the grill rack with oil. Place the patties on the grill, cover, and cook for 4 minutes. With a spatula, turn the patties over, and cook an additional 4 minutes, or until done to preference. During the last few minutes of grilling, place the rolls, cut side down, on outer edges of grill to lightly toast. To assemble the burgers, spread the mayonnaise mixture over the bottom roll halves and the cheese mixture over the top halves. Layer the bottom rolls with the patties, sopressata, spinach leaves, tomato slices, and roll tops. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 33034,&quot;Vegetable Parmesan Butter, for greasing the baking dish 1 medium eggplant, cut into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices 2 medium fennel bulbs, trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices 2 zucchini, trimmed and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices Olive oil, for drizzling Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (26-ounce) jar marinara sauce, divided 3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided 1 cup grated Parmesan, divided 1 cup plain bread crumbs Instructions: Put an oven rack in the center of the oven.

Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the bowl. Whip for about 12 minutes at medium speed, or until the mixture has lightened and tripled in volume. Beat in the espresso extract. Transfer the mixture to a bowl placed in a larger bowl of ice water to maintain its consistency.<br> In a mixer bowl or a metal bowl, whip the heavy cream with 3 tablespoons of the sugar until it holds its shape when the whisk or beater is lifted. Fold the whipped cream into the yolk mixture and return the bowl to the ice.<br> Whip the egg whites in a mixer bowl or metal bowl until they are frothy. While whipping, add in the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar and whip the egg whites just until they hold soft peaks, being careful not to overwhip them. Fold in the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk mixture until they are completely combined.<br> Spoon the semifreddo into six 8- to 10-ounce coffee cups, leaving at least 1/2 inch at the top for the steamed milk. Gently tap the cups against the counter to level the mixture. Cover the cups with plastic wrap and place them in the freezer until frozen, at least 6 to 8 hours, or overnight. These will keep for up to 3 days in the freezer; after that time, they will start to deflate. For the cinnamon-sugar doughnuts part 1: Place the water in the bowl of a mixer. Crumble the yeast into the water; mix and crush the yeast with a spoon to dissolve. Add the flour to the bowl and, using the dough hook, mix slowly until the ingredients are thoroughly blended.<br> Transfer this sponge to a bowl, cover, and let proof at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, until it has doubled; or place the bowl in the refrigerator to proof overnight.<br> Part 2: Crumble the yeast into the milk in a small bowl, stirring to dissolve. Place 3/4 cup of the flour, the sugar, and salt in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mixing on low speed, pour in the milk and yeast mixture, followed by the egg yolks and butter. Mix for a minute to combine.<br> Add the proofed sponge and the remaining 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour. Continue to beat at low speed until combined. Turn up the speed slightly and knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it has formed a ball and cleans the sides of the bowl. If the dough seems wet, it may be necessary to add 1 to 2 more tablespoons flour. Cover the bowl and let the dough proof overnight in the refrigerator.<br> To shape the doughnuts: Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and roll it out to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out the doughnuts using a 2-inch doughnut cutter, or a 2-inch biscuit cutter (in which case, you will also need a 3/4-inch cutter to make the hole). Place the doughnuts and doughnut holes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover the doughnuts with a sheet of plastic wrap that has been sprayed with nonstick spray.<br> At this point, the doughnuts can be frozen for several days, refrigerated, or allowed to rise at room temperature. If they&#39;re frozen, defrost them and then allow them to rise at room temperature for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. They can be refrigerated for several hours or overnight, to rise slowly. When you remove them from the refrigerator, uncover them and let them finish proofing in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes. If they have not been refrigerated or frozen, they should rise at room temperature in about 15 minutes. Once proofed, they will have risen to approximately 3/4 inch.<br> To cook the doughnuts: In a deep heavy saucepan large enough to hold half the doughnuts and holes at a time, heat canola oil for deep-frying to 325 degrees F. Add half the doughnuts and holes to the oil and cook for approximately 30 seconds on the first side. Flip the doughnuts and fry for 1 minute on the second side, then turn back to the first side to cook for an additional 30 seconds, or until a deep golden brown. Remove the doughnuts, drain them briefly on paper towels, and toss them in a bowl with the cinnamon sugar. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts.<br> To complete: Remove the semifreddo from the freezer a few minutes before serving to soften slightly. Steam the milk using a cappuccino machine or frothing machine. Place a cup of semifreddo and a doughnut on each of six plates. Top each doughnut with a doughnut hole. Spoon the steamed milk over the semifreddo and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33036,&quot;Teriyaki-Glazed Pork Spare Ribs Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup Chinese five-spice powder 1 rack pork spareribs, trimmed of excess fat, cut in 1/2 through the bone so you have 2-inch length riblets 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds, for garnish Cilantro leaves, chopped, for garnish Green onion, thinly sliced, for garnish 1 cup low-sodium soy sauce 1 cup fresh grapefruit juice 1/4 cup hoisin sauce 3 tablespoons ketchup 3 tablespoons rice vinegar 1 fresh red cl, split 2 garlic cloves, smashed 2 -inch piece fresh ginger, cut into 1-inch coins Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Mix the salt and pepper in a small bowl with the five-spice powder. Rub some of the mixture all over the ribs, and then store remaining rub in an airtight container for another use.

To make Teriyaki Glaze: In a pot, combine the soy sauce, grapefruit juice, hoisin sauce, ketchup, rice wine vinegar, cl, garlic, and ginger over medium heat. Bring to a slow simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 20 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of Teriyaki Glaze in a small bowl and set aside. In the last 30 minutes of cooking, baste the ribs with the Teriyaki Glaze. When they are done, the meat will start to pull away from the bone. Just before you&#39;re ready to eat, baste the ribs with the Teriyaki Glaze again and stick them under the broiler for 5 to 8 minutes to make the spareribs a nice crusty brown. Separate the ribs with a cleaver or sharp knife, cutting at every second rib so there are 2 bones per piece. Pile them on a platter, and pour on the reserved Glaze.

Lay the whole tomatillos and serranos on a broiler pan or baking sheet. Set the pan 4 inches below the broiler and let roast until the tomatillos are softened and splotchy black in places (the skins will split), about 5 minutes; your goal is to cook the tomatillos through while they roast, which means they&#39;ll change from light bright green to olive green on the top side. With a pair of tongs, flip over the tomatillos and chiles and roast the other side for another 4 to 5 minutes or so. Set aside to cool. Turn the oven down to 425 degrees. Separate the onion into rings and, on a similar pan or baking sheet, combine them with the garlic. Place in the oven. Stir carefully every couple of minutes, until the onions are beautifully browned. (They&#39;re going to look wilted and translucent, even have a touch of char on some of the edges.) The garlic should feel soft and be browned in spots. The total roasting time will be about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. In a food processor, place the onion-garlic mixture and the serranos, and pulse until moderateley finely chopped, scraping everything down with a spatula as needed to keep it all moving. Scoop the mixture into a large bowl. Without washing the processor, coarsely puree the tomatillos with their juice, no need to peel off their darkened skin or cut out their cores. Stir them into the chiles. Stir in enough water to give the salsa an easily spoonable consistency. Stir in the cilantro. Taste and season highly with salt. Taste again and, if you like, add just enough sugar to take the edge off the bright tanginess of the tomatillos. If you are planning to use your salsa right away, simply pour it into a bowl and it is ready, or refrigerate it covered and use within 5 days.; In a medium saucepan, combine the beans with 3 cups of water and the herbs and bay leaves. Partially cover the pan and bring to a good rolling boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer the beans very gently (still partially covered) until they are tender, about 1 hour (if you simmer them gently enough, they won&#39;t begin to fall apart before becoming thoroughly tender). Add more water if the beans ever begin peeking up above the surface of the water. While beans cook, in a 6 quart Dutch oven cook the bacon slices over medium heat, turning them occasionally, until thoroughly crispy. Remove to drain on paper towels, and when cool, crumble. Tip the Dutch oven slightly, spoon off most of the fat that collects, and add it to the simmering beans. Heat the oven to 325 degrees. If your pork loin roast is in 2 sections that have been tied together, untie them. Sprinkle the meat liberally with salt. Heat the Dutch oven over medium-high until quite hot. Lay in the pork and brown thoroughly on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Pour in the salsa and nestle in the epazote if you it. Cover the pot and place it the oven. Cook until the pork registers about 150 degrees on a meat or instant-read thermometer; the meat will feel rather firm (not hard) to the touch, and cutting into the center will reveal only the slightest hint of pink. The total cooking time should be about 45 minutes. Remove the epazote and set the pot aside uncovered. When the beans are tender, season them with about 1 teaspoon salt, let stand for a few minutes for the beans to absorb the seasoning, then drain off their cooking liquid. Remove the pork to a cutting board, add the beans to the pork pot, set over medium heat and season with salt. Slice the pork, laying the slices slightly overlapping on a warm serving platter. Spoon the beans and sauce around the meat, sprinkle everything with the crumbled bacon, garnish with herb sprigs and carry to the table. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 33051,&quot;Chocolate-Chocolate Cherry Cupcakes 1 (18.25-ounce) package butter-recipe chocolate cake mix (recommended: Betty Crocker) 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened 3 eggs 1 1/3 cups cranberry-cherry juice 1/2 cup cherry pie filling 1 1/4 cups white baking chips 7 tablespoons heavy cream 2 1/2 teaspoons light-color corn syrup 1 1/4 cups whipped fluffy white frosting 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips 1 (10-ounce) jar maraschino cherries with stems, drained Instructions: For cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Let sit 10 minutes to dissolve; you will see a few bubbles but the mixture won&#39;t be foamy. Whisk together the granulated sugar, eggs and 1 tablespoon salt in a small bowl. Add the bread flour, whole-wheat flour, milk powder and egg mixture to the yeast mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Fit the bowl in place on the stand mixer and fit the mixer with the dough hook. Mix on medium speed until the dough comes together but is still slightly tough, about 3 minutes. Increase the speed to high and add 20 tablespoons (2 1/2 sticks) butter a tablespoon at a time (the dough will look broken after each addition, but it will eventually come together) and beat until the dough is smooth, elastic and very tacky but pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 12 minutes.<br> Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free area until it has a buttery, yeasty smell and has doubled in volume, 35 to 50 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, whisk together the dark brown sugar, cinnamon and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until no lumps of sugar remain. Smash in the remaining 24 tablespoons (3 sticks) butter and stir until completely combined. Set aside until ready to assemble. Line two 18-by-13-inch sheet pans with parchment.<br> Gently deflate the dough by lifting it up around the edges and letting it fall back into the bowl, turning the bowl and repeating if needed. Transfer to a clean work surface lightly dusted with bread flour. Cut the dough in half. Roll one piece into a 12-by-18-inch rectangle, pushing the edges towards the center to make straight sides. Spread half of the butter mixture over the dough in an even layer, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edges. Starting from a long end, tightly roll into a log, pressing the sides occasionally to keep them flush. Transfer to one of the prepared baking sheets and freeze for 20 minutes to firm up the dough. Repeat with the remaining dough and butter mixture.<br> Generously butter the bottom and sides of an 18-by-13-inch sheet pan. Cut one log of dough crosswise into 16 pieces and arrange them cut-side up in the pan, gently shaping each cinnamon roll to make them fit in the pan. Repeat with the remaining log, ending up with a 4-by-8 grid of rolls. Let rise, uncovered, in a warm, draft-free area until almost doubled in volume, 45 minutes to 1 hour.<br> Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Bake the cinnamon rolls until golden brown on top and baked all the way through, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool for about 10 minutes before glazing.<br> Meanwhile, whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, cream, vanilla and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl until smooth and creamy, adding more cream if necessary to make a thick glaze.

Sift the flour into a large bowl and whisk in the wet ingredients until just combined. Gently stir in the melted butter and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. (Alternatively, you can refrigerate the batter overnight.) Preheat the oven to its lowest setting. Place a parchment-lined baking sheet inside. For the filling: Line a plate with a paper towel. Place the water and bacon into an ovenproof skillet over high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring to make sure the bacon pieces are separated. Allow the water to boil off, then continue cooking the bacon, stirring occasionally, until almost brown and crisp.

Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a clean, dry, small saucepan (preferably one with a pouring spout) fitted with a candy thermometer and bring to a boil over high heat. Without stirring, cook until the mixture reaches 305 degrees F or \\hard crack\\ stage on the candy thermometer. (While the syrup is cooking, occasionally wash down the sides of the pan with a clean brush dipped in water, to prevent crystallization.) Set up an ice bath in a sink. When the mixture is done, remove the pot from the heat and dip it into the ice bath for 15 seconds to stop the cooking. Remove the pot of syrup from the ice bath and stir in 1/2 teaspoon orange extract. Divide the sugar mixture between 2 heat-safe measuring cups. Color 1 measuring cup with yellow food coloring and the other with blue food coloring, stirring very gently with a wooden skewer so that the color is evenly distributed. To avoid air bubbles in the finished lollipops, stir the mixture gently in both directions, but be careful not to over mix. Pour or carefully spoon a little of the syrup around each lollipop stick, creating freeform designs covering at least a 1/4-inch of the end of each lollipop stick. Then add blue coloring to the yellow measuring cup to make green and add red food coloring to the blue measuring cup to make purple, and pour more syrup onto the pops. Re-warm the syrups in the microwave a few seconds at a time if they are cooling too much and setting up. Cool the lollipops for at least 20 minutes, until hard. Lift off the pan and store in an airtight container for up to 1 week, or 2 to 3 days if the weather is very humid. Notes about the recipe: Lollipops are the last thing you expect to see on a petit-four tray in a fancy restaurant ? so that&#39;s why I like to serve them last at mine. People burst out laughing when these jewel-like treats arrive on a silver platter after dessert. But then they sit back and savor those suckers right down to the stick! I never get tired of watching Chicago&#39;s most elegant diners licking lollipops like kids ? and taking a last few minutes to enjoy the evening. Using a very long stick makes these lollipops look and feel more fancy. The flower petals are also very pretty, but optional. If you plan to make these without lollipop molds, just arrange the sticks and petals on the cookie sheet. Let the syrup cool a bit to thicken it slightly, and then pour it over the ends of the sticks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 33083,&quot;Boozy Cherry Cola Slushies 1 1/2 cups cherry cola Maraschino cherries, for topping, plus 1/4 cup cherry juice, plus extra for drizzling 1/4 cup cherry vodka Instructions: Place the cola, juice, vodka and 6 cups ice in a blender and blend until frosty.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large stew pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the meat, in small batches, until well browned, adding more oil to the pan as needed. Transfer meat to a bowl and reserve. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the pan. Saute the onions over medium heat for 10 minutes, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon from the bottom of the pan. Add the garlic and saute for 2 minutes more. Stir in the 1/3 cup chili powder, cumin, and oregano and cook for 2 minutes. Add the canned diced tomatoes and whisk in 4 cups of the stock. Add the meat and any accumulated juices back to the pot. Bring to a gentle simmer. Season the chili with the salt and pepper, cover, and cook for 30 minutes. In a food processor or blender puree half of the beans with the remaining 1 cup of stock. Add the bean mixture to the chili along with the whole beans. Let simmer, uncovered, 1 hour more or until the meat is tender. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons chili powder and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve with rice and suggested condiments. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 33093,&quot;Pretzel-ish Pigs in a Blanket with Mustard Sauce 1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110 degrees F) One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for greasing 1 scant tablespoon honey 1 teaspoon kosher salt 6 tablespoons grainy Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar Nonstick cooking spray, for the parchment, optional One 12-ounce package mini hot dogs (32 to 36 pieces) 1/2 cup baking soda 2 to 3 tablespoons pretzel or kosher salt Melted unsalted butter, for brushing Instructions: For the dough: In a bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Stir to dissolve the yeast and allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes. Using a sieve or strainer, sift about half of the flour over the yeast mixture and mix with your hands until smooth. Add the oil, honey and kosher salt. Sift over the remaining flour and mix to combine. Lightly flour a cutting board or flat surface. Turn the dough onto the floured area and knead until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are fully integrated, 3 to 5 minutes. Lightly oil a bowl and place the dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm place until it has doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. For the mustard sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk the mustard, honey, hot sauce and vinegar with a splash of warm water. Taste for seasoning. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the pretzel-ish pigs in a blanket: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper sprayed with nonstick cooking spray or silicone baking mats and set aside. Sprinkle some flour on a flat surface. Roll the dough out into an 18-by-13-inch rectangle about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Cut into 2 1/4-inch squares. Roll each mini hot dog in a single piece of the dough. Pinch the seam and ends to firmly close, tucking the excess on the ends underneath. Place each wrapped hot dog seam-side down on one of the prepared baking sheets. For the baking soda bath: Prepare a third baking sheet or large platter with parchment. In a medium pot, bring about 6 cups of water to a boil over medium heat. Slowly whisk in the baking soda a bit at a time. Working in batches, use a slotted spoon to drop each pig in a blanket into the water for 30 seconds, then remove and transfer to the prepared third baking sheet or platter. Transfer the pigs in a blanket in a single layer back onto the original baking sheets, allowing some space between each. Sprinkle the dogs with the pretzel salt or kosher salt. Bake in the center of the oven until the pastry is nicely browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Lightly brush with melted butter before serving. Serve with the mustard sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 33094,&quot;Yucca Buns Recipe | Cassava Bread Nonstick cooking spray 1 cup tapioca flour, plus extra for kneading 1 teaspoon baking powder 2 cups Oaxaca cheese or other fresh white cheese, such as mozzarella, finely grated 2 large egg yolks 2 to 3 tablespoons heavy cream, if necessary Pineapple Jalapeno Marmalade, recipe follows 1 (20-ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice, strained 4 cups sugar 1 orange, zested and juiced 1 lemon, zested and juiced 2 jalapenos, seeded and minced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking pan with aluminum foil, and coat with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. Combine the tapioca flour and baking powder together in a large bowl. Stir in the cheese and egg yolks. Mix until the dough forms a ball. Lightly flour a work surface and turn the dough out. Knead the dough with your hands until the dough is smooth, even-textured, and not sticky. If the dough doesn&#39;t come together or seems too stiff, then add cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it comes together and feels supple. Divide the dough into 10 even pieces and with your hands, roll each into a ball. Shape the balls into ovals and place them 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the rolls are pale gold (not browned), about 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 to 10 minutes and serve while still warm. Serve with Pineapple Marmalade, if desired. Combine the pineapple, sugar, orange zest, orange juice, lemon zest, lemon juice and jalapenos in medium saucepan. Bring mixture to a rapid boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Lower heat to medium and continue to cook for 15 minutes, stirring often to prevent scorching. Remove from heat and cool before serving. Store in refrigerator for up to 1 month or in the freezer for 6 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 33095,&quot;Bistecca Fiorentina 1 cup cubed pork fatback 6 cloves of garlic 2 sprigs rosemary 1 (24 to 28-ounce) bone-in rib-eye steak Salt and pepper Instructions: Put the fatback, garlic, and rosemary into a food processor and blend until it is the consistency of toothpaste. Tie the rib in the correct way so that it is tight and will cook evenly. Rub the fat mixture all over the meat and season with salt and pepper. Place it on a very hot grill. Cook the steak on 1 side for about 8 minutes. You can move it around a little bit to find the right heat. Turn it over and cook it a little bit less on the other side, about 6 minutes. When it is finished, take it off the grill and let it rest for 5 to 7 minutes. This allows the blood to circulate and allows the juices to distribute evenly. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec]&quot; 33096,&quot;Pan Seared Chicken Breast 2 plump chicken breasts, skin on 3 tablespoons olive oil, halved Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 6 sprigs fresh thyme 2 sprigs fresh rosemary 6 garlic cloves Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Heat a skillet over medium high heat. Drizzle the chicken breast with 1/2 of the oil, and then season the breast with a good crust of salt and pepper. Put chicken in the pan skin side down, then add the herbs, and garlic. When the skin has a nice golden color turn it over, and put in a preheated oven for 8 minutes or until juice runs clear. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 33097,&quot;Baby Greens Salad with Quail Egg and Maple White Balsamic Vinaigrette 1/8 cup white balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon maple syrup (add 1 teaspoon more if you like a sweeter taste) 1 shallot clove, very finely minced 1 tablespoon very finely minced fresh rosemary 3/4 cup olive oil, preferably extra-virgin Salt and pepper 3 ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges 1 English cucumber, peeled and sliced 1 carrot, peeled and sliced thin, or shredded with a vegetable peeler 1 pound baby greens (such as frissee, arugula, romaine hearts), rinsed and dried with a salad spinner or paper towels Salt and pepper 1 (15-ounce) can pre-cooked quail eggs* Instructions: Make the vinaigrette by adding vinegar, mustard, maple syrup, shallot and rosemary, 1 at a time, through the feed opening of a running blender. Then leaving the blender running, pour the olive oil in a slow steady stream into the vinegar mixture to emulsify. Remove vinaigrette to a container and season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, toss tomatoes, cucumber and carrots with salad dressing. Toss with baby greens just before serving and garnish with quail eggs cut into halves. Season with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 33098,&quot;Sombrero Corn Chips 1 cup fine-ground yellow cornmeal 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling 1/3 to 1/2 cup boiling water<br> Canola oil, for frying Salsa or guacamole, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, shortening and salt with a fork until the shortening is completely incorporated into the cornmeal. Mix in the boiling water a little at a time until a stiff dough forms, about the consistency of soft clay. Press the dough into the donut molds in a thin even layer to completely coat each mold, including the centerpiece that would create the hole in the donut. Dip your fingers in water to keep the dough from sticking to them as you press it into the molds. Bake until firm, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly, then carefully remove the sombreros from the molds. Fill a medium pot with about 4 inches of oil and heat to 350 degrees F over medium heat. Working in batches, fry the sombreros until just light brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels and sprinkle with a bit of salt. Fill each sombrero with salsa or guacamole. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 33099,&quot;Mushroom, Potato and Goat Cheese Strudel in Sweet Pepper Sauce 1 1/2 cups warm water 750g bread flour 250g sugar Melted butter Pinch salt 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced 1 onion, peeled and finely diced 2 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 pounds crimini mushrooms (or a mix of crimini, portobello, oyster and shiitake) 2 tablespoons white wine 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 2 teaspoons chopped flat leaf parsley 1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage 1 cup goat cheese (or substitute with ricotta or cheddar) Salt and pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 onion, diced 3 bell peppers, diced (all 3 the same, either red, orange or yellow) 1 cup white wine 1 sprig fresh thyme 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream Salt and pepper 1/2 cup melted butter 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs Instructions: For the Strudel Dough: In a mixing bowl with a paddle attachment, blend all ingredients until dough becomes stretchy and does not snap away from itself (10 to 15 minutes). Cover in plastic wrap and let relax for 1 hour. This can be made in advance and refrigerated but allow to return to room temperature before stretching. For the Filling: Boil potatoes in salted water until cooked through. Drain, dice and set aside. In a large pan over medium heat, saute onions in butter until, almost translucent (5 minutes). Add mushrooms and continue sauteing fully cooked. Add wine and herbs and saute for an additional 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Place in a large bowl and allow to cool. Toss potatoes and goat cheese into mushroom mixture. For the Sweet Pepper Sauce: In a medium saucepan, saute onions over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add peppers and saute until heated through. Add wine and thyme and simmer until peppers are soft, approximately 10 to 12 minutes. Remove thyme. Puree peppers with a hand blender or in a food processor. Strain. Season with salt and pepper. Add cream, heat to a simmer. Pour the sauce onto the plate and then place strudel on top. To assemble Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place dough in the middle of a floured clean tablecloth. Press out as far as it can go. Then from underneath, start pulling and stretching the dough from the middle outward. Keep pulling the dough until it is almost translucent. If it tears, don&#39;t worry. Many layers will be folded. Stretch the dough out to about a 2.5 foot square. Brush entire dough (gently) with melted butter. Sprinkle with bread crumbs. Along one side of the dough, spread the filling, leaving a 3-inch overhang to fold over filling. Begin rolling the filling up in the dough, using the tablecloth to help you roll evenly. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 1/2 hour. Serve with greens as a lunch or on its own as an appetizer with Chardonnay. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 33100,&quot;Maracuya (Passion Fruit) Mousse 2 cups frozen passion fruit pulp, defrosted 4 cups heavy cream 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk Mint sprigs, for garnish Biscotti or other crisp cookies, for garnish Instructions: Special Equipment: martini glasses Place 1 tablespoon of passion fruit pulp in the bottom of 8 martini glasses or ramekins, totaling in 1/2 cup passion fruit pulp, set them aside. Using an electric mixer beat the cream until it holds stiff peaks. Whisk 1 1/4 cups of passion fruit pulp with the condensed milk in a large bowl, add 1/4 of the whipped cream and whisk it in. Fold in the remaining whipped cream and fill martini glasses or ramekins with some mousse. Drizzle some of the remaining passion fruit pulp over the top. Serve immediately or cover flush with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 8 hours.

So while the crunchy salad strips of carrot, scallion and bell pepper, do bring colour and beauty to the otherwise brown study, their texture and Asian-flavoured bite provide the perfect partner for the rich aromatic spiciness of the soft-braised stew beneath. Cooking the shin on the bone gives me a certain primitive pleasure, and the meat even more melting tenderness, but you can buy cubed beef shank off the bone (or other stew meat, if you must), in which case, you won&#39;t need as much in weight. Along with the stew and its crunchy, hot and sour topping, I serve gingery mashed parsnip and potatoes, the ginger offering a muted echo of the South East Asian tones. While a plain bowl of rice would be a fine alternative, know that the aromatic mash makes for fantastic, fiery potato patties the day or so after. For the beef: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Quarter and peel the onions, and peel and roughly slice the ginger and put into the processor with the peeled garlic cloves and coriander. Blitz until finely chopped, then heat the oil in a large Dutch oven and fry this mixture gently, until soft and beginning to catch in the pan; this should take about 10 minutes, over medium heat and with regular stirring. Pour in the Chinese wine (or sherry) and let it bubble up. Add the soy sauce, brown sugar, broth, oyster sauce and vinegar. Bring to a boil, then drop in the cinnamon sticks and star anise. Add the pieces of beef shank and let everything come up to a bubble again, then clamp on a lid and put into the oven for 2 hours (regular stew steak may take longer). Take the Dutch oven carefully out of the oven and, using a perforated spoon, remove the beef to an ovenproof dish, cover with aluminum foil, and keep warm in the oven, while you vigorously boil the sauce in the Dutch oven on the stove, without a lid, until it has reduced by about half. For the salad: Peel the carrots, cut into long slices, and then julienne them (i.e. cut into matchstick-like strips). Trim and halve the scallions and then julienne as well. Seed the chillies and also cut into juliennes, and finely chop the cilantro. Combine all the julienned vegetables and the chopped cilantro in a bowl. In another bowl mix the lime juice, fish sauce and superfine sugar, and dress the vegetables with this. For serving: Arrange the beef on a serving platter and pour over the reduced sauce over the meat, then dress the top with the hot and sour shredded salad. If you are using cubes of stew meat, rather than slices of shank, you&#39;d probably do better to use a deeper dish. Make Ahead Note: Cook the beef for 1 3/4 hours then transfer to a bowl to cool. Cover, refrigerate and store in refrigerator for up to 2 days. When ready to use, return the beef to the Dutch oven and heat gently until sauce is just boiling. Cover and return to oven for 30 minutes, or until the beef is piping hot. Transfer meat to an ovenproof dish and finish sauce as directed. Freeze Note: Cook and cool as above then freeze for up to 3 months in airtight container. Thaw overnight in fridge and reheat and finish as above. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 33102,&quot;Five Herb Marinated Chicken with Roasted Garlic-Fava Bean Sauce, and Celeriac and Potato Puree 1/2 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh sage 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh parsley 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped tarragon 2 tablespoons chopped rosemary 2 tablespoons chopped thyme 6 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 2 whole chickens (2 1/2 to 3 pounds each), butterflied Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 cups homemade chicken stock 1 head garlic, roasted, cloves squeezed in a bowl 2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into tablespoons 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup cooked fava beans 1 pound celeriac peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces 1 pound baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup milk or cream, warmed Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: For the Chicken: Whisk together the olive oil, herbs and garlic in a large shallow baking dish. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and let marinate at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Heat a large saute pan or grill pan over high heat until just smoking. Remove chicken from marinade and season with salt and pepper to taste. Sear each chicken on both sides, and place on a sheet pan. Place in oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until cooked through. For the Roasted Garlic-Fava Bean Sauce: Place stock and roasted garlic in a medium saucepan and reduce to 3 cups. Strain into a clean saucepan and bring to a simmer. Whisk in the butter and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the fava beans and cook for 1 minute. For the Celeriac and Potato Puree: Place the celeriac and potatoes in a large saucepan filled with salt water and cook until soft. Drain, rinse out the pan and run the celeriac and potatoes through a food mill into the pan. Add the butter, warmed milk and beat with a wooden spoon. When the mixture is smooth, season with salt and pepper and fold in the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 33103,&quot;Glazed Citrus Rounds 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons finely grated citrus zest (orange, lemon, lime or grapefruit) 2 large egg yolks 3/4 teaspoon lemon extract 1/4 teaspoon orange extract 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh citrus juice (use the same kind as the zest) Instructions: Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth. Add the granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon citrus zest and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, then beat in the lemon and orange extracts. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the flour mixture and beat until a soft dough forms. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Freeze at least 30 minutes or overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the cookies straight from the freezer, 1 baking sheet at a time, until the edges are set and the bottoms are lightly browned, 15 to 17 minutes. Let cool 3 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, 2 tablespoons citrus juice and the remaining 1/2 tablespoon zest in a medium bowl until thick and smooth. (Add 1 more tablespoon citrus juice if the glaze is too thick.) Spread on the cookies; transfer to a rack and let set, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 33104,&quot;Jolly Greens 4 ham hocks 2 yellow onions 3 cloves garlic 1 bay leaf 2 cups water 16 ounces chicken broth 12 bunches collard greens Instructions: Cook ham hocks, whole onions, whole garlic, bay leaf, water and broth in a large saucepan for 1 1/2 hours or until meat falls off bone.

Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the lentils are tender, 15 to 20 minutes, adding water if the liquid has evaporated and the lentils are still tough. Drain the lentils and set aside to cool. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the carrots. Rest the bottom of one of the peeled carrots on a cutting board. Starting at the skinny tip of the carrot, press firmly down the length of the carrot with the vegetable peeler to create thin shavings. Repeat with the remaining carrots. (If you prefer, you can use a mandoline instead.) Add the shaved carrots to a mixing bowl along with the broccoli sprouts and onion. To make the dressing, in a separate small bowl, whisk together the tahini, olive oil, agave nectar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach the consistency of a basic vinaigrette. Add the dressing to the bowl with the vegetables and toss to coat. Add the lentils and half of the pistachios and toss again.

Set aside. Reduce red wine by half in a 1-quart pot over medium heat, then set aside. Melt remaining tablespoon butter in a small saute pan over medium heat, then add chopped mushrooms, garlic, onions, peppers and a pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring, until vegetables are soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Let vegetables cool for a couple of minutes, then add them to a food processor and liquify as much as possible, adding 1/4 cup beef broth if the vegetables become too sticky. Transfer back to the pan and add the reduced wine, then add the remaining 2 3/4 cups beef broth and bring back to a rolling boil. Reduce the heat and thicken with the roux until the sauce is as thick as you would like it to be.

Using your fingers, 2 knives, or a pastry blender, cut the butter and lard into the dry ingredients until mixture resembles fine crumbs. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolk and water together and add to the flour mixture. Mix quickly, but thoroughly, until mixture just comes together to form a dough. Knead briefly until pastry is smooth with no cracks; the trick to making this delicate pastry easy to work with is kneading it just enough so that it can be rolled out and manipulated without breaking but yet retains its lovely crumbly texture. Press into a flattened disk shape and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight before proceeding. Remove the pastry from the refrigerator and unwrap. Allow to soften slightly, then place on a lightly floured work surface and roll the pastry to a thickness of 1/4-inch. Using a small plate or saucer as a guide, cut out 6 (6-inch) rounds. (Scraps may be combined and reformed if you cannot get 6 rounds out of the first batch.) Stack the pastry rounds onto pieces of plastic wrap or parchment paper (with pieces between each round to keep them from sticking together) and refrigerate while you prepare the filling. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove the pastry circles from the refrigerator. In a mixing bowl, combine the meat, onion, carrot, potato, salt and pepper and mix until thoroughly combined. Place the pastry circles on a clean work surface and place about 1/2 cup of the filling in the center of 1 side of the pastry. Using the beaten egg, brush the edges of the pastry and then bring the unfilled side over the filled side so that edges meet. Press edges together to seal and then crimp using your fingers or a fork. Repeat with the remaining turnovers and then transfer to a baking sheet. Brush the tops of the turnovers with the remaining egg and then cut several slits into the top of each pastry. Bake for 20 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown around the edges. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue to bake until the pasties are golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 33109,&quot;Surf And Turf: Pork and Shrimp with Garlic (Cerdo y Gambas al Ajillo) 1 (2-pound) pork loin Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil 2 cups white rice 2 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 (16-ounce) can red beans 1 (16-ounce) can black beans 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 1 shallot, minced 1 small jalapeno pepper, stems and seeds removed and minced (use gloves when handling these or any hot peppers) 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 1 cup chicken stock 1 cup mango juice, preferably with no additional sugar added Salt, if needed, and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup honey 1 tablespoon grapeseed oil 1 tablespoon butter 4 garlic cloves 1 pound (21 to 30-count) shrimp, shells removed and deveined Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Rub the pork loin with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. In a large skillet with oven safe handles, heat the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat and sear the pork loin on all sides. Cover with foil and roast in the oven until fork tender, about 35 to 45 minutes to 1 hour. At the 30 minute mark, you will remove the foil and brush some of the mango honey sauce on the pork. Bring 5 cups water to a boil in a saucepan with a lid. Add rice, butter and salt. Return to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and let cook for 20 minutes without removing the lid. After the pork loin has been placed in the oven, begin the mango honey sauce. In a saucepan, heat the grapeseed oil over medium-high heat and saute shallot until translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in jalapeno and vinegar and cook for about 1 minute. Add chicken stock and mango juice, bring to a boil. Allow to reduce by 2/3, about 10 minutes. Stir in the honey and allow to thicken, about 2 minutes. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the sauce in a small bowl, cover and keep warm by immersing in a larger container of hot water. Uncover the pork and brush some of the mango glaze on the pork and allow to caramelize on the surface of the meat in the oven. Remove the rice from the heat and let sit covered for a minutes. Heat the beans over medium heat and keep warm. Remove pork from oven and let rest. Fold the beans into the rice, cover and let rest. For the shrimp, heat the grapeseed oil over medium heat in a skillet and add the butter to melt. Add the garlic and saute for a couple of minutes, being careful not to burn it. Add the shrimp and cook until just pink and opaque and remove from heat. (Do not overcook the shrimp.) Slice down the pork. Spoon some rice and beans into the center of serving plate.

Trim the woody ends from the asparagus. Spread the spears in a single layer in a shallow roasting pan baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and roll to coat thoroughly. Roast the asparagus until lightly browned and tender, about 10 minutes, giving the pan a good shake about halfway through. Meanwhile, put the egg yolk, lemon juice, and cayenne in a blender. Pulse a couple times to combine. Put the butter in a small microwave proof bowl and heat in a microwave until just melted. With the blender running, gradually add the melted butter into the egg to make a smooth frothy sauce. If the sauce is really thick blend in a teaspoon of lukewarm water to loosen it up. Season with the salt and serve immediately or keep warm in a small heat-proof bowl set over hot (but not simmering) water until ready to serve. Spread the roasted asparagus on a serving platter. Grind a generous amount of pepper over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 33111,&quot;Spicy Ranch Dressing 1 clove garlic 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided 1 cup sour cream 1/4 cup buttermilk 1/4 cup loose packed fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper 1 teaspoon dried dill 1 teaspoon dehydrated onion flakes 2 drops Worcestershire sauce</p>",126)]))}const m=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
