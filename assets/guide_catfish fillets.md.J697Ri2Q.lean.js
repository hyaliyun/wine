In a large bowl, add the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt and cayenne and whisk to combine. Whisk in the beer, being sure to remove any lumps. Cut the catfish fillets in half lengthwise to make 2 strips. If desired, cut into bite-sized pieces. In a small bowl add the salt, pepper and granulated garlic. Season the fillets with some of the salt mixture. Reserve the remaining salt mixture for another use. Dip each strip in the beer batter and add to the fryer, a few at a time, moving them around so they don&#39;t stick. Fry until brown and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the fryer to a serving platter. Repeat with the remaining fillets and season the fish with lemon juice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12420,&quot;Salmon Piccata 5 ounces salmon, skin off Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil<br> 1 teaspoon slivered garlic<br> 1 teaspoon minced shallots<br> 2 ounces canned cannellini beans, rinsed and drained<br> 1 cup spinach<br> 1 ounce lemon juice 1 ounce vegetable or fish stock<br> 1 tablespoon capers, lightly chopped<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped<br> Instructions: Dry the salmon with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper.

Add the mushrooms and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Soften the miso in a small bowl by mixing it with a few tablespoons of hot dashi. Pour the softened miso into the saucepan. Heat the soup, being careful not to boil, and add tofu. Pour into individual soup bowls and garnish with the green onions. Combine the water and kelp in a large pot. Bring the water to a boil, removing the kelp just before water boils since it emits a strong odor. If the fleshiest part of the kelp is still tough, return it to the water for a few more minutes, along with a little cold water. (Soft kelp means sufficient flavor has been extracted.) Remove the kelp and bring stock to a full boil. Add 1/4 cup cold water to bring the temperature down quickly and add the bonito flakes. Bring to a boil, and then immediately remove from the heat. (If bonito flakes boil too long, the stock becomes bitter.) Allow the flakes to settle to the bottom of the pan, then filter the stock through cheesecloth. &quot;,&quot;[Sak, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 12422,&quot;Turkey Avocado Wraps 1/4 cup low-fat ranch dressing 2 tablespoons chipotle salsa 1/4 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 4 8-inch flour tortillas 12 ounces sliced oven-roasted deli-style turkey breast 1 ripe Hass avocado, pitted, peeled, and sliced 2 cups mesclun lettuce or sprigs cilantro 1 1/2 cups grated jicama 1 tomato, thinly sliced 2 scallions (white and green parts), thinly sliced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions:</p><ol><li>Combine ranch dressing with salsa and orange zest in a small bowl.

Pour the oil into the pan and onto the sausage. Break into bite-sized pieces and turn on the heat. Season and distribute evenly with 1 tablespoon black pepper and 2 tablespoons salt. Mix together and cook the meat until done, about 10 minutes. Once the sausage is fully cooked, turn the heat to low and distribute the flour evenly onto the sausage. Make sure the oil and the flour combine to form a thick roux. Once each sausage piece is thoroughly covered with flour, turn the heat back onto high. Add the milk to the pan and stir to break up any sausage clumps. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon pepper and 2 tablespoons salt to the milk. Bring to a simmer and cook, mixing periodically so that the flour does not cook on the bottom of the pan. Once the milk starts to boil, continually stir the mixture as it thickens, ensuring it doesn&#39;t burn. Once the sausage starts to \\pull\\ from the sides of the pan, the gravy is cooked completely. Pour into a dish and refrigerate overnight so it gets gelatinous. For the dough: In a sauce pan, melt the butter. When melted, whisk in the milk, then pour into a mixer bowl. Add the yeast, flour, sugar, egg yolks and salt to the bowl and mix on low until the mixture is fully incorporated. Turn the mixer up slightly and knead until the dough is smooth. Portion the dough into 3-ounce balls immediately and set aside to proof until the dough is soft and supple, about 30 minutes. Building the sausage and gravy kolache: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When the dough is soft and plump, place a ball into one hand and flatten. Use a spoon to scoop the sausage and gravy filling into the center of the flattened dough in your palm. Pull the outside portion of the dough up and around the filling, pinching the dough closed at the top. Invert the ball with the seam on the bottom and place on a baking sheet.

Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12478,&quot;Lucerne Cheese Torte 1 cup sifted cake flour 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 large eggs, room temperature 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 1/4 cups water 2 1/4 cups granulated sugar 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, strained 4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature 1 tablespoon sour cream 1 teaspoon lemon zest 2 large egg yolks 2 tablespoons water 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: For the cake: Position rack in lower third of over 5 to 6 inches from the bottom and preheat to 350 degrees. Grease the bottom and sides of a 8-inch round pan with solid shortening. Dust generously with flour, tilt to distribute, then tap out excess, and insert a parchment or waxed paper liner.<br> Pour the flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, and salt in that order into a triple sifter or sieve. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper to distribute the sugar evenly and to remove any lumps in the flour, set aside. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Pour into a 1 quart mixing bowl, and set aside.<br> Crack the eggs into the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer. Add the 1/2 cup sugar, and whisk by hand to combine. Rest the bowl in a shallow pan, such as a 10 inch skillet, filled with 1-inch of water that feels hot to the touch (120 degrees). To prevent the eggs from setting, whisk them continuously for about 30 seconds. Now test if the mixture has warmed to body temperature, taking care that it does not exceed 110 degrees.<br> Attach the bowl to the mixer, and with the whisk attachment, whip on medium speed (#5) until the mixture has cooled and increased considerably in volume (tripled or more), appears light in texture and almost white in color, and has thickened to the consistency of a whole egg meringue (about 3 to 4 minutes). Pour in the vanilla during the final moments of whipping. Test if it is time to fold in the flour by lifting the whisk. If some of the mixture falls back into the bowl in ribbons and remains on the surface, proceed. But if it sinks back into the batter right away, continue whipping for a few more minutes, or until the desired consistency is achieved. Then remove the bowl and its whisk from the mixer.<br> With the aid of a flexible metal icing spatula, scoop up one third of the flour mixture, and sprinkle it over the top. Using a rubber spatula, fold the mixture into the batter just until incorporated. Repeat procedure two more times, folding just until all the flour has been absorbed.<br> Gently pour about 1 cup of the batter into the melted butter, and with the rubber spatula, fold until combined. Return the butter mixture to reserved batter, and again fold to combine. Gently pour the mixture into the pan, taking care not to deflate the foam structure you have created. With a rubber spatula, smooth the top of the batter, working from the center outward, until a slightly raised ridge forms around the outside rim. (Since the cake bakes faster near the metal rim, mounding the batter around the edges assures a more evenly baked layer.) Bake for 25 to 27 minutes, or until the top springs back slightly when lightly touched, sounding spongy when tapped, and the sides begin to contract from the pan.<br> Place the cake on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. With mitts, tilt and rotate the pan, and gently tap it on the counter to see if the cake is releasing from the metal sides. If not, or if in doubt, run a small metal spatula or the thin blade of a table knife between the outside cake edge and the metal rim, freeing the sides and allowing air to get under the layer as it is rotated. Cover the pan with another cooking rack, invert it onto that rack, and carefully lift the pan from the cake to remove. Slowly peel off the parchment liner, turn it over so that the sticky side faces up, and reposition it on top of the cake. Cover with the first rack, invert the layer right side up, and remove the top rack. Allow cake to cool completely.<br> If you plan to assemble a dessert later in the day or the next, leave the genoise out, uncovered, on a rack to airdry. (Most genoises benefit from slight staling since they will absorb the dessert syrup more easily.) The theory behind using dessert syrup is twofold: It makes it possible to keep the dessert longer, and it adds to a complexity of flavors.) For the syrup: Pour the water into a 1 1/2 quart saucepan. Add the sugar; stir to blend; then bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and cool. Pour into a container with a lid and refrigerate up to 6 months. Combine the Soaking Syrup and lemon juice in a liquid cup measure. Set aside. For the filling: In a 2 to 3 quart mixing bowl, manipulate the cream cheese with a rubber spatula until smooth. Gradually add the butter, stirring until smooth and homogeneous. Lastly, stir in the sour cream and lemon zest; set aside. Place the egg yolks in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer and with the whisk attachment, whip them on medium speed (#5) until light in color and fluffy in texture (about 2 minutes). Detach whisk and remove bowl; set whisk close by to use later. Combine the water and sugar in a heavybottomed saucepan or sugar pot. Place over low heat, swirling the pot occasionally to distribute heat until the sugar completely dissolves (about 2 minutes). Keep a pastry brush in a small glass of water to wash down any sugar crystals that form along the sides of the pot. As soon as the sugar has dissolved, increase heat to high and boil until it registers 238 degrees (soft ball stage) on a mercury candy thermometer (about 5 minutes). Quickly pour the syrup into the center of the whipped yolks and whisk vigorously by hand to combine, using the mixer&#39;s whisk attachment. Reattach the bowl and its whisk to the mixer and whip on medium speed (#5) until the egg yolk mixture thickens, increases in volume, lightens in color and texture and cools to room temperature (about 4 minutes). Whisk into the cream cheese mixture until blended smoothly. Whip the heavy cream in a deep 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Then fold into cream cheese buttercream. The consistency is soft and thin, but after refrigeration, the cream cheese and fat become firm to give the filling body and texture. Yield: 1 1/2 cups Cutting the Cake:<br> The genoise is cut in such a fashion that its exterior is left intact, but a core is removed. Imagine a 1/2-inch thick border around the outside edge of the cake. Now, using the tip of a shortbladed paring knife, cut along the imaginary line with a sawing motion around the entire cake, stopping short of the cake&#39;s bottom by 1/2-inch. Loosen the 6 1/2-inch circle or inner core of the cake without disturbing the outer shell. Using a small serrated knife, such as a tomato knife, insert the blade into the side of the cake 1/2-inch from the bottom, creating a small slit. Keeping the knife horizontal and level, pivot the serrated edge in one direction, trying not to cut through the outer shell of cake. (This will eventually loosen the entire bottom of the inner core.)<br> Remove the knife, insert it back into the slit with the serrated edge facing the opposite direction, and pivot the other way. Repeat three more times, rotating the cake a quarter turn each time. After completing four cuts, you should have loosened the core sufficiently to lift it out. Test it gently with a fork around the edge of the core; if you meet resistance anywhere, insert the serrated knife back into the nearest slit, and pivot the blade again. Be patient and keep pivoting as well as tracing the top circle, and soon you&#39;ll be able to lift the core with the aid of the fork.<br> Remove the center core of the cake; it should measure about 6 1/2 to 7 inches in diameter and be about 1-inch thick. Place the core on a flat work surface. Mentally divide it in half horizontally. Now, using the paring knife, cut all the way around the side of the cake about 1/2-inch deep on that imaginary line. Slide a 12-inch knife into the cut. Holding the knife steady in that path, rotate the cake in a circle into the knife blade, cutting in a slow sawing motion all around, until the cake is evenly split into two 1/2-inch thick layers.<br> Remove the top 1/2-inch layer, wrap it in plastic, and save for future use. Split the remaining 1/2- inch layer into two 1/4-inch thick layers, using the same cutting procedure as above. Remove the top 1/4-inch layer and set aside. (Use a removable quiche bottom to aid in lifting, if necessary.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12479,&quot;Orange Cream Pop Sundae 2 pints vanilla ice cream Orange Magic Chocolate Sauce, recipe follows Chocolate-Dipped Clementine Segments, recipe follows 4 fresh mint sprigs<br> 1/2 cup coconut oil 1 tablespoon corn syrup<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons orange or clementine zest<br> 5 drops orange gel food coloring<br> 1 1/4 cups chopped white chocolate or white chocolate chips<br> 1/2 cup chopped dark chocolate or dark chocolate chips 2 clementines, peeled and separated into segments<br> 1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt<br> Instructions: Divide the ice cream among 4 bowls.

Pour into a medium bowl; sprinkle with the yeast and let soften, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the sugar and set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and fine salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. With the mixer on low speed, add the yeast mixture and butter and mix until the dough is slightly smooth and soft but still sticky, about 2 minutes. Coat a large bowl with cooking spray; add the dough, cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Generously coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Stretch into a 16-inch-long log, about 2 inches wide; cut into 8 even pieces. Roll and stretch each piece into a 6-inch-long rope, then wind into a coil; tuck the end underneath. Transfer the rolls to the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature 15 minutes, then refrigerate until slightly puffed, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Fill a large pot or deep skillet with 3 inches of water. Add the baking soda and 1/4 cup coarse salt and bring to a boil. Add half of the rolls and cook until slightly puffed, about 1 minute, flipping halfway through with a slotted spoon. Recoat the baking sheet with cooking spray and return the rolls to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining rolls. Brush the rolls lightly with the beaten egg, then sprinkle with coarse salt. Transfer to the oven and bake until the rolls are deep golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes on the pan, then remove the rolls to the rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12489,&quot;Apple Tarte Tatin 3 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and each sliced into 12 to 16 thin wedges 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 stick unsalted butter 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed and chilled Ginger or cinnamon gelato or whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Mix the sliced apples together with 1/2 cup of the sugar and the lemon juice in a large bowl and set aside. The lemon juice will give flavor as well as keep your apple wedges from oxidizing. Melt the butter in a 12-inch nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup sugar evenly over the melting butter. Place the apples in the skillet, flat-side down, starting from the outside and working in, slightly overlapping one another. Fill in the center with the remaining apples. Return the skillet to medium-low heat on the stovetop and cook until the caramel darkens in color evenly, 20 to 25 minutes. Keeping your heat on medium-low will ensure that your caramel doesn&#39;t burn and cooks evenly. Remove the skillet from the heat. Lay the puff pastry over the skillet and simply fold the corners in to fit into the pan. Bake until the crust has puffed and is golden brown, 20 minutes. Let cool, making sure that it is cool enough to handle. Loosen up the edges using a butter knife. Place a plate or platter larger than the skillet right on top. Carefully (but with gusto!) flip the tart upside-down onto the plate. If the apples stick to the skillet, carefully remove them and put them back where they belong on the tart. Serve the warm tart with gelato or whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 12490,&quot;Profiteroles 1 cup milk 1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter Pinch kosher salt 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 extra-large eggs 1/2 cup heavy cream 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons prepared coffee Good vanilla ice cream (recommended: Haagen-Dazs), for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Heat the milk, butter, and salt over medium heat until scalded. When the butter is melted, add the flour all at once and beat it with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together and forms a dough. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat for 2 minutes.

Preheat the oven at 350 degrees F. Remove the ribs and keep the marinade for later. Sear the short ribs in a heavy saucepan on medium high or until golden brown on all sides and remove. Add the carrot, leek, celery in the saucepan and caramelize on high heat, then deglaze with the reserved marinade. Bring to a boil and add the short ribs again, veal stock, ketchup, and honey. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and place in the oven for 3 hours or until the meat falls off the bone. Remove from oven, strain liquid and skim the fat. On medium heat, reduce the braising liquid by half, about 30 minutes. Keep aside for the creamy mushroom sauce. For the filling: Rehydrate the dried mushrooms in hot water for about 15 minutes and keep the liquid for the sauce. Place the onions in a saute pan and cook on low heat for about 30 minutes, until golden brown and caramelized, stirring on a regular basis. In another pan, saute the rehydrated mushrooms in olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Add the shredded short rib meat and caramelized onions. Season with salt and pepper. Keep aside. For the pasta dough: Place the flour on a table in a mound and make a well in the center. Put the eggs and salt into the well. Whisk the eggs together with a fork, and gently incorporate the flour into the egg mixture a little at a time. Using your hands, bring the mixture together to form a ball. Knead the pasta dough, about 5 minutes. Put the dough in a bowl with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes until ready to roll your fresh pasta. The pasta can be used right away or will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. Cut the pasta dough into 4 equal sections. Flatten one of the dough balls with the palm of your hand until it&#39;s about 1/2-inch thick and no wider than the slot of the pasta machine. If you don&#39;t have a pasta machine, a rolling pin will work fine but make sure to roll the dough thin enough. Adjust the slot of the pasta machine to its widest setting (usually number 7). Turn the handle while feeding the dough through the slot. Gently hold the flattened dough as it comes out of the pasta machine, but don&#39;t pull on it. After the dough has completely passed through the pasta machine, turn the slot down to the next smallest setting and pass the dough through the slot. As you make the slot smaller, your sheet of dough will become longer. Try to gently hold the dough as it exits the pasta machine so it doesn&#39;t tear. Continue passing the dough through the machine until it&#39;s about a 1/16-inch thick or number 2 on the pasta machine. For the ravioli: Using 2 spoons, place about 1 tablespoon of filling into each pocket. Leave 2-inches in between each of them. Brush the edges of the pasta with water. This will help the ravioli to seal tightly when boiled. Place another sheet of pasta over the ravioli filling. Press out any air to form a seal around each ravioli. Using a cookie cutter to cut desired shape. Place the raviolis in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet to prevent from sticking. At this point, if you want to freeze the ravioli for later, place the entire baking sheet into the freezer. Once the ravioli have frozen, you can remove the pasta and place them in resealable bags. For the sauce: In a pan on medium heat, saute the shallots and fresh mushrooms in olive oil and butter until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper. Add reserved short rib braising liquid and water from the rehydrated mushrooms. Continue cooking until quantity is reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Add the cream and let simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. For serving: Cook the ravioli in salted boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes or until the ravioli floats. Serve 3 to 4 raviolis per person, add the mushroom sauce and garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 12508,&quot;Butter-Me-Up Scampi Bucatini Salt 1 pound bucatini pasta 1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails off 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 2 lemons, 1 sliced and 1 juiced 1 stick butter 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 cup flat-leaf parsley, loosely packed 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon fennel seeds 1/2 cup white wine or white vermouth Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat.

Sprinkle the chicken chunks with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Quickly brown the chicken, in batches if necessary, and transfer it to a plate. Deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup of the chicken stock, after fond is deglazed, transfer the liquid to a small bowl and set aside. Give the pan a quick rinse and towel dry. Put the pan back over medium-high heat and when the pan is hot, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil (but not smoking) add the onion, and 2 pinches of salt, saute until nearly translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes, Stir in the garlic and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the dry spices to onion/garlic mixture and saute for 2 minutes. Next add the remaining 1 3/4 cups chicken stock (including stock from deglazing), and bring to a near boil but not bubbling. Turn the heat down to simmer, and whisk in the almond butter, tomato paste, sriracha sauce, salt to taste, and honey. Whisk the sauce until completely incorporated. Add chocolate pieces, and continue to whisk until melted. Gently simmer the sauce for 5 minutes on the stove, take the pan off the heat, and immerse the chicken into mole sauce. Cover the pan and put it into the oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees F. Remove the cover from the pan and bake for 1 hour. As the mole bakes, spoon the mole sauce over the chicken if the chicken is exposed periodically, or give a gentle stir every once and a while if you see a skin forming. If the mole sauce seems to be reducing too much (if it looks overly pasty), then add a splash of chicken stock to thin it out. Take the pan out of the oven, remove chicken from the pan to a covered dish to keep warm. The sauce should be thick; if it&#39;s not gravy-thick then reduce it for a few minutes on the stove top. If the sauce is overly thick then thin it out with a splash of chicken stock. Taste and add more kosher salt if you like. Stir in most of the cilantro (reserve a few pinches for garnish), then add the chicken back to the sauce. Spoon the chicken mole into a serving dish and top with the diced tomato and remaining cilantro. Good accompaniments include a Spanish-style rice, roasted potatoes, stewed Mexican-style black beans, roasted pumpkin, or squash. Cook&#39;s Notes:</p><ul><li>I prefer bone-in but can use boneless, bone in will make for moister, more flavorful chicken, if medium-size then split and cut breast (with or without bone-in) into 3rds, for large chicken breasts then cut into quarters.</li><li>Sriracha sauce is a spicy sauce from Vietnam with rooster on label, or you can substitute with fresh minced habanero pepper or good quality hot sauce to taste, (if not using sriracha make sure you use substitute heat with caution, for example 1 teaspoon fresh habanero is far hotter than equal part sriracha) but sriracha works best in this recipe.

Mix with your hands. Set out 3 bowls. Put the buttermilk into 1 bowl, the flour in another, and the remaining buffalo sauce in the last bowl. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat, and add 4 cups of canola oil. When the oil starts to separate in the pan, it is ready; if oil starts to smoke, immediately lower the temperature. Dredge the chicken in the buttermilk, and then in the flour. Carefully put them into the hot oil and cook on both sides until brown. Dip the chicken into the buffalo sauce and serve them between Hawaiian bread buns. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 12546,&quot;Vanilla Gelato Bites with Chocolate and Hazelnuts 1 pint vanilla gelato or ice cream 1 (12-ounce) bag chocolate chips (about 2 cups) 1 cup finely chopped toasted hazelnuts (about 5 ounces) Special equipment: bite-sized ice cream scoop and wooden popsticks Instructions: Place a small tray or a plate in the freezer. Remove the gelato from the freezer to soften, about 5 minutes. Remove the chilled tray from the freezer. Scoop out 16 bite-sized balls of gelato and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Remove from the freezer and quickly insert a wooden popstick into each gelato ball. Return them to the freezer for at least 1 hour. When the gelato balls have frozen with their sticks in place, place the chocolate in a double-boiler over very gently simmering water until melted. Next to the pot of chocolate, place the toasted, chopped hazelnuts in a shallow bowl. Remove the gelato balls from the freezer, 4 at a time. Working quickly, hold the gelato ball by the stick and dip into the melted chocolate, then dredge it in the hazelnuts. Return them to the freezer and continue with 4 more gelato balls, until all the gelato balls are covered in chocolate and nuts. Freeze the chocolate-and-nut-covered gelato for at least 1 hour.

Lay the strips out on baking sheet pan and salt generously. Set aside. Roast the peppers over a gas flame or broil on a sheet pan until completely charred, about 8 minutes. Put the peppers in a bowl, cover, and set aside until just cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes. Rub the skins off the peppers with your fingers to remove most of the charred skin. Core and remove the seeds, then slice the peppers lengthwise into 1 1/2-inch strips. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Mix the goat cheese, olives, thyme, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Thoroughly wipe excess salt and moisture from zucchini and squash with paper towel. Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce into the bottom of an 8- by 11-inch baking dish. Begin layering, remembering to season with pepper between each layer. Start with the zucchini and then summer squash and all the peppers. Dollop spoonfuls of the cheese over the peppers and then spread it out to cover. Spoon half of the remaining sauce over the vegetables. Repeat with the remaining zucchini, squash, goat cheese, and sauce. Sprinkle top layer with Parmesan and bake, covered, for 30 minutes, then uncover. Continue baking until the vegetables are tender and the sauce thickens, about 30 minutes more. Let lasagna stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Put the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, vinegar, and salt in a sauce pan. Bring to a boil over high heat, lower heat to a brisk simmer, and cook until thickened, about 30 minutes.

Stir occasionally to combine. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a large heatproof bowl until they become lighter in color and the sugar dissolves. When the milk mixture is at a simmer, lower the heat to medium. Carefully ladle 1 cup of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, while whisking, and whisk until fully combined. Repeat this step one more time, then pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan. Add the salt. Cook the mixture while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, making sure to stir the corners of the pot. Cook until the mixture thickens and can coat the back of a spoon. Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl or pot with water and ice. Carefully strain the mixture into a strainer set over a heatproof bowl. Remove and discard the vanilla bean. Put the heatproof bowl in the ice bath. Stir occasionally until the mixture is chilled and no longer warm. Set in the fridge until very cold, at least 1 hour. Freeze the mixture to an ice-cream maker and process according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Transfer to a freezer-proof container and cover. Freeze before serving, 1 to 2 hours. It&#39;s best to serve the gelato the same day it&#39;s made. For the compote: Combine the cherries, 1/2 cup water and the sugar in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a bare simmer over medium heat. Stir to allow the sugar to melt. Cook the compote until the ingredients combine and the cherries just begin to break up, 7 to 10 minutes. (Depending on the ripeness of your cherries you may want to cook them longer.) Remove the pan from the heat and add the rum. Ignite the compote safely with a long-handled lighter and return to the stovetop to flambe and cook off the alcohol. Serve the gelato with the warm compote. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 12559,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Chia Seed Pudding Parfaits 3 tablespoons chia seeds 2 tablespoons honey or agave nectar 1 cup oat milk, plus a splash more if needed, preferably Planet Oat Extra Creamy Oatmilk 1 mashed ripe banana, frozen 2 tablespoons chocolate hazelnut spread 1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts, chopped 1/4 cup salted banana or plantain chips, crushed or chopped Instructions: For the pudding: In a small bowl, whisk together the chia seeds and honey or agave. Add the oat milk, whisking to break up any clumps. Refrigerate for 3 hours, stirring halfway through. The pudding is ready when the seeds soak up all of the oat milk. It shouldn\\u2019t be stiff; it should jiggle a bit. If needed, to slightly loosen for texture, add a splash of oat milk and stir. For the chocolate hazelnut and banana layer: Using a mini chopper, blend the banana and chocolate hazelnut spread until smooth. To assemble the parfaits: In a 6- to 8-ounce glass or cup, layer a quarter of the chia seed pudding, half of the blended banana mixture, and another quarter of the chia seed pudding.

Cook, whisking constantly, until light amber in color, 5 to 7 minutes. For the first dough: Mix the flour and boiling water together in a small bowl until a dough forms. Knead for a minute or two to make sure that everything comes together. Set aside. For the second dough: Meanwhile, pour the room temperature water into the bowl of a stand mixer and top with flour and salt. Mix with the dough hook on medium-low speed until dough starts to come together. While dough is in the beginning phase of mixing, add in the hot water dough in small chunks. Knead on medium-low speed until the dough comes together and leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto a work surface (oiled so the dough does not stick) and knead by hand until smooth and one consistent temperature; be careful not to overwork. Wrap tightly in plastic and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. For rolling out: Divide dough into 65-gram portions and cover with plastic wrap. (The dough dries out very quickly before it is rolled out, so be sure to keep it covered if you are not working with it.) Squeeze a tablespoon or so of oil onto a very clean marble, stone or metal countertop and spread around. Place one dough ball in the center of the oiled surface. Gently but using force, roll dough ball with a floured rolling pin until very thin and slightly translucent. The rolled dough will be oddly shaped and that is okay. If the dough rips, that&#39;s also ok--it&#39;s still usable. Once dough is rolled to translucent point, brush with a layer of roux and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of sliced scallions. Working from the bottom end of the rolled dough (the end closest to your body), begin gently rolling dough up like a cigar. The end result will be a long \\snake. Twist the snake into a coil. Smash the coil down with your palm and roll this into a 6- to 8-inch-wide pancake. Repeat until all your pancakes are complete. Store pancakes in the refrigerator between layers of parchment paper greased with oil until you&#39;re ready to cook. Heat a pan over medium-low heat. Add a small amount of oil and a cold pancake to the pan. Cover with a lid and cook until light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes, before flipping and covering again. Cook the other side until golden brown, another 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to a plate. Serve the hot scallion pancakes with the slaw. For the ginger soy dressing: Combine the mustard, soy sauce, vinegar, maple syrup, ginger and shallot in a blender and blend until smooth. Add the egg yolk and turn blender on low speed. Drizzle in the oil until the dressing is thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the slaw: Stir together the cabbages, mushrooms, cilantro, mint and parsley.

Once each jar is lined with pie dough, fill each with 1/2 a cup of cherry pie filling. Place a small pat of butter on top of each pie, and top with the pie dough circles or make a lattice pattern. Make sure you vent the top of the crust by creating a slit so that the steam can escape. Using your finger or a fork, press the 2 pieces of dough together around the perimeter. Brush each pie crust with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar. Seal each jar with its metal lid and place in the freezer for up to 3 weeks. Baking instructions: If baking pies fresh, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. If baking pies that have been frozen, bring them to room temperature before placing in the oven. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 12567,&quot;Spiced Pineapple Lentils 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 onions, diced 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 garlic cloves, crushed 2 cups lentils, washed and picked over 3 cups water 1/2 cup canned crushed pineapple Instructions: Heat the oil in a medium pot over moderate heat.

Also, wash and chop them when you come in from market, then they are ready for you to cook up even quicker. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and toss 2 minutes, then add chard in bunches and keep it moving as it wilts up a bit - you are just searing it up. The greens should remain crisp and crunchy. Wilting them all and searing them up should take no more than 3 to 4 minutes. Season the greens with nutmeg and salt and pepper, to taste. Douse the pan with a little vinegar and remove from heat. Toss to cook off vinegar and serve the greens hot. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 12569,&quot;Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie 11/4 cups dry-roasted, salted peanuts 1/2 cup granulated sugar Pinch ground cloves 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 1/2 cups milk 2 large eggs 1 cup confectioner&#39;s sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch Pinch fine salt 4 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate 11/4 cups heavy cream, chilled 1 tablespoon confectioner&#39;s sugar Instructions:</p><ol><li>For crust: Preheat oven to 350degreesF.

Let it sizzle and, using a fork, whisk or wooden spoon, beat cream and paste together until combined. Still beating gently, add the rest of the coconut milk, fish stock, fish sauce, sugar, lemongrass, lime leaves (if using) and turmeric. Bring to a boil and then add the pumpkin. Cook on a fast simmer until the pumpkin is tender, about 15 minutes, although different sorts of pumpkins can vary enormously in the time they take to cook; some squash can take a little as 5 minutes. As I mentioned, you can cook the curry up until this part in advance, maybe leaving the pumpkin with a tiny bit of bite to it (it will soften and cook as the pan cools). Either way, when you&#39;re about 5 minutes from wanting to eat, get ready to cook the seafood. So, to the robustly simmering pan, add the salmon and shrimp (if you&#39;re using frozen shrimp they&#39;ll need to go in before the salmon). When the salmon and shrimp have cooked through, which shouldn&#39;t take more than 3 to 4 minutes, stir in any green vegetable you&#39;re using - sliced, chopped or shredded as suits - and tamp down with a wood spoon. When the bok choy is wilted, or other green vegetable is cooked, squeeze in the juice of half a lime, stir and taste and add the juice of the remaining half if you feel it needs it. Take the pan off the heat and pour the curry into a large bowl, and sprinkle over the cilantro; the point is that the cilantro goes in just before serving. Serve with more chopped cilantro for people to add their own bowls as they eat, and some plain Thai or basmati rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 12571,&quot;Beignets aux Pommes 2 1/4 cups unsifted all-purpose flour Pinch salt 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 2/3 cups beer 1 cup warm water 2 egg yolks 2 tablespoons butter, melted 2 egg whites, stifly beaten Oil, for deep frying 1/2 cup superfine sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 6 apples (Granny Smith, Rome Beauty, Pippin) 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/2 Kirsch Instructions: Combine flour, salt, sugar, beer, water, yolks, and butter.

Combine in a food processor the achiote paste, olive oil, cumin, coriander, oregano, and 1 tablespoon garlic. Make sure to puree all these ingredients until it becomes a paste. Rub the marinade inside the Cornish hen cavities, underneath the skin, as well as outside. Allow the hens to marinade overnight, refrigerated. Next day, heat up a large saute pan. Add the chorizo and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and remaining 4 tablespoons garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the mustard greens and deglaze with the chicken stock. Cook until greens have wilted, about 2 minutes, and then add the potato, green olives, and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Once the stuffing has cooled, distribute it equally into the hens and place them on a sheet with a rack.

Add the remaining ingredients, except the vegetable oil, and combine well. Roll into about 20 or so balls, about 2 inches in diameter. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, shut off the heat (to avoid splattering). Add the meatballs in a single layer and spread somewhat apart so they have a chance to \\brown\\ instead of steaming. Put the skillet back on high heat and brown the meatballs, turning them so they brown all around. Treat them like hamburgers and cook them until they are medium-rare, about 3 to 5 minutes. Touch them to make sure they are still tender in the center. Add the meatballs to the hot tomato sauce and allow them to bubble slightly and simmer over very low heat for a few minutes.

Set aside until needed. At the same time, boil the potatoes until soft and drain well. Begin the sauce while the squash and potatoes for the rissole are boiling. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat in a saucepot (reserving the other 2 tablespoons) and cook the onion until translucent. Add the chicken stock, vinegar, soy sauce, and potato chunks and let the potato chunks cook while the liquid reduces and thickens. For the chicken, preheat oven to 375 degrees F. While the chicken stock mixture is cooking for the sauce, season chicken breasts with salt, pepper and lime powder. Heat the grapeseed oil over medium high heat in a separate large skillet and sear the chicken leaving undisturbed for the first 3 minutes or so on each side to let the seasonings integrate into the surface of the chicken and allow the caramelization process to begin to prevent tearing of the chicken or \\crusting off\\ of the seasonings. After the chicken is seared on both sides, transfer to a baking sheet and finish chicken in the oven. For the garnish, boil asparagus spears until just tender in salt water and set aside. In the same pan you used to sear the chicken, heat additional grapeseed oil (if needed) and saute the white onion until tender. Transfer the onion to the potatoes which have been boiled for the rissole cakes, reserving the saute pan. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper, and mash together. Fold in the white chocolate chips, scallions, cranberries, and cubes of squash, trying not to break up the squash. Allow to sit until cool enough to handle, then use a 3-inch circle cutter to form rissole cakes. In the same pan, heat additional grapeseed oil (if needed) over medium-high heat and sear the rissole cakes. Leave undisturbed for the first 2 to 3 minutes on each side to let the caramelization process begin and to prevent the cake from breaking apart. When you see the edges of the cake beginning to turn golden brown, flip and sear the other side. Then cook further until the cake is firm. Remove from heat and keep warm. In the same pan, sear the asparagus spears for a few minutes to add a little color and a nutty flavor. Return to the pot of the chicken stock mixture which has been cooking for the sauce. Fold the white chocolate chips into the sauce, and transfer the sauce to a blender and puree until smooth. Whisk in the reserved 2 tablespoons butter to finish the sauce, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place a rissole cake on serving plate, top with a chicken breast, spoon sauce over and garnish with asparagus spears. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12575,&quot;Fried Catfish Deviled Eggs 2 whole eggs, hard-boiled and peeled 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 tablespoon sweet relish 1 teaspoon mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil, for frying 1 cup flour 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1 catfish fillet Fresh dill sprigs, for garnish Paprika, for garnish Instructions: Slice the eggs in half lengthwise.

Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to smoke, carefully place one piece of pork in the saute pan and sear, turning once, until golden. Remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining pieces of pork. Set aside. Carefully add the beer to the drippings in the pan and cook, scraping up the cooked bits with a wooden spoon, until reduced. Heat the remaining 5 tablespoons of oil in a large flame-proof roasting pan over medium heat. Add the celery, onions, carrots, garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the pork to the roasting pan. Add the deglazed pan juices and enough chicken stock to cover the pork and vegetables. Add the peppercorns, thyme, bay leaves and 2 generous pinches of salt. Cover the pan with foil and braise for 3 hours. Remove the foil and roast 30 minutes more. This will allow the pork to gain a beautiful color and for the braising liquid to reduce. Let the pork cool in the braising liquid for 30 minutes to increase tenderness. Remove the pork from the roasting pan and strain the braising liquid. Refrigerate separately until ready to use. The pork can be served sliced or shredded. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Rioja, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 12578,&quot;Bean Curd Dengaku with Miso Toppings Scant 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoon white miso 1/2 cup red miso 4 egg yolks 4 tablespoons sake 4 tablespoons mirin 4 tablespoons sugar 14 tablespoons dashi Ground toasted sesame seeds Grated rind of yuzu citron, lemon or lime Ground kinome leaves Fresh ginger juice 2 cakes white tofu, preferably \\cotton\\ tofu 1 green bell pepper White poppy seeds Kinome sprigs Toasted white sesame seeds Toasted black sesame seeds Instructions: Make white and red miso toppings: Put 3/4 cup white miso in top of a double boiler; put 3 tablespoon white miso and red miso in top of a separate double boiler.

Set aside briefly. In a small bowl, make a paste with the 1/2 cup of the lemon juice (reserving the rest - about 1/4 cup - for a lemon-butter sauce), lemon zest, and lemon pepper. Season the swordfish steaks with salt and press some of the lemon paste into the top surface of the fish to make a crust on each. Over medium heat in a large saute pan, heat the olive oil and melt 1/4 cup butter. Starting with the crust side down first, sear the swordfish steaks. It is important to leave the fish undisturbed for about 3 minutes for the seasonings to integrate into the surface of the fish and for the caramelization process to begin. This will prevent the layer of seasonings from \\crusting off. Flip the fish and sear the other side. Swordfish must be cooked briefly because it easily dries out. Remove fish to a utility platter and let rest. (The fish will continue to cook even when it is removed from the heat because of a process known as \\carryover\\ cooking. It is especially important to be mindful of this with swordfish. Do not overcook the fish. If you cook this fish in the pan until it \\looks\\ done - it will end up being overdone after carryover cooking.) To the pan, add the reserved lemon juice and swirl to get all the bits in the pan. Remove from heat and whisk in cubed butter. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if needed. Place swordfish steaks on serving plate and drizzle with a small amount of the lemon butter sauce. Spoon citrus salad around fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 12608,&quot;Chicken Shawarma Wrap 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1 teaspoon sweet paprika<br> 1 teaspoon ground turmeric<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice<br> 1/4 teaspoon chili powder<br> 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 4 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 2 lemons, zested and juiced Kosher salt 6 skin-on, boneless chicken thighs 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar or white balsamic vinegar<br> 2 Roma tomatoes, diced<br> 1 English cucumber, diced<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> 1/2 small red onion, minced<br> Handful fresh curly parsley leaves, chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup tahini paste 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1/2 lemon, juiced<br> Kosher salt<br> 4 large flour tortillas, slightly griddled until soft 1 head romaine, shredded<br> Pickled whole Middle Eastern peppers, for serving Instructions: For the shawarma: Whisk together the oil, cumin, paprika, turmeric, allspice, chili powder, cinnamon, garlic, lemon zest and juice and 2 teaspoons salt in a container until combined.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the flour, granulated sugar and salt to a food processor and pulse 2 to 3 times to combine. Add the cold butter cubes and pulse until the butter breaks down into small, uniform-size pieces, about the size of small pebbles. Add the lime zest and egg yolks and process a few more seconds or until the mixture looks like wet sand; the dough will not come together into a ball. Spray a 9-inch nonstick tart pan lightly with cooking spray, making sure to spray the sides of the pan as well as the bottom. Pour the dough into the tart pan and spread evenly. Using your hands, press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. To prevent any dough from falling out of the pan, place your left thumb over the top of the pan along the crust and press the dough up the sides with your right pointer finger. This way, you will tightly pack the dough along the sides with your pointer finger and stop it at the top of the pan with your left thumb. Continue to press the dough into the pan and along the sides until it is tightly packed and evenly distributed. Poke the bottom of the crust with a fork all over and then place the tart pan on a baking sheet. Bake until the sides of the crust are a deep golden brown and the crust bottom is light golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely. For the mango filling: Add the mango and lime juice to a blender and puree on high speed for 1 minute until completely smooth. Hold in the blender. In a small bowl, mix together the gelatin and 1/2 cup of the coconut milk. Let stand 5 minutes. As the gelatin rehydrates, the coconut milk will begin to look curdled; don&#39;t worry--it isn&#39;t. Set a medium saucepan over medium heat and add the granulated sugar, salt and remaining coconut milk (about 1 1/4 cups). Stir the mixture together and bring to a simmer. Continue to simmer until the sugar melts completely; the coconut milk will become opaque. Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the gelatin mixture. until completely melted. Strain the mango mixture into the coconut milk mixture and whisk again to combine. Let the mixture cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Using a hand mixer, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the mango filling and then pour the entire filling into the cooled tart crust; the filling will come to the very top of the crust. Refrigerate for 2 hours to set the filling completely. You can make the tart up to this point 1 day in advance. For the tequila-lime glaze: Line a baking sheet with a cooling rack. Cut the 2 larger sides of the mango off of the pit, followed by the 2 smaller sides. Peel the 4 pieces of mango, then cut them into 1/4-inch half-moon slices. In a small bowl, whisk together the confectioner&#39; sugar, tequila and lime juice. Dip each slice of mango into the glaze and coat completely. Let drip dry over the bowl for a few seconds, then lay the mango pieces on the cooling rack for at least 15 minutes for the glaze to set. When ready to serve, remove the tart from the tart pan and place on a cake stand. Lay the mango slices in a circle around the tart, setting aside the smallest slice for later; the mango slices will meet in the center of the tart and then fan out overlapping each other around the tart. Roll the reserved mango slice into a rosette and place in the center of the tart. Garnish with the lime zest and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 12618,&quot;Grilled Chimichurri Shrimp Wraps Half a 15-ounce bag frozen french fries 1 pound 16-20 shrimp, peeled and deveined 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon steak seasoning 1 cup chimichurri sauce 2 roasted garlic naan breads 1/3 cup roasted garlic aioli 1 cup arugula 1 avocado, diced 1 vine-ripened tomato, diced 1/2 cup jarred pickled red onion Instructions: Cook the fries according to the package instructions.

Sprinkle with the salt and toss with your fingers, then make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the beaten egg. Quickly combine with your fingers and as the dough starts to come together, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time, up to 3 tablespoons total. Keep kneading until you get a solid but soft ball of dough, about 5 minutes. Place it in a bowl and cover with a damp towel for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll them each out on a floured surface to make a skinny log about 10-inches-long. Pinch off a small piece of dough, just enough to cover your fingertip, and roll the dough against the floured work surface with your thumb, creating a \\little ear. Transfer the orecchiette to a large piece of parchment paper. Keep pinching and making the orecchiette with your thumbs until no dough is left. In the meantime, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Pick up the sides of the parchment paper to slide the fresh pasta into the water. Boil until the pasta floats to the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve about half a cup of pasta water, and drain the rest. Combine the pasta with the oil and 2 tablespoons pasta water in a large bowl (add more pasta water if it seems dry!).

Add the granulated sugar, the vanilla bean seeds, the scraped vanilla bean pod and 2 1/2 cups of water to the saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower to a simmer and continue to cook slowly until the apricots are very soft and the mixture is slightly caramelized, 1 hour or more. Add the lemon juice and lemon zest and simmer for 10 minutes more. Remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool. When cool, remove the vanilla bean pod and place the apricot mixture in a food processor and pulse until slightly chunky. Drain off the excess liquid, if there is any. Refrigerate the apricot jam in a covered container until ready to use. For the chocolate shells: Melt 24 ounces of the chocolate in a metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water fitted with a digital or chocolate tempering thermometer. Heat to 115 to 120 degrees F. Remove the bowl of chocolate from the heat and add the remaining 8 ounces of chocolate. Stir until all the added chocolate has melted. The temperature of the chocolate should be below 86 degrees F. If not, allow the chocolate to continue to cool, stirring frequently, until it reaches 85 to 86 degrees F. Place the bowl of chocolate over the simmering water again and reheat for a few seconds at a time, stirring well, until the temperature has risen to 87 to 91 degrees F. (Do not allow the temperature of the chocolate to exceed 91 degrees F, or you will have to repeat the procedure from the beginning.) Wipe any moisture from the underside of the bowl before proceeding. Ladle the tempered chocolate into a 24-cavity half-sphere polycarbonate chocolate mold, filling the cavities completely. Tap the mold on the table or countertop several times to release air bubbles in the chocolate. Invert the mold over a large, clean bowl and allow the excess chocolate to drip out. Scrape the drips with a large thin spatula or blade and then invert the mold again. Scrape once more, making sure to leave clean edges around each cavity in the mold. Scrape any leftover chocolate into one bowl. Reheat and maintain the temperature between 87 to 91 degrees F. Leave the shells to set at cool room temperature, or place the mold in the refrigerator for no more than 5 minutes to help the chocolate begin to set. Reserve the remaining tempered chocolate for the spider legs. For the chocolate almond croquant: In a small bowl, mix the almond butter with the dark chocolate. Set aside and keep warm. Place a small saucepan over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle in 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Allow the sugar to melt without stirring. Tilt the pan if necessary to help the sugar melt evenly. Add 2 or 3 additional tablespoons of sugar and allow it to melt. The sugar may begin to caramelize at this point. Raise or lower the heat as needed to control the melting and prevent the sugar from burning. Continue to add the sugar in increasing increments until it has all been incorporated. Make sure all the sugar has melted (you may stir gently at this point) and continue to heat until a slight smoking of the caramelized sugar occurs. Immediately remove the pan from the heat and add the butter. Stir the mixture until the caramel absorbs most of the butter. Reheat the caramel, if necessary, to keep it fluid. Reheat the almond butter and chocolate mixture if necessary. It should feel warm to the touch. Scrape the mixture onto a nonstick silicone mat and spread to a thickness of about 1/4-inch. Have ready 2 bench scrapers. Pour the caramelized sugar and butter mixture onto the top of the almond butter and chocolate mixture. Using the bench scrapers, fold the mixture over itself repeatedly. The more you mix, the smoother the texture will become. As you continue to fold, the mixture will begin to cool and will absorb any butter or chocolate that has leaked out. Quickly shape the croquant mixture evenly, cover it with another silicone baking mat and use a rolling pin to roll the croquant to 3/8-inch-thickness. Remove the mixture from the silicone mats and cut it into disks slightly smaller than your hollow chocolate shells. To assemble: Transfer the apricot jam to a disposable pastry bag and snip a small opening. Pipe the jam into the prepared chocolate shells, filling about halfway. Press a croquant disk into the mold, making sure to leave a slight headspace. Ladle the remaining tempered chocolate onto the top of the mold, filling in the headspace of each chocolate shell. Tap the mold a few times on the table to release air bubbles. Use a spatula or blade to scrape the excess chocolate from the top of the mold. Let set at cool room temperature for a minimum of 2 hours, or preferably overnight. Before unmolding the filled chocolate shells, place the mold in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes. Well-tempered chocolate will contract as it sets and release cleanly. Remove from the refrigerator, flex the mold slightly, and carefully invert to release the chocolates. These will be your spider bodies. Arrange the spider bodies on a clean piece of parchment or wax paper. Transfer some of the remaining tempered chocolate to a small pastry bag and pipe a small mound of chocolate that touches each spider body. This will be the spider?s head. Allow these to set until firm. Pipe spider legs onto a separate piece of parchment or waxed paper. When the legs are set, carefully remove them from the parchment paper and use the reserved tempered chocolate to attach the legs to the bodies. &quot;,&quot;[Rh?ne Blends, Pinot Noir, Sparkling Wine]</p><p>&quot; 12645,&quot;Roasted Leg of Lamb with Artichokes, Fennel and Red Bliss Potatoes 1 (8 to 10-pound) leg of lamb, boned*, reserving bones Kosher salt 8 sprigs rosemary, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup) 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced Extra-virgin olive oil1 (8 to 10-pound) leg of lamb, boned*, reserving bones 1 lemon, cut in 1/2 12 baby artichokes 2 bulbs fennel, cut into 1/4-inch slices 2 pounds red bliss potatoes, about 20, cut into quarters 10 whole garlic cloves 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 1 bottle dry white wine 1 bundle thyme, about 10 sprigs tied together with string 5 bay leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the lamb into 2 equal halves and butterfly each half. Remove any huge gobs of fat. Don&#39;t try to get it all. Fat tastes good and adds lots of moisture. Sprinkle each piece of the meat generously with salt, chopped rosemary, and sliced garlic. Drizzle the meat with olive oil. Massage the salt, rosemary, garlic and oil into the lamb. Be sure to try and get the cracks and crevices filled with the yummy tasting stuff. Roll each piece of lamb and tie with butcher twine. Sprinkle generously with salt. Reserve while you prepare the veggies. For the vegetables: Fill a bowl with water and squeeze the lemon into the water and add the lemon halves as well.

Combine dry ingredients with wet ingredients and raisins and mix by hand with a wooden spoon. Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto a well-greased baking sheet. The dough will be very tacky, so you may wish to moisten your fingers so it does not stick. With moistened fingers, press down on the dough and form it into circles about 1/8\\ thick. The circles should be about 2\\ diameter before baking. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until a couple of the cookies start to darken around the edges. They will still be very tender in the center until cool. Be careful not to overcook. When cooled, the cookies should be about 1/4\\ thick and very soft and chewy. When cookies have completely cooled, assemble them by spreading about 1 1/2 tablespoons of marshmallow creme over the flat side of a cookie and then pressing another cookie on top, making a sandwich. Repeat for remaining cookies and filling. Store cookies wrapped in plastic wrap to keep them soft and chewy.

Process until the garlic and herbs are pureed. With the processor on, slowly pour in the buttermilk and season with the salt and pepper. The dressing will be thick and creamy. This dressing will keep for 2 to 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. First, make yogurt cheese by draining the yogurt as follows. Line a colander with cheesecloth and place in a bowl. Spoon the yogurt into the colander. Refrigerate and let drain for at least 1 hour. Discard the liquid in the bowl. In a food processor, combine the yogurt cheese, tofu, and garlic. Process until the mixture is pureed, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients. Process again to combine, about 3 minutes. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt or pepper, to taste. This dressing will keep for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 12653,&quot;Green Tea Ice Cream 2 cups heavy cream 2 cups half-and-half 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 9 egg yolks 3/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons green tea powder Instructions: In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream, half-and-half, and vanilla bean, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn&#39;t scorch on the bottom. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the still-hot cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat and whisk in the green tea. Meanwhile, half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Strain the mixture into a smaller bowl to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Rest the smaller bowl in the ice water and let the mixture cool, stirring often, then continue according to the directions of your ice cream maker. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12654,&quot;Penne with Butternut Squash and Pancetta Kosher salt 8 ounces penne 1 small butternut squash (about 1 pound) 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 ounces pancetta, diced 3 cloves garlic, sliced 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

To complete the cooking, place in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear. Serve with Garlic Mashed Potatoes. In a small pot over high heat, bring water to a boil. Chop the potato into 3 or 4 pieces. Boil the potato for about 10 minutes, or until it is fork tender. Drain the potato and return it to the pan. Add the milk, butter, garlic powder, and parsley. Mix all together until desired texture is reached. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 12657,&quot;Lambrusco Sangria 2 Fuji apples, cut into 1/2-inch dice 1 orange, unpeeled, cut into 1-inch pieces 1/2 cup freshly-squeezed orange juice<br> 1/2 cup orange liqueur, such as Cointreau<br> 1/2 cup Spiced Syrup, recipe follows Two 750-ml bottles Lambrusco wine 2 cups club soda<br> 1/2 cup sugar 10 cardamom pods, crushed 8 cloves 2 cinnamon sticks Instructions: In a pitcher or punch bowl, combine the apples, oranges, orange juice, orange liqueur and Spiced Syrup; stir with a wooden spoon.

Move straws onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Bake at 375 degrees for 8 to 15 minutes, until light brown. Watch carefully, as overly browned straws aren&#39;t tasty. Cool on a rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12659,&quot;Stuffed Turkey Breast 2 tablespoons butter 1 large onion, diced 2 stalks celery, diced 3 cloves garlic, minced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 2 sweet Italian sausages (8 ounces), casings removed 3/4 cup dried cranberries 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1/2 cup white wine One 1-pound French rustic loaf, cut into 1-inch cubes, dried or toasted (or 9 cups store-bought) 1 cup chicken broth 1 egg, beaten 3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley One 4-pound turkey breast, boned and butterflied Olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Add the butter to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once melted and foaming, add the onion, celery, and garlic and saute until tender, about 3 minutes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Add the sausage to the pan and immediately begin breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon so it will cook down and crumble. Cook the sausage until it&#39;s browned, about 6 minutes, then add the cranberries, sage, rosemary and thyme and cook for 1 to 2 more minutes. Stir in the white wine and use your wooden spoon to scrape up the bottom of the pan for any stuck bits. Let cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat.<br> Add the bread cubes to a large bowl and add the chicken broth, beaten egg, sausage mixture, and chopped parsley and stir all together so all the bread is soft and moistened. Let cool as you prep the turkey.<br> Lay the turkey breast skin-side-down on your work surface and season the meat with salt and pepper. Add a layer of the stuffing about 1/2-inch thick across the turkey breast, leaving a 1/2-inch border. The extra stuffing can be placed in an 8-inch-by-8-inch-buttered casserole dish and baked the last 40 minutes of cooking.<br> Carefully roll the turkey up into a cylinder. Tie the roll with butcher&#39;s twine with about 1-inch between each knot. Trim the strings after tying. Place the turkey seam-side-down on a baking sheet covered with foil and fitted with a baking rack. Drizzle the turkey with olive oil, rub into the skin, then season well with salt and pepper.<br> Place in the oven and roast for 1 hour 15 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roll reads 155 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the oven and let rest, loosely tented with foil for 15 minutes. The turkey will rise in temperature as it rests to 165 degrees F. Snip the butcher&#39;s twine and slice the roll into 1-inch thick slices, place on a platter, and garnish with fresh rosemary and sage. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12660,&quot;Sorbet Bar 1 pint mango sorbet 1 pint strawberry sorbet 1 pint raspberry sorbet 1 cup shredded coconut 2 ripe bananas, sliced 2 teaspoons lemon juice 1 pint strawberries, sliced 1 package wafer cookies or wafer roll cookies Instructions: Set out ice cream cups, sorbet selections, ice cream scoops, coconut.

Just like the salad bar, they can have it their way. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 12661,&quot;Spicy Pork and Chili-Pepper Goulash 4 1/4 pounds pork shoulder off the bone, in 1 piece, skin off, fat left on Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil 2 red onions, peeled and finely sliced 2 fresh red chiles, seeded and finely chopped 2 generous heaping tablespoons mild smoked paprika, plus a little extra for serving 2 teaspoons ground caraway seeds Small bunch fresh marjoram or oregano, leaves picked 5 bell peppers (use a mixture of colors), sliced 1 (10-ounce) jar grilled peppers, drained, peeled and chopped 1 (14-ounce) can good quality plum tomatoes<br> 4 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br> 14 ounces basmati or long-grain rice, washed<br> 2/3 cup sour cream 1 lemon, zested Small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Get yourself a deep, ovenproof stew pot with a lid and heat it on the stove. Score the fat on the pork in a criss-cross pattern all the way through to the meat, then season generously with salt and pepper. Pour a good glug of olive oil into the pot and add the pork, fat side down. Cook for about 15 minutes on a medium heat, to render out the fat, then remove the pork from the pot and put it to 1 side. Add the onions, chili, paprika, caraway seeds, marjoram or oregano and a good pinch of salt and pepper to the pot. Turn the heat down and gently cook the onions for 10 minutes, then add the sliced peppers, the grilled peppers and the tomatoes. Put the pork back into the pot, give everything a little shake, then pour in enough water to just cover the meat. Add the vinegar - this will give it a nice little twang. Bring to the boil, put the lid on top, then place in the preheated oven for 3 hours. You&#39;ll know when the meat is cooked as it will be tender and sticky, and it will break up easily when pulled apart with 2 forks. If it&#39;s not quite there yet, put the pot back into the oven and just be patient for a little longer! When the meat is nearly ready, cook the rice in salted, boiling water for 10 minutes until it&#39;s just undercooked, then drain in a colander, reserving some of the cooking water and pouring it back into the pan. Place the colander over the pan on a low heat and put a lid on. Leave to steam dry and cook through for 10 minutes - this will make the rice lovely and fluffy. Stir the sour cream, lemon zest and most of the parsley together in a little bowl. When the meat is done, take the pot out of the oven and taste the goulash. You&#39;re after a balance of sweetness from the peppers and spiciness from the caraway seeds. Tear or break the meat up and serve the goulash in a big dish or bowl, with steaming rice and your flavored sour cream. Sprinkle with the rest of the chopped parsley and tuck in! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 12662,&quot;Bushmills Irish Coffee 1.5 oz.

Add the sour cream, lemon juice, dill, horseradish, salt, and pepper, and mix. Add the smoked salmon and mix well. Chill and serve with crudites or crackers.

Heat the milk, butter, and salt over medium heat until scalded. When the butter is melted, add the flour all at once and beat it with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together and forms a dough. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat for 2 minutes. The flour will begin to coat the bottom of the pan. Dump the hot mixture into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Add the eggs and pulse until the eggs are incorporated into the dough and the mixture is thick. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large plain round tip. Pipe in mounds 1 1/2 inches wide and 1-inch high onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. You should have about 18 puffs. With a wet finger, lightly press down the swirl at the top of each puff. (You can also use 2 spoons to scoop out the mixture and shape the puffs with damp fingers.) Bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly browned, then turn off the oven and allow them to sit for another 10 minutes, until they sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Make a small slit in the side of each puff to allow the steam to escape. Set aside to cool. For the chocolate sauce, place the cream and chocolate chips in a bowl set over simmering water and stir just until the chocolate melts. Add the honey and coffee and stir until smooth. Set aside. For serving, cut each profiterole in half crosswise, fill with a small scoop of ice cream, replace the top, and drizzle with slightly warm chocolate sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 12667,&quot;Baked Rigatoni with Eggplant and Sausage Kosher Salt Extra-virgin olive oil 6 links fennel pork sausage (about 3/4 pound) 1 large eggplant (about 1 1/2 pounds), cut into 1-inch pieces 1 large onion, chopped 3 garlic cloves, chopped 1 large can (28 ounces) peeled whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano Leaves from 1 small bunch basil 1 pound rigatoni 1 pound fresh mozzarella Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat for the pasta. Get yourself a 9 by 13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. Heat a 2 count of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausages and toss in the hot oil for 3 to 4 minutes, you want them nicely browned on the outside but still rare on the inside. Put the sausages in the baking dish. Turn the heat down to medium. Add a generous 1/3 cup of oil to the skillet and get it hot. Add as many eggplant pieces as you can comfortably fit in a single layer and sprinkle well with salt. Cook, turning, for 7 to 8 minutes, until the eggplant is nice and browned, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Use a spatula to put the eggplant into the baking dish with the sausage. Cook the rest of the eggplant pieces, adding more oil to the pan, as needed, and putting the finished eggplant into the baking dish. Add another 2 count of oil to the skillet, then your onion and garlic, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until translucent. Dump the whole can of tomatoes and their juices into a bowl and crush the tomatoes with your hands to break them up; add that to the pan with the basil and cook it down until pulpy and relatively thick. This will take about 15 minutes. By this time your pasta water will be boiling. Add the rigatoni, give it a stir, and cook for 6 to 7 minutes, it should be slightly firm as it will cook further in the oven. Ladle out 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water and reserve; the drain the rigatoni. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Chop the sausages into nice big, bite-size chunky pieces and return the pieces to the baking dish. Add the tomato sauce, rigatoni, and the reserved pasta water. Break up half the mozzarella over the mixture, season with salt and pepper, and gently mix with your hands or a spatula. Dust with the Parmigiano and drizzle with more olive oil. Bake for 15 minutes. Spread the remaining mozzarella in an even layer over the top and continue to bake for another 10 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 12668,&quot;Johnny Cakes with Horseradish Creme Fraiche and Smoked Trout 3/4 cup creme fraiche 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, drained 2 teaspoons whole grain mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup, plus 1 tablespoon fine yellow or white cornmeal 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon baking powder 2 large eggs, separated 3/4 cup whole milk 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus 1/4 cup more for frying Horseradish creme fraiche, for garnish, recipe follows 1 smoked trout, flaked with fork Fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, for garnish Finely chopped fresh chives, for garnish Instructions: For the horseradish creme fraiche: Whisk together the creme fraiche, horseradish and mustard in a small bowl.

Add the butter and mix thoroughly with your fingers or a fork until all of the butter has been evenly distributed and incorporated into the flour. Form into small to medium clumps with your fingers. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Beat together the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour, beating until just incorporated. Spoon half of the cake batter (it will be very thick) into the prepared pan and smooth with an offset spatula. Dollop the jam on top and carefully smooth with the spatula. Sprinkle the raspberries on top. Spoon the remaining cake batter on top and smooth the top. Sprinkle on the crumb topping. Bake until the cake and topping are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.

In a small metal bowl, combine the 2 types of chocolate and melt them gently over a pot of simmering water or a double boiler. Cool chocolate to room temperature. Make the shortbread dough: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the butter and sugar. Blend until smooth and \\creamed,\\ 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in the cooled melted chocolate. Sift the flour and add to the butter mixture and blend on low speed to incorporate the flour. Do not over mix . Remove the dough from the bowl and refrigerate for a few minutes to chill. Make the chocolate sauce: In a medium-sized pot, bring the cream to a gentle simmer. Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the white chocolate pieces. Allow the mixture to sit and cool for a minute. All of the white chocolate should easily melt into the cream. Whisk in the sour cream and taste for seasoning. Cook&#39;s Note: Sour cream is temperamental when heated, so take care that your mixture never gets overly hot. If so, cool a little before incorporating. Set aside at room temperature. Press the shortbread dough evenly into a 9 by 13 by 1-inch greased non-stick baking pan. Place in the center of the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes until the dough is fairly firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow the shortbread to cool for about 10 minutes. Cut into 12 rectangles, 4 by 2 inches, and then cut diagonally across rectangles to form 24 long triangles for good dipping. Arrange shortbread wedges on a tray with the white chocolate sauce in a bowl for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 12680,&quot;Sprinkle-y Glazed Yeasted Donuts 3 cups (400 grams) all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting 1/2 cup (70 grams) potato flour (see Cook\\u2019s Note)<br> 1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar<br> 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 cup (240 grams) whole milk, warm<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, softened<br> 2 to 3 quarts neutral oil, for frying and oiling the bowl Sprinkles, for sprinkling<br> 3 cups (360 grams) powdered sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 3 tablespoons whole milk, or more as needed<br> Food coloring, preferably AmeriColor, deep pink Instructions: For the donuts: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, whisk together the all-purpose flour, potato flour, granulated sugar, yeast and salt. Add the milk, eggs and vanilla extract and mix with the dough hook to combine. With the mixer running, add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until fully incorporated into the dough. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl, as needed. Mix on medium speed, dusting with a light sprinkling of flour as needed, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is completely smooth and slightly sticky, about 10 minutes. Stretch the dough into a ball. Lightly oil a clean, large mixing bowl and place the dough in the bowl, turning it around and upside down to fully coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean, dry towel. Let the dough rise at room temperature until it\\u2019s doubled in size, 1 1/2 hours. Turn the risen dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll out to 1/2-inch thick. Cut into donuts with a 3-inch donut cutter, then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet that has been dusted with some flour. (You can form the dough scraps into a ball, allow to rest for 30 to 45 minutes, then repeat the process of rolling it out and cutting additional donuts.) Cover with plastic and let proof in a warm place until slightly puffed and increased in volume, 45 minutes. Prepare a heavy-bottomed pot with oil for frying. When the oil reaches 350 degrees F, fry the donuts 3 or 4 at a time, flipping every 30 seconds (a pair of chopsticks works well for flipping these), until puffed up to double their size and golden brown, a total of 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a rack. Allow the oil to come back to temperature before frying another batch. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze: Combine the powdered sugar, vanilla, salt, and 3 tablespoons of the milk in a mixing bowl. Whisk until smooth, adding more milk if needed to achieve a thick but drizzle-able consistency. Add a few drops of desired food coloring. Place in a piping bag until ready to pipe onto donuts. Pipe the glaze on top of the cooled donuts. Add sprinkles before they dry. These are the best super-fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container on the counter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12681,&quot;Baked Banana Pudding 3 ripe bananas, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 cup granulated sugar, plus 2 tablespoons 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 4 large eggs, separated 2 cups half-and-half 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 45 vanilla wafers 1 pinch cream of tartar Instructions: Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Dollop half of the compound butter along the long edge of a 12-inch piece of parchment or waxed paper. Roll into a log, twisting opposite ways on both ends of the paper to create a tightly wrapped log of butter. Refrigerate or freeze for another use. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Using your fingers, carefully loosen the skin from chicken breasts. Stuff about 1/4 of the remaining blue cheese butter under the skin of each breast; smoothing the skin to evenly distribute the butter over the surface of the breast meat. Put the chicken on a rimmed baking sheet and rub any remaining butter over the skin. Season each breast with just a pinch of freshly ground black pepper. Roast the chicken breasts, skin sides up, in the center of the oven until skin is crisped and chicken is cooked through, about 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer should register 165 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the meat. Remove from the oven to a serving platter. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. Cook&#39;s Note: This recipe makes 2 logs of compound butter; unused butter can be used to top grilled meats, burgers, or baked or mashed potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 12683,&quot;Pineapple Upside-Down Cake 1 fresh pineapple 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon water 2 cups lightly packed light brown sugar 6 to 8 maraschino cherries 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature 2 cups granulated sugar 2 large eggs 1/2 cup buttermilk 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting cake 1 quart yogurt gelato, store-bought, for serving Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Peel the pineapple and remove core. Slice into (1-inch) thick circles.<br> In a small saucepan melt butter with 1 tablespoon of water and add light brown sugar. Stir well with a whisk over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved and you have a nice smooth caramel, about 3 to 4 minutes. Pour into a round 9 1/2-inch nonstick cake pan. Arrange pineapple circles evenly in the caramel, (1 in the center and 5 around the outside usually works), and press down so they are submerged in the caramel. Place 1 maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring. Make the batter: Sift flour and baking powder together. In a stand mixer cream butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. With mixer on low, add eggs 1 at a time. Add half the buttermilk and vanilla then half the flour. Add remaining buttermilk and then remaining flour. Pour the batter into the cake pan over the caramel and pineapple. Spread out evenly with a rubber spatula. Place the cake pan on a roasting tray to catch any caramel that may bubble over and bake in the oven for approx 1 hour. The cake should be nice and golden on top and puffed up slightly. When gently pressed in the center it should bounce back. Allow to cool slightly, (about 1 minute), before inverting onto a cake plate.

Cook the potatoes then the beans in the water, cooking each until just tender. Drain the potatoes and slip off the skins. Drain the beans and refresh them in ice water. Refill the pot with salted water. Cook the pasta sheets 1 at a time, just until tender. Drain each sheet and lay on clean towels. Cover with additional towels to keep warm. Coat the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch serving dish with a thin layer of pesto. Cover the pesto with a 1/3 of the warm lasagne noodles. Spread pesto over the pasta. Break the potatoes up into bite-size pieces and put half of them and half the beans on top. Arrange another layer of pasta over the beans and potaotes, cover with pesto, another layer of beans and potatoes then a final layer of pasta. Cover the lasagne with Parmigiano-Reggiano, cut and serve. Place the basil leaves, garlic, and pine nuts in a mortar or food processor. Grind or pulse until the leaves are finely chopped. Gradually incorporate the Parmigiano Reggiano, ricotta and yoghurt. Then, work in the oil, adding it in a steady stream. Season the pesto to taste with salt and pepper. Mix the flour with the salt and mound them on a clean work surface. Create a well in the center of the flour mound. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the well. Lightly beat the eggs with the oil. Using the fingers of one hand, begin incorporating the dry ingredients into the wet, drawing flour into the well in a circular motion. Use the other hand to protect the outer wall. Work the flour mixture into the egg mixture until the dough forms a ball (if the dough doesn&#39;t come together add a drop or two of water). Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil , wrap the dough in plastic wrap; and set aside to rest for about 30 minutes. Cut the ball of dough in half. Wrap and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Form the dough into a rectangle and roll it though a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at the widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting: the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick. Make 4 pieces, about 20-inches long and 6-inches wide. Lay the lasagne sheets out on a clean dry surface and allow them to dry slightly (about 10 minutes) before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 12685,&quot;Grilled Corn on the Cob with BBQ Butter 2 tablespoons canola oil 1/2 small red onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tablespoon ancho chili powder 2 teaspoons Spanish paprika 1 teaspoon toasted cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder 1/2 cup water 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, slightly softened 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 ears corn Kosher salt Instructions: Perfectly Grilled Corn, recipe follows Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over high heat until almost smoking.

Strain into a chilled highball glass over ice. &quot;,&quot;[Bourbon, Rye]&quot; 12697,&quot;Spatchcocked Grilled Turkey 1 tablespoon granulated sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 12- to 14-pound turkey, butterflied (back and breast bones removed by your butcher)<br> Instructions: The day before roasting, combine the sugar, 1/4 cup salt and 2 teaspoons pepper in a small bowl. Rub the turkey all over with the salt mixture. Refrigerate on a baking sheet, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to overnight. The next day, rinse the turkey and pat dry. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the middle burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Place the turkey breast-side up over the drip pan and grill, covered, until the meat is cooked about halfway through, about 50 minutes. Turn and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees F, about 50 minutes more. Move the turkey to direct heat and rotate to evenly brown the skin in the last 10 minutes of cooking. Transfer to a cutting board, cover and let rest 10 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12698,&quot;Sweet Heat Barbecue Ribs 2 racks spareribs, on the bone (6 to 7 pounds) 1/4 cup paprika 1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar 2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon garlic salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons canola oil 4 cups wood chips such as cherry or hickory, soaked in water for at least 1 hour, optional Sweet Heat Barbecue Sauce, recipe follows 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1 sweet onion, very finely chopped 2 1/2 cups ketchup 2 cups apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, or to taste 2 tablespoons firmly packed brown sugar 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste Juice of 2 lemons Coarse kosher salt Instructions: If necessary, remove the thin membrane from the back of each rack of ribs; discard the membrane. Combine the paprika, brown sugar, kosher salt, cayenne pepper, garlic salt and black pepper in a small bowl. Rub the meat with the oil and then rub liberally with the spice blend. Leave at room temperature for 45 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, set the grill for indirect cooking at 250 degrees F, with wood chips for flavor if using. (I use bourbon barrel staves. Cherry and hickory would be good, but stay away from mesquite.) Wrap the soaked chips in a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place the foil-wrapped chips on the coals.<br> Add the spareribs, meat-side up. Close the lid and cook, flipping occasionally, until the meat is smoky and just tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Brush the spareribs with the Sweet Heat Barbecue Sauce and continue cooking until the sauce is nicely caramelized and the meat is completely tender, about an additional 30 minutes. Serve with Sweet Heat Barbecue Sauce on the side. In a saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat; add the onions and simmer until soft and melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, black pepper, brown sugar, cayenne pepper and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, decrease the heat to low and simmer until the flavors have smoothed and mellowed, at least 10 and up to 30 minutes.

In metal bowl, combine sugar and flour. In another bowl, lightly beat the eggs and add them to the sugar mixture, combining well. Blend the butter into the mixture using the back of a spoon. Add the buttermilk and blend with a whisk. If the butter has not incorporated by this step set the bowl over a pan of simmering water to help soften the butter. Add the lime juice, vanilla and nutmeg. Blend well. Slowly pour the custard filling into the pie crust. Set the pie on a baking sheet and place it in the oven for 1 hour. Remove pie and let it cool before cutting. Combine the butter, shortening, 2 cups of the cake flour, and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. Blend together. Stop mixer, scrape the sides and add remaining 2 cups of cake flour and remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour. Blend to combine completely. Mix sugar and salt into 1/4 cup of the water and add it to the flour mixture. Blend briefly and add the remaining water if needed. The dough should not be overworked and should make a solid piece when held in your hand. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured smooth surface and knead it several times. Divide the dough into portions and flatten it. Wrap unused dough in plastic. Roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Reserve any unused dough in the freezer for another use. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Prick bottom and sides of pastry with fork. Bake 12 minutes or until light brown.

Arrange the oxtails and bones on a baking sheet and rub all of the pieces with the tomato paste. Roast the bones until very brown in spots, about 45 minutes. Transfer the roasted bones to a 7-quart slow cooker. Use a metal spatula to scrape up any of the brown bits from the baking sheet and add them to the slow cooker, too. Nestle in the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, parsley and bay leaves. Toss in the peppercorns. Pour in the vinegar and 8 cups water (the water should just cover the bones and vegetables). Set your slow cooker to low and cook anywhere from 12 to 24 hours, the broth will be deeper and stronger in flavor the longer it cooks. Once you&#39;ve decided the broth is ready, remove the insert and transfer the bones and pieces of meat to a baking sheet with tongs. Strain the remaining broth through a fine sieve. Let cool to room temperature. Let the bones cool and pick off and reserve any good-looking pieces of meat to add to soups and stews. Store the bone broth in airtight containers for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or up to 3 months in the freezer. Serve hot with desired mix-ins. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 12701,&quot;Crostata with Raspberry Jam 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel 10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1/4 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons ice water Flour for dusting, as needed 1 jar (3/4 cup) raspberry preserves 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon sliced almonds, toasted Powdered sugar, for dusting, optional Instructions: Mix the flour, sugar, and lemon peel, in a food processor. Add the butter. Pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add salt. Pulse in the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until moist clumps form. Gather the dough into a ball; flatten into a disk. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to an 11-inch round. Transfer the dough onto a heavy baking sheet that has been lined with a silpat or parchment paper. Stir the lemon juice into the preserve and spread the preserves on top of dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the dough border over the filling to form an 8-inch round, pleating loosely and pinching to seal any cracks in the dough. Bake the crostata until the crust is golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool. Sprinkle with the almonds and dust with the powdered sugar, if you wish. Slide a metal spatula under the crust to free the crostata from the baking sheet and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 12702,&quot;Eggplant-Olive Caponata 1 cup reserved roasted vegetables from Roasted Vegetable stew 1 cup diced fresh beefsteak tomatoes 1/2 cup diced pitted kalamata olives 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine roasted vegetables, tomatoes, olives, and parsley.

Spray a 10-cup bundt pan with cooking spray. Line a baking sheet with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles to al dente according to the package directions. Drain the noodles and spread them flat on the prepared baking sheet to dry completely (you may need to create 2 to 3 layers to fit all of the noodles; put paper towels between each layer).<br> Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the meat and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and onion and continue to cook until the onion is softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the marinara sauce and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Set aside.<br> Wrap the spinach in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze until very dry. Combine the spinach, ricotta, Parmesan, eggs and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl and mix thoroughly.<br> Cut 3 of the noodles in half and set aside. Use the remaining 12 whole noodles to line the prepared bundt pan, laying them crosswise and overlapping like a fan, so that one end of each noodle goes up the center tube of the pan and the other end hangs over the edge. Spoon half of the spinach mixture into the bottom, then arrange half of the mozzarella slices on top. Drizzle 1 cup of sauce over everything, then top with the 6 reserved noodle halves so that they overlap. Repeat the layers with the remaining spinach mixture and mozzarella and another 1 cup sauce. Fold over the overhanging ends of the noodles to enclose the lasagna. If the noodles are a little too long and cover the hole of the pan, use kitchen scissors to trim them. Bake until the noodles on top are turning golden brown and starting to crisp up, 45 to 50 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes, then invert the pan onto a cutting board or serving platter to unmold the lasagna. Reheat the remaining sauce and pour into the center. Sprinkle with the parsley and a little Parmesan. Slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 12704,&quot;Sherry Rosemary Apricot Jam 24 ounces dried apricots (about 4 cups; see Cook&#39;s Note) 3 cups boiling water<br> 3/4 cup dry sherry or white wine<br> 4 sprigs fresh rosemary plus 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary 1 teaspoon lemon zest plus 1/4 cup lemon juice<br> 1.75 ounces powdered fruit pectin<br> 4 cups granulated sugar<br> Instructions: Wash 2 pint jars (or a few half-pint jars) so that they are ready to go when your preserves are ready to be canned. Add the apricots to the boiling water in a bowl along with 1/2 cup sherry and the rosemary sprigs. Let soak until the apricots are rehydrated, about 30 minutes. Strain the apricots, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid. Add the apricots, reserved liquid and lemon zest to a large non-reactive pan. Stir in the pectin. Bring the mixture to a boil and add the sugar, lemon juice, chopped rosemary and remaining 1/4 cup sherry. Boil until the sugar is dissolved and the jam is thick (you can check by spooning the jam onto the back of a wooden spoon; if you can run your finger through it without it spreading, it is good!) for 20 to 30 minutes. Transfer the cooked jam to the jars. Let the jam cool to room temperature.

Let sit for 30 minutes. Drain the clams and rinse with cold running water several times. (You can do this up to 7 million times and you will never remove all the sand. Let this be a lesson in life to you.) Place the cleaned clams in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot and add enough wine to go about halfway up the clams, about the whole bottle. Tie the thyme, oregano and bay leaves in a bundle and add to the pot. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and steam until the clams open completely, 15 to 20 minutes, or about 8 minutes after the liquid boils. Once the clams are all opened, remove them with a slotted spoon to a sheet pan to cool for a few minutes. Strain the clam broth through a fine strainer, reserving the liquid. Put a large Dutch oven over medium heat and add the olive oil. Once heated, add the guanciale and prosciutto and begin to render, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove some pieces of crispy prosciutto for garnish, if possible. If not, move on. Add the onion, garlic and celery to the pot and gently sweat over medium-low heat until they begin to soften up, about 3 minutes. Add the diced potatoes and cook to allow more fat to render from the prosciutto and guanciale and for the vegetables to fully soften, another 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, remove the clams from the shells and chop roughly; don&#39;t turn them into dust\\u2014big pieces are good. Add the clams and the Calabrian cl paste to the potato pot and add about two-thirds of the reserved clam broth. Let the chowder begin to gently heat up and come to a simmer.

Grease 2 large baking sheets. Melt the butter with the marjoram in a large saucepan on low heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar and salt. Add the egg whites one at a time and stir until well blended after each addition. Stir in the flour. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake, one baking sheet at a time, until the edges of the cookies are browned (the centers should remain pale), 8 to 10 minutes. Immediately remove the cookies to wire racks to cool completely. For the marshmallow filling: In a small bowl, soak the gelatin in 2 cups of cool water to soften. In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, mix together the sugar, corn syrup and honey. (Note that you will use this saucepan twice, to make the syrup and melt the gelatin, eliminating the need to wash it between uses.) Place the saucepan over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer, pour in the egg whites and beat on low speed until frothy. Add the pinch of salt. When the sugar syrup reaches about 210 degrees F, increase the speed of the mixer to high and beat the whites until they are thick and fluffy. When the syrup reaches 245 degrees F, while the mixer is running on high speed, slowly pour the hot syrup into the whites, pouring so that the syrup does not fall on the whisk (or some of the syrup will splatter and stick to the sides of the bowl). Continue mixing. Scrape the gelatin and 1/3 cup of the soaking water into the pan that you used for the syrup. There should still be enough residual heat left in the pan from making the syrup to dissolve the gelatin. Pour the liquefied gelatin slowly into the whites as they are whipping. Add the vanilla paste and continue to whip until the mixture feels completely cool when you touch the outside of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Immediately pipe the marshmallow into the cookies and sandwich. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12720,&quot;White Claw Lime Cupcakes Nonstick cooking spray One 15.25-ounce box super moist vanilla cake mix One 12-ounce can White Claw Natural Lime Hard Seltzer 3 large eggs 3/4 cup lemon curd One 16-ounce can vanilla frosting 8 lime-flavored jelly fruit slices, each cut into thirds (24 pieces total), for decorating Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line 2 muffin pans with 24 cupcake liners. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the hazelnut liquor and cocoa powder together until combined. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars together on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, until each has been incorporated. Add the buttermilk and vanilla extract and mix until fully combined. Turn the mixer to low, and add the flour and cocoa mixture, alternating between the 2, beginning and ending with the flour. Mix until just combined and no streaks remain. Set aside while you prepare the filling. For the filling: In the bowl of a food processor, grind the hazelnuts until they reach a very fine sand consistency. Add the hazelnut spread and process until the mixture begins to clump. Add the hazelnut liquor 1 tablespoon at a time, or until the mixture is able to ball easily in your hand. With your hands, form the paste into balls about the size of a very large cherry. Roll the balls lightly in the flour to absorb any excess liquid. To assemble: Fill the cupcake liners about 1/4 of the way full with the cupcake batter. Place 1 ball of filling in each liner, and then cover the filling with the remaining batter so each cupcake is about 3/4 of the way full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. Dip each cupcake top into the Chocolate Ganache, forming an even layer, and allow to cool. In a heat-proof bowl, microwave the heavy cream on high for 1 to 2 minutes. The cream should be very hot to the touch. While the cream is being heated, place the chocolate chips and espresso powder in a medium heat-proof bowl. Once the cream is ready, pour it on top of the chocolate chips and whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture has thickened. Whisk in the vegetable oil for extra shine. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 12747,&quot;Almond Orange Crusted Chicken with Fennel Arugula Salad 1 orange 2 eggs whites 3/4 cup sliced almonds, coarsely chopped 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup all purpose flour 4 pieces thin-sliced boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 1 pound total) Cooking spray 1/2 small bulb of fennel, halved, cored and thinly sliced into half-moons (about 1 cup) 4 cups arugula, lightly packed, coarsely chopped if leaves are large 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 F degrees. Ten minutes before you are ready to cook the chicken, put a baking sheet in the oven to pre-heat. Finely zest the orange and set the zest aside. Cut the top and bottom off of the orange, sit the orange on one end on a cutting board and cut the entire peel and pith off by cutting downward following the shape of the fruit. Then, using a paring knife, remove each section of orange from the membrane. Set the orange sections aside. In a shallow bowl, whisk the egg white until slightly frothy. In a large shallow bowl or on a plate, combine the orange zest, almonds, and 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Put the flour on a large plate. Remove the pre-heated baking sheet from the oven and spray with cooking spray. Dip the chicken breasts, one at a time, first into the flour, shaking off any excess, then into the egg white, and then coat with the almond mixture and place on the baking sheet. Spray the top of the chicken with cooking spray. Bake for 6 minutes, turn and bake for 6 minutes more, until the chicken is cooked through and the coating is golden. While the chicken is cooking, combine the fennel, arugula and orange sections in a large bowl. In a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat.

Place the lemons in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave until the essential oils in the skin are released. Since these will be hot coming from the microwave, you will need to set them aside briefly, until they cool just enough to handle. Pour vinegar into a blender, turn it on, and then squeeze in 1emon juice from the micro-waved lemons. Leaving the blender running, add 1 at a time through the feed opening: garlic, mustard, chives, basil, Parmesan, and pepper and blend until smooth. While keeping the blender running, add oil through the feed opening in a slow stream. Set aside until needed. In a large mixing bowl combine kidney beans, chick peas, green beans, artichoke hearts, and black olives. Dress with enough vinaigrette to coat well, then gently fold in pasta, scallops, shrimp, tuna, peas, and grape tomatoes. Taste and adjust dressing as needed. Do not feel compelled to use all of the dressing. You want enough to complement the ingredients of the salad without overcoming their flavors. (You can always serve dressing on the side, or add more to the salad if you wish. The pasta will absorb some of the vinaigrette.) Transfer to serving bowls or serve family style.

Place the pan on a baking sheet. Spread the peanut butter batter over the crust, smoothing out the top. Very carefully add the jelly batter over the peanut butter batter. Place the cheesecake in the center of the oven. Place a second baking sheet on a lower shelf and fill it with water. The water will create steam in the oven and prevent the cheesecake from developing a hard crust. Bake for about 60 minutes or until set in the center. The top will souffle slightly. Allow the cheesecake to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 4 hours. After one hour in the refrigerator, loosely cover with plastic. Carefully run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the pan. Un-mold the cake from the pan. To make the ganache: In a saucepan, bring the cream to a simmer. Remove from the heat, add the butter and chopped chocolate. Allow to sit for 2 minutes, then stir gently, until totally smooth. Place the cheesecake on a cooling rack that is sitting above a baking sheet, lined with parchment. This will catch the excess ganache. Let the cake sit on the rack until the ganache has set up, about 45 minutes. To decorate the sides see the above video. Use a thin knife, dipped in a pitcher of hot water to cut the cake. When you cut into it, the peanut butter and jelly layers will reveal themselves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12759,&quot;Scallops Sauteed in Macadamia Nut Oil with a Macadamia Nut Crust 2 cups macadamia nuts 7 scallops 3 tablespoons macadamia nut oil 1 bulb fennel 1 tablespoons water Salt and pepper 1 piece star anise Instructions: Toast the macadamia nuts in the oven for about 5 to 10 minutes until they are toasted blonde, watch them carefully as they burn quickly.

Spoon the bread pudding into bowls, drizzle with the warm cinnamon syrup, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 12803,&quot;Chockablock Chocolate Cakes with Warm Macadamia Nut Goo 3 cups sugar 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/8 cups cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-process 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder 2 1/4 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 3 eggs 1 1/2 cups milk 3/4 cup vegetable oil 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups very hot water 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/3 cup water 2/3 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup macadamia nuts, toasted and roughly chopped 1/2 cup flaked sweetened coconut, toasted Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a sheet pan and line the bottom and sides with parchment or waxed paper. Sift together the 3 cups sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Transfer to a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or use a hand mixer) and blend briefly. Whisk together the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. Add to the dry ingredients and mix at low speed for 5 minutes. Gradually add the hot water, mixing at low speed just until combined. The batter will be quite thin. Pour the batter into the pan. Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean (a few crumbs are okay) and the center feels firm to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan. Chill, covered, until ready to cut the cake. Meanwhile, make the caramel: Pour the 1 1/4 cups sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour the water around the walls of the pan, trying not to splash any sugar onto the walls. Do not stir; gently draw your finger twice through the center of the sugar, making a cross, to moisten it. Over high heat, bring to a full boil and cook without stirring, swirling the pan occasionally to even out the color, until medium caramel in color, 5 to 10 minutes. Immediately turn off the heat and use a wooden spoon to slowly and carefully stir in the cream (it will bubble up and may splatter). Stir in the macadamia and coconut. Set aside. When ready to serve, cut rounds of the chilled cake with a biscuit or cookie cutter, 2 to 3 inches in diameter. If the cake seems to be sticking, dip your cutter in cocoa powder between cuts. If the sauce has cooled, rewarm it over low heat (or in a microwave) until softened. Place a cake on each plate, and drizzle with caramel sauce. Place another round of cake on top and drizzle lightly with more caramel sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 12804,&quot;Rosalia Sr.&#39;s Pollo Pipian 1 whole 4-pound/1 kg chicken, cut in pieces Olive oil, for searing 1 head garlic, halved 1 onion, quartered Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup/125 ml pumpkin seeds, toasted 1/2 cup/125 ml sesame seeds, toasted 6 cloves garlic, peeled and roasted 4 guajillo chiles, roasted 1 ancho cl, roasted 2 whole cloves 2 onions, quartered and roasted One 1/2-inch cinnamon stick Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup/125 ml chicken stock or water Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish Corn tortillas, for serving Instructions: For the chicken: In a large stockpot, sear the chicken in some olive oil over medium-high heat.

Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into 2 balls. Wrap them in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. (At this point the dough can be kept in refrigerator for up to 2 days or frozen for 2 months.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin, roll the dough to 1/3-inch thickness. Using the square and round cookies cutters, dipped in flour, cut out an equal number of each shape and transfer them to an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake until the edges are golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the cookies from oven and cool slightly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough, making sure to cool down the baking sheets between batches. To decorate: Cut the fondant into 4equal pieces. Lightly dust a clean, dry, flat surface with cornstarch. Working in bathes, roll out each piece to 1/4-inch thickness. Using the round and square cutters cut out enough fondant to equal the number of round and square cookies. Using small flower cutters cut out flower shapes from each piece of fondant. Dampen 1 side of each flower shape with a pastry brush and attach it to the cooled cookies. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 12806,&quot;Peanut Butter Fudge 2 cups sugar 2 cups brown sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup cocoa powder 1 1/3 cups milk 1/4 cup butter 3/4 cup peanut butter 2 teaspoons vanilla Instructions: In a saucepan, stir together the sugars, salt, cocoa powder, milk, and heat until sugar is dissolved.

Crack the eggs on top, and using an egg cutter, slice the tops off the eggs. Carefully pour out the contents of 5 of the eggs into a bowl and separate the yolks from the whites. Transfer the yolks to another bowl. (Use the 5 egg whites and the contents of the remaining 7 eggs for other dishes). You need a total of 12 egg shells for this recipe. Add the cream and roasted garlic to the 5 yolks and whisk thoroughly; season with salt and pepper. Carefully rinse out the hollowed eggs under cold running water and return them to the egg carton. Pour the whisked egg mixture into each hollowed egg so that it fills the shell halfway. Place the carton in a roasting pan. Pour enough warm water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the eggs. Cover the pan with foil and put it into the oven. Cook for about 20 minutes, or until the custard is firm and does not break when touched with your finger. While the eggs are cooking, pour the oil into a heavy skillet and set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and shimmering, add the mushrooms and saute for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and continue to saute until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add the vinegar, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the chopped parsley. Remove the eggs from the oven, and divide the mushroom-tomato mixture between the eggs, spooning it carefully over the custard inside the eggs. To serve, arrange the 3 types of peppercorns in the bottom of a serving dish, platter, or basket. Set the filled eggs upright on the peppercorns and serve with demitasse spoons. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barolo]</li></ol><p>&quot; 12819,&quot;Blidas 2/3 ounce, or 2 tablespoons, all-purpose flour 7 ounces, or 1 1/2 cups, almond and sugar powder 3 large egg whites, at room temperature 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2-ounce, or 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon superfine sugar 3 ounces, or 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon, blanched almonds, finely chopped Confectioners&#39; sugar 5 tablespoons strained apricot jam Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Sift the flour and toss it with the almond and sugar powder. Whip the egg whites in an electric mixer at low speed until they start to froth. If you are not whipping the whites in a copper bowl, then add the cream of tartar at this point. Gradually increase the whipping speed to medium-high, and continue whipping until the whites form very stiff peaks and just begin to slip and streak around the side of the bowl. Add the superfine sugar and continue whipping at high speed for a few seconds longer to incorporate the sugar and tighten the meringue. Gently fold in the almond and sugar powder and flour. Scoop the batter into the pastry bag, and pipe the batter in domes 1-inch wide, arranging them on the baking sheets in staggered rows and separating them by about 1-inch. Unless you have 2 ovens, pipe only 1 sheet of cookies at a time, and keep the remaining batter in the pastry bag until the first sheet is baked. Dust chopped almonds over the piped batter. Turn the baking sheet upside down and tap it with a wooden spatula to dislodge the excess almonds, then quickly turn the baking sheet right side up again. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. Let rest for about 1 minute to allow some of the confectioners&#39; sugar to dissolve. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until the cookies are lightly browned on the bottom and dry and crusty on top, but still soft inside, about 15 to 18 minutes. Place the baking sheet on a wire rack and let the cookies cool. While they are still warm and before the batter sets, carefully transfer them to a wire rack with a metal spatula. Then let them finish cooling on the wire rack. Press the center of each dome on the flat side with your fingertip to make a slight depression. Turn half the domes upside down and spoon about 1/2 teaspoon of apricot jam on the center of each. Then place a second dome right side up on top of each to make a sandwich. Lightly dust the balls with confectioners&#39; sugar, then turn them upside down and dust the other side as well. Storage: Covered airtight in a tin cookie box or a cookie jar for up to 4 to 6 days.

Whisk to combine. Add the sea bass fillets and turn to coat in the marinade. Cover with a lid and marinate in the refrigerator, flipping once halfway through, 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill or large cast-iron grill pan to medium heat. While the grill heats up, remove the fish from the marinade and pat fairly dry with paper towels. (There should be a light coating of marinade on the fish but not too much, because excess oil will cause flare-ups on the grill.) Discard the marinade. Season the fish liberally on all sides with salt and pepper. Place the fish skin-side down on the hot grill. Cook until the skin is light golden brown and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip the fish and cook until just cooked through and the center is opaque, 3 to 5 minutes more. While the fish is cooking, add the tangerines to the grill cut-side down. Grill until the flesh is deeply charred in spots, about 10 minutes. Remove from the grill and cool slightly. To serve, transfer the grilled fish to a large platter. Nestle the grilled tangerines around the fish and top with the sprigs of mint.

Sprinkle the turkey with 2 tablespoons of the Poultry Seasoning, then place 3 cups of the stuffing in the center of the breast and fold the ends of the turkey to cover. Flip the turkey over to seam-side down, and use kitchen twine to tie the turkey at 1-inch intervals. Place the remaining stuffing in the prepared casserole dish, and set aside. Arrange the sliced onions in the center of a roasting pan. Rub the turkey skin with the butter, sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons Poultry Seasoning, and then place the turkey over the sliced onions. Roast, basting occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 2 hours. After about 1 hour 30 minutes, add the stuffing to the oven and bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove the turkey from the pan and rest for 10 to 15 minutes, reserving the pan with the drippings for a later use. For the gravy: Place the roasting pan with the drippings on the stovetop set over medium-high heat. Pour in the wine to deglaze the pan. Use a spoon to scrape the bits from the bottom of the pan. In a medium bowl, add 1/4 cup of the chicken broth and the flour. Whisk to make a slurry. Add the remaining 1 cup chicken broth and the slurry into the roasting pan. Whisk until combined and smooth. Then simmer until the gravy reduces and thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the strings from the turkey and carve it into slices. Serve the turkey with the stuffing and gravy. Place the marjoram, parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme in a spice grinder or blender and grind until powdery.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12871,&quot;Meatball and Eggplant Parm Kebabs 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 28-ounce can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes, crushed by hand Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 pound ground beef 8 ounces hot Italian sausage, casings removed 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese 1/4 cup breadcrumbs 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley 2 cloves garlic, grated 1/4 cup milk 1 large egg Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 small Japanese eggplants, sliced 1/2 inch thick 3 cups broccoli florets 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the grill Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced, then cut into 1-inch squares Toasted Italian rolls, grated parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes, for serving Instructions: Make the marinara sauce: Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the sliced garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the oregano, then add the tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and set aside until ready to serve. (For a smoother sauce, puree with an immersion blender.) Meanwhile, make the meatballs: Combine the beef, sausage, shredded mozzarella, parmesan, breadcrumbs, parsley, grated garlic, milk, egg, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl; mix with your hands until combined. Form into 1 1/2-inch meatballs (about 24). Make the kebabs: Preheat a grill to medium high. Combine the eggplants, broccoli, olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a large bowl; toss to coat. Thread the meatballs, eggplant and broccoli onto eight 12-inch skewers.<br> Brush the grill grates with olive oil. Grill the kebabs, covered and turning occasionally, until the meatballs are cooked through and marked and the vegetables are charred around the edges, about 15 minutes; drape a slice of mozzarella over each meatball during the last minute of cooking. Remove to a platter. Reheat the marinara sauce if needed. Serve the kebabs in rolls with the marinara sauce, parmesan and red pepper flakes. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Dolcetto, Montepulciano]&quot; 12872,&quot;Chocolate Candy Bar Rounds 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips 2 teaspoons coconut oil<br> 1/2 cup marshmallow creme, such as Marshmallow Fluff 2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter, not natural, such as Jif or Skippy 1/3 cup good-quality caramel sauce, such as Ghirardelli 2 to 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar<br> Coconut oil spray, for the spoons 1/3 cup coarsely chopped salted roasted peanuts<br> 1/2 cup white chocolate candy melting wafers 1/4 cup popping candies, such as Pop Rocks<br> Instructions: For the chocolate layer: Combine the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a double boiler over low heat. Heat until melted and stir until smooth. Let sit until thickened slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the chocolate mixture into each cavity of a 6-cavity round cylinder silicone mold (2-inch-wide by 1-inch-deep cavities). Use a small pastry brush to paint the chocolate up the sides of the molds, making sure to cover the entire inside of each mold. (If your chocolate is too hot and doesn\\u2019t coat the molds, refrigerate for a few minutes, then try again.) Refrigerate or freeze until set, about 10 minutes. For the nougat layer: Stir the marshmallow creme and peanut butter together in a small bowl. It should be the consistency of putty. For the caramel layer: Put the caramel sauce in a separate bowl. Stir in the confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture is thick but still pourable. For the assembly: Grease 2 teaspoons with coconut oil spray. Use the teaspoons to place a heaping tablespoon of the nougat into each mold, pressing to make a smooth layer. Sprinkle over the peanuts and press into the nougat. Use the same teaspoons to add a heaping tablespoon of the caramel to each mold, stopping about 1/4 inch from the top of the molds. Pour the remaining chocolate over the caramel and spread gently with a small offset spatula to completely cover the caramel. Refrigerate or freeze until set, at least 30 minutes. Remove the chocolates from the molds. Microwave the candy melting wafers in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments, stirring in between each, until melted and smooth. Drizzle the melted white candy over top of the rounds and sprinkle over the popping candies to decorate. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 12873,&quot;Cajun Corn Maque Choux 4 ears fresh corn 4 strips bacon, diced 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 stalks celery, diced 1 green bell pepper, diced 1/2 large onion, diced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup milk 5 scallions, white and green parts, sliced (reserve the sliced green parts for garnish)<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 plum tomatoes, seeded and diced Instructions:</p><ol><li>Cut the kernels off of the corn into a large bowl.

When browned, remove and set aside.<br> Season both sides of the veal medallions with salt and pepper, and then dust each side very lightly with flour. Pat off any excess.<br> Heat the oil in a heavy saute pan large enough to hold the veal without crowding it. When the oil is hot, brown the medallions approximately 3 minutes per side, or until they are golden brown and just cooked through. Transfer the meat to a heated plate and keep warm. Pour off any excess fat from the pan.<br> Deglaze the pan with the wine, and then reduce to 1/4 of a cup. Add the stock and also add any of the veal juices that have collected on the plate. Reduce the sauce until it thickens slightly. Slowly whisk in 4 tablespoons of the butter, a little at a time. Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and pepper and strain into a small saucepan. Keep warm.<br> In a medium saute pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the sliced apples, and the lemon juice. Saute until tender and golden brown.<br> Mix watercress with citrus vinaigrette. Divide watercress evenly among 4 plates. Place a few slices of apple on top of the salad. Top with 2 veal medallions per plate, and spoon sauce over meat. Sprinkle with the reserved pine nuts. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Spread the bones and onion slices in a roasting pan and set in the oven. Turn the bones to brown all sides until they are a deep golden brown, about 30 minutes. Do not allow them to burn, since that will give the stock a bitter taste.<br> Transfer the bones and onion to a stockpot, and place the roasting pan on the stove. Over medium high heat, deglaze the pan with 2 cups of water, scraping up all the bits that stick to the bottom of the pan. Pour into the stockpot and add 3 quarts of water. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for 3 hours.<br> Strain into a clean stockpot and boil for 20 to 30 minutes, until the stock is reduced to 2 cups. At this point, the stock is more concentrated and more flavorful. Strain into a clean bowl and cool.<br> Since brown stock is primarily a base for sauces and only a small amount is used, pour the cooled stock into an ice-cube tray. When completely solid, release the cubes, enclose in a plastic bag, and return to the freezer. When needed, one or two cubes can be defrosted and used.<br> In a medium saucepan, bring orange juice to a boil. Lower to a simmer and reduce until only 1/3 cup remains. Cool to room temperature.<br> In a medium bowl, combine orange juice, shallot, thyme, vinegar and orange zest.<br> Slowly whisk in olive oil until thick and emulsified. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until needed.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 12893,&quot;Cakey Oatmeal Raisin Cookies Boiling water<br> 1/2 cup raisins 1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour, spooned and leveled 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 cup apple butter 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1 large egg<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 3/4 cup rolled oats (not quick-cooking) Instructions:</p><ol><li>In a small bowl, add the raisins and cover with boiling water.

Starting at the bottom of the cone and working in an upward spiral, insert a row of wooden toothpicks 2 inches apart. Insert 5 more evenly spaced rows of toothpicks around the cone. Press a large White Chocolate Strawberry onto one toothpick in the first row (place the large strawberries on the bottom and work up to the smaller strawberries on top). Repeat the process with the Cream Puffs on the next row of toothpicks. Add the Meringue Swirls on the row after that. Repeat with the strawberries, cream puffs and meringues on the remaining 3 rows. Fill in any holes by adding more toothpicks to the cone and pressing on the remaining strawberries, cream puffs and meringues. Slip the Meringue Leaves into any gaps, distributing them evenly around the croquembouche. Gently drape the tower with the Spun Sugar and serve immediately.<br> Lightly spray a baking rack with nonstick cooking spray and set in a rimmed baking sheet. Using a paring knife, trim off the tops of the strawberries. Put the strawberries top-side down on the prepared rack and place in the freezer until very cold but not frozen, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted, about 3 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the chocolate over each strawberry and let set, about 30 seconds. Drizzle the chocolate over some of the set strawberries to create stripes; spoon some more of the chocolate over the remaining strawberries and decorate with the sanding sugars and sprinkles. Let set completely, about 30 minutes.<br> For the pastry: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Combine the butter, granulated sugar, salt and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When the mixture comes to a boil, add all the flour at once and stir with a wooden spoon until fully incorporated and smooth, about 1 minute. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 30 seconds more. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, add the eggs 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition until they are completely incorporated and the mixture is thick and smooth, about 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip. Pipe fourteen 2-inch-wide cream puffs onto one of the prepared baking sheets with half the dough, spacing them 1/2 inch apart. Pipe twenty-eight 1-inch-wide cream puffs onto the other baking sheet with the remaining dough. Dip your finger in water and use it to smooth out any bumps or points in the dough. Bake the cream puffs for 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F; continue to bake until the cream puffs are puffed up and golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let cool completely. For the whipped cream: Combine the cream, granulated sugar and vanilla in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Transfer the cream to a pastry bag fitted with small round tip.<br> Set aside all 14 of the 2-inch puffs and 16 of the 1-inch puffs for filling (freeze the extra puffs for later use or fill and eat them separately). Use the pastry tip to gently poke a hole in the bottom of the reserved puffs. Pipe the cream into the puffs until they are just filled (do not overfill).<br> For the glaze: Put the confectioners&#39; sugar in a medium bowl and whisk in the juice until smooth. Dip the top of each cream puff in the glaze, letting the excess drip off before turning over and placing on a cooling rack. Let rest until the glaze is dry and shiny, about 30 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or use an electric hand mixer); beat on medium speed until frothy, about 2 minutes. Add the cream of tartar and increase the speed to medium high; beat in the granulated sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue beating until the meringue is thick, glossy and holds stiff peaks, about 6 minutes more. Remove 1 cup of the meringue to a small bowl and whisk in the green and yellow food coloring. Beat the red food coloring into the remaining meringue. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a small star tip with the pink meringue. Pipe half the meringue into 2-inch swirls on half of a prepared baking sheet, spacing the swirls about 1/2 inch apart. Pipe the remaining pink meringue into 1-inch swirls on the other half of the baking sheet.<br> Fill a pastry bag fitted with a leaf tip with the green meringue. Pipe a variety of leaves on the second prepared baking sheet.<br> Bake the meringues until dry, 30 to 45 minutes; you do not want any color or browning on the swirls. Remove the meringues from the oven and let cool completely, about 20 minutes. Reserve 8 of the larger swirls, 7 of the smaller swirls and 25 of the leaves for the croquembouche. Store any extras in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup and 1/4 cup water in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Cook to 300 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Let cool to 275 degrees F. Position 2 wooden spoons 2 feet apart on similar-size bowls with their handles sticking out over the edge by 6 inches. Put newspaper or foil on the counter below the spoons.<br> Dip a fork in the sugar syrup and flick it back and forth over the spoon handles to create lots of long thin threads. Repeat 3 to 4 times, then gently gather up the threads and put them on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining sugar until it is all spun. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12902,&quot;Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese Salad 2 Bosc pears 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 1 bunch watercress, stems trimmed 1 bunch arugula, stems trimmed 2 endive, thinly sliced crosswise 2 ounces crumbled blue cheese, such as Roquefort, Maytag, or Stilton, about 1/2 cup Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Halve and core the pears and cut into 3/4-inch pieces. Heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil in an ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the pears and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer pan to the oven and continue cooking until the pears are softened, about 5 to 7 minutes more. Meanwhile, whisk the mustard and vinegar in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, starting with a few drops and then adding the rest in a steady stream, to make a smooth, slightly thick dressing. Set aside. Toss the watercress, arugula, and endive in a large bowl. Add the blue cheese and dressing, season with salt and pepper, and toss gently. Toss the warm pears into the salad.

When friends are coming for lunch, get the water heated to boiling point before they arrive, otherwise you end up nervously hanging around waiting for a watched pot to boil while your supposedly quick lunch gets later and later. Bring the water to the boil, cover and turn off burner. I tend to leave the addition of salt until the water comes to a boil a second time. But whichever way you do it, add quite a bit of salt. When the bubbling&#39;s encouragingly fierce, put in the pasta. I often put the lid on for a moment or so just to let the pasta get back to the boil, but don&#39;t turn your back on it, and give it a good stir with a pasta fork or whatever to avoid even the suspicion of stickiness, once you&#39;ve removed the lid. Then get on with the sauce, making sure you&#39;ve set your timer for about a minute or so less than the time specified on the package of pasta. In a bowl, add the yolks, cream, Parmesan, zest of the whole lemon and juice of half of it, the salt and good grind of pepper, and beat with a fork. You don&#39;t want it fluffy, just combined. Taste. If you want it more lemony, then of course add more juice. When the timer goes off, taste to judge how near the pasta is to being ready. I recommend that you hover by the stove so you don&#39;t miss that point. Don&#39;t be too hasty, though. Everyone is so keen to cook their pasta properly al dente that sometimes the pasta is actually not cooked enough. You want absolutely no chalkiness here. And linguine (or at least I find it so) tend not to run over into soggy overcookedness quite as quickly as other long pasta. This makes sense, of course, as the strands of \\little tongues\\ are dense than the flat ribbon shapes. Anyway, as soon as the pasta looks ready, remove a cup of the cooking liquid, drain the pasta, and then, off the heat, toss it back in the pot or put it in an efficiently preheated bowl, throw in the butter, and stir and swirl about to make sure the butter&#39;s melted and the pasta covered by it all over. Each strand will be only mutely gleaming, as there&#39;s not much butter and quite a bit of pasta. If you want to add more, then do; good butter is the best flavoring, best texture, best mood enhancer there is. When you&#39;re satisfied the pasta&#39;s covered with its soft slip of butter, then stir in the egg mixture and turn the pasta well in it, adding some of the cooking liquid if it looks a bit dry (only 2 tablespoons or so - you don&#39;t want a wet mess - and only after you think the sauce is incorporated). Sprinkle over the parsley and serve now, now, now. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 12910,&quot;Curry Vegetables with Couscous Parchment Pack 1 cup plain couscous 3 cups small cauliflower florets (about 1/2 of a small head) 1 cup diced butternut squash (about chickpea-sized) One 15.5-ounce can low-sodium chickpeas, drained and rinsed One 14.5-ounce can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, drained 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons curry powder (no salt added) 1 clove garlic, finely grated 1 teaspoon finely grated ginger Kosher salt 1/2 cup low-fat plain yogurt, for serving Lime wedges, for serving Instructions: Position 2 racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Cut four 16-inch long sheets of parchment paper. Fold each sheet in half and open it like a book. Divide the pieces of parchment between 2 baking sheets (2 pieces per sheet). Toss the cauliflower, butternut squash, chickpeas, diced tomatoes, olive oil, curry powder, garlic, ginger, and 2 1/2 teaspoons salt together in a large bowl. Divide the vegetables between the 4 sheets of parchment, placing them on one side of the fold. Drizzle 2 teaspoons water over each serving of vegetables. Fold over the top half of the parchment, crimping and overlapping small folds along the open edge to seal tightly. Bake until the parchment puffs and becomes golden, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place couscous in a heatproof bowl. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil and carefully pour over the couscous. Stir and cover with plastic wrap. After 5 minutes, uncover and fluff with a fork.

Line a quarter-sheet pan with parchment paper overlapping the longer sides, then spray with baking spray, ensuring the exposed sides of the pan are well-greased. Combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a large bowl. Stir together and set aside. Mix the buttermilk, baking soda, vanilla and egg in a small pitcher. Set aside. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, then add the cocoa. Whisk together to combine. Add 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, then cook for 10 to 15 seconds. Add the chocolate mixture to the flour and stir together for a moment to cool slightly. Add the egg mixture and stir until smooth. Add the batter to the prepared pan and bake until cooked through in the center, about 15 minutes. Set aside and allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes. For the cherry sauce: Combine the cherries, granulated sugar and liquor in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced and thickened, 6 to 7 minutes,. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool to room temperature. For the whipped cream: Whip together the heavy cream, powdered sugar and vanilla with a stand mixer until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Cover and transfer to the refrigerator until ready to build the cake. Once the cake has cooled completely, flip it onto a cutting board and remove the parchment paper. Cut the cake in half, then cut each piece in half again, giving you 4 equal pieces. Carefully put the first piece of the cake on a cake stand or platter. Spread a quarter of the whipped cream on top, then scatter a third of the cherry mixture over the top. Repeat two more times, trying to build the cake layers as straight and even as possible. Place the final piece of cake on the top and spread the remaining whipped cream over the top. Grate the chocolate bar over the top of the whipped cream for the finishing touch. Chill the cake for 20 minutes to help firm up the whipped cream before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Moscato, Riesling]</li></ol><p>&quot; 12913,&quot;Slow-Cooker Overnight Breakfast Casserole 2 pounds bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 pound breakfast sausage, casings removed, broken up<br> Nonstick cooking spray One 2-pound bag frozen shredded or diced hash brown potatoes (not patties) Two 10-ounce cans tomatoes and chiles, such as Ro-Tel 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded pepper Jack cheese<br> 1 medium red onion, finely chopped 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded whole-milk mozzarella<br> 12 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 cup milk 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Chopped cilantro, hot sauce and lime wedges, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a wok or frying pan over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Decrease the heat to medium and add the onion, Chinese Celery stems, ginger and the cilantro-root paste. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion has wilted slightly, about 90 seconds. Turn off the heat. Pour the remaining 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil into the clay pot and rub to coat the bottom and sides. Line the bottom of the pot with one layer of the pork belly, then add the onion mixture in an even layer. Use kitchen shears to snip off any pointy feelers from the shrimp, then snip through the shell on the back of the shrimp and barely into the flesh to expose the vein. Discard the veins and add the shrimp to the pot in one layer. Sprinkle on the cracked black pepper. In a medium mixing bowl, toss the noodles with the black soy sauce until the noodles are an even amber color, then add the noodles to the pot in an even layer. You can stop here and cook the dish up to an hour later or cover and keep the pot in the fridge overnight. Let it come to room temperature before cooking. In a small bowl, stir together the thin soy sauce, oyster sauce, seasoning sauce, Shoaxing wine, sugar, sesame oil and water. Measure 3 tablespoons of this mixture and drizzle it over the noodles. Top with the Chinese celery leaves. This dish tastes best cooked on a charcoal tao (you can get away with cooking it on a gas stovetop rack). Prepare the tao, as you would a charcoal grill, to cook over medium heat. Cover the pot with the lid and cook until the noodles and the shrimp are completely cooked, 9 to 12 minutes, resisting the temptation to check under the lid until at least 9 minutes have passed. You won&#39;t be able to tell until you stir, but the pork belly should be slightly caramelized. If it&#39;s not, then use a slightly higher heat the next time you make the dish. Stir well before serving. If you&#39;ve made it, serve the dipping sauce alongside and occasionally dunk a shrimp. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 12931,&quot;Crispy Shallots 5 cups shallots, thinly sliced Peanut oil for frying Salt to taste Instructions: In a large pot or deep fryer heat peanut oil until piece of shallot dropped in oil sizzles.

Add 1 cup of the Parmesan and stir to combine. Season with some salt and pepper. Preheat a large grill pan or outdoor grill over high heat. Slice the baguette in half length-wise, like you would to make a sandwich. Then slice each half into 8 equal pieces, about 3/4-inch-thick. Place the pieces on a baking sheet or large plate and reserve. Quarter the romaine hearts lengthwise and cut each quarter into 1-inch pieces, making sure to keep each piece stacked and together. You will need 24 pieces total. To assemble the skewers, carefully thread 1 stack of the romaine on a skewer, making sure that the thickest part of the romaine is in the center of the skewer. Follow the romaine with 1 piece of baguette and repeat until you have 3 stacks of romaine and 2 pieces of baguette on the skewer. Thread 2 shrimp onto the end of the skewer, making sure that both the top and bottom of each shrimp is taut on the skewer. Leave no more than 1/2-inch of exposed skewer at each end once all of the ingredients are on. This will prevent you from having to soak the skewers if you are using wooden skewers. Place the assembled skewer on a sheet tray. Repeat with the remaining 7 skewers and ingredients. Place 1/2 cup of the dressing in a small bowl and whisk in the remaining oil. Brush the skewers liberally with the dressing. Place the skewers on the grill and cook until the bread and romaine are lightly charred and the shrimp is just cooked through, about 3 minutes, rotating the skewers as needed for even charring. If the shrimp is not cooked by the time the bread toasts, use tongs to touch the shrimp ends to the hot grill grate. Transfer the grilled skewers on to a large platter and sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan. Serve immediately with the remaining dressing on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 12936,&quot;Grilled Herbed Tofu with Avocado Cream One 12-ounce container extra-firm tofu, drained and patted dry 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon herbs de Provence 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper One 6-ounce ripe Haas avocado, peeled and pitted 1/2 packed cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 1/2 cup vegetable broth 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice (about 1 large lime) 1 clove garlic, peeled and smashed 1 large lime, zested Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: For the tofu: Place a nonstick grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. (If not using a nonstick grill pan, oil the grill lightly before cooking the tofu to prevent sticking.)<br> Cut the tofu in half diagonally to make 2 large triangles. Cut each large triangle in half to make 4 smaller triangles. Cut through each triangle horizontally to make 8 triangles. Brush on each side with olive oil. Season with the herbs de Provence, salt and pepper. Grill the tofu until light golden, 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a platter.<br> For the cream: In a food processor, blend the avocado, parsley, broth, olive oil, lime juice, garlic and lime zest until smooth.

Poke a few holes in the potatoes with a fork. Bake until tender, 50 to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil and fill a bowl with ice water. Blanch the broccoli by throwing the florets into the boiling water until bright green and still slightly crisp, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Immediately drain the broccoli and plunge it into the bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Remove it from the ice water and set it aside. In a skillet over medium heat, add 1/4 inch of vegetable oil. Add the onions and fry until browned and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. In another skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for a minute or 2, but do not let the flour brown. Whisk in the milk and cook until it thickens. Turn the heat to low, stir in the Cheddar and pepper Jack and cook until they are melted. Add the broccoli and cook, stirring, until the broccoli is warmed through. Make a slit down the length of each potato using a fork. Push in the ends to open up the potatoes and break up some of the potato inside. Pour a ladle of the cheese sauce over each potato. Garnish with the crispy onions and serve while hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 12940,&quot;The Big Winooski 1/2 cup (40 grams) Dutch-process cocoa powder (like Cacao Barry Extra Brute) 1/4 cup (30 grams) all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 3 large eggs, at room temperature 1/2 cup (110 grams) light brown sugar, packed 2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 10 ounces (280 grams) bittersweet chocolate (like Callebaut 60/40), finely chopped 1 cup (170 grams) bittersweet chocolate chips Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two sheet pans with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the eggs, brown sugar, honey, espresso powder, and vanilla. Whisk on high speed until the mixture ribbons thickly. Put the butter and chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set it over a saucepan of simmering water (to make a double boiler). Stir until melted. Using a sturdy wooden spoon, stir the flour mixture into the melted chocolate mixture until well combined. This becomes a very thick paste, but if you use your muscles, you&#39;ll get through it. Stir one third of the egg mixture into the chocolate mixture to lighten it; again, this takes a little muscle. Add the lightened chocolate mixture to the remaining egg mixture in the mixer bowl and whisk on medium speed until the batter is smooth and shiny. Using a wooden spoon, fold in the chocolate chips. If the dough isn&#39;t already firm, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until scoopable, about 1 hour. Dip a medium (1 1/2-ounce) cookie scoop in hot water (don&#39;t dry off after dipping), then scoop leveled scoops of the dough and place them on the prepared sheet pans 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Dampen your hands with water and gently press down on the cookies with your palm to flatten them a bit. Bake until the cookies just begin to lose their shine on top (they&#39;ll still have a \\sheen\\ but they will no longer be shiny), 10 to 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]&quot; 12941,&quot;Lightly Toasted Overnight Steel-Cut Oatmeal with Honey-Roasted Apricots and Pistachios 2 cups steel-cut Irish oats 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt<br> 8 ripe but still firm apricots, pitted and quartered<br> 1/2 cup apricot nectar<br> 1/4 cup clover honey<br> 4 whole cloves<br> 2 cinnamon sticks<br> 1 cup warm milk<br> 3/4 cup shelled pistachios, toasted and chopped<br> Rose water, for drizzling, optional<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Spread the oats on a baking sheet in an even layer and bake, stirring occasionally, until lightly toasted, about 15 minutes. In a large pot, bring 8 cups of water and the sea salt to a boil. Stir in the toasted oatmeal and cook for 1 minute. Cover the pot tightly and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. The next morning, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the apricot quarters in a medium glass roasting pan and bake until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. While the apricots roast, combine the apricot nectar, honey, cloves and cinnamon sticks in a medium skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the baked apricots and any pan juices and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apricots are well caramelized and the liquid is syrupy, about 5 minutes.

To score the ham, use a serrated knife to make parallel cuts about an inch apart, across and through the skin into the fat. Cut diagonally across these first cuts to make a diamond pattern. In a food processor combine the parsley, sage, garlic, mustard, red pepper, salt, and pepper. Add 1/4 cup of the oil and pulse to a make a coarse paste. Rub the paste all over the ham, pressing it into the cuts. Cover the ham with plastic wrap, put on a pan, and refrigerate overnight. Remove ham from the refrigerator about 1 1/2 hours before cooking so the meat can come to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large roasting pan toss the onion wedges with the remaining oil. Place the ham on top of the onions and add 1 cup of the cider. Roast the meat for 30 minutes, reduce the oven temperature 300 degrees F. Cook the ham until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 150 degrees F. A 13-pound ham will take about 4 to 4 1/2 hours, about 20 minutes per pound. Meanwhile in a large saucepan bring the cider to a boil. Reduce the heat to a brisk simmer and cook the cider until syrupy and about 1 1/2 cups. Skim off any foam that comes to the surface as the cider reduces. During the last 1 1/2 hours of cooking the ham, brush the reduced cider over the roast every 30 minutes to glaze the skin. Let the cooked ham rest, loosely covered with foil, at room temperature for 30 minutes before carving. Reserve the onions and pan juices, skimming off any excess fat. Carve the ham and serve with the onion and pan juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12943,&quot;Tomato Fromage 4 Roma tomatoes Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Garlic powder 1/4 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Dust a clean, flat work surface with flour. Using a rolling pin, roll the pizza dough into a 16-inch circle. Dust a 14- to 16-inch pizza pan with flour and carefully transfer the dough onto the pizza pan. Arrange the string cheese around the perimeter of the dough with a 1-inch border from the edge. Stretch the dough over the cheese and press to seal. Drizzle the surface with 2 tablespoons of the Pickle Oil, including some of the mustard seeds, coriander seeds and garlic for added texture and flavor. Arrange half of the pickles on the dough, then top with the grated Havarti, making sure to get all the way to the edge of the crust, and the remaining half of the pickles on top of the cheese. Bake until the cheese is splotchy and bubbly and the crust turns golden brown; begin checking at 12 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and season with black pepper. Brush the crust with additional Pickle Oil. Top the pizza with drizzles of sriracha and ranch dressing and sprinkles of dill and scallions. Slice and serve immediately. Combine the flour, yeast and salt in the bowl of the stand mixer and whisk together. Add the water and oil and mix with the dough hook until a dough forms, scraping down the sides.

Strain the blueberries through a fine mesh strainer (chinois). You don&#39;t want to have the skins of the berries in the ganache, just the juices. Reserve this liquid. Bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan. Add the white chocolate and stir frequently or whisk until smooth. This can also be done over a double broiler to risk the chance of scalding the cream and chocolate. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the blueberry liquid. A pourable ganache should be held around 90 degrees F. The ganache can be held in refrigeration for 4 days or frozen for 3 months. Ice Cream: Puree blueberries in a food processor until the berries are somewhat chunky, similar to a salsa consistency. Whisk the sugar and eggs in a medium mixing bowl until they are thickened and pale yellow. Bring the creams to a simmer in a saucepan (170-degrees F). Slowly whisk the cream mixture into the egg and sugar mixture. Pour entire mixture back into saucepan and bring and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until the custard thickens. If the heat gets too high or boils, the eggs will scramble. Pour the custard through a strainer into a clean bowl. Place in a freezer until cool, then stir in blueberries and vanilla extract. Transfer to an ice cream machine and follow manufacturer&#39;s directions or return to freezer and stir occasionally until custard sets. Profiteroles: Bring water, milk, and butter to a boil, then add flour all at once, stirring vigorously with a large spoon until mixture groups together. Reduce heat while continuing to stir for one more minute to cook out any excess moisture. Beat the eggs in one at a time with a mixer at low speed or with a spoon. Make sure the paste is smooth before the next egg is added. When all eggs are incorporated, the dough should be smooth and shiny. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place paste in a large pastry bag and pipe on to a large ungreased cookie sheet in 12 round mounds around 2 to 2 1/ 2-inch in diameter and 1-inch high. Place in 400-degrees for 15 minutes then reduce heat to 350-degrees for roughly 25 to 30 minutes. Profiteroles should be golden brown. Remove from oven and place profiteroles on a rack to cool. Cut profiteroles in half. Scoop blueberry ice cream into bottom half of profiteroles and place top half on ice cream. Drizzle with ganache. Top with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and a few fresh blueberries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12968,&quot;Chocolate Tartlets Nonstick cooking spray 1 (18-ounce) package refrigerated sugar cookie dough (recommended: Nestle Toll House) 5 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 3/4 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 tablespoon sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 large egg, at room temperature, beaten Whipped cream and shaved dark and white chocolate, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the butter and sage in a mixing bowl, mash with a fork or spoon until the sage is well incorporated and the butter has flecks of green in it; season with salt and pepper. In a saute pan, melt 4 tablespoons of the sage butter, add the onions, cook and stir for 15 minutes until soft and golden. Remove from heat. Put the cornbread in a large mixing bowl and scrape the sauteed onion mixture on top. Add the egg, heavy cream, and just enough chicken stock to moisten the stuffing without making it soggy (about 1/2 cup.) Toss well to combine, season with salt and pepper. Remove the neck and gizzards from the inside of the turkey and discard. Rinse the bird thoroughly inside and out with cold water, pat dry. Sprinkle the cavity and skin liberally with salt and pepper. Using your fingers, gently lift the skin from the breast and legs, and slip pieces of the sage butter underneath; massaging it in as you go. Fill the bird with the cornbread stuffing without packing too tightly; cook the remaining stuffing separately in a buttered baking dish. Truss the turkey; place it on a rack in a large roasting pan, and put into the oven. Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, whisk together the maple syrup and hot water to thin the glaze out a bit; use this to baste the turkey every 30 minutes. The turkey should take about 3 hours to cook (i.e. 15 to 20 minutes per pound.) If the legs or breast brown too quickly, cover with foil. About 2 hours into cooking, shingle the strips of bacon oven the turkey breast to cover; continue to roast and baste for another hour or so. The turkey is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meatiest part of the thigh registers 170 degrees F (the thigh juices will also run clear when pricked with a knife.) Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let rest for 20 minutes before carving, so the juices can settle back into the meat. Skim off the excess fat from the pan drippings with a spoon and place the roasting pan over 2 burners set on medium-high heat. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up brown bits stuck to bottom of pan. Whisk the flour into the drippings, stirring as it thickens to prevent lumps. Add the remaining chicken stock and bring to a simmer; season with salt and pepper and hit it with a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavor. Simmer for 5 minutes and then strain to remove any particles. Serve the gravy with the maple-roasted turkey and cornbread stuffing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 12997,&quot;\\Pork on Pork\\ Chops 1 pound pancetta, cut into small dice 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves<br> 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves<br> 3 garlic cloves<br> 4 center-cut pork chops, each about 2 1/2 inches thick Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 3 tablespoons canola oil<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a food processor, combine the pancetta, thyme, rosemary and garlic. Pulse until the mixture is finely ground. Set aside. Make sure the pork chops are at room temperature, then liberally season them with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat the canola oil in a large ovensafe skillet or grill pan over high heat. When the oil is hot, sear the pork chops for about 2 minutes on each side. Stick the pan in the oven to finish cooking the pork, 5 to 6 minutes. Depending on your oven, of course, and the thickness of your chops, this should result in a medium to medium-well chop, still slightly pink in the middle. If you prefer a more well-done chop, add a minute or 2 to the cooking time. While the pork chops are in the oven, heat a large saute pan over high heat. Add the pancetta and herb mixture. Turn the heat down to low and continue to cook the pancetta, stirring continuously to break up any large chunks, until all the fat is rendered and the pancetta is crispy, 8 to 10 minutes.

Rest the chicken in a bowl or on a plate for 2 hours total, refrigerated first for 1 1/2 hours, then at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes. In a large pot, add the garlic, chicken and the chipotle peppers from the marinade. Add just enough water to cover, then bring to a boil on medium high. Once boiling, turn the heat to the lowest setting and poach the chicken until cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and rest (reserve the poaching water for cooking the pasta). Fish out the peppers and discard them; place the garlic cloves in a large bowl and smash them with the back of a spoon or your hands. Once the chicken is cool enough to touch, shred it by hand into bite-size pieces. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Use the butter or cooking spray to coat the bottom and sides of a 13-by-9-inch casserole dish. In the same pot used to poach the chicken, add more water to the poaching water and a nice pinch of salt and bring the pot back to a boil (watch the water; it may foam up a bit from the poaching process). Add the pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package suggests. Drain the pasta in a colander. For the sauce: In the large bowl with the garlic, add the heavy cream, cheese, crema, flour, pepper, scallions, eggs, reserved 2 tablespoons adobo sauce, shredded chicken and cooked pasta. Stir to combine. Pour into the prepared dish. For the topping: In a medium bowl, toss together the crushed chips and cheese. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the dish.

Heat the oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat. When hot, add the short ribs and sear on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the pressure cooker and reserve. Lower the heat to medium, add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, sage and thyme and cook until lightly caramelized, 6 to 8 minutes. There should be a fond-- tasty bits from searing the ribs--on the bottom of the pan. Add the red wine and chicken stock and, using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pressure cooker to get the fond into the sauce. Let the wine reduce for 6 minutes. Add the short ribs back to the pressure cooker and stir well. Add the pressure cooker lid, line up the arrows and, following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions, keep over medium heat while the cooker pressurizes. Cook over medium heat until the ribs are tender and almost falling off the bone, 45 minutes. Remove the pressure cooker from the heat and carefully release the steam through the pressure valve on the lid, following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Transfer the ribs to a plate. Reserve to the side. Strain the cooking liquid from the pressure cooker into a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate saute pan, combine the red wine vinegar, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, hot sauce, red pepper flakes, remaining teaspoons each of salt and black pepper and whisk together well. Bring the sauce to a simmer. Add 1 cup of the reduced cooking liquid to the barbecue sauce mixture and cook until thickened, another 5 minutes. Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Place the short ribs on the grill, baste with the barbecue sauce, and cook until they have started to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Baste the short ribs with the sauce, flip the ribs, and cook until the other sides start to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the short ribs to a cutting board and allow to rest 5 minutes. Serve the BBQ short ribs over a bed of Roasted Red Pepper Polenta; drizzle with more barbecue sauce and garnish with sliced scallions, if using. Serve immediately. To fire-roast the red peppers, place them over a high flame on a stove-top burner and roast, turning occasionally, until the skins turn black on all sides. Place the peppers in a medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow them to steam for 10 minutes. Peel away the blackened skins from the peppers. Cut away the stems and then seed, core and coarsely chop the peppers. Place them in a food processor and puree until smooth; reserve to the side. In a heavy bottom medium pot, bring 8 cups water, salt and the roasted red pepper puree to a boil. Add the stone-ground cornmeal in a gentle stream, whisking or stirring vigorously in the same direction as you pour it in. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring continuously for 2 to 3 minutes. Cook the polenta, stirring every few minutes and scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent from sticking for 35 to 40 minutes. When the polenta is thick, glossy and pulling away from the side of the pan, add the Pecorino Romano and butter, stirring quickly to incorporate. Pour the polenta into a medium serving dish and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]&quot; 13029,&quot;Pan Fried Ham Kebobs served with Basmati Rice, Peppers, Pineapple and Mango 3 tablespoons ginger-flavored soy sauce 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 whole smoked ham, cut into 1-inch cubes 1 green pepper, 1-inch dice 1 red pepper, 1-inch dice 1 yellow pepper, 1-inch dice 1 red onion, 1-inch dice 1 white onion, 1-inch dice 16 to 24 (1-inch) cubes fresh pineapple 8 to 10 wooden skewers Basmati Rice, recipe follows 1 mango, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 1/4 head red leaf lettuce, chopped 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves, for garnish 4 cups water 2 cups basmati rice 2 to 4 tablespoons butter Instructions: Combine the soy sauce and lemon juice in a medium non-reactive bowl.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until all of the liquid has evaporated and the pineapple has caramelized, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in the condensed milk and salt; cover and freeze 30 minutes. Beat the cream and vanilla bean paste with a stand mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir the chilled pineapple mixture to loosen it up, then fold in the whipped cream.<br> Cut out a 4 1/2-inch round of pound cake using a 1-quart plastic deli/soup container as a cutter; this will be the base of the Hawaii. (If the pound cake is small, you can form the base out of multiple pieces.) Wrap the cake round in plastic and set aside until ready to use.<br> Line the quart container with plastic wrap so that 4 inches hang over the sides. Add 2 cups of the pineapple ice cream, smooth the top, cover and freeze until solid, about 3 hours. Freeze the remaining pineapple ice cream for another use.<br> Top the pineapple ice cream with the pistachio gelato, pushing it down to fill in all the gaps. Unwrap the pound cake round and press it into the top of the ice cream to make it adhere. Cover the top using the overhanging plastic wrap and freeze until solid, 2 to 3 hours.<br> For the honey meringue: Boil the honey, sugar and 1/3 cup water without stirring in a medium saucepan until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F.<br> Meanwhile, whip the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed until soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. With the mixer running, carefully pour the hot syrup into the whites in a thin, steady stream. (The whites will deflate slightly at first, but as the sugar syrup becomes incorporated, they will thicken, turn white and begin to fluff up.) Continue to whip until very thick and glossy, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a large piping bag fitted with a large closed-star tip; set aside until ready to use.<br> Use a 2 1/2- and a 1-inch round cutter to cut 2 rounds of pound cake. Pipe a tablespoon of the meringue in the center of a cake stand, then invert the frozen container of ice cream onto the center of the cake stand to unmold it, pressing the pound cake base into the meringue to glue it in place. Pipe a teaspoon of the meringue on the top of the ice cream core and press the 2 1/2-inch cake round on top. Pipe another teaspoon of meringue on the top of that cake round and press the 1-inch cake round on top. Working quickly, pipe a wide band of meringue around the circumference of the ice cream core about 2 inches from the bottom. Pipe another band just above so that the two bands touch. Repeat, making two additional bands forming a thick meringue \\belt\\ in the center of the core. Use a small offset spatula to sculpt and smooth the belt into a pineapple shape, with the widest part in the center and tapering at the top and bottom; use more meringue if necessary. Pipe meringue over the two cake rounds on top and sculpt and smooth to completely cover and form the tapered top of the pineapple. Freeze for 2 hours. Store the remaining meringue in its piping bag at room temperature.<br> For the fronds: Place the attached PDF of pineapple fronds on a rimmed baking sheet and place a piece of parchment on top. Melt the candy melts with 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil, stirring occasionally, in a heatproof bowl set inside a pot of simmering water. Turn off the heat and transfer 2 tablespoons of the melted candy to a small piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Trace the outside border of the pineapple fronds with the melted candy and freeze to set, about 5 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, stir the remaining tablespoon coconut oil into the remaining melted candy in the bowl. Flood the pineapple top by spooning the liquid candy melt into the outlines of the frond. Freeze to harden, about 15 minutes.<br> Pipe concentric bands of meringue stars to cover the surface of the pineapple. Freeze 30 minutes. Use a kitchen torch to toast the meringue, then freeze at least 10 minutes. Keep frozen until ready to serve.<br> Right before serving, use a chef&#39;s knife to cut a 2-inch slit in the top of the pineapple. Insert the candy fronds into the slit and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 13032,&quot;Chocolate Dipped Bananas 5 bananas 8 popsicle sticks 3 cups good quality chocolate bar 3 tablespoons butter, cut up Chopped nuts Toasted coconut Cookie crumbles Colored sprinkles or chocolate jimmies Mini chocolate candies or mini semi sweet chips, for chocoholics Granola Instructions: Peel and cut the bananas in half crosswise, so that you have 8 pieces.

Add the garlic and continue to cook for another minute. Transfer the mixture to a medium mixing bowl and set aside to cool. Clean the squid thoroughly and remove the heads from the tentacles and discard the heads. Turn the tubes inside out (since the outside skin tends to curl outward, it&#39;ll hold the stuffing better inside out), put into a bowl and set in the refrigerator until ready to use. Place the tentacles and the shrimp into the bowl of a food processor and pulse 6 to 8 times or until there are no large pieces visible. Do not process until smooth. Transfer to the mixing bowl along with the onions and garlic. Add the bread crumbs, tomato, lemon zest, ginger, parsley and pepper. Stir to combine well. Place the mixture into a resealable freezer bag and snip 1 corner. You may use a pastry bag with a tip just small enough to fit into the end of the tubes.
