Remove the woody stems from the collard greens using the tip of a sharp knife. Carefully lower the collard greens into the boiling water with a steamer basket or a long pair of tongs. Cook over high heat until the collards lose their starchy rigidity and become pliant, about 1 minute, then carefully remove from the water and lay on a paper-towel-lined plate. Allow the greens to cool before handling. Meanwhile, prepare a smoker or grill for indirect cooking at 225 degrees F. Drain the stewed tomatoes of their juice (reserve the juice) and add the tomatoes to a disposable aluminum pan. Place tomatoes in the smoker. Allow to smoke until the tomatoes acquire a savory smoky fragrance, about 1 hour. Remove the tomatoes. Puree the smoked tomatoes into a thick sauce in a blender. If the tomatoes are too thick, thin the puree with the reserved tomato juice. Keep warm. Fill a large pot with cold water. Mince the sweet potatoes into roughly 1/2-inch cubes. Add the sweet potatoes to the cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until sweet potatoes can be easily pierced with a knife, about 20 minutes. Drain in a colander and let cool. Meanwhile, add 3 cups water to the rice in a saucepot. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a simmer. Cook until rice is fluffy and the water has either cooked into the rice or evaporated off. Combine sweet potatoes, brisket, rice and jalapeno jelly in a large bowl. Whisk the heavy cream and horseradish into the sour cream in medium bowl. Season with a touch of lemon juice and salt. Keep cool. Assembly: On a clean cutting board, lay one blanched collard green on top of another, orienting them so that the stem seams do not line up and weaken the finished roll. Along the center line of the greens, add one quarter of the sweet potato filling mixture. Tightly roll the greens over the filling like a wide sleeping bag, then slice into 1-inch-wide pinwheels. Repeat with remaining greens and filling. Spread a 2-ounce ladle of the smoked tomato puree on a plate. Carefully transfer the rolls to the plate with a long spatula. Finish with a zig-zag drizzle of horseradish crema. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71803,&quot;Shrimp in Garlic Pepperoni Sauce 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil 1 (16-ounce) pepperoni, 1/2-inch dice 1 head garlic, peeled and chopped 1 teaspoon adobo seasoning 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon cayenne 1 1/2 pounds (16 to 20 count) shrimp, peeled and deveined Crusty chewy bread, for sopping Instructions: In a medium saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat and saute the diced pepperoni until it releases some of its oil, about 3 minutes.

Whisk to evenly combine. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer, or in the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, stopping the mixer once or twice to scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each until thoroughly incorporated. Add the vanilla. Scrape the bowl again and mix for a few more seconds. On low speed, add 1/2 the dry ingredients. Beat until combined. Add the remaining dry ingredients and beat just until the flour is completely absorbed into the dough. Turn the dough onto the table, gather it together, and knead gently into a smooth mass. Form it into a log and divide into 3 even parts. Flatten each section into a patty about 1/2-inch thick and cover each with plastic wrap. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. The dough may also be frozen for up to 1 month. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Let the dough sit at room temperature, still covered, for about 20 minutes to soften slightly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to slightly more than 1/8-inch thick. Cut out shapes with cookie cutters, as close together as possible, and use a palate knife or metal spatula to transfer to ungreased baking sheets, placing them about 1-inch apart. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Press the scraps together, roll them out, and cut, always brushing off any excess flour, until all used up. Bake cookies for about 17 minutes, or until the edges begin to turn golden. Let sit for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a bowl using a handheld mixer, begin to beat the egg whites and sugar on low speed. Be sure the bowl and beaters are free of any fat and that there is no egg yolk in the whites. After 30 seconds or so, scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula and gradually increase the speed of the mixer to medium. Beat until the mixer thickens and stiffens, about 3 minutes.

Place the butter in a bowl and mash with a fork until smooth. Add the matcha and 1 teaspoon salt and stir until evenly combined. Slide your forefinger gently under the skin of the chicken and loosen it from the breasts and thighs. Using a spoon, stuff scoops of matcha butter underneath the skin of the breasts and thighs and press it so it spreads out evenly. Take any remaining matcha butter from the bowl (or that doesn&#39;t get underneath the skin), and rub it all over the outside of the chicken. Sprinkle the chicken generously with more salt and pepper. Peel off the outer layers of each leek until you have at least 8 inches of white and light green parts to each. Roughly chop enough tough green parts to make a handful, then trim off and discard the rest. Cut the white and light green leeks crosswise into 1-inch-thick rounds and rinse thoroughly to remove any dirt on them. Place the leek rounds and olive oil in a bowl, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss gently to coat. Arrange the rounds on a rimmed baking sheet flat-side down so they form a \\bed\\ for the chicken. Stuff the chopped greens inside the chicken along with the garlic. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and place the chicken on the bed of leeks.<br> Bake the chicken for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees F and continue baking until the chicken is golden brown, the skin is crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh reads 160 degrees F, about 1 hour. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and cut into serving pieces. Scrape the leeks and pan juices into a bowl and toss together until evenly coated. Transfer the leeks to a serving platter and arrange the chicken on top of the vegetables. Spoon any pan juices over the chicken and sprinkle with the parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 71825,&quot;Les Oeufs Jeannette 6 jumbo eggs (preferably organic) 1 teaspoon chopped garlic cloves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 2 to 3 tablespoons whole milk 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (preferably peanut oil) 2 to 3 tablespoons leftover egg stuffing (from above) 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard 1 tablespoon water Dash salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To make the Eggs: Put the eggs in a small saucepan, and cover with boiling water. Bring to a very gentle boil, and let boil for 9 to 10 minutes. Drain off the water, and shake the eggs in a saucepan to crack the shells. (This will help in their removal later on.) Fill the saucepan with cold water and ice, and let the eggs cool for 15 minutes. Shell the eggs under cold running water, and split them lengthwise. Remove the yolks carefully, put them in a bowl, and add the garlic, parsley, milk, salt, and pepper. Crush with a fork to create a coarse paste. Spoon the mixture back into the hollows of the egg whites, reserving 2 to 3 teaspoons of the filling to use in the dressing. Heat the vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet, and place the eggs, stuffed side down, in the skillet. Cook over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until the eggs are beautifully browned on the stuffed side. Remove and arrange, stuffed side up, on a platter. To make the Dressing: Mix all of the dressing ingredients in a small bowl with a whisk or a spoon until well combined. Coat the warm eggs with the dressing, and serve lukewarm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 71826,&quot;Asian Grilled Salmon 1 side fresh salmon, boned but skin on (about 3 pounds) 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 3 tablespoons good soy sauce 6 tablespoons good olive oil 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic Instructions: Light charcoal briquettes in a grill and brush the grilling rack with oil to keep the salmon from sticking. While the grill is heating, lay the salmon skin side down on a cutting board and cut it crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Whisk together the mustard, soy sauce, olive oil, and garlic in a small bowl. Drizzle half of the marinade onto the salmon and allow it to sit for 10 minutes. Place the salmon skin side down on the hot grill; discard the marinade the fish was sitting in. Grill for 4 to 5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. Turn carefully with a wide spatula and grill for another 4 to 5 minutes. The salmon will be slightly raw in the center, but don&#39;t worry; it will keep cooking as it sits. Transfer the fish to a flat plate, skin side down, and spoon the reserved marinade on top. Allow the fish to rest for 10 minutes. Remove the skin and serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 71827,&quot;Zucchini Fry Nachos Nonstick cooking spray 1/2 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt 3 large eggs, beaten 2 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs (See Cook&#39;s Note) 1 pound zucchini (2 to 3 small to medium zucchini), cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds 1 1/2 cups shredded Mexican-blend cheese (about 4.5 ounces) 1/4 cup sliced pickled jalapenos 1/2 cup sour cream 1 cup pico de gallo or salsa 1 small avocado, diced 1 radish, thinly sliced A small handful cilantro leaves and tender stems<br> A small handful cilantro leaves and tender stems 1 lime, quartered Instructions: Adjust 2 oven racks to the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F. Put the wire racks in the baking sheets and coat each generously with cooking spray. Combine the flour and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large re-sealable plastic bag. Combine the eggs and 3/4 teaspoon salt in another large plastic bag; combine the breadcrumbs and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a third large plastic bag. Add about a half of the zucchini rounds to the flour, and use a combination of your hands and shaking the bag to coat the zucchini. Remove the zucchini and shake off any excess flour. Transfer to the egg wash and repeat until coated. (It&#39;s less messy if you use only one hand for the dry ingredients and the other for the wet.) Let any excess egg drip off before transferring to the breadcrumb mixture; repeat until fully coated (you&#39;ll still see some green and white of the zucchini peeking through the breading). Transfer to the prepared baking sheets and coat the breaded zucchini generously with cooking spray (there&#39;s no need to turn them). Repeat with the remaining zucchini. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom about halfway through, until golden brown and tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Lower the oven to 350 degrees F and let the baking sheet cool for a few minutes. Remove the rack from one of the baking sheets and line the baking sheet with foil. Slide the baked zucchini onto the baking sheet and scatter the cheese and jalapenos on top. Bake until the cheese melts, about 10 minutes. Thin the sour cream out with a little water, until it&#39;s pourable, and drizzle over the nachos. Then garnish with the pico de gallo, avocado, radish and cilantro. Serve with lime on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 71828,&quot;QA V1.0.113 2 honey hams 3 hot dogs 4 buns 1 turkey Instructions: kill skin pluck boil &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Wine]&quot; 71829,&quot;Ceviche About 1 (2-ounce) fresh piece octopus, diced into small pieces About 1 (2-ounce) fresh piece sole, diced into small pieces 1/2 onion, diced 1 Peruvian aji pepper, julienned Dash sea salt Dash freshly ground black pepper 1 cup Peruvian lime juice Instructions: Place the fish pieces into a medium bowl.

Cool slightly and mix in all the remaining ingredients. Set aside. Dough: Place the flour in a bowl large enough to mix the dough. Add salt and mix to combine. Make a well in the center of the flour to hold eggs. Add eggs, and with a fork, whip the eggs and slowly incorporate flour. When dough begins to form, work it together with your hands. Kneed dough until it is smooth. Let dough rest for about 10 minutes and then roll it out to the second thinnest setting on a pasta machine. Lay the pasta out flat and spoon a small amount of filling down the center of the pasta, about 1/2-inch apart. Lay another piece of pasta on top and press down to seal in the filling. Cut into individual ravioli and press the edges with the tines of a fork to seal. Bring a large pot of boiling, salted water to a boil. Boil the ravioli until they float, about 3 minutes. Drain the ravioli well. Add the blanched ravioli to the Rosemary Cream Sauce and cook until smooth and velvety. Garnish with shaved Montasio cheese and a sprig of rosemary, if desired. In a large skillet, saute the rosemary in butter until fragrant. Add cream and stock and bring to a simmer; heat through and let the flavors infuse. Add blanched ravioli and cook until smooth and velvety. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 71833,&quot;Marinated Tuna 1/4 cup picholine olive brine 1/3 cup freshly squeezed Meyer lemon juice 1 pound sushi-quality yellow fin tuna, thinly sliced across the grain 3 ounces (about 18) picholine olives, pitted and slivered Freshly ground black pepper 1 bulb fennel, thinly sliced 2 Meyer lemons, zested Instructions: In a glass baking dish or a wide, shallow, nonreactive bowl, mix together olive brine and lemon juice. Gently toss in tuna slices and olive slivers. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, occasionally moving tuna slices around gently in marinade to ensure that slices cure evenly. Just before serving, strain the tuna slices from marinade. Divide tuna between 4 to 6 appetizer plates. Spoon a little marinade (with olive slivers) over the tuna. Grind black pepper, to taste, over each serving. Garnish with fennel and lemon zest, and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 71834,&quot;Brissin Clam Fritters 1 tablespoon canola oil 6 sprigs fresh thyme 1/2 whole jalapeno, seeds removed and roughly chopped 6 cloves garlic, smashed 1 lemon, quartered lengthwise 1/2 cup white wine 1/2 teaspoon red cl flakes 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 pounds local littleneck or steamer clams, scrubbed, or 2 (15-ounce) cans baby clams 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/4-inch diced 1/4 cup finely chopped onion 1 teaspoon minced jalapeno 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons minced Italian parsley, divided 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup cornmeal 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 cup room temperature beer, such as pale ale 2 egg yolks 1/2 to 1 cup reserved clam broth 1 1/2 cups canola oil Lemon wedges, for garnish Fritter Dipper Sauce, for serving, recipe follows 1 egg yolk 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon capers 1/2 lemon, zested 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh Italian parsley Instructions: For the clams: In a large pot over high heat, add the oil and when hot, add the thyme, jalapeno, garlic, and lemon. Cook for 1 minute, and then add the white wine, red cl flakes, and butter. Bring this mixture to a boil and then add the clams. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low and steam for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the clams and strain over a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid. When clams are cool enough to handle, remove from their shells and chop. Guy&#39;s tip: If using canned baby clams, build the clam liquid the same as above and then add the baby clams and 1/3 cup of the can liquid into the broth, turn off heat and let sit 15 minutes. No need to chop these! For the fritter batter: In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, add the butter and, when melted, add the red bell pepper, onions, and jalapenos. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes, and then add the garlic and 1 tablespoon of the parsley and cook for 1 minute more. Remove to a plate to cool. In a large bowl, add the flour, cornmeal, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and baking powder. Mix well. Make a well in the center and add the beer and the egg yolks, and fold together with a rubber spatula until well combined. Add in the cooled vegetable mixture, the chopped clams, and 1/2 cup to 1 cup of the reserved, strained cooking broth. You are looking for the consistency of pancake batter. In a large skillet over high heat, add the canola oil and when hot (200 degrees F) add the fritter batter in 1/3 cup amounts, careful not to crowd. Be cautious, these pop sometimes, splattering hot oil. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, gently turn over and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate, sprinkle with reserved salt and repeat. Can be held warm in a 275 degrees F oven for 15 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges, the remaining 1 tablespoon minced parsley, and the Fritter Dipper Sauce. In the small bowl of a food processor fitted with the bottom blade, add the egg yolk, vinegar, horseradish, and salt and pulse to combine. With the motor running, very slowly add in the olive oil in a fine stream. Once mayonnaise is created, add the remaining ingredients, and adjust seasoning if needed. Guy&#39;s Tip: If you have time, cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes allow flavors to marry. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 71835,&quot;White Peppermint Snowballs 1 package (18-ounce) refrigerated sugar cookie dough, room temperature (recommended: Pillsbury) 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract (recommended: McCormick) 1/3 cup crushed peppermint candies, plus more for garnishing 1 cup powdered sugar, divided 1 package (18-ounce) refrigerated sugar cookie dough, room temperature (recommended: Pillsbury) 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract (recommended: McCormick) 1/2 teaspoon red food coloring Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the cookie dough into 8 pieces. In bowl of electric mixer, on medium speed thoroughly combine the dough pieces, peppermint extract, 1/3 cup crushed peppermint candies, and 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar. Roll the dough into 1-inch diameter balls. Arrange, 2 inches apart, on parchment lined cookie sheets and bake until set, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly on cooling racks. Add 1/2 cup of the remaining powdered sugar to a small bowl. While the cookies are still warm, roll them in the sugar. Sprinkle with crushed peppermint candies and serve. As the cookies cool, they will flatten slightly. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cut the roll of cookie dough in half. Put the halves in separate large mixing bowls. In 1 bowl, thoroughly mix 1/4 cup of the flour and the peppermint extract into cookie dough. In the second bowl, add the remaining 1/4 cup flour and enough food coloring to make a red dough. Mix well with gloved hands until the color is well blended. Divide the white and red dough into 24 pieces each, (for a total of 48 pieces). Roll each piece into a rope 8 inches long and about 1/4-inch in diameter. To shape candy canes, arrange 1 rope of each color side by side on parchment lined cookie sheets. Gently twist together and shape into a candy cane. Repeat with the remaining pieces, spacing the cookies about 2 inches apart. Bake until edges are very lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest, about 5 minutes, before transferring the cookies to racks. Gently remove them from the cookie sheets with a long metal spatula and cool on cooling racks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 71836,&quot;Eggs in Purgatory With Salami 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cloves garlic, smashed 4 ounces deli-sliced salami, roughly chopped 1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced 1 Italian green frying pepper, thinly sliced 1 small yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 cup tomato puree or marinara sauce 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves 8 large eggs 2 tablespoons grated pecorino romano or parmesan cheese Crusty bread, for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Lightly grease a 7 by 4 by 3-inch loaf pan with oil. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, 1 cup of the evaporated cane juice, the potato starch, arrowroot, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the cinnamon. Add the oil, applesauce, vanilla, and 1 cup of hot water to the dry ingredients. Stir until the batter is smooth. Transfer 1/4 cup of the batter to a small bowl, and add the remaining 1/4 cup of the evaporated cane juice, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, and the remaining hot water. Stir until the mixture is creamy. Pour contents of the medium bowl into the prepared loaf pan. Carefully drizzle the batter from the small bowl down the center of the loaf. To create the swirl, take a teaspoon and, starting from 1 end of the loaf pan, move down the length of the pan as you swirl the spoon up and down through the batter. Sprinkle the top with evaporated cane juice. Put the pan in the oven on the center rack and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the top with a generous amount of oil. Return it to the oven and bake for another 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the crust is crunchy. Let the teacake cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then gently run a knife around the edge of the cake. Cover the top of the pan with a cutting board, and invert the cake onto the board. Carefully lift the pan away and re-invert the Teacake onto another cutting board. Either cut and serve warm, or wait until it is completely cool before storing. Cover the uncut teacake with plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71873,&quot;Baked Eggs and Tomatoes Butter, for ramekins 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 shallot, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 5 plum tomatoes, seeded and roughly chopped 1 tablespoon tomato paste Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chiffonade basil leaves, plus more for garnish 4 eggs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels. Whisk 2 tablespoons salt, the brown sugar, cl powder, 2 teaspoons paprika, the cumin, coriander and onion powder in a small bowl. Spread about one-quarter of the rub inside the cavity of the turkey and spread the rest all over the skin. Set the turkey on a rack in a large roasting pan and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. The next day, let the turkey let sit at room temperature, 30 minutes. Position an oven rack in the lowest position (remove the other racks); preheat to 350 degrees F. Pour or wipe out any juices that have collected in the bottom of the roasting pan. Stuff the turkey cavity with the onion, carrot, celery and thyme sprigs. Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and tuck the wings under the body. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat; whisk in the chopped thyme and the remaining 1 teaspoon paprika. Let cool slightly, then brush all over the turkey. Transfer to the oven and roast 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the Classic Gravy, adding the heavy cream and chipotle and sauce with the stock in step 2. After the turkey has roasted 1 hour, baste it with the drippings. Continue roasting, basting every 30 minutes, until the skin is dark golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 2 more hours. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and let rest 30 minutes before carving; reserve the drippings for the gravy. Stir the vinegar into the finished gravy. Prepare the stock: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the turkey neck and giblets; cook, turning, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, carrot, celery, thyme and bay leaves; stir to coat. Add the wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the broth, reduce the heat to low and simmer about 1 hour. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup; reserve the saucepan. You should have 7 cups stock-if you&#39;re short, add more broth. Melt the remaining 8 tablespoons butter in the reserved saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth and bubbling, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the 7 cups stock; bring to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Set aside until the turkey is done. Pour the turkey pan drippings into a fat separator and let stand until the fat rises to the top. Discard the fat (or drizzle on your stuffing). Whisk the defatted drippings into the gravy; season with salt and pepper. Reheat before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 71877,&quot;BBQ Pork Chislic Sandwich 6 1/4 ounces tomato sauce 1/4 cup orange juice<br> 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons dark molasses<br> 2 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 1 1/4 tablespoons fish sauce<br> 1 1/4 tablespoons stone-ground mustard<br> 1 1/4 tablespoons tamarind concentrate<br> 3/4 tablespoon garlic powder<br> 3/4 tablespoon dry mustard powder<br> 3/4 tablespoon onion powder<br> 3/4 tablespoon coarse black pepper<br> 1/2 tablespoon garlic salt<br> 1/2 tablespoon paprika<br> 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 tablespoon liquid smoke<br> 3/4 cup brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon cornstarch<br> 1 cup honey<br> 1/4 cup unsalted butter<br> 1/2 head green cabbage (approximately 1 pound) 1/4 head red cabbage (approximately 1/4 pound)<br> 1 cup mayonnaise<br> 1/2 cup honey mustard<br> 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon garlic salt<br> 1 teaspoon dried parsley<br> 1 teaspoon white pepper<br> 2 cups soy or canola oil 4 ounces melted butter<br> 2 hoagie buns (sliced in half lengthwise, but not all the way through)<br> 4 slices Swiss cheese<br> 4 ounces fried onions<br> Instructions: For the sweet BBQ sauce: Combine tomato sauce, orange juice, granulated sugar, molasses, Worcestershire, soy sauce, fish sauce, stone-ground mustard, tamarind, garlic powder, mustard powder, onion powder, black pepper, garlic salt, paprika, kosher salt, liquid smoke and 1/2 cup brown sugar in a small stockpot or saucepan and whisk together.

Spray two 8-inch cake pans and a 2-quart (8-inch) metal bowl with cooking spray and coat with flour, tapping out the excess. Line the bottoms of the cake pans with circles of parchment. Toss the chocolate chips with 1 tablespoon of the flour in a small bowl and set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cake mix, eggs, vegetable oil, the remaining flour and 2 cups cold water. Beat on low speed just to combine, then increase the speed to high and beat until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Add red food coloring to deepen the shade from light to dark pink (15 to 20 drops). Stir the flour-coated chocolate chips into the batter. Pour half of the batter into the bowl and divide the remaining batter between the 2 cake pans. Bake all 3 cakes until the cake rounds (not the bowl) are risen and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 23 to 25 minutes. Remove the cake rounds to a cooling rack, reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F and continue to bake the cake in the bowl until it is risen and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes more. Cool the bowl cake on a rack, then unmold all three cakes and remove the parchment from the rounds. With a serrated knife, cut the domed tops from all 3 cakes to flatten them, and dust off any excess crumbs. Remove a heaping 1/4 cup of the frosting to a small bowl and stir in enough red food coloring to approximately match the color of the inside of the cake. Place 1 cake round, cut-side up, on a serving plate. Spread a very thin layer of red frosting on the layer. You do not want the layer to be visible when you cut the cake, it is just to glue the layers together. Top with the second cake round, cut-side down. Spread with another very thin layer of red frosting. Top with the domed cake. Frost the entire cake with a layer of white frosting about 1/4 inch thick to make the watermelon \\rind.\\ Let the frosting dry and harden in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes Meanwhile, put the remaining frosting in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add green food coloring, about 15 drops to start, to make a medium-pale green color several shades lighter than your fruit candy. Smooth the green frosting over the white layer, taking care not to combine the two colors. Drape the green fruit candy over the cake, cutting to fit as necessary, starting in the center like spokes in a wheel to make the lines on the watermelon.

Drain beans and rinse well. In a large stockpot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and saute for 5 to 6 minutes, or until browned. Remove the sausage from the skillet and reserve. Add the onions and cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, an additional minute. Add the browned sausage back to the stockpot. Stir in the beans, bay leaves, and thyme. Add the chicken stock, water, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat to a simmer and cook, partially covered for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Skim off any fat, as necessary, if desired. (The cook time may vary depending on the beans, but they should be tender and falling apart when finished.) Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper, if needed. Using a potato masher or the flat side of a spoon, gently mash the beans against the bottom and sides of the stockpot, leaving some of the beans whole and some mashed. Continue to simmer the soup for 30 minutes, uncovered, or until desired consistency. Ladle the soup into bowls.

Grease paper and set sheet aside. Reserve any remaining melted butter for later. Line two more shallow baking sheets or trays with waxed paper for holding and chilling assembled candy and set them aside. Cut each stick of butter in half and place next to work surface, along with measured salt, baking soda, vanilla and coarsely chopped macadamia nuts. Place chopped chocolate in a heat proof bowl and set aside. Place a cup of hot water next to stove and put a pastry brush in water.<br> To prepare toffee: Place a 2 1/2 quart heavy bottomed saucepan on the stove. Place water, sugar and corn syrup in the pan and stir gently to combine. Place pan over medium heat and as sugar dissolves, swirl pan gently. Let mixture come to a rolling boil and, once boiling and mixture is clear, don&#39;t stir or swirl pan anymore. If, while sugar is boiling, any sugar crystals cling to sides of pan, use moistened pastry brush to wash sides of the pan. Cook syrup until starts becoming a very light amber color. Lower heat and add butter, one half stick at a time, stirring very gently. (Only add additional butter after preceding piece has become melted and fully incorporated.) Once all the butter has been added, place candy thermometer into mixture, making sure that the bottom tip does not touch the bottom of the pan. Raise heat to medium and boil mixture until the temperature reads between 295 degrees F and 300 degrees F. Remove thermometer from pan and pan from stove and immediately stir in salt, baking soda, vanilla and macadamia nuts. (Quickly stick thermometer it warm water to aid in clean up.) Immediately, pour candy mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Brush the bottom of a long offset metal spatula (an icing spatula is perfect) or a knife with some melted butter. Spread the candy mixture out so that it is 1/4-inch thick. Use the knife to push the sides back into a rectangular shape as the mixture cools. Let the mixture set for a few minutes.<br> To melt chocolate: While toffee firms up a bit, melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a skillet with 1 inch of hot but not simmering water (stirring constantly until smooth). Be careful not to allow any water to enter bowl of chocolate.<br> To cut candy: While candy mixture is still warm and pliable, use a buttered pastry scraper to score the candy into 1 1/2 by 2inch rectangles. Let set further until the candy is firmer (5 minutes at room temperature). Score again through original cuts, making sure candy is in separate squares all the way through to the bottom. ( If stubborn, use your pastry scraper and mallet to knock through any sticky, tough spots. Hit the top (wooden part) of the scraper with a heavy mallet.)<br> To fully assemble candy and chill: When chocolate is firm, pour melted chocolate over top of scored candy and, using a spatula, spread it out evenly. It&#39;s okay if the chocolate runs down into grooves in candy. Scatter 2 cups of the ground toasted nuts on top of the chocolate and press them into the chocolate. Reserve the remaining 1 cup of nuts. Lift one end of the parchment paper so the first line of cut candy bends and separates from the next line. Carefully lift one piece off at a time. Sprinkle with some additional nuts to coat any exposed chocolate. Place candy on prepared baking sheets lined with waxed paper (in a single layer) and refrigerate (covered with plastic wrap) so chocolate will harden. Once set, place candy in an airtight tin, separated in layers with waxed paper. Although these candies may be stored at room temperature, to best preserve fresh flavor, store them in the refrigerator &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 71898,&quot;Pineapple Cheesecake Bar 1 1/3 cups all-purpose bleached flour 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick softened) 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup powdered sugar 1 large egg 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 cup crushed pineapple or 1 (8-ounce) can, drained 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup white chocolate chips 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Use a sharp knife to remove all of the rind and pith, trying not to cut into the fruit itself. You should be able to see the segments and the pith separating them. Working over a bowl to collect the juice, use the knife to cut the segments away from the membrane; reserve the segments. Squeeze the leftover membrane into the bowl to collect any juice from the remaining fruit still attached. Reserve the juice for the drizzle. For the cranberry concord drizzle: Whisk 3 tablespoons of the collected orange juice in a separate bowl with the olive oil, Cranberry Concord Syrup, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper (reserve any remaining orange juice for another use). Put the lettuce in a large, wide bowl and put the orange segments on top. Drizzle with the cranberry concord drizzle and serve. Combine the cranberries, grape jam, grape juice, sugar and orange zest in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries are very soft and easily break apart when pushed with a wooden spoon, about 20 minutes. Do not simmer too hard or the sauce may boil over.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the bottom of an 8-by-12 inch metal baking pan and line the bottom with parchment. Then grease and flour the bottom and sides of the pan. Set aside. For the cake: sift together the flour and baking powder. Add the salt and stir to combine. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add 1 cup of butter and sugar and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, as needed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating on medium speed and scraping down the sides of the bowl between additions. Add the vanilla and almond extracts and beat to combine. On low speed, mix in half of the flour mixture, then mix in the milk. Mix in remaining flour mixture until just combined. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake until a tester comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool slightly, then unmold and cool completely. To make the cake filling, using a serrated knife, cut the cake into an 8x8-inch square. Set aside. Crumble the portion of the cake that was removed and reserve 2 1/2 cups. Add the remainder of the cake crumbs to a large mixing bowl along with the remaining 1/4 cup melted butter, jam and almonds. Mix well (your hands are the best tool here) to make a spreadable filling. To assemble the cake, use a serrated knife to split the cake crosswise into 2 halves. Arrange both halves so they\\u2019re facing cut-side up. Brush the cake with about 2/3 of the cooled almond syrup. With a small offset spatula, gently spread the jammy filling over the entire bottom half of the cake and top with the top half of the cake, cut side down. Press gently to adhere. Flip the cake so the flat bottom is now facing up, to create a flat top. Freeze the cake until firm, 1 hour. With a serrated knife, cut off the rough sides on the frozen cake and cut into 16 squares. Set the cake on a cooling rack over a parchment-lined baking sheet. Coat the cakes 1 at a time by pouring the icing around the edges and letting it drip down to coat the sides, then fill in the top. (Set the bowl over hot water and stir if it begins to thicken before you are done.) Top with sprinkles or non pareils before the icing begins to set. Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan over low heat and cook to dissolve the sugar, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the almond extract and stir to combine. Cool completely. Melt the chocolate chips or candy melts in a double boiler and stir until smooth. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the confectioner\\u2019s sugar, corn syrup, hot water and vanilla. Mix on low speed until smooth. Add the melted chocolate and continue to mix to make a very smooth, pourable icing, about the consistency of molasses.

Add the ice water 1 tablespoon at a time and pulse until the dough just begins to clump together against the walls of the processor. Dump the dough out onto a work surface and press together to make a cohesive ball, kneading once or twice if it is falling apart. Divide the dough in half, wrap 1 portion in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour before rolling out. (This recipe makes a double portion of dough; if you are only using 1 portion, wrap the other half in 2 layers of plastic wrap, place in a resealable plastic bag and freeze for another use.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On a well-floured surface and using a well-floured rolling pin, roll out the pie dough into a 9- to 10-inch round. Lightly flour the pin as needed to prevent sticking; if the dough tends to stay sticky while rolling, refrigerate it until firm and begin again. Use a large flat spatula or bench scraper to transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie plate and press into shape using a fork. Place a sheet of parchment paper or foil into the pie shell and fill with pie weights, uncooked rice or dried beans. Bake until the edges are lightly golden, about 25 minutes. Remove the pie crust but keep the oven on. For the quiche: While the crust is baking, heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until well browned and cooked through, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Then add in the mixed veggies to cook out any excess water and wilt the spinach leaves. Remove from the heat. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, cream, parsley, thyme, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a large bowl and lightly whisk. Sprinkle half of the Gruyere, Cheddar and Parmigiano-Reggiano on the crust, followed by the veggie mixture and then the remaining cheese.

Once the roux reaches the desired color, add the onions, celery and peppers and cook, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and bay leaves, and cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the beer, stirring to scrape any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet. Transfer the roux mixture to a large Dutch oven or stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the Chicken Stock, salt, black pepper and cayenne, and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the gumbo for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the gumbo is simmering, slice the sausage lengthwise and then make crosswise cuts, forming 1/2-inch-thick half-moons. Place the sausage in a large skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sausage is rendered and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a paper-towel-lined plate and pat dry. Add the cooked sausage, okra and tomatoes to the gumbo and simmer an additional 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chicken and cook an additional 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt or pepper if needed. Just before serving, remove and discard the bay leaves and stir in the green onions. Ladle the gumbo into warmed soup bowls and top with cooked rice. Serve hot. For the whole chicken: Rinse the chicken under cold running water and pat dry. Place the chicken in a large stockpot or Dutch oven and add 5 quarts cold water, the carrots, celery, onions, garlic, salt, thyme and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 45 to 50 minutes, skimming off any foam that rises to the top. Remove the whole chicken from the water mixture and set aside to cool slightly. Continue to simmer the broth mixture for an additional 30 minutes, skimming occasionally. Strain the broth through a fine-meshed sieve or strainer and discard the solids. The stock can be used immediately or chilled and kept refrigerated for up to three days or frozen for up to one month. The meat can be pulled off of the whole chicken and reserved for another use. For the chicken bones: Rinse the bones under cold running water and drain. Place the bones in a large stockpot or Dutch oven and add 5 quarts cold water, the carrots, celery, onions, garlic, salt, thyme and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, skimming off any foam that rises to the top. Strain the broth through a fine-meshed sieve or strainer and discard the bones and vegetables. The stock can be used immediately or chilled and kept refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month. Makes about 5 quarts. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 71908,&quot;Roasted Shrimp Tossed with Parsley Pesto 1 bunch parsley leaves 3 garlic cloves 1/4 cup pine nuts 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano 3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: 1 1/2 pounds shrimp, roasted using your favorite method, and allowed to cool to room temperature Combine all the ingredients except for the oil and shrimp in a food processor.

Discard the pulp and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add 4 cloves garlic, the onion, red pepper and black pepper. Saute until the onion is soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add juiced tomatoes, red wine, Parmesan and salt. Add the tomato paste and the water and stir together over medium heat. *Cook&#39;s Note: Tomato paste should be added after making meatballs and ribs. Put the ground meat in a mixing bowl. Beat the eggs and add them to the meat along with 6 cloves garlic, the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, Parmesan and milk. Mix this all together with your hands. Wet your hands with water and continue to wet them as you pinch meat from the bowl and roll into 2-inch balls. Roll the balls in the flour. Heat 1/2-cup of oil in a large skillet. Add 3 cloves chopped garlic and saute until golden brown. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the meatballs and saute over medium-high heat, turning them until they are brown all over. *Cook&#39;s Note: As soon as you can pick them up with a fork, they are ready. You don&#39;t want them to be well done. If the meatball slides off the fork when you pick it up, it needs to cook a little longer. Cut the ribs apart and remove the membrane. Saute them in 1/2-cup oil until very brown and remove. Return the garlic to the oil and add tomato paste (for the sauce) to the pan; Cook, stirring, over medium heat for about 3 minutes until it softens. Remove from the heat and add to the sauce. Add the meatballs and spareribs to the sauce. Bring to an easy boil, then simmer over low heat for 2 hours. Add the basil and simmer for 15 minutes more. The spareribs should be very tender, falling off the bone and the meatballs should float in the sauce &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Dolcetto, Montepulciano]&quot; 71910,&quot;Neely&#39;s Sauteed Spinach 3 slices bacon, roughly chopped 3 garlic cloves, sliced 2 bunches spinach, well washed and tough stems discarded 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat a medium skillet over medium high heat.

For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Toss the Brussels sprouts with the butter, oil, 2 teaspoons salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl. Layer the bacon in a 24-by-12-inch grill basket in a single layer and top with the Brussels sprouts. Close the grill basket and place it on the grill over indirect heat Brussels sprouts-side down. Cover the grill and cook until the Brussels sprouts are tender and dark golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Open the grill, flip the basket so the bacon is down and move the basket to direct heat. Cook until the bacon is crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. If you want your Brussels sprouts darker, flip again and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Carefully remove the Brussels sprouts to a serving platter, crumble the bacon over the top and sprinkle with the lemon zest.

Set aside. Fill a saucepan about a third of the way with water, then bring to a simmer. Chop the chocolate with a cook&#39;s knife. Put the chocolate in a medium-large heatproof bowl, and place over the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. Set the chocolate aside. Keep the pot of water hot, but not boiling. In a small bowl, stir the espresso powder into the rum or water, to dissolve. Put the egg, yolks, and pinch of salt in heatproof bowl. With a hand-held electric mixer whip the eggs until light, about 1 minute. Slowly add the sugar to the eggs, while continuing to beat. Add the rum mixture. Set the bowl of eggs over the simmering water, increase the heat to bring the water to a rapid simmer. Whisk the egg mixture constantly over the heat, until pale yellow, very fluffy, and hot to the touch, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whip until cool and thick, and the mixture folds over on itself or \\holds a ribbon. Whisk about a quarter of the egg foam into the chocolate to lighten. With the whisk, briskly fold in the remaining foam, (the mixture may get very thick). Whisk in the whipped cream, taking care to keep the mixture light.

Squeeze out the excess water, and place the bread, vinegar and garlic in a food processor; puree until smooth. With the machine running, drizzle in the olive oil, and process until combined. Add the chives and parsley, and pulse a few more times to combine. Season with salt and more vinegar, if you like (I like a very bright, acidic dipping sauce). Transfer the sauce to a serving bowl. For the Parmigiano-crusted cauliflower: Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Fill a large bowl of well-salted water with ice. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Toss the cauliflower in the boiling water. When the water returns to a boil, cook the cauliflower for another 2 minutes, then drain and immediately plunge the cauliflower into the ice water. When the cauliflower is cool, drain well and lay it out to dry on the prepared baking sheet. In a large saucepan, pour enough oil to fill the pan to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2 inches. Heat over medium-high heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees F. To see if it&#39;s hot enough, drop some flour into the oil--if it sizzles and floats quickly, you&#39;re good to go; if the flour burns or the oil begins to smoke, it&#39;s too hot, so reduce the heat. Place the flour in one bowl, the eggs beaten with 2 tablespoons water in a second bowl, and the breadcrumbs and Parmigiano in a third. Place a couple of layers of paper towels on a baking sheet next to the stovetop. Dredge some of the blanched cauliflower in the flour and shake off the excess, then dip it in the egg mixture, and finally in the breadcrumb mixture. Repeat for the remaining cauliflower. Working in batches so you don&#39;t overcrowd the pan, fry the cauliflower until brown and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the cauliflower to the paper towels, sprinkle with salt, and serve hot, hot and hot with the agliata sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 71928,&quot;Chickpea Stew 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 cups chopped onion 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons toasted cumin seed, ground 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled 1 (16-ounce) can tomatoes, including liquid, chopped 3 cups beef stock or broth 1 cinnamon stick 3 carrots, cut diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices 3 cups blanched broccoli florets 2 medium yellow squash, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 (10 1/2-ounce) can chickpeas, drained 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger Instructions: In a casserole heat the oil over moderate heat until hot.

To prepare your crabs humanely, place them in the freezer for 1 hour to put them to sleep. For the Sate Sauce: Pour the vegetable oil in a wok and bring to medium heat, fry the garlic and spring onions until fragrant. Now add the crab meat, shrimp, sugar, salt, oyster sauce, and fish sauce. Stir to incorporate, and then reduce the heat to a low simmer for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. Lastly add the cl oil, stir and simmer for another 5 minutes. Cooks Note: Use this sate sauce as a dipping sauce for noodle soups or add to stir-frys. Refrigerate the extra sauce in an airtight container. For the crab: Remove the upper shell of the crab, pick off the gills, which look like little fingers, and discard them. Clean the crab under running water and drain. Place the crab on its stomach and chop the crab in half with a heavy cleaver. Now chop each half into 4 pieces, chopping each piece after each leg. With the back of the cleaver gently crack each claw this makes it easier to extract the meat. Heat the oil in a wok to 400 degrees F, or until a cube of bread dropped into the oil browns in 5 seconds. Dust the crab pieces with potato starch, shaking off the excess. Deep-fry the crab in batches for 3 minutes, turning over once, until golden brown. Remove the crab pieces from the wok and drain on kitchen paper towels. Carefully, remove the oil from the wok, reserving 2 tablespoons, and clean the wok. Heat the reserved oil in the wok, then add the shallots and garlic and fry until fragrant. Now add the sate sauce and stir for 1 minute. Add the crab, spring onions, and chiles and toss, making sure to coat the crab well. Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl and garnish with red cl.

In large, heavy-bottomed deep skillet over medium-high heat, add the grapeseed oil. When the oil is super hot and glistening, sear the pork chops, without moving, until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Pull out the chops and set aside on a plate. Work in batches of 2 chops at a time to ensure they form a nice crust. Turn the heat down to medium and add the onions and garlic to the pan. Season again with salt and pepper and sweat the vegetables, 8 to 10 minutes. Deglaze with the apple cider and hard cider, scraping the tasty bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the pork chops back to the pan along with any juices that have accumulated on the plate. Add the thyme and cloves. Cover and bring to a simmer. Cook until the meat falls from the bone, about 1 1/2 hours. While the pork is cooking, work on the slaw: Whisk together the mayonnaise, cider vinegar, agave nectar, celery seed and Dijon mustard until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture over the coleslaw and apples and mix well. And more agave nectar if you prefer a sweeter slaw, or more vinegar if you prefer a tangier slaw. To build the sandwich: Cut the pork away from the bone and butterfly the meat. Place on the bottom bun and top with the apple slaw and pickles. Spread some gorgonzola on the top bun and close the sandwich. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Stir everything round and add the onions, shallots and leeks. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place a lid on the pan, leaving it slightly ajar, and cook slowly for 50 minutes, without coloring the vegetables too much. Remove the lid for the last 20 minutes, the onions will become soft and golden. Stir occasionally so that nothing catches on the bottom. Having the patience to cook the onions slowly, slowly, gives you an incredible sweetness and an awesome flavor, so don&#39;t be tempted to speed this up. When your onions and leeks are lovely and silky, add the stock. Bring to the boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. You can skim any fat off the surface if you like, but I prefer to leave it because it adds good flavor. Preheat the oven or broiler to maximum. Toast your bread on both sides. Correct the seasoning of the soup. When it&#39;s perfect, ladle it into individual heatproof serving bowls and place them on a baking sheet. Tear toasted bread over each bowl to t like a lid. Feel free to push and dunk the bread into the soup a bit. Sprinkle with some grated Cheddar and drizzle over a little Worcestershire sauce. Dress your reserved sage leaves with some olive oil and place 1 on top of each slice of bread. Put the baking sheet into the preheated oven or under the broiler to melt the cheese until bubbling and golden. Keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn&#39;t burn! When the cheese is bubbling, very carefully lift out the baking sheet and carry it to the table.

Mix the ingredients together in a bowl with a wooden spoon in order until the batter is smooth. Using 2 teaspoons, scoop a spoonful of batter then push it off into the hot oil with the other spoon. They will sink then float to the top of the oil. Turn them occasionally to fry evenly on all sides. Drain on paper towels and then dip in powdered sugar or roll at the table in cinnamon sugar. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 71981,&quot;Super-Layered Biscuits 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook\\u2019s Note), plus more for dusting 4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 tablespoon sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 20 tablespoons (2 1/2 sticks) frozen unsalted butter, plus melted butter, for brushing, optional 1 1/2 cups cold low-fat buttermilk, plus more for brushing Line a baking sheet with parchment. Instructions: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt and baking soda in a large bowl. Grate the butter using the large holes of a box grater and add to the flour mixture. Quickly toss the butter with the flour mixture by hand until the butter is evenly distributed and coated with flour. Slowly drizzle the buttermilk over the flour mixture, using a fork to incorporate, until the mixture comes together in a shaggy dough. (There may be some dry bits remaining; don\\u2019t overmix.) Turn the dough out onto a cutting board or work surface (the dough does not need to be floured at this point or for the first round of layers). Pat the dough into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle, about 12 inches by 8 inches, using a bench scraper, bowl scraper or ruler to keep the edges straight. Cut the dough into 6 even pieces using a sharp knife and stack the pieces on top of each other, making sure to line up the edges. If any large bits of dough come off, gently press them back while taking care to maintain the shape and even thickness. Any small bits of dough that fall off can be tucked away between the stacked pieces. This creates the first set of layers. The dough may seem like it&#39;s not hydrated enough, but it will come together. Lightly dust the work surface and stack of dough with flour. Use a rolling pin to press the stack down and roll out back to a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle, about 12 inches by 8 inches, making sure the layers of dough stay lined up and even with one another (see Cook&#39;s Note). Dust the surface of the dough once more lightly with flour. This helps to provide definition between the layers. Cut the dough once more into 6 even pieces and stack them on top of each other to create a second set of layers. Repeat dusting, pressing down, rolling out, dusting, cutting and stacking one more time, dusting the work surface with flour as needed, to create a third set of layers, 18 layers total. Roll out the stack of dough to a thickness of about 1 1/2 inches. Cut out 9 biscuits with a floured 2 1/4-inch round cutter and place on the prepared baking sheet. Do not twist the cutter or it will seal the sides and prevent the layers from rising. Press together the remaining scraps of dough and cut out 3 more biscuits. Transfer the rest of the biscuits to the prepared baking sheet and transfer the baking sheet to the freezer while the oven preheats and until the biscuits are thoroughly chilled, 10 to 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Brush the biscuit tops with buttermilk, taking care to keep the sides dry. Bake until the tops and bottoms of the biscuits are golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Brush the warm biscuits with melted butter as desired and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 71982,&quot;Zucchini and White Bean Fritters 2 zucchini 1 carrot Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup cannellini beans, drained and rinsed 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 1 teaspoon lemon zest, plus lemon wedges, for serving Cornmeal, for coating 1/2 cup vegetable oil Instructions: Grate the zucchini and carrot on the large holes of a box grater in a colander set over a bowl. Sprinkle with salt and let stand 15 minutes. Squeeze the excess liquid from the vegetables. Put the beans in a medium bowl and mash with a fork. Stir in the zucchini mixture, parsley, lemon zest, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Form into 12 patties, each about 2 inches in diameter. Spread the cornmeal in a shallow dish and coat each patty with the cornmeal. Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches and adding the remaining 1/4 cup oil as needed, cook the fritters until crisp and golden on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt. Serve with lemon wedges on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner, Albari?o]&quot; 71983,&quot;Quinoa with Roasted Squash and Pistachios 3 cups chopped unpeeled acorn squash 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped, plus more for serving 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup shelled pistachios 1 1/2 cups quinoa, rinsed and drained 1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Toss the squash on the baking sheet with the thyme, 3 tablespoons of the oil, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper until the squash is well coated. Roast until very tender, about 30 minutes, stirring halfway through the cooking time. Meanwhile, put the pistachios on a small baking sheet and toast until fragrant, about 5 minutes; set aside to cool. Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan and stir in the quinoa. Simmer, uncovered, until the quinoa is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain the quinoa and transfer to a medium bowl. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the toasted pistachios, roasted squash and vinegar, toss well and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper. Sprinkle with thyme leaves. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 71984,&quot;Stonefruit and Mint Julep 1/2 cup water 1 cup sugar, plus more for garnish 2 cups mint leaves, plus 1 bunch 2 bottles Southern whiskey 2 cups stonefruit puree (peach, nectarine, apricot, plum, etc.) Lime wedges Mint or lavender sprigs, for garnish Instructions: To make a mint-flavored simple syrup, begin by boiling the water and sugar with 2 cups of roughly torn and bruised mint in large sauce pot. Boil just until the sugar dissolves completely. Cool and strain the mint out of mixture. Add 2 bottles of whiskey and fruit puree to the infusion. Pour the mixture into a large bottle or pitcher.

Butter a nonstick regular size muffin tin with 12 muffin cups or 2 (6-muffin) cups. For the polenta: In a medium-sized stock pot over medium heat, bring the milk and stock to a bubble. While the liquids are heating up place a small skillet over medium-high heat with 1 turn of the pan of olive oil, about 1 tablespoon. Add the chorizo and cook until crispy 2 to 3 minutes. Once the liquids come up to a bubble slowly whisk in the polenta and continue whisking until it begins to thicken and resemble hot oatmeal about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and add in the cheese, chopped parsley, 2 tablespoons butter and crispy chorizo. Pour the polenta into the muffin tins, 1/2 of the way up the muffin cup. Once all the cups are filled, form a well with the back of a spoon by pushing the polenta up the side until it reaches the top rim of the muffin tin. The well will be relatively large but that&#39;s ok, you want the egg to have a little nesting place so it won&#39;t overflow out of the tin. Once you have made all the wells, crack an egg into each of the polenta filled cups. Season the tops of the eggs with some salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20 minutes; yolk will still be a little runny. Once done, remove from the oven and let sit. Run a small butter knife around the edges of the polenta to loosen from the sides of the muffin tin. Gently help them out of the muffin tins with a fork or a knife and serve plated or on a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Barbera, Dolcetto]&quot; 71993,&quot;Ham and Egg Fried Rice 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons canola oil 3 cups cooked long grain rice, cooled 1/2 onion, diced<br> 4 thick slices deli ham, cut into bite-size pieces<br> 3 eggs<br> 1 tablespoon milk<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups baby spinach Instructions: Heat 1/4 cup of the canola oil in a large nonstick saute pan set over medium-high heat.

Liberally spray an 8-ounce coffee mug and 12-inch cast-iron skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Prepare the cake mix in a large bowl according to the package instructions, then add the instant coffee or espresso. Fill the prepared coffee mug halfway with the cake batter. Pour the remaining batter into the prepared skillet. Place in the oven and bake until a skewer or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes for the mug cake and 25 to 30 minutes for the skillet cake. Let cool completely. Remove the mug cake from the mug. Slice off the crowned top. Place the cake back into the mug cut-side down so that the flat bottom is now on the top. If the top of the skillet cake is crowned or domed, slice off the domed part to make a flat and even top. For the mug cake icing and garnish: In a small bowl whisk together the caramel sauce and cream. Pour on top of the mug cake in the mug to give it a coffee-with-cream-like appearance. Line a sheet tray with parchment paper. Transfer the melted white chocolate to a small disposable piping bag. Cut off the tip to create an 1/8-inch opening. Pipe the white chocolate onto the lined sheet tray in three squiggly lines that are joined at the bottom to resemble steam. Repeat with the remaining white chocolate. (You will have extra \\steam\\ garnish in case one breaks.) Place in the refrigerator until firm, about 30 minutes. Use to garnish the coffee mug cake. For the skillet cake icing: Add the cream to a medium pot. Place over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Add the chopped chocolate, butter and corn syrup. Let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk to blend everything together. Add the finely ground chocolate wafers to the chocolate mixture and stir until completely combined. Pour over the skillet cake and smooth with a spatula until it is a nice even layer. Place in the refrigerator to let the icing set for about 30 minutes. For the eggs: Line a sheet tray with plastic wrap or parchment paper and spray with cooking spray. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the gelatin and 1 tablespoon water and mix to combine to bloom the gelatin. In a small pot, combine the cream, milk, granulated sugar and salt. Place over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer, stirring to help the sugar dissolve. Remove from the heat and whisk in the bloomed gelatin, stirring until dissolved. Transfer to a measuring cup. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until the mixture cools and starts to thicken. (You can place the measuring cup in a bowl of cold water to help it thicken quickly; you want it to be the consistency of thick pancake batter.) If the mixture gets too thick, place it in a bowl of warm water or microwave it for about 5 seconds. Remove the chilled sheet tray from the freezer. Pour about 1/4 cup of the cream mixture into the prepared frozen sheet tray in an irregular circle to make an \\egg white,\\ making sure to leave room to make three more egg whites. Place one of the canned apricot halves \\egg yolks\\ cut-side down into the center of an egg white. Repeat with the remaining cream mixture and apricot halves. Place in the refrigerator and chill until the whites are set, 30 minutes to 1 hour. To assemble: On one side of the skillet cake, place two \\eggs\\ on top. Place three strips of candied bacon on the other side of the skillet cake. Serve the extra eggs and candied bacon on a plate on the side and with the coffee mug cake garnished with white chocolate steam. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the brown sugar in a plate or sheet pan. Line a baking sheet with a wire rack and spray with cooking spray. Gently press the bacon into the brown sugar until mostly coated.

While the butter melts, slice the banana in half across, then in half lengthwise to create 4 long pieces. Once the butter is melted and foaming, swirl the skillet and place the banana pieces cut-side down in the butter. Saut the bananas, swirling the skillet occasionally, until nicely caramelized on the bottom and the butter smells rich and toasted and is deep golden-brown (see Cook&#39;s Note), 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer the bananas and browned butter to a small bowl and add the cinnamon. Use a fork to mash the banana. Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda together in a medium bowl. Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar to the bowl and use the whisk to break up and incorporate the sugars into the flour. Add the egg, vanilla extract and the banana mixture and use a wooden spoon to stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Add the chocolate chips and then the walnuts if using and stir until just combined. Use a rubber spatula to scrape all the dough into the center of the bowl. Press plastic wrap directly on top of the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours. (The flavors will intensify as the dough chills.) Meanwhile, evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 rimmed baking sheets thoroughly with more butter. Use a large ice cream scoop to scoop 6 mounds of dough (or have each one be 3 tablespoons) onto each prepared baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between each scoop. Bake the cookies, turning the baking sheets halfway through, until the edges are golden brown and the centers are very puffy and slightly domed, 12 to 14 minutes. (The centers will settle as they cool.) Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Store the cookies at room temperature in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72022,&quot;Spicy Sausage Dogs One 12-ounce can lager 1 cup chili sauce, such as Heinz<br> 1/4 cup malt vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 2 teaspoons curry powder<br> 2 teaspoons hot sauce<br> 8 spicy beef or pork sausages<br> 2 white onions, thickly sliced<br> Olive oil, for grilling<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> Pinch of freshly ground black pepper<br> Crusty rolls, for serving<br> Instructions: Preheat a grill pan over medium heat. In a large pot over medium heat, stir together the lager, chili sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, curry powder and hot sauce. Cook until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. While the sauce is reducing, grill the sausages on the grill pan until browned and cooked through, turning every so often, about 12 minutes. Set aside. Brush the onions with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and grill on the same pan you grilled the sausages. Cook until brown and golden, about 10 minutes. Put the grilled sausages in the pot with the sauce, then add the onions. Cook together for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve the sausages on crusty rolls topped with the onions and lots of sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Shiraz, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 72023,&quot;Moroccan Chocolate Mousse 2 cups heavy cream, chilled 1 1/2 teaspoons agave nectar<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/8 teaspoon salt<br> 8 ounces dark chocolate (70% cacao), chopped<br> Instructions: Stir together the heavy cream, agave, cinnamon, cumin and salt in a large bowl. Place the chopped chocolate in the bowl of a double boiler. Set the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water and stir until the chocolate is fully melted, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot and set on a dish towel to dry the bottom of the bowl. Using a hand-held mixer, whip the spiced cream just until it forms soft peaks, 2 to 3 minutes; be careful not to over-whip. Now, using a rubber spatula, quickly and gently fold the melted chocolate into the whipped cream. Serve immediately, or divide the mousse among serving bowls and refrigerate until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Barolo, Pinotage]&quot; 72024,&quot;Italian Easter Pie 3 large eggs 3 tablespoons cold water<br> 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, plus more for the pan 22.5 ounces full-fat ricotta cheese 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 7 large eggs 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 1 pound ground spicy or sweet sausage 8 ounces asparagus, sliced 1/2 inch thick<br> 10 thin slices Genoa salami<br> 10 thin slices capicola<br> 8 thin slices provolone cheese<br> Instructions: For the dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and water; set aside. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour and salt and pulse a couple of times. Add the chilled butter and pulse about 10 times until pea-size pieces remain. Add the egg mixture and pulse 15 to 20 times until a dough ball forms. Place the dough ball on a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 1 minute. Divide into 2 balls, wrap each ball with plastic wrap and rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour. For the filling: While the dough is resting, whisk together the ricotta cheese, salt, some pepper and 6 of the eggs in a medium bowl and set aside. In a 10-inch skillet over medium heat, add the oil and brown the sausage, breaking up the pieces while it&#39;s cooking, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain the sausage on a paper towel-lined plate, leaving behind any fat. Add the asparagus and cook until beginning to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch cake pan with butter. On a well-floured counter, roll out each dough ball into a thin 14-inch circle. Cover one circle with plastic wrap until ready to use. Loosely roll the other dough circle around a rolling pin and unroll over the prepared cake pan, letting the excess hang over the side. Press the dough gently into the sides of the pan so there is no gap between the pan and the dough. Shingle the salami over the bottom of the dough, creating an even layer. Then, add the asparagus in an even layer on top of the salami. Next, add half of the egg mixture and spread it out evenly, then top with the capicola in an even layer. Layer in the sausage and top with the remaining egg mixture, then finally the provolone cheese. Whisk the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the outside rim of the dough with the egg wash. Add the remaining dough circle to the top of the pie and cut off the excess dough. Press both circles together to create a seal. Brush the remaining egg wash over the entire top and slice a couple slits in the top of the pie. Bake until golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Gavi]&quot; 72025,&quot;Curried Mussels with Butternut Squash and Leeks 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 cups cubed peeled butternut squash (about 8 ounces) 2 leeks (white and light green parts only), halved, thickly sliced and well rinsed Kosher salt 1 tablespoon curry powder 1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger 1 teaspoon grated lime zest, plus the juice of 1 lime 1/4 cup heavy cream 4 pounds mussels, scrubbed and debearded 1 cup fresh cilantro 4 thick slices crusty bread, halved Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the squash and leeks and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks start softening, about 3 minutes. Add the curry powder, ginger and lime zest and stir to coat. Reduce the heat to medium low and add 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook until the squash is almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add the heavy cream to the pot, then stir in the mussels. Increase the heat to medium, cover and simmer until the mussels open, 5 to 6 minutes. (Discard any unopened mussels.) Stir in the lime juice and cilantro. Serve with the bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 72026,&quot;S&#39;mores Dip 4 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Kosher salt Heaping cup of mini marshmallows Suggested dippers: graham crackers, pretzels, potato chips Instructions: Combine the chocolate chips, heavy cream, corn syrup, butter and 1/8 teaspoon salt in an 8-inch cast iron skillet (see Cook&#39;s Note). Put over medium heat. Stir periodically as the mixture comes to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 6 minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce is smooth and slightly thickened. Turn down the heat if the sauce comes to a full boil. Remove from the heat and let cool at least 15 minutes. Preheat the broiler. Cover the fudge sauce with a single dense layer of marshmallows. Place under the broiler and broil until the marshmallows are toasty brown, 2 to 3 minutes (watch carefully as they may brown more quickly depending on your broiler.) Serve right away with dippers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 72027,&quot;Bacon-Wrapped Chicken Breasts 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 small yellow onion, minced 2 cloves garlic, minced 6 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 tablespoons finely chopped chives 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Four 6- to 8-ounce boneless skinless chicken breasts 12 slices bacon (not thick-cut) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 30 seconds more. Remove the pan from the heat and add the cream cheese, chives and Worcestershire sauce and stir until evenly combined. Season the filling with salt and pepper. Halve each chicken breast horizontally, leaving it attached at one side so it opens like a book. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper, then divide the filling among the breasts, spreading it evenly on the inside of each. Close the chicken breasts and sprinkle the outsides lightly with salt and pepper. Lay 3 strips of bacon side-by-side on a cutting board and position a chicken breast right-side-up at the end of the strips. Tuck the thinner \\tail\\ of the chicken breast underneath for even cooking, then roll the breast up in the bacon. Repeat with the remaining bacon strips and chicken breasts.<br> Set a cooling rack in a rimmed baking sheet and transfer the chicken breasts with the bacon seam-side down to the rack. Bake until the chicken is almost cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the middle of each breast reads 155 degrees F, about 35 minutes. Heat the broiler and broil the breasts until the bacon turns golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72028,&quot;Honey Sesame Tuiles 1/4 pound butter, softened at room temperature 1 cup powdered sugar 1/4 cup honey 1/2 cup egg whites 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour 1/8 cup white sesame seeds Instructions: Cream butter and sugar using a paddle.

For the pork belly: Season the pork belly with salt and pepper. On medium-high heat, in half the oil, sear the meat in an oven-proof casserole dish on all sides, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, onion, fennel, thyme, and peppercorns and continue cooking for another 5 minutes, or until caramelized. Add the veal stock and hard cider. Cover the casserole dish with a lid, or securely with tin foil, and braise the pork belly in the oven for 3 hours, until tender. Remove the pork belly from the oven and set aside on an aluminum-foil covered plate. Strain the leftover liquid with a large sieve over a stockpot, discard the vegetables and skim the excess fat from the braising liquid. Heat a pan on high heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Cut the pork belly into 4 equal pieces and sear on all sides until crispy, about 3 minutes. Remove from pan and keep warm. Before this step, reduce the glaze. For the glaze: Start by reducing the braising liquid by half for about 15 minutes on medium-high heat. Add the coffee and honey and continue cooking for about 5 minutes, until it thickens. You will know the sauce is done when it coats the back of a spoon. Set aside. For the scallops: Season the scallops with salt and pepper. In the same hot pan as the pork belly, sear the scallops on both sides for about 1 minute. For serving: Drizzle the coffee glaze over the pork belly. Top with a scallop. Season with sea salt and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 72032,&quot;Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookies 1 cup creamy peanut butter 2/3 cup granulated sugar, plus more for rolling 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 large egg 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Position the oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Whisk the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl. Add the foamy yeast mixture and olive oil and mix together with a stiff rubber spatula. Form the dough into a uniform ball in the center of the bowl. Be sure to scrape and use any dough stuck to the sides. The dough will be very sticky at this stage. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and keep in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours. Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour. Sprinkle a generous amount of flour on a clean, dry work surface. Scrape the dough onto the floured surface and knead for a couple of minutes, working in just enough flour to make the dough less sticky but still moist to the touch. Form the dough into 1, 2 or 4 balls, for large, medium and small pizzas. Place the dough ball(s) on the prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes. The dough can then be shaped and cooked as desired or wrapped well and frozen for up to 1 month.

Add the onion, celery, garlic and some salt, and sweat for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the fish bones and shrimp shells, and fill the pot with water. Add the bay leaves and thyme and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain the liquid into a bowl and reserve. Voila! Fish stock! For the tomato broth: Lightly coat a large saucepan with olive oil and heat over medium heat. Add the onion, fennel, celery and a large pinch of salt. Cook the veggies until soft and very aromatic, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the wine and reduce by half. Season with salt. (It&#39;s important to season all along the way.) Add 8 cups of the fish stock and the saffron. Stir in the tomatoes, thyme and bay leaves. Season with salt and cook for 20 to 30 minutes. The final broth should be a very pretty and flavorful soup. Taste and add salt as needed. Remove and discard the thyme bundle and bay leaves. For the stew: Heat a straight-sided saute pan, lightly coated with olive oil, over high heat. Sprinkle the cod with salt, add it to the pan and brown it on all sides. Remove to a large plate and reserve. Drain the fat from the pan and add the clams and about 4 cups of the tomato broth. Cover and cook until the clams open, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shrimp and cod along with the beans and the escarole. Cover and cook until the cod and shrimp are cooked through and the escarole is wilted. If at any point the soup has cooked down too much, add more tomato broth. For the toast: Preheat a grill. Place ciabatta slices on grill and toast on both sides. Remove and rub with garlic. Drizzle with olive oil and cut in half. To assemble: Remove the cod, clams and shrimp from the pan and put in a bowl. Spoon the beans and escarole into serving bowls. Ladle in the tomato broth and arrange the cod, clams and shrimp on top of the beans and escarole. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with fennel fronds.

Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface, to about 1/2-inch thickness. Using a round pastry cutter or cookie cutter, about 3 inches in diameter, cut out 6 round disks. Brush each disk with the beaten egg, coating the pastry well. Arrange on a greased baking sheet and bake until the pastry rises and is golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. When baked, remove from oven and allow to cool. Add the grapeseed oil to a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until soft and translucent (not caramelized), then add the lobster. Saute until the lobster is cooked, about 5 to 8 minutes. At this point, add the carrots and celery and saute a few more minutes until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the flour and cook for about 5 minutes; this is the beginning of the roux. Slowly begin adding the chicken stock, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens. *Add the milk, slowly and stir until incorporated to the desired thickness. Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue to cook for a further 10 to 12 minutes. Just before serving add the crabmeat and the peas and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. To serve, spoon into small bowls, sprinkle with chopped chives and top with a puff pastry disk. *Cook&#39;s Note: By adding the liquid slowly it will help you see the desired thickness of the sauce. You may not need all of the milk, as some flours absorb different amounts of liquid.

Slowly whisk the extra-virgin olive oil into the middle of the vinegar mixture to create an emulsion, incorporating all the oil. Stir in the chives. Cover and refrigerate. For the salad: In a medium saucepan, toast the quinoa in the olive oil over medium-high heat about 1 minute to evaporate the water. Add the vegetable stock and salt and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, until the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from the burner and allow to sit covered for 5 minutes. Fluff the quinoa and let cool uncovered; reserve to the side. In a large mixing bowl, combine the kale, carrots, radishes, red onion and cooked red quinoa. Add the red wine vinaigrette and toss well to thoroughly combine.

Preheat the oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F for 30 minutes. Place a large saute pan over high heat. Add the olive oil and when it is hot, saute the artichoke hearts and mushrooms. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Pour off any excess oil and let the vegetables cool. Roll or stretch the dough, 1/4 at a time, into a 9-inch circle. Place the dough, one at a time, on a lightly floured wooden peel. Brush the circles to within 1-inch of the edge with chili oil. For each calzone, put 1/4 of both cheeses on half of the dough, still leaving the 1-inch border. Top with 1/4 of the artichokes and mushrooms, the garlic and the thyme. Assemble the remaining calzones in the same way. Moisten the edges of the circles with water. Fold the un-topped half of the dough, trapping as much air inside as possible, over the filling and press the edges together firmly to seal. With the backside of a fork, press the edges of the dough to crimp them. Slide the calzones onto the pizza stone and bake about 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Brush the calzones with melted butter and sprinkle them with Parmesan. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball.) Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Yield: 4 (8-inch) pizzas &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 72044,&quot;Mascarpone Yogurt Parfaits 2 pints Greek yogurt 1 pint mascarpone 1 cup lemon juice<br> 1/2 cup sugar<br> 1/4 cup ground cinnamon<br> 1 pint blueberries<br> 1 pint raspberries<br> 4 strawberries<br> Instructions: Blend the yogurt and mascarpone in a medium bowl.

Bake the crust until light golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the crest and reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees. When the pan is cool enough to handle, brush the sides with melted butter. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), cream the goal cheese and cream cheese until very smooth. Add the sugar and vanilla and mix. Two at a time, add the eggs, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Pour into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Prepare a water bath: Place the springform pan on a doublelayer sheet of aluminum foil, with at least 3 inches of foil all around the pan. Fold the aluminum foil up around the sides of the pan. Fill a roasting pall large enough to hold the cake pan with hot water to a depth of about 1 inch. Then lift the foilwrapped cake into the roasting pan, keeping the foil turned up so that it prevents wafer from overflowing or seeping into the cake. Be careful not to make any holes in the foil as you do this! Bake about 1 hour, until the top of the cake is golden and dry to the touch, though still a bit soft in the center. It should \\shimmy\\ a bit when you shake the pan; it will firm up more as it cools. Lift the foil up to remove the cake from the water bath, remove the foil, and let cool 1 hour. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving. Serve with compote. Make the compote: combine &#39;all of the ingredients in a mediumsize saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stir, and reduce the heat so that the mixture is barely simmering. Simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn (fit the heat, cover, and set aside to soften and infuse. I1&#39; not using within a few hours, refrigerate until ready to serve. When ready to serve, remove the walls of the pan and, if desired, reheat the compote. Serve in wedges, with compote spooned around the sides. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72046,&quot;Spiced Orange Blossom Tea Cakes 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 1 teaspoon orange blossom water<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice, plus more for sprinkling, optional<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 large egg, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Instructions: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, orange blossom water, salt, baking soda, cloves and allspice.

Remove from the heat, then add the gelatin mixture and stir to dissolve.<br> Put the white chocolate chips in a large bowl and set a fine-mesh strainer on top. Pour the gelatin mixture through the strainer to catch any small lumps; remove the strainer. Let stand 5 minutes for the chocolate to soften, then stir with a rubber spatula until smooth. Tint with food coloring (divide the glaze in half if you are using more than 1 color), then let sit, stirring occasionally, until thickened and a thermometer registers 90 degrees F. Transfer to a tall, wide glass container (such as a wide-mouth mason jar) for easy dipping. Working one at a time, dip the cake pops into the mirror glaze to completely coat letting any excess drip off. Return to the foam board (it may continue to drip for a minute or two). Transfer to the refrigerator to set completely, about 1 hour. (Even after setting, mirror glaze stays sticky, so make sure to space the pops apart). Using a small, clean art brush, dust the peanut butter cups with edible gold pearl dust, then place one on top of each cake pop \\ornament\\ (see Cook&#39;s Note). Keep chilled until ready to serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 72084,&quot;Pistachio Melbas Unsalted butter, softened, for greasing pan 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1 cup sugar Finely grated zest of 2 lemons (about 1 tablespoon, packed) Finely grated zest of 1 orange (about 2 teaspoons, packed) 4 large eggs 1 cup whole raw peeled pistachios Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Brush a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan with butter and dust it with flour. Whisk the flour and salt together in a bowl. In another medium bowl, rub the citrus zests into the sugar with your fingers until the sugar is fragrant and takes on a bit of the fruit color. Beat the eggs into the sugar with a wooden spoon until blended. Stir in the flour mixture to make a smooth, sticky but pourable batter. Stir in the pistachios. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the surface lightly with a spatula. Bake until the loaf is lightly browned and pulling away from the sides of the pan, about 40 to 45 minutes. A skewer inserted into the center should come out clean, and the loaf will look like a not so great pound cake. Let stand for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and cool on a rack for 1 hour. Wrap the loaf in plastic and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Slice the chilled loaf as thin as you can -- 6 to 8 slices to the inch. (It helps to mark the loaf lightly with a serrated knife every half-inch and use that as a guide.) Lay the slices flat on 2 baking sheets and bake until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. (Take care -- the cookies can go from pale to dark brown quickly.) Let stand overnight or for at least 12 hours on a rack to cool and crisp up. Serve. Store in a well-sealed jar or other container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 72085,&quot;Lightened-Up Spinach and Artichoke Macaroni and Cheese 8 ounces whole-wheat elbow pasta 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 medium shallots, finely chopped (about 1/3 cup) 3 cloves garlic, finely minced 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 cup skim milk 1/3 cup reduced-fat sour cream 1 cup lightly packed shredded part-skim mozzarella 2/3 cup lightly packed shredded low-fat Swiss cheese 1/4 cup lightly packed grated Parmesan One 6-ounce bag baby spinach (about 6 heaping cups) One 9-ounce box frozen artichoke hearts, thawed and roughly chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Special equipment: a broiler-safe 2-quart baking dish Position an oven rack at the center of the oven, and preheat the broiler. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Reserve 3/4 cup of the pasta water; strain the pasta. Wipe out the pot. Add the butter, and melt over medium heat. Add the shallots, and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the flour, and whisk constantly until it begins to toast, about 2 minutes. (The flour will form a thick paste, but that&#39;s okay; just keep it moving in the pot.) Whisk in the milk and the reserved pasta water, and whisk constantly until the mixture is thick like gravy, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in the sour cream, 2/3 cup of the mozzarella, the Swiss cheese and 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan. Once the cheeses have melted, add the spinach, and cook until just wilted, about 1 minute. Stir in the artichoke hearts, pasta, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Transfer to a broiler-safe 2-quart baking dish. Stir together the remaining 1/3 cup mozzarella and 3 tablespoons Parmesan in a small bowl. Sprinkle over the pasta.

Fill a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish with water and mix in 1 tablespoon salt. Add the eggplants to the water and let soak, rotating them occasionally, for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F; line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat it with cooking spray. Remove the eggplants from the water, gently squeeze to get rid of excess water and pat them dry. Rinse and dry the casserole dish; reserve for later. Place the eggplants on the prepared baking sheet and brush with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Bake until they are cooked and tender but not falling apart, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove the eggplants and lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, to make the filling, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until golden, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes more. Add the ground beef, breaking it up with a spatula, and cook until browned, about 10 minutes. Add the Anaheim peppers and tomato and toss to combine. Mix in the Aleppo pepper, black pepper, 1 tablespoon of the tomato paste and 1 teaspoon salt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have broken down and the mixture is saucy, about another 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Transfer the eggplants to the reserved casserole dish. Open up each slit by pushing against the sides of it with a spoon, making sure the eggplant is still intact on the bottom. Spoon the filling into each eggplant. Mix the remaining 2 tablespoons tomato paste with 1 1/2 cups hot water and 1 teaspoon salt in a measuring cup or bowl. Spoon the sauce over the eggplants and into the casserole dish. Bake until heated through and lightly browned on top, about 30 minutes. Top with parsley right before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Garnacha, Tempranillo, Pinot Noir]&quot; 72087,&quot;Warm Farro Salad with Roasted Butternut Squash and Spiced Cranberry Vinaigrette 3 tablespoons brown butter (infused with a cinnamon stick during browning), melted 1 butternut squash, peeled, seeded and diced 2 cups farro Salt Extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper 3 cups fresh cranberries 2 cups brown sugar 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 2 oranges, zested and juiced 1 bunch fresh mint, picked, washed and lightly torn 2 cups fresh arugula 1 cup crumbled French feta Instructions: Toss the brown butter with the butternut squash.

Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper and lightly spray with nonstick spray; set aside. Put the oats, seeds and nuts in a large bowl. Combine the pumpkin puree, sugar, maple syrup, oil and pumpkin pie spice in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat and let it cook for 1 minute longer, whisking occasionally. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients over the oat mixture and stir until the oats are fully coated. The mixture will be pretty wet. Evenly spread the mixture, in a single layer, onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes, then stir and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the granola is golden brown and crisp. Cool on a baking rack. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the cranberries, if using. Store leftovers in an airtight container in a cool, dark, place, for up to 1 week. For the orange cranberry jam: Combine the orange juice and zest, and the sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the sugar has melted. Add the cranberries, reduce the heat so the mixture simmers, and cook until the cranberries pop and the mixture thickens slightly (it will thicken much more as it cools), about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Makes about 2 cups; store leftovers in the refrigerator, covered, for 2 weeks. For the maple yogurt: Whisk together the yogurt and 2 tablespoons maple syrup until smooth; taste, and add more maple syrup if you&#39;d like it sweeter. Chill.

Follow that with about 1/4 cup of pumpkin granola, another 1/4 cup of yogurt, about 2 tablespoons of orange cranberry jam, then a little more yogurt and a few more tablespoons of granola. Drizzle over some Pumpkin Spice Syrup, if using. Serve. Combine the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until the mixture thickens slightly and the spices become fragrant, about 3 minutes. Combine 2 cups cold water and the granulated and brown sugars in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil over high heat and cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture thickens and reduces slightly, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, whisk in the spiced pumpkin puree and cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes. Do not allow the mixture to boil after you add the pumpkin or the syrup will become cloudy (even after straining.) Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool for 10 minutes. Place a mesh strainer over a medium bowl and line the strainer with several layers of cheesecloth. Pour the mixture through the strainer and let it strain slowly into the bowl. Add the vanilla extract to the syrup and transfer to a container with a tight fitting lid. The syrup will last 1 month stored in the refrigerator.

Meanwhile, toast the bulgur in a medium skillet over medium heat until fragrant and nutty, about 4 minutes. Stir in the bulgur, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for 5 minutes. Transfer the bulgur to a medium bowl and fluff with a fork. Add 1/4 cup of the olive oil, chopped herbs, pine nuts, 2 teaspoons salt, scallions, and garlic and season with pepper, to taste. Cool slightly and add the egg and feta, and mix to combine. Set the stuffing aside. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Lay the hens on a work surface. Starting from the neck of a hen, slip a couple fingers between the skin and breast, and loosen the skin. Take a large spoonful of the stuffing and slip the spoon between the skin and breast. With your free hand, hold the stuffing in place and gently pull the spoon out, leaving the stuffing behind. Press the skin down to evenly distribute the stuffing over the breast. Repeat until the hens are evenly stuffed. Cross the legs of the birds at the breastbone and tie them with a piece of kitchen twine. Arrange the hens breast-side up on a baking sheet. Brush all over with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Roast the birds until well browned and crispy, and an instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees when inserted into the thigh, about 40 minutes. To serve, split the hens in half lengthwise. Pour the coulis onto a platter and arrange the hens on top. Garnish with the herb sprigs and serve. Put the tomatoes over 2 gas burners on high and cook, turning occasionally, until charred and peeling. Alternatively, broil the tomatoes until charred. Put the tomatoes in a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Set aside to steam for 5 minutes. Peel and seed the tomatoes. Transfer the tomatoes to a blender with the vinegar and garlic and puree until smooth. While the motor is running, drizzle in the oil until incorporated. Season with pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 72105,&quot;Cherry BBQ Chicken Drumsticks 3 teaspoons ancho cl powder 1 teaspoon smoked paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 chicken drumsticks (about 3 1/4 pounds) 2 tablespoons canola oil 1/2 Vidalia onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 tablespoons tomato paste Juice of 2 oranges Juice of 1/2 lemon 1 cup ketchup 1 (16-ounce) bag frozen pitted cherries, thawed 1/2 cup water Olive oil, for greasing grates Fresh cherries, for serving Instructions: In a small bowl, whisk together 2 teaspoons cl powder, smoked paprika, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper.

Add in the ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon and scraping up any brown bits in the pan, until golden brown in spots and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in 3/4 cup of the ketchup sauce.<br> Coat the back of a baking sheet with cooking spray. Unroll both cans of crescent dough and separate unto 16 triangles. Put a 5-inch ramekin in the center of the prepared baking sheet. Arrange the triangles in a ring around the ramekin so the short sides of the dough are touching the ramekin, overlapping slightly, and the pointed ends are facing outward (it should look like a giant sun).<br> Spoon the beef mixture over the short ends of the triangles closest to the ramekin. Cover the beef with the cheese slices. Top the cheese with the pickle slices. Remove the ramekin. Take hold of the pointed end of one of the triangles and fold it up and over the filling, tucking the tip under the bottom edge of dough to secure (the dough will not cover the filling completely but should cover the pickle slice). Repeat with the remaining triangles (there will be some gaps where you can see the beef mixture).<br> Bake until the dough is golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 25 minutes. Brush the ring with butter and sprinkle on the sesame seeds. Let cool for 15 minutes. Use a spatula to slide the ring off the baking sheet onto a platter.

Bring to a mild boil for about 5 minutes. Add the chicken pieces and give it another 10 minutes over medium heat or until the chicken cooks. Add the carrots, fish sauce, roasted garlic and sugar. Let it cook over low heat another 3 minutes, and then the egg noodles and Dried Pepper Extract and cook for a final 2 minutes. Take your choice of 6 of the dried peppers. Over a bowl, snap off the tails but try to keep the seeds in the bowl. Fill a large saucepan with 6 to 8 ounces water. Add the peppers and boil over medium heat until you see the skins soften and become moist, about 3 minutes. Then strain a little of the water in the sink but leave enough to blend the peppers, 1 to 1 1/2 ounces. Remember to keep the seeds. Add the fresh garlic, cumin and the peppers and seeds to a blender and puree. You have now created the paste used to generate the hot oil. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes. CAUTION: the following step may be toxic. Take the dried pepper paste you have just blended and SLOWLY and carefully drop into the hot oil while stirring for about 3 minutes. This will produce a homemade pepper extract. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Aglianico]&quot; 72109,&quot;Carne Asada Naan Pizza Bites 3 teaspoons olive oil, plus more for spraying 1 medium onion, thinly sliced 6 ounces flank steak, trimmed 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 2 whole wheat naan breads 3/4 cup shredded low-fat Cheddar 1/2 cup store-bought salsa Serving suggestions: avocado, cilantro and lime juice<br> Serving suggestions: avocado, cilantro and lime juice Instructions: Heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone liners. Place the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt into a sifter or fine-mesh strainer, then sift the mixture into a large bowl until it&#39;s all combined. Throw the butter pieces into the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. Measure the cream in a spouted measuring cup and crack in an egg. Zest one of the lemons and add the zest to the cream. Add half of the rosemary to the mixture. Whisk together, then drizzle it into the flour-butter mixture, stirring gently with a fork until combined and a dough forms. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle. Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. The final rectangle should be about 18 inches by about 10 inches. Use a knife to trim the dough into a symmetrical rectangle, then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical square/rectangular pieces. Next, cut each piece in half diagonally to form smaller triangles. Transfer the triangles to the prepared baking sheets. Bake until just barely golden brown, about 18 minutes, then allow to cool completely. While the scones are cooling, make the glaze: Combine the powdered sugar and milk in a large bowl. Add the juice of the lemon you zested and whisk the mixture together. Zest the second lemon and add the zest to the bowl. Add the rest of the rosemary and whisk it until it&#39;s all combined. Add a little extra milk if it needs thinning. Position a cooling rack over a baking sheet. When the scones are completely cooled, drop them one by one into the glaze. Flip them over to coat. Transfer them to the cooling rack to allow the excess glaze to drip off. Allow the glaze to set completely before serving. The scones will last for several days in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 72111,&quot;Open-Faced Breakfast Sandwich 3/4 cup olive oil 1 stalk fresh rosemary 8 to 10 sprigs fresh thyme 1 clove garlic, smashed Kosher salt 4 slices white bread 4 eggs 1/4 pound dry cured and smoked speck ham, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons maple syrup Freshly ground black pepper 4 tablespoons grape jelly 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese Instructions: Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Prick the sweet potatoes with a fork and bake them until they are soft, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and set aside until they are cool enough to handle. While the potatoes are cooking make the pastry: combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in the ice water and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes. Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour. Roll the dough out into a 10-inch circle. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin and lay it inside a 9-inch pie pan. Press the dough firmly into the bottom and sides so it fits tightly. Trim the excess dough around the rim and pinch the edges to form a border. Place a piece of parchment paper over the crust and fill with uncooked beans or pie weights. Bake the pie crust until it sets, about 20 minutes. Remove the parchment and beans. Brush the bottom with the beaten egg white and set aside. While the crust is cooking make the filling: When cool enough to handle, peel the sweet potatoes and puree the pulp in a food processor with 1/2 stick butter and a pinch of salt. Measure 1 1/2 cups puree into a bowl. In another bowl beat the eggs and sugar until the sugar has melted. Add the eggs to the sweet potato puree and whisk well. Add the cream, orange zest, cinnamon, and nutmeg and stir well to combine. Pour the mixture into the pie shell. Place the pie pan on a sturdy cookie sheet to catch any spills.

Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt over the garlic and continue to chop it, occasionally smashing and smearing the garlic with the flat side of the knife, until the garlic becomes paste-like. (Alternatively, mash the garlic and salt together in a mortar and pestle.) Put the garlic paste, butter, thyme, and pepper in a small bowl. Fold the softened butter over and onto the garlic and thyme, mashing it down with the back of a spoon or spatula. Use a sheet of plastic wrap to help shape the butter into a log, wrap the log well with the plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use. (The garlic butter can be made up to 3 days ahead; it can also be frozen, well wrapped, for a couple of months.)<br> Melt half of the garlic-butter mixture in a small pan over medium heat. (Rewrap and save the other half for future use; it&#39;s great stuff under the skin of a chicken before roasting or tossing into the broth of steamed mussels.)<br> Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> In a large ovenproof saute pan, heat the vegetable oil over high heat until very hot. Season the steaks with a little salt and pepper. Add the steaks to the pan and brown them well on 1 side, about 5 minutes. Turn the steaks and brush them liberally with the garlic butter. Finish cooking the steaks in the oven, brushing them occasionally with more garlic butter, until done, about another 5 minutes. (The time will vary depending on how you like your steaks cooked and how thick they are.) Remove the steaks from the oven and allow them to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve smaller steaks whole or sliced thinly across the grain. Cut larger steaks into 2 servings or into thin slices. Spoon any remaining juices from the pan onto the meat as well. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Pinot Noir]&quot; 72152,&quot;General Tso&#39;s Chicken 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1- by 4-inch strips 1 egg white, lightly beaten Kosher salt 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 2 ounces crispy rice cereal, such as Rice Chex, finely ground (rounded 1/2 cup) Nonstick cooking spray 2 cloves garlic, cracked 2 ginger coins, cracked 2 dried red chiles, broken in half 3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth 2 1/2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons agave syrup 2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar 2 teaspoons cornstarch 4 cups broccoli florets (about 10 ounces) 4 cups cooked brown rice, for serving 2 scallions, thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Using your fingers, insert the garlic cloves as deep into the meat as possible. Season the roast evenly on all sides with the salt and pepper. Heat a Dutch oven over high heat. Add the oil and, when very hot, use the meat fork to add the roast. Sear on all sides until very well browned, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. Don&#39;t be afraid to let the roast get very brown -- this is where a lot of the flavor comes from. When the roast is evenly browned on all sides, add the water and stir to loosen the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Cover the Dutch oven, reduce the heat to low/medium-low and cook the roast until it is very tender, about 3 hours, turning two or three times during the entire cooking time. Check occasionally to make sure that you always have 1-inch or so of liquid on the bottom of the pan. If necessary, add more water. When the roast is very tender, transfer to a serving platter and slice or pull meat apart into serving pieces.

Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides. Lightly butter the foil and sides of the pan. Pulse the sugar with the lemon zest and rosemary in a food processor until well combined. Remove 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture and reserve. Add the butter, salt and vanilla to the food processor with the sugar and pulse until combined. Add the flour, about 1 cup at a time, pulsing to combine after each addition. (After the last addition, you may need to stir and scrape down the sides of the food processor to incorporate all of the flour.) Continue to pulse until a dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto the prepared baking pan and press it evenly into the pan. Poke the dough all over with a fork and sprinkle it with the reserved sugar. Bake until the edges are golden brown and the center is golden, about 25 minutes. As soon as it&#39;s out of the oven, use a bench scraper or knife to cut the shortbread into 1-by-3-inch cookies. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then carefully remove the cookies using the foil as handles. Cool completely on a rack.

Season with the salt. For the salad: Add the chopped romaine, roasted red pepper, fennel, provolone and salami to the dressing. Toss well to coat. For the pasta: Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the par-cooked pasta and fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove to a paper towel-lined plate and season with the salt. Sprinkle the crispy orzo over the top of the salad and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 72183,&quot;Big Cheese Squeeze 2 slices of bread, cut thin (as far as breadselection goes, all I&#39;ll say is the bigger the loaf the bigger the sandwich) 1 teaspoon (or more) smooth Dijon mustard 1 cup grated cheese Semi-hard, semi-soft combo like smoked gouda and Gruyere or Fontina with a young Asiago. Good quality olive oil for spritzing. Instructions: Find 2 heavy skillets that will nest together. Two (10-inch) cast iron skillets are ideal. Heat them over high heat. Meanwhile, spread mustard on one slice of bread. Distribute the cheese evenly over the mustard, season with fresh black pepper and top with second piece of bread. Spritz the bread surface that&#39;s staring up at you with olive oil using either a Misto or a pump sprayer. A light coat will do, don&#39;t soak. When the pans are hot enough to vigorously sizzle a drop of water, remove them from the heat and place the sandwich, top-side down in the middle of one pan. (if your pans are a different size, this would be the larger one.) Spritz the slice now facing you, as well as the bottom of the other skillet. Lay the skillet right on top of the sandwich. If the top pan isn&#39;t cast iron, weigh it down with a brick, can, or something of similar heft. Wait patiently, crack a beer. When you hear the first bit of cheese run out and sizzle on the pan, it&#39;s done. This will take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully remove the top skillet, (you may need to coax it off with a spatula, but I doubt it). Just look at it. It&#39;s perfect...better than mom&#39;s. (no reason to tell her) Remove to a plate, count to 10 and slice it in half. Take a bite. Take another.

Add the butter and pulse until completely combined. The texture will be similar to wet sand. Press firmly into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of a 7-inch springform pan. Put the crust in the freezer while you make the filling. Wipe out the bowl of the food processor and add the cream cheese, pumpkin puree, vanilla, nutmeg, eggs, 3/4 cup of the sugar and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon. Process until completely smooth, opening the lid and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Pour the mixture over the crust. Tear off a piece of aluminum foil about 1 1/2 feet long and put the springform pan in the center. Wrap the foil around the pan, folding down the sides as needed so the top of the pan isn&#39;t covered. The aluminum foil should only be on the outside of the pan. Tear off a second piece of aluminum foil about 2 feet long and lay the foil in front of you with one of the longer sides closest to you. Folding it toward you (the long way), fold the foil in half once then fold once again to create a foil sling for the cheesecake. Pour 2 cups water in the bottom of a 6-quart Instant Pot? and insert the machine&#39;s trivet. Put the springform pan in the center of the foil sling, then pick up both sides of the sling, bringing them up the sides of the pan. Carefully lower the pan onto the trivet. Fold down the foil sling as needed so that it fits in the pot but does not touch the cheesecake. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure cook on high for 35 minutes. After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, turn off the heat and let the steam release naturally for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, follow the manufacturer&#39;s guide for steam release and allow any residual steam to air out. Being careful of any remaining steam, unlock and remove the lid and carefully use the foil sling to lift out the pan and set it over a cooling rack. Remove the foil from around the pan, then use paper towels to blot off any excess liquid from the top and sides of the cheesecake. Use a small offset spatula or the tip of a paring knife to loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan. Allow to sit at room temperature until mostly cooled, about 1 hour. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely set, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.<br> Once fully chilled, remove the plastic wrap from the cheesecake and use a small offset spatula or the tip of a paring knife to again loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan. Remove the outer ring and set the cheesecake on a serving dish. Spread the whipped cream over the top. Whisk together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl. Dust the cinnamon sugar over the top of the cheesecake before slicing.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72185,&quot;Herbed Potato Galette 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 5 sprigs thyme, leaves stripped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 small onion, thinly sliced<br> Flaky sea salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the tart tin with the dough and bake &#39;blind&#39;. Cook&#39;s Note: Blind Baking. To pre-bake a pastry shell before adding filling, first chill the pastry, and then line your pan. Line the pastry with foil, parchment or greaseproof paper, leaving plenty to come up the sides. Fill with baking beans (alternatively, for a really smooth finish use plastic wrap to line the pastry: place 2 sheets over the pastry, add the beans and bring the edges into the center.) Whichever method you choose, bake &#39;blind&#39; in a 350 degree F oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry feels dry. Remove the paper and beans, and brush with a little leftover beaten egg, and return to the oven for 2 minutes. If there are any little holes or cracks in the pastry, just patch it up with any leftover raw pastry before you return it to the oven. Remove from the oven, and set aside in the pan while you make the filling. The pastry can be baked a day in advance and kept covered until you need it. Filling: Wash and dry the spinach, removing any tough stalks and stems, if using large spinach leaves. In a medium-size saucepan, cook the spinach in just the water that&#39;s clinging to it, over a low heat until it wilts. Drain the spinach in a colander or sieve, and let cool a little, then squeeze most of the moisture out with your hands, and roughly chop. Meanwhile, steam or boil the potatoes, until just cooked, and cool the potatoes on a tray or board. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them into 1/4-inch thick slices. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the eggs, and add the cream, salt, and pepper, lemon zest, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and grated Parmesan. Whisk these ingredients together, and then add the spinach, and mix through. Season well as the potatoes are very mild and need a good contrast. Spread the potato slices over the base of the prepared tart, and dot with the goat&#39;s cheese, reserving a few slices of each to place on the top, if you wish. Gently spoon the spinach cream mixture over the cheese, as high as you can go. If you are concerned about spillage, carry the tart minus the last few spoons of filling over to the oven. Place the pan in the oven, and then add the remaining filling, and any remaining potato, and cheese slices. Bake until the tart is golden brown and just set in the center, about 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the tart from the oven, and let cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Shortcrust Pastry Place the flour, salt, and butter in a food processor and whiz or pulse briefly. Add half the beaten egg and continue to whiz. You might add a little more egg, but not too much as the mixture should be just moist enough to come together. If making by hand, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse bread crumbs. Then, using your hands, add just enough egg to bring the dough together. With your hands, flatten out the ball of dough, until it is about 3/4-inch thick, and then wrap in plastic wrap or place in a plastic bag and leave in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or, if you are pushed for time, in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes. Makes 1 crust (about 14 ounces). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 72187,&quot;Marinated Grilled Pork Tenderloin 3 (3/4 to 1 pound) pork tenderloins 1/2 cup soy sauce 1/2 cup dry sherry 1/2 cup honey 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar 1/4 cup vegetable oil 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice 1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon minced shallots 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger Instructions: Trim the tenderloins of all fat and silverskin. Place them in a shallow baking dish large enough to hold them without crowding. Combine the soy sauce, sherry, honey, vinegar, oil, and orange juice in a medium bowl, whisking until well blended. Stir in the rosemary, shallots, and ginger. Pour the mixture over the tenderloins. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to marinate at room temperature for 2 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan. Remove the pork from the marinade, shaking off any excess. Place the tenderloins on the grill and cook, turning frequently, for about 18 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 155 degrees F. Transfer to a platter and allow the meat to rest for 10 minutes before carving. Meanwhile, place the marinade in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Slice the pork into 1/4 inch-thick slices, spoon the hot marinade over the pork.

Bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until the bananas are golden and the sauce is bubbling. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 72189,&quot;Croquembouche 2 cups water 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter 1 teaspoon salt 3 teaspoons granulated sugar 2 cups flour 8 to 10 eggs Filling, recipe follows Caramel, recipe follows 4 cups whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 12 egg yolks 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar 1/2 cup cornstarch 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 1/2 cups sugar 2/3 cup water Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large saucepan, bring the water, butter, salt, and sugar to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, 30 seconds to evaporate some of the moisture. Scrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer). Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running, and working 1 egg at a time, add 6 of the eggs, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add 1 or 2 more eggs, and mix until incorporated. Using a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip, pipe the dough in big kisses onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Whisk 2 eggs with 3 teaspoons of water. Brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash to knock down the points (do not use all the egg wash.) Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375-degrees and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 20 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. The recipe can be made up to this point and frozen in plastic bags. Filling: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and any flavorings if you want to make a different flavor like chocolate or coffee. Let cool slightly. Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. The custard can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Poke a hole with a plain pastry tip in the bottom of each cream puff and pipe it full of the custard. Caramel: Dissolve the sugar in a saucepan with the water, making an \\X\\ through the sugar with your finger to allow the water to slowly soak into the sugar. Boil to make a light golden caramel then dip the bottom of the pan in an ice bath to stop the cooking. Dip the sides of the puffs in the caramel and stick them together (approximately 20 cream puffs) in a circle, tops facing out. Make a second row on top of the first but a bit smaller to draw the circle in and create a tower of cream puffs. Check it from all sides occasionally to make sure it&#39;s straight. When it&#39;s finished, drizzle it with caramel all over. You can also stick on decorative elements with the caramel in the crevices, like candied violets, gold balls, gum paste flowers, sugar covered almonds, etc. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 72190,&quot;Giant Chocolate-Peanut Butter Cookie Cake 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2/3 cup unsweetened dark cocoa powder 2 teaspoons baking soda 2 teaspoons fine salt 3 sticks (24 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 cups packed dark brown sugar 4 large eggs 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 cups semisweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup honey-roasted peanuts, chopped 2 sticks (16 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup smooth peanut butter 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 1/3 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the cookies: Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a second large bowl until light and fluffy, about 6 minutes. Add the eggs to the butter mixture, one at a time, beating after each addition to incorporate; beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to medium, add the flour mixture, and beat until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips by hand. Roll the dough into 6 balls (about 1 1/2 cups each). Divide 4 of the balls between 2 rimmed baking sheets (2 balls per sheet). Flatten them into 6-inch circles using your hands; make sure the circles are 2 inches apart. Bake until just set, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining 2 balls of dough. For the frosting: Meanwhile, beat the butter and peanut butter with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Slowly add the confectioners&#39; sugar about 1/2 cup at a time, beating between additions, until incorporated. Assemble the cake: Place a cookie on a cake stand or serving plate and spread the top with some frosting. Top with another cookie and more frosting; repeat with the remaining cookies and frosting, making sure the frosting on the top layer is spread smooth. For the ganache: Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. Bring the cream and butter to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Pour over the chocolate and let stand for 5 minutes; stir until melted and smooth. Pour the ganache over the top of the cake, smoothing the top with a small offset spatula and letting it drip over the sides. Decorate the rim of the cake with the peanuts. Let stand at room temperature until the chocolate hardens, about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 72191,&quot;Aioli With Roasted Vegetables 12 cloves garlic Kosher salt 2 large pasteurized egg yolks 1 1/2 cups light extra-virgin olive oil (or equal parts extra-virgin olive oil and grapeseed oil) Instructions: Place 10 garlic cloves in a saucepan and cover with cold water.

Strain the stock, removing the meats. You should have 10 to 11 cups of stock. Discard the marrow bones. Cut the beef and the pork into 1 1/2-inch chunks, discarding the pork bones. Reserve the meats. While the stock is cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Wrap the beets separately in aluminum foil and bake until a tip of a small knife slides in easily, about 45 minutes. Unwrap the beets, plunge them into a bowl of cold water, then slip off the skins. Grate the beets a 4-sided box grater or shred in a food processor, and set aside In a large, heavy soup pot, cook the bacon in the butter over medium heat until it renders its fat. Add the onion, carrot, and pepper, and saute until softened, about 7 minutes. Add the cabbage, and saute, stirring, for another 7 minutes. Add the stock, the potatoes, tomatoes, apple, and the reserved meats. Season with salt to taste, and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the reserved beets and cook the soup over medium-low heat until all the vegetables are soft and the flavors have melded, about 25 minutes more. With a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic, pepper, and parsley to a paste and add it to the soup. (If you don&#39;t have a mortar and pestle, just use ground pepper, crushed garlic and minced parsley.) Stir in the vinegar and the sugar, adjusting the balance of sweet and sour, to taste. Let the borshch stand for 10 minutes before serving (or better serve the next day.) To serve, add a teaspoon of sour cream to each bowl and sprinkle liberally with dill and scallions. Instruct the diners to mix the sour cream well into the soup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 72208,&quot;Arctic Char Salad with Apples 1/2 pound baby red-skinned potatoes, thinly sliced Kosher salt 3 ounces cream cheese Juice of 1 lemon 1 tablespoon horseradish 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground pepper 1 pound skin-on Arctic char or wild salmon fillet 1 head escarole, chopped 1 romaine heart, chopped 6 radishes, thinly sliced 1 green apple, thinly sliced 3/4 cup chopped fresh dill and/or chives Instructions: Put the potatoes in a small saucepan and cover with cold water; season with salt.

Mix the coarse kosher salt, coarsely ground black pepper, granulated garlic, granulated onion, five-spice, Big Lee\\u2019s Sweet Heat, curry powder and paprika in a small bowl. Generously apply the dry rub to all sides of the oxtails. Cover and allow to dry brine in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Set up your smoker following the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions and heat to 200 degrees F. Add applewood or hickory wood as specified by the manufacturer. Alternatively, set up a charcoal grill for smoking following the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions and heat to 200 degrees F. Place the oxtails in a large aluminum baking pan in the smoker on the indirect side (farthest from the fire box or heat source) and smoke for 2 hours. Increase the smoker temperature to 300 degrees F and smoke until the oxtails are a beautiful, glistening, mahogany color and there is some rendered fat in the bottom of the pan, 2 hours more. Now, it\\u2019s time to break down the oxtails\\u2019 muscle fibers, while still retaining high levels of moisture. Remove the pan from the smoker, cover with aluminum foil and tightly seal the edges. Smoke until the meat is tender and easily pulls away from the bone, 2 hours more. If the meat doesn\\u2019t easily pull away from the bone, rewrap the pan and smoke for 1 hour more. Remove the oxtails from the smoker and allow them to rest for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, place the Fresnos on a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, drizzle with olive oil to coat, sprinkle with salt and wrap in the foil. Repeat with the jalape?os, garlic and onion, using 3 separate sheets of foil. Place the wrapped Fresnos, jalape?os, garlic and onion in the smoker\\u2019s firebox. If using a charcoal grill, remove the grill grate and place the wrapped vegetables in the coals. Cook until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Check frequently, as they can burn quickly.\\u202f Transfer the vegetables to a work surface. Discard the foil. Pick up the garlic with long grilling tongs and hold over the smoker\\u2019s fire or grill\\u2019s coals until it develops a good char, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. Repeat with the Fresnos, jalape?os and onion, 7 to 10 minutes each. Let rest for 5 minutes. Combine the milk, grits, butter, smoked sea salt and 1 1/2 cups water in medium saucepan. Place the saucepan on a burner over medium-low heat and bring to a very slow simmer, whisking occasionally. Cover and cook, whisking occasionally to prevent lumps and sticking to the bottom of the pot, until the grits thicken, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the grits from the heat and gently fold in the gouda until softened and slightly melted. Scoop the grits into 2 bowls. Pull the meat off of the oxtail bones with a fork and place on top of the grits. To deseed the Fresnos and jalape?os, cut them in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with the back of a chef\\u2019s knife. Thinly slice the peppers crosswise. Thinly slice the roasted garlic. Peel the onion, cut it in half, then thinly slice it. Divide the Fresnos, jalape?os, Fresnos, garlic, onions and chives between the bowls. Top each dish with the zest of half of the lemon and a squirt of lemon juice. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 72211,&quot;Apple Filled Pancakes 2 tablespoons sugar 1 cup flour 1 teaspoon baking powder Salt 1 1/4 cups milk 2 eggs 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 4 tablespoons butter 2 pounds or 4 Golden Delicious or Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, quartered and cut into 1/8-inch slices 1 tablespoon sugar mixed with 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions: You must have a non-stick skillet or this won&#39;t work.

To cut pockets into the pork chops, insert the point of a small sharp knife horizontally into the fat-covered edge. Move the knife back and forth to create a deep pocket about 1 1/2 inches wide. Fill the pocket of each chop with the breadcrumb mixture. Secure the openings with toothpicks. Place the flour in a shallow bowl. Dredge the stuffed chops lightly in the flour, shaking off the excess. Wipe out the skillet used previously for the stuffing and place it over medium-high heat. Add the oil and, when hot, add the chops. Sear over medium heat until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Place a rack in a roasting or baking pan and add water, being careful not to cover the rack with water. Place the chops on the rack and cover the roaster with the lid or aluminum foil. Bake the chops for 1 hour. Let rest, remove the toothpicks and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72229,&quot;Whipped Taro Root and Taro Chips 2 pounds of taro root 6 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> Salt and pepper to taste<br> 2 cups of peanut or grapeseed oil 2 4- pound Long Island ducks 3 tablespoons ginger<br> 6 cloves of garlic<br> 1 quart Kikkoman soy sauce<br> 1 cup of sherry<br> 2 tablespoons of sesame oil<br> 1 1/2 cup julienned scallions, or more<br> Whipped Taro Root and Taro Chips (see previous recipe) Duck Jus, recipe follows 2 tablespoons oil 1 chopped, roasted duck body 1 leek, roughly chopped 1 stalk celery 1 carrot, cut into 1/2 inch pieces 1 cup white wine 2 cups chicken stock 1/2 cup soy marinade<br> Instructions: Peel taro root. First, for the chips, take your peeler and peel approximately one cup of long taro shreds. Reserve for frying. Take the remaining taro and cut it up into rough 2 inch chunks. Place in a sauce pan, covering with cold water. Boil root until tender. Strain into a colander, reserving cup of the liquid. In a food processor, pulse taro, adding little dabs of butter as you go, along with some of the cooking liquid to make a smooth consistency. Remove and season with salt and pepper.<br> For the chips:<br> Heat a couple of cups of peanut or grapeseed oil to 350 degrees. Drops shreds into oil in small batches. Remove when crisp (the chips should still be light in color) and salt. For the duck: Separate legs from the breast by cutting where the breast and carcass end and legs begin, or have your butcher cut it for you. Using a sharp boning knife, follow right along the breast bone on either side and remove both breasts. Trim fat along outside of the breast allowing approximately one-third of an inch of fat overlap. Score fat on breast by making a diagonal cut, making sure not to cut the breast meat. About four strokes is sufficient. In a food processor, dice unpeeled ginger and garlic until coarsely chopped. Place in a stainless steel bowl. Add remaining ingredients. Place the two whole duck legs and the four duck breasts in the marinade. Remove the duck breasts after one hour. The legs should continue to marinate for an additional half an hour, and then be removed.<br> Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Using the carcasses of the duck, place the duck legs on the duck carcass. Place legs and carcasses in a roasting pan and roast for 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours. Check periodically to make sure the ducks are not getting too dark. They are ready when the leg wiggles freely to your touch, and they are a nice deep amber color. The skin should look crisp and rendered of fat. Cool. Once cooled, take your boning knife and cut through the skin right in the middle of the legs. Using your hands, separate duck legs. (Use your thumb to get under the oyster and gently pull leg from the bones.) Gently use your fingers to pull out the thigh bone. Trim legs a little to keep a nice triangular shape. For the breasts:<br> Heat a large, 12 inch saute pan to medium high. (You can cook two duck breasts in one pan or cook one at a time in a smaller, 10 inch pan.) Add two breasts, skin side down to start rendering the fat. Cook over medium high heat for a couple of minutes. (You will need to remove the rendered fat as you go. Hold duck breast still with a pair of tongs and pour fat into a stainless bowl or other container. Return to heat). After the first couple of minutes on medium high heat, turn burner down to medium, so not to burn the duck. The duck should be a rich amber color. Continue cooking until the fat is almost completely rendered. You can check this by looking at the incisions of the fat. When there is only a thin, crisp skin, the duck is ready to be flipped. Turn duck over. Shut heat off and leave the breast to sit in the pan for about three to four minutes. Remove from pan and allow to rest for five minutes.<br> Meanwhile, place the duck legs in a medium to medium small saute pan, skin side down and pan covered to heat and finish any additional rendering of fat, approximately five minutes.<br> Slice duck breast into fairly thing slices, keeping the nice shape of the breast. With a spatula, pick up breast and fan it out onto the plate. Place duck legs on an angle near the top of the slices. Serve with Whipped Taro Root, Taro Chips, lots of julienned scallions, and a little Duck Jus.<br> In a heavy-bottomed sauce pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil. Add one chopped, roasted duck body, 1 leek, roughly chopped, one stalk of celery and one carrot cut into half-inch pieces. Cook until vegetables are golden. Add a cup of white wine and two cups of chicken stock and reduce by half. Add one half cup of soy marinade, cooking an additional few minutes. Skim off any fat and strain. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 72230,&quot;Acai Yogurt Pops 2 3.5-ounce packets frozen acai puree (from a 14-ounce bag), thawed 1 banana 1/2 cup frozen mango chunks 1/2 cup frozen pineapple chunks 1/2 cup coconut water 1 cup vanilla yogurt, plus more for dipping 1 cup granola, large clusters broken up Instructions: Combine the acai, banana, mango, pineapple and coconut water in a blender.

Grease and lightly flour a 6-by-9-inch 3D egg cake pan. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and granulated sugar until lightened in color and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the milk; begin and end with the flour mixture. Beat until the batter is smooth and thoroughly combined. Divide the batter among 3 bowls. Tint one bowl with the red food color, one with the orange and one with the yellow. Fill each half of the egg pan alternately with the batter colors. Use a butter knife or skewer to swirl the batter together. Bake until a toothpick tester inserted near the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Transfer the cakes to wire cooling racks and let them cool completely before frosting. When the cakes are cool, level them with a serrated knife, if needed. For the simple syrup: Combine the granulated sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Let cool for about 15 minutes before using. Place the cakes dome-side up on a wire rack or baking sheet. Use a pastry brush to coat the cakes with the simple syrup. Use about two-thirds of the syrup on the cakes and reserve the remaining syrup for later use. For the vanilla buttercream: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment, cream together the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar on low speed until crumbly. Add the vanilla extract. Beat again, adding milk or cream 1 tablespoon at a time to thin the mixture. When the mixture starts to appear creamy, increase the mixer speed to high and beat until light and fluffy. Add more milk or cream to bring to spreading consistency. Place one egg cake on a 9-inch cake board or serving plate dome-side down. Cover with a thick layer of buttercream and sandwich with the second egg cake, dome-side up. Use the buttercream to completely cover the outside of the egg cake, smoothing it as much as possible with an offset spatula. This doesn\\u2019t have to be perfect because the cake will be covered with fondant dragon scales. Refrigerate the cake until the buttercream is firm, about 20 minutes. For the marshmallow fondant and dcor: In a large microwave-safe bowl, combine the marshmallows and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon water. Microwave in 30-second intervals until the marshmallows have expanded to twice their size, 60 to 90 seconds total. Stir to deflate. Add one-third of the confectioners&#39; sugar into the marshmallow mixture and stir to combine. Add more confectioners\\u2019 sugar and stir until very stiff. When the mixture becomes difficult to stir, knead with your hands. Add the remaining confectioners\\u2019 sugar a little at a time, until the fondant is very smooth and elastic and holds a firm ball shape. Remove a third of the fondant to a work surface and cover the remaining fondant with plastic wrap to prevent drying. Dust the work surface with confectioners\\u2019 sugar. Knead a few drops of brown gel food color into the portion until a light tan is achieved. If the fondant feels too dry, knead in 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable shortening. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and set aside to rest. Re-dust the work surface with confectioners\\u2019 sugar. Knead the remaining fondant with 1/4 teaspoon moss green gel food color until a consistent green hue is achieved. Roll the fondant to 1/8-inch thickness using a fondant rolling pin. Use a 2-inch fondant serrated leaf cutter to stamp as many \\u2018dragon scales\\u2019 from the fondant as possible. Transfer the scales to baking sheets lined with parchment paper and cover with plastic wrap so they don\\u2019t dry out. Re-roll the fondant and cut more scales. Repeat the process until all of the fondant is used. Roll out the tan fondant to 1/4-inch thickness and cut out a 6-inch circle with a 6-inch pastry cutter (or use a dessert plate as a template). Use a kitchen-dedicated paintbrush to lightly coat one side of the fondant with the simple syrup and then press it onto the bottom rounded part of the egg. Use the end of the paintbrush to pock the fondant. Use a butter knife to scrape irregular markings into the fondant to create a distressed appearance. Use the paintbrush to apply a small amount of simple syrup to the back of a fondant scale. Place the scale halfway over the edge of the 6-inch round of fondant. Repeat the process, overlapping the scales slightly. After the first row of scales is applied, begin the second row by placing a scale\\u2019s point between 2 scales of the first row. Repeat the process of brushing, applying and overlapping scales until the entire cake is covered. In 3 separate small cups, combine each of these food colors with a few drops of clear extract: emerald green, moss green and neon yellow. Lightly dip a clean brush into the emerald green food color mixture. Brush it onto the top third of the scaled portion of the cake. Dampen a food-dedicated 3-inch round sponge with water and wring out completely. Use the sponge to tap the color into the fondant, so that it has a mottled appearance. Repeat the process with the moss green food color on the middle third of the scales, followed by the yellow on the bottom third of the scales. Use the sponge to mottle color onto the distressed tan fondant. Use every color to create lots of color variation. Refrigerate the cake until the color is set and dry, about 15 minutes. Dip a dry soft-bristle paintbrush into the gold luster dust. Lightly brush over the scales to create a metallic shine. Slice the cake in front of your guests to reveal the fiery interior--then ENJOY! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 72233,&quot;Sugar Stained Glass Scant 5 cups or 1 kilo sugar 1 1/4 cups or 400 grams corn syrup 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons or 250 grams of water Scant 5 cups or 1 kilos sugar 1 1/4 cups or 400 grams corn syrup 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons or 250 grams water Cornets, method follows (at least 1 cornet per color) Food colors, assorted Royal icing, recipe follows 1 large egg white* 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar 1/2 lemon, juiced and strained Instructions: Place the sugar for the frame in a pan, insert a candy thermometer and begin to cook the sugar. It is ready when it reaches 320 degrees F. Have the line drawing ready and enlarged to the size you need. Have 4 heatproof spouted measuring cups in a warm oven, ready for your stained glass sugar.<br> Arrange 4 metal rulers on a silicone baking mat in the shape of a frame the same size as your drawing. Pour the cooked frame sugar inside the frame outline so that it is about 1/4-inch thick. When the sugar has cooled, place the line drawing on the work surface and remove the sugar sheet from the ruler frame and place it over the drawing. Place some Royal Icing into a cornet and use it to trace the outlines on top of the sugar frame.<br> When all of the outlines are drawn, place the ingredients for the stained glass in a pan, (this is your second batch of sugar) insert a candy thermometer and cook to 320 degrees F, divide the sugar evenly between the heatproof, warm measuring cups. Add a few drops of food color (pick colors that will work with your drawing) to each cup of sugar and stir with wooden skewers. It is best at this point to use some heavy cotton gloves to protect your hands. Pour 1 of the colors into a cornet and use it to fill in the spaces that you want to be that particular color. Use 1 color at a time. You can reheat the sugar in the microwave as long as it is in the measuring cups but you cannot reheat the sugar when it is in the paper cornet. When all of the spaces on your drawing have been filled to your satisfaction, you are ready to display your stained glass masterpiece! To make royal icing: Combine the egg white and powdered sugar in a medium-size mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium speed until opaque and shiny, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and continue whipping until completely incorporated, about 3 minutes. The lemon juice whitens the royal icing. The royal icing should be light, fluffy, and slightly stiff. You may need to adjust the consistency by adding more egg whites if the icing is too dry or more powdered sugar if it is too wet.<br> Place the royal icing in a small piping bag or paper cornet.<br> Yield: 2 cups How to Make a Cornet: From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations.<br> Cut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between 2 fingers of 1 hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side.<br> Release your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 72234,&quot;Chicken Thigh Anticuchos 6 dried aji panca cl peppers, stemmed, some seeds removed Kosher salt<br> 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon tamari 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean cl paste) 2 small cloves garlic<br> 1/2 tablespoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground 1/4 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano Freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 pounds skin-on, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes<br> Kosher salt 6 small serrano cl peppers, stemmed and seeded 1/2 small poblano cl pepper, stemmed and seeded 2 cups packed fresh cilantro, plus more for topping Juice of 3 limes Juice of 1/2 orange 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup mayonnaise (preferably Kewpie) Kosher salt Crushed peanuts, for topping Instructions: Make the aji panca puree: Put the aji panca chiles in a large bowl and cover with 1 1/2 cups boiling water.

Traditionally Brewed Soy Sauce 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1/2 cup Buffalo-style hot sauce 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar, such as Kikkoman? Rice Vinegar 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br> 2 scallions, sliced Flatbread, for serving Instructions: Prepare a grill for direct and indirect heat: For gas grills (with 3 or more burners), turn all the burners to medium-high heat; after about 15 minutes, turn off one of the side burners and turn the remaining burners down to medium. For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) If your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling. To spatchcock the chicken: Use kitchen shears to cut out the backbone from the chicken. Lay the chicken breast-side down on a cutting board and use a large knife to cut through the breastbone but not into the flesh. Push the chicken down to flatten it. Cut the wings off at the third joint (at the wing tip). Line a plate with paper towels and put the chicken on it skin-side down to dry the skin. Sprinkle the non-skin side generously with salt and pepper.<br> Oil the grill grates thoroughly. Put the chicken on the indirect-heat side of the grill skin-side down and top with a large cast-iron skillet.

Mix the oregano and paprika with some salt and pepper in a small bowl. Rub the spice mixture all over the pieces of chicken; marinate for 30 minutes so the flavor can sink in a bit. Heat the olive oil in a paella pan or wide shallow skillet over medium-high heat. Place the chicken in the pan, skin-side down and brown on all sides, turning with tongs. Add the chorizo and continue to cook until the oil is a vibrant red color. Remove the chicken and sausage to a platter lined with paper towels. Return the pan to the stove and lower the heat to medium. Make a sofrito by sauteing the garlic, onion, and tomatoes; cook until the mixture caramelizes a bit and the flavors meld; season with salt and pepper. Fold in the rice, stirring to coat the grains. Stir the saffron into the rice. Pour in the water and simmer for 10 minutes, gently moving the pan around so the rice cooks evenly and absorbs the liquid. Do not cover or constantly stir like risotto. Add the shrimp, lobster, clams, the reserved chicken, and the chorizo. Give the paella a couple of good stirs to tuck in all the pieces and just let it simmer, without stirring, until the rice is al dente, about 15 minutes. Scatter the peas on top and continue to cook for 5 minutes, until the paella looks fluffy and moist. The ideal paella has a toasted rice bottom called socarrat. Allow to rest, off the heat for 5 minutes, and garnish with parsley. Serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]</p><p>&quot; 72244,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Simple Stuffing One 12-ounce bag stuffing mix, such as Pepperidge Farm 1/4 cup loosely packed chopped fresh parsley 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 cup chopped celery<br> 1 cup chopped onions<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme<br> 5 to 6 fresh sage leaves, chopped 4 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 1/2 cups turkey or chicken stock<br> 8 ounces sausage, sauteed 1 green bell pepper, chopped and sauteed<br> 1 red bell pepper, chopped and sauteed<br> 1 yellow bell pepper, chopped and sauteed<br> 8 large oysters (about 1 cup) 2 hard-boiled eggs, coarsely chopped 1 cup dried apricots, diced 1 bulb fennel, sliced and sauteed<br> 1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped 2 apples, diced<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Lightly grease a 6-inch cast-iron skillet with canola oil spray. Remove the biscuits from the package and lay them out on a clean work surface. Gently pull the layers apart at the middle to divide the biscuits in half. Gently pull each of the halves apart so you are left with four thin, round biscuits each (32 in all). Don&#39;t worry if any biscuits tear: just press the torn pieces back together. Place 1 teaspoon of the mozzarella in the center of each biscuit round; you will use about 1 1/2 cups of the mozzarella for this. Fold the dough around the cheese and roll into balls. Arrange the balls in a circle around the edge of the prepared skillet, then work your way in until you have completely filled the cast-iron pan with the dough balls. If you start to run out of room as you get closer to the center of the skillet, gently push the dough from the center towards the edges of the pan to make more space. Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Once melted, stir in the scallions, garlic, red pepper and salt. Cook until the butter is just beginning to brown and the garlic is lightly toasted and very fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vinegar. Pour the melted butter evenly over the top of the dough and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella. Bake until the dough is cooked through and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.

Add in the onion, green pepper and garlic. Saute for 3 minutes to soften the vegetables. Then, add the tomato paste and cumin and cook until a deep reddish-brown color is achieved. Stir in the tomatoes and cook until they become tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in the broth and the beans, bring everything to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the gravy thickens slightly, about 15 minutes. (Chef&#39;s Note: The consistency will be soupy.) Adjust the seasonings with salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste. For the faux-fongo: Heat 2-inches of vegetable oil in a deep skillet to 360 degrees F. Cut the plantains into 2-inch pieces, then remove their skins with a knife by cutting through a corner of the flesh along the length of the slice to get a lead, then peel the fruit. Fry the plantains, in batches, in the oil until when tapped with a metal spoon it sounds hard, about 8 minutes. Transfer the pieces to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat with remaining plantains. Sandwich the plantains between parchment paper and, using a small plate or a coffee mug, press them so they are about 1/2-inch thick. Fry the plantains again at 360 degrees F until crisp and golden, then transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to cool slightly. Add the fried plantains to a food processor. Combine them with the bacon, bacon fat, and garlic, then pulse until everything is blended, but still chunky. (Chef&#39;s Note: The texture should be a mix of crunchy, moist and tender.) Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt, if needed. To serve, spoon in enough Faux-Fongo to fill a 6-ounce ramekin and press the mixture down well. Invert the portion onto a plate and ladle the gravy around it.

Add the nuts and dried fruit and pulse until the fruit is coarsely chopped and the nuts are broken into small pieces. (If the paneer is not salted, add a pinch of salt.) Transfer the paneer mixture to a small bowl. Form the mashed potato mixture into 8 equal balls. (A kitchen scale isn\\u2019t necessary, but is helpful.) Form the paneer mixture into 8 equal balls. They don\\u2019t have to be perfectly shaped, but it is much easier to stuff the potato balls when the paneer mixture has been squished into little balls.<br> Hold a potato ball in the palm of your hand. Make an indentation with your thumb. Place a paneer ball into the concave hollow and push it in gently. Pinch the potato mixture around it and roll the potato ball in your palm to make a nice round shape. Repeat with the remaining potato and paneer balls.

Once browned on all sides, add enough water to cover the roast along with the 1 sliced onion and about 6 cloves of garlic. Cook until the meat is fork tender and comes apart with no resistance, about 2 hours. When done, remove the roast to a platter to cool, reserve the beef broth. Hand shred the meat and set aside. To prepare the sauce, remove the tops of the dried chilies and shake out most of the seeds. Place the chilies in a large stockpot and cover them with water. Add the cumin, remaining sliced onion and garlic. Boil for 20 minutes until the chiles are very soft. Transfer the chiles to a blender using tongs and add a ladle full of the cl water (it is best to do this in batches.) Puree the chiles until smooth. Pass the pureed chiles through a strainer to remove the remaining seeds and skins. Pour the chili sauce into a large bowl and add salt, stir to incorporate. Taste to check seasonings, add more if necessary. Add the shredded beef to the bowl of chili sauce, and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate until ready to use. Go through the dried cornhusks, separate them and discard the silk, be careful since the husks are fragile when dry. Soak them in a sink filled with warm water for 30 minutes to soften. In a deep bowl, combine the masa, baking powder, and salt. Pour the broth into the masa a little at a time, working it in with your fingers. In a small bowl, beat the vegetable shortening until fluffy. Add it to the masa and beat until the dough has a spongy texture. Rinse, drain, and dry the corn husks. Set them out on a sheet pan covered by a damp towel along with the bowls of masa dough and beef in chili sauce. Start with the largest husks because they are easier to roll. Lay the husk flat on a plate or in your hand with the smooth side up and the narrow end facing you. Spread a thin, even layer of masa over the surface of the husk with a tablespoon dipped in water. Do not use too much! Add about a tablespoon of the meat filling in the center of the masa. Fold the narrow end up to the center then fold both sides together to enclose the filling. The sticky masa will form a seal. Pinch the wide top closed. Stand the tamales up in a large steamer or colander with the pinched end up. Load the steamer into a large pot filled with 2-inches of water. The water should not touch the tamales. Lay a damp cloth over the tamales and cover with lid. Keep the water at a low boil, checking periodically to make sure the water doesn&#39;t boil away. Steam the tamales for 2 hours. The tamales are done when the inside pulls away from the husk. The tamale should be soft, firm and not mushy. To serve, unfold the husk and spoon about a tablespoon of remaining beef filling on top. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 72288,&quot;Pan Roasted Lobster with Cava Butter Sauce and Salsa Verde Rice 4 live lobsters (1 1/2 to 2 pounds each) Olive oil Salt and pepper 2 shallots, finely chopped 2 cups Cava 2 tablespoons champagne vinegar 2 tablespoons heavy cream 3 sticks very cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes Salt and freshly ground white pepper 1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon 1/4 cup olive oil 3 tomatillos, papery skins removed, roughly chopped 3 tablespoons chopped parsley 3 tablespoons chopped basil 3 tablespoons chopped tarragon 3 tablespoons water 3 cloves garlic, chopped 1/2 cup white wine 3 cups clam juice 1 lemon, juiced Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself. Cut sugar of different flavors. Pull into long ropes. Put together side-to-side. Roll into a big cigar. Pull the sugar to make it a little thinner. When thin, start to roll into a spiral. You can twist the sugar to give it another look. Trim off the end. Insert the stick. Set aside and let it cool. Use any colors, any flavors, and any size. Wrap in plastic and tie with a bow to preserve them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 72314,&quot;Branzino Alla Max 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 (8 ounce) sea bass or branzino fillets Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 red pepper, seeded and coarsely chopped 1 purple onion, coarsely chopped 1 zucchini, coarsely chopped Fresh parsley, finely chopped, for garnish Sweet Sour Sauce 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons honey Instructions: In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and add the sea bass fillets.

Split open baguettes, giving you tops and bottoms for each piece. Spread mayonnaise on the tops and bottoms. Add 3 to 4 thin slices jalapeno to the bottom. Place the desired amount of Duck Confit on top of that, then top with Pickled Slaw. Top with 3 to 4 thin slices cucumber and a sprinkling of cilantro. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Break down the duck by removing the legs, thighs, breast and wings. Discard the carcass (or reserve for a stock). Place the duck pieces in a deep roasting pan and cover with the lard, smoothing it over the duck with a spatula or gloved hands. Add the chopped garlic, peppercorns, salt and bay leaves. Roast for 4 hours, then transfer the pan to the top shelf of your fridge. Let cool completely, 4 to 6 hours. Once cooked, pull meat from the bones, shredding it as you remove it, and discard the bones. Meanwhile, place vinegar, sugar, cl flakes and sliced garlic in a pan over medium heat. Let slowly boil until reduced to a third of the original amount, about 1 hour. Remove from heat. Warm a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the shredded duck until it is heated to approximately 145 degrees F, 6 to 8 minutes.

Allow the yeast to proof for about 5 minutes, (bubbles will form around the outer edges). Add the oil, flour, and salt. Begin processing or mixing the ingredients, slowly pouring in the remaining 1 cup of water. Mix until the dough balls together and is shiny and elastic, about 5 minutes. Add a little olive oil to a large bowl and spread evenly around the bowl to prevent the dough from sticking. Add the dough, cover with plastic wrap and put in a warm spot (I use the microwave oven) for about 2 hours. Punch the dough down and let it rise again, about another 2 hours. I prefer to make my dough early in the day for evening dinner or a day ahead. Sauce: Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer over medium-low heat until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 30 minutes. I use 2 ovens when I cook my pizzas, 1 oven is preheated to 450 degrees F with a \\Hearth-kit\\ in it, and the other oven is preheated at 500 degrees F with a pizza stone. Heat the stones for at least 1 hour before baking pizzas. Assembly: Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll out dough until very thin and cannot be rolled further. Sprinkle about 1/2 teaspoon of polenta onto a pizza peel. Put the dough on the peel and spread 1/2 tablespoon of oil all around the edges. Add 1/4 cup of pizza sauce to the middle of the dough and spread it to the outer edges, leaving about a 1-inch margin. Sprinkle the sauce with the mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheeses. Top with crumbled sausage and drizzle the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil over the pizza. Bake for 10 minutes in the 450 degree F oven. (If using only 1 oven, raise the heat to 500 degrees F.) Remove the pizza from the oven and top with the cooked crawfish. Put the pizza in the 500 degree F oven and cook until the top is golden brown and bubbling, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pizzas to a cutting board and slice. Arrange on a serving platter and serve. \\Mangia, mangia. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 72335,&quot;Thai Soup 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 shallot, peeled and sliced 1 (2-inch piece) ginger, sliced 2 fresh serrano chiles seeded, sliced (wear gloves) 4 stalks lemon grass, white part sliced Juice and coarse zest of 1 lime 2 tablespoons fish sauce 8 cups chicken stock 1 pound medium/large shrimp, shelled 1/4 pound enoki mushrooms Salt and white pepper, to taste Garnish: cilantro sprigs Instructions: Heat a wok and coat with vegetable oil.

Stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees F. Coat a saute pan with the olive oil and place over medium heat. When the oil gets hazy, add the onion and garlic, cook and stir for 5 minutes to soften. Add the olives, capers, and some hand torn basil. Carefully add the tomatoes (nothing splashes like tomatoes), cook and stir until the liquid is cooked down and the sauce is thick, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper and then take it off the stove. Spread the sugo sauce evenly on the crust with a ladle. Rip the mozzarella into pieces with your hands and distribute them on top; scatter some basil leaves all around. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp, and the cheese is bubbly. Garnish with even more fresh basil before serving. In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water; stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. Turn the mixer on low and add the salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the flour, a little at a time, mixing at the lowest speed until all the flour has been incorporated. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium; stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough by squeezing a small amount together: if it&#39;s crumbly, add more water; if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour - 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix until the dough gathers into a ball, this should take about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times; kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a round and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it over to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e. over a gas pilot light) until doubled in size, about 1 hour. This is a good time to stick a pizza stone in the oven and preheat them to 500 degrees F. Once the dough is domed and spongy, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter. Roll and stretch the dough into a cylinder and divide into 3 equal pieces. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes so it will be easier to roll out. Roll or pat out a piece of dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick. Dust a pizza paddle with flour and slide it under the pizza dough. Brush the crust with a thin layer of olive oil, and top with your favorite flavors. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and crisp. Repeat with the remaining dough. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 72341,&quot;Bucatini with Rose Red Pepper Sauce and Shrimp 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 pound large peeled and deveined shrimp, tails on Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 large red bell peppers, diced 1 red onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, sliced 4 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 cup dry rose wine 1/2 cup heavy cream One 12-ounce package dried bucatini Instructions: Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Toss with sesame oil. In a mixing bowl add ice cubes and 1 egg and scramble with fingers. Add half of water and baking soda and stir with fingers. Slowly add flour until it forms a loose batter: do not over work -- flour will not be totally incorporated. Add pinch of salt. Bring peanut or corn oil for frying to 350 degrees F. Place shrimp one at a time into batter, coat and place in oil. Cook until floating and golden, approximately1 to 2 mintutes, depending on size of shrimp. Salt lightly and place on towel to dry. Using a rolling mat, place 1 sheet of nori, shiny smooth side down. Apply one finger tip of wasabi on nori, then start layering vegetables. Lay leaves of spinach on lower half of sheet and place carrots, squash, then 2 shrimp on next,tails facing outward. Finish with a layer of soba noodles, red cabbage and scallions. Take bottom edge of nori sheet and begin to roll sheet. When you can tuck the edge on first rotation, bring the mat up to help finish rolling. Using one hand, hold top of nori to keep roll tight. With the other hand pull gently as you roll. When 1/2-inch from top, place water on finger tips and dampen slightly top edge of nori. This will help nori to adhere to itself. Place aside with finished edge side down. Repeat this process, then slice into bite- size pieces.

Let sit until slightly set, 5 minutes. Whip the cream in another large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Add the cocoa powder and mix on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 1 minute. Transfer one-third of the whipped cream to the pudding and whisk until fully incorporated, then carefully fold in the remaining whipped cream with a rubber spatula. Divide half of the pudding mixture among 6 clear cups or glasses (each 9 fluid ounces), filling them about halfway. Top each cup with 1 heaping tablespoon of the crushed cookies, then nestle 2 or 3 gummy worms and 3 or 4 candy eyeballs into the \\u201cdirt,\\u201d against the side of the cup so they are visible. Layer each cup with another heaping tablespoon of the crushed cookies and about 1/3 cup of the remaining pudding, then finish with 2 more heaping tablespoons of the crushed cookies. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Line a baking sheet with kitchen towels. To make the spiderwebs, fill a large bowl with crushed ice and a small amount of water. Press the ice down so the surface is as flat as possible. Transfer the melted wafers to a piping bag fitted with a medium round tip (or a resealable plastic bag with one corner snipped off). Pipe into the ice bath 4 intersecting lines to create a 3-inch asterisk, then pipe a circle just inside the asterisk and a smaller circle inside the first circle. Let the spiderweb set for 10 to 15 seconds then gently transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat to make 8 spiderwebs; since they are fragile it is good to have a couple extra. To make the spiders, arrange the gummy bears flat-side up. Use kitchen shears to snip 3 narrow triangles out of each short end, creating 4 legs on both sides of each spider. Place a spiderweb on each dirt cup then top with a gummy spider.

Grease a 13 by 17-inch sheet pan and line the bottom and sides with parchment or waxed paper. Sift together the 3 cups sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Transfer to a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or use a hand mixer) and blend briefly. Whisk together the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl and add to the dry ingredients and mix at low speed for 5 minutes. Gradually add the hot water, mixing at low speed just until combined. The batter will be quite thin. Pour the batter into the pan. Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean (a few crumbs are okay) and the center feels firm to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan. Chill, covered, until ready to build the cake. Make room in your freezer for a serving platter that you&#39;ll build the cake on. Place a piece of parchment over the entire cake and flip it out onto another sheet pan. Peel off the original parchment and cut the cake in half so you have 2 pieces 13 by 8 1/2 inches. Place a piece of cake on a rectangular serving platter and schmear the ice cream on it all the way to the edges. Smooth it out with an offset spatula and place back in the freezer. After it has chilled 15 minutes or so place the second layer of cake on top, cover with parchment paper and press down with a sheet pan gently to stick the top layer. Return to the freezer while you make the chocolate topping. In a small saucepan, heat the 1 cup of cream and once it comes to a boil pour it over the chopped semisweet chocolate and whisk to make a smooth ganache. Do the same with the remaining 1/2 cup of cream and the white chocolate, adding the mint extract and green coloring to make a light mint green color then place it in small pastry bag with a small plain tip. Remove the cake from the freezer and working quickly spread the chocolate ganache over the surface of the cake smoothing it with an offset spatula. Drizzle lines of the green ganache over the entire surface of the cake at diagonal. Take a toothpick and run it back and forth in the opposite direction to draw it through the ganache and make decorative pattern. Return to the freezer until ready to serve.

Add the mushrooms and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the moisture has evaporated from the mushrooms, 12 to 15 minutes (make sure to cook out all the moisture or your pastry will not become crisp). Add the sherry vinegar and cook 1 more minute. Season with the kosher salt and pepper and let cool completely. Lay out a few sheets of paper towels and pat dry the filet cubes. Heat the olive oil in a large cast-iron pan over high heat. In batches if necessary, sear all sides of the meat cubes, about 45 seconds per side. Remove from the pan and let rest until cool, then brush on all sides with the Dijon mustard. On a baking sheet, lay out a half slice of prosciutto and spread with a thin layer of the mushroom mixture. Place a filet cube in the center and wrap the prosciutto around it. Repeat with the remaining prosciutto, mushroom mixture and filet cubes. Wrap the baking sheet with plastic wrap and pop it in the freezer for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut sixteen 2-inch squares from the pastry. Put a prosciutto-wrapped filet cube in the middle of each puff pastry square. Bring the corners together and seal, using water if necessary to get the pastry to stick together. Place the Wellingtons seam-side down on the lined baking sheet. Beat the egg with 1 teaspoon water, then brush the pastry with the egg wash. Sprinkle with some sea salt. Bake until golden, about 5 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72394,&quot;Simple Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette 2 bags ready to use mesclun greens Pinch salt Freshly ground black pepper Balsamic Vinaigrette, recipe follows 1 pint grape tomatoes 1 yellow bell pepper, seeded, halved and thinly sliced 1 shallot, peeled and roughly chopped 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1 cup olive oil Instructions: Toss the greens, salt and pepper together with just enough vinaigrette to coat, about 1/2 cup. Place them in a decorative bowl and top with the grape tomatoes and bell pepper. Serve the remaining vinaigrette on the side. Put the shallot and basil into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse until the shallot is finely chopped. Add the balsamic, sugar, salt and pepper and pulse again. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a steady stream through the feed tube. Pour the vinaigrette into a small bowl and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 72395,&quot;Linzer Bars 1/2 pound whole shelled hazelnuts 1 cup cake flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 pound unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into chunks 1 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1 egg 1 1/2 cups raspberry jam Powdered sugar, for decorating Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Position the rack in the middle of the oven. Spread hazelnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven until golden, about 10 minutes. Turn oven off since you will not need it on again for at least 45 minutes. Empty nuts onto a folded towel, enclosing them between the folds, and rub them to remove their skins. Transfer the nuts to a strainer and carefully discard the skins. Allow nuts to cool to room temperature. Put the hazelnuts in a food processor fitted with the stainless-steel blade and pulse a few times. Add cake flour and process until the nuts are finely ground. Set aside. In a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter, sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and lemon zest on medium speed until light and creamy. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Over medium speed, add the egg and continue mixing for 1 more minute. Reduce the speed to low, add the hazelnut-flour mixture, and continue mixing until well blended into a smooth dough. Divide the dough into 2 portions, with 1 portion about 8 ounces or 1/3 of the dough. Transfer to a medium pastry bag fitted with a number 1 plain tip and set aside. With the remaining 2/3 of the dough (about 20 ounces), form into a 1-inch flat disc. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. With a marking pen, trace a 16 by 13-inch rectangle shape on parchment paper. Place paper, marked side down, onto a baking sheet. With the reserved dough in the pastry bag, pipe straight parallel lines, about 1-inch apart, inside the marked rectangle. Then pipe a second set of parallel lines at a 45 degree angle to the first set of lines to make a trellis shape. Refrigerate until needed (dough should be well chilled before using). With more cake flour, lightly dust a pastry board or work surface with flour. With a rolling pin, roll out the dough to a rectangular shape, about 15 by 12 inches by 1/4-inch thick. Transfer dough to a parchment lined baking sheet and trim any excess dough to make an even rectangle. Bake for 20 minutes, or until dough starts to color. Remove baking sheet from the oven and transfer to a rack. Leave oven on. Allow dough to cool for at least 10 minutes. Spread raspberry jam over the entire surface of the cooled dough. Carefully place the refrigerated trellis-shaped dough over the jam. Return to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, or until crust is golden in color. Allow to cool completely before cutting. Trim edges and then cut into 3 by 1-inch bars. Lightly dust bars with powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 72396,&quot;BBQ Brisket Sandwich with Caraway Coleslaw 1 cup ketchup 1 cup red wine<br> 1/2 cup tomato paste<br> 2 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons dry mustard<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne<br> 4 pounds brisket 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper Pretzel Challah Buns, homemade or store-bought, recipe follows 1/2 green cabbage, thinly sliced (about 4 cups) 1/4 red cabbage, thinly sliced (about 2 cups) Kosher salt<br> 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds<br> Freshly ground black pepper 4 carrots, cut into matchsticks (about 1 1/2 cups) 1/2 sweet onion, thinly sliced (about 1 cup) 3 1/2 cups (448 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/4 cup (50 grams) sugar<br> 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 envelope) instant yeast<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 cup (178 grams) warm water, 105 to 110 degrees F 1/3 cup (66 grams) flavorless oil, plus more for the bowl 3 large eggs<br> 1 cup (230 grams) baking soda<br> Coarse pretzel salt, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: For the BBQ sauce: Add the ketchup, wine, tomato paste, brown sugar, Worcestershire, mustard, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne to the pot of a multi-cooker or slow cooker. For the brisket: Season the brisket with the salt and some pepper and add to the pot with the BBQ sauce, coating the brisket in the sauce. Cook until tender, on high for 4 to 5 hours or on slow cook for 8 to 10 hours. While the brisket is cooking, prepare the coleslaw. For the caraway coleslaw: Toss together the green and red cabbage with 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl and massage to soften; set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, mustard, caraway, 1/4 teaspoon salt and some pepper. Pour over the cabbage mixture, add the carrots and onions and toss to combine. Keep in the fridge until ready to serve. When the brisket is tender, remove it from the pot and rest the meat for 10 minutes. Cut slices against the grain. While the meat is resting, reduce the sauce. If you are using a multi-cooker, set to simmer for about 10 minutes to thicken. If you are using a slow cooker, remove the sauce to a small saucepot and reduce until thickened, about 10 minutes. Slice the buns, toast them and spread some of the BBQ sauce on each slice. Top with the sliced brisket and coleslaw. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt. Whisk to combine. In a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, oil and 2 of the eggs. Beat to mix and pour into the dry ingredients. Stir to form a dough. Knead either in the stand mixer or by hand on a floured surface, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking, until smooth and just slightly sticky, 7 to 10 minutes. Grease the inside of a large clean bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover with a towel and let the dough rise until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. While the dough is rising, bake the baking soda. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Spread the baking soda out on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 1 hour. Let it cool and set it aside (even though the baked baking soda isn&#39;t as strong as lye, it could potentially irritate your skin, so avoid touching it once it&#39;s out of the oven). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Split the dough into 8 equal portions and keep it covered when you&#39;re not working with it. Working with one piece of dough at a time, stretch it into a ball by tucking the top surface under and pinching to seal, then place it on a baking sheet. Continue with the remaining dough pieces, placing them 1 1/2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Cover and let rise for 20 more minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Place the baked baking soda in a large bowl or casserole dish and add 2 cups (472 grams) of water. Stir it to dissolve the baking soda. (I&#39;ve never been able to get all of it to dissolve, so a few baking soda chunks are totally ok as long as they don&#39;t stick to the dough.) Whisk together the remaining egg with a splash of water for the egg wash; set aside. Using gloved hands or tongs and working in batches, immerse the rolls in the baking soda bath for about 2 minutes on both sides. Pat them dry with a paper towel and place them back on the baking sheet. Brush with the egg wash and sprinkle with coarse pretzel salt. Cut 2 shallow slits in an X shape on top and bake until golden brown; begin checking for doneness at 16 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 72397,&quot;Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Cake 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans 2 1/4 cups cake flour, plus more for the pans 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 4 large eggs 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3/4 cup whole milk 1 pint strawberry ice cream 1 pint vanilla chocolate chip ice cream 4 cups strawberries (about 2 pints), hulled and quartered 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 cups cold heavy cream 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment and butter the parchment. Lightly dust the pans with flour and tap out any excess. Whisk the cake flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides and beat in the eggs one at a time. Beat in 1 tablespoon vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until the batter is just combined, about 20 seconds (do not overbeat). Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cake is just golden and springs back when gently pressed, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 20 minutes in the pans, then turn out onto the rack, remove the parchment and let cool completely. Meanwhile, remove the ice cream from the freezer and let soften slightly. Combine both flavors in a large bowl and stir together with a rubber spatula. Line one of the cooled cake pans with plastic wrap and fill with the ice cream in an even layer. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm but not rock solid, about 45 minutes. Uncover the ice cream and invert onto one of the cake layers; discard the plastic wrap. Top with the second cake layer, gently pressing it into the ice cream. Smooth the sides with an offset spatula. Freeze until firm, at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, pulse 2 cups strawberries in a food processor until liquefied. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing with a rubber spatula; set the puree aside. Combine the remaining 2 cups strawberries, remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and the lemon juice in a small bowl; toss. Combine the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and remaining 2 teaspoons vanilla in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Beat in the strawberry puree. Remove the cake from the freezer and frost with the strawberry whipped cream. Return to the freezer until the whipped cream hardens, at least 45 minutes or overnight. Top with the macerated strawberries. Let the cake soften 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 72398,&quot;Spiced Crabs and Shrimp With Potatoes 2 tablespoons dill seeds 2 tablespoons dried dill 2 tablespoons mustard seeds 2 tablespoons chili powder 2 tablespoons sweet paprika 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons white peppercorns 2 teaspoons celery seeds 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 3 bay leaves 10 sprigs thyme 1/2 bunch parsley 1 head garlic, cut in half horizontally 4 leafy stalks celery, halved crosswise Kosher salt 12 live jumbo blue crabs or 6 Dungeness crabs 1 1/2 pounds new potatoes 2 pounds extra-large shrimp (unpeeled) Melted butter, for dipping Instructions: Combine the dill seeds, dried dill, mustard seeds, chili powder, paprika, coriander seeds, peppercorns, celery seeds, red pepper flakes and bay leaves in a small bowl. Transfer to a blender or spice grinder in batches and pulse until coarsely ground. Fill a large deep pot with 8 quarts water. Add the spice mixture, thyme, parsley, garlic, celery and 1/4 cup salt. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Uncover, reduce the heat and simmer, 30 minutes. Meanwhile, put the crabs in a large colander in the sink. Holding each crab with tongs, run under cold water to wash away sand. Transfer to a large container of ice water and soak 15 minutes. (This relaxes the crabs and helps remove the grit.) Remove the crabs and discard the water. If the crabs are still sandy, repeat. Bring the spiced broth to a boil over high heat. Wrap the potatoes in cheesecloth and tie closed. Add the crabs to the broth, then the potatoes; cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until the crab shells are bright red, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the potatoes after 15 minutes. Transfer the crabs to a platter or newspaper with tongs, letting the excess liquid drain into the pot. Let sit at least 5 minutes before eating. Meanwhile, add the shrimp to the pot, stir once and cook until the shells are pink, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon. Season the crabs, shrimp and potatoes with salt. Serve with melted butter and the broth, for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 72399,&quot;Spinach and Feta Rugelach 10 ounces frozen chopped spinach 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1 small onion, finely chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 to 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> 3/4 cup crumbled feta 3 tablespoons heavy cream<br> 1 teaspoon lemon juice<br> A few shakes hot sauce<br> One 14.1-ounce box refrigerated rolled pie crusts (2 crusts total) or 2 homemade rounds pie dough 1 large egg yolk, beaten with a splash of water<br> Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Set the frozen spinach out on a plate at room temperature to soften slightly. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and a few turns of black pepper and cook until fragrant, 1 more minute. Add the flour and stir to combine, then stir in the spinach and a good pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until the spinach is heated through and the mixture is combined. Stir in the feta, heavy cream, lemon juice and hot sauce, then remove it from the heat. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. Roll out half of the pie dough on a lightly floured surface until it is a large round, about 1/4 inch thick. (If using store-bought pre-rolled dough, simply unroll it onto your surface.) Spread on half the spinach mixture in an even layer so that it covers the dough. Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut the dough like a pizza into 8 triangular wedges. Roll up each section starting at the wide end. Transfer the rugelach to the lined baking sheets, placing them 1 inch apart. Repeat with the other half of the dough and spinach filling. Lightly brush the tops with egg wash and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly and enjoy.

In a large Dutch oven, or other heavy pot that has a tight cover, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over moderately high heat. Add the garlic and the beef to the pot, browning the meat on all sides, taking the time to get a nice crust on the outside. Add the onion and allow to lightly brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, plus 1 tomato can of water, spices, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add enough water to cover the meat. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer with a lid for 3 hours until the meat is fork tender. Let meat cool in the liquid. Shred meat and set aside. Heat a large pot of oil over medium heat. When oil reaches 350 degrees F, fry the corn tortillas 1 at a time. Place the tortilla in the oil and wait about 30 seconds. Then use the handle of a wooden spoon to press down into the center of the tortilla and fold it in the middle. Hold down for a few seconds waiting for the tortilla to form into taco shell and then drain on paper towels. Season with salt. To make salsa, pulse all the ingredients, except the tomato juice, in a food processor. Add the reserved tomato juice if the salsa is too thick. Drizzle salsa with olive oil, cover with plastic wrap and set aside, allowing the flavors to marry. To assemble the tacos: Lay some shredded cabbage as a base. Top with some shredded beef. Serve alongside Guacamole and salsa. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves. Halve and pit the avocados. With a tablespoon, scoop out the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash the avocados using either a fork or potato masher, leaving them still a bit chunky. Add the remaining ingredients, and fold everything together. Drizzle with a little olive oil, adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and give it 1 final mix with a fork. Lay a piece of plastic wrap tight on the surface of the guacamole so it doesn&#39;t brown and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Barbera, Grenache]&quot; 72411,&quot;Mustard Mayo 1 1/2 cups good mayonnaise 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 1/2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard 1/3 cup sour cream 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Whisk the mayonnaise, mustards, sour cream and salt together in a small bowl.

Add the shortening and water, work them in with your hands to make a soft, pliable dough. Add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the dough feels too dry. Gather the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Put the dough in the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour so it will firm up a bit and be easier to roll and cut. (Dough can be prepared 1 day ahead, refrigerated.) Unwrap the ball of dough and put on a lightly floured surface, cut in half. With a floured rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a circle, about 1/4-inch thickness. Using a paring knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into triangles as you would a pizza. You should end up with 6 or 8 triangles per circle. Heat 2-inches of oil to 375 degrees F in a heavy skillet or deep pot over medium-high heat. Fry a few of the sopapillas at a time, keeping an eye on maintaining the oil temperature. As the sopapillas puff up and rise to the surface, flip them over with a slotted spoon, skimmer, or chopsticks; about 2 minutes on each side. Carefully remove the sopapillas from the oil and drain on several layers of paper towels or a brown paper bag. Cool slightly. Serve hot with honey or cinnamon sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 72415,&quot;Slow-Cooker White Bean Soup 1 1/4 cups dried cannellini beans, picked over and rinsed 3 carrots, roughly chopped 3 stalks celery, roughly chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 15-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth 2 bay leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 ears corn, shucked 4 ounces Black Forest ham, diced 3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, plus more for topping Instructions: Combine the beans, carrots, celery and garlic in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker.

In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, basil, tarragon, salt, and pepper. Add the croutons and toss well. Divide tomato mixture among 4 plates. Top each serving with an equal amount of the arugula. With a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan over the salad. Serve immediately. Michael&#39;s Notes: I&#39;ve used basil and tarragon here, but you can use any herbs you like. Parsley and marjoram come to mind as good alternatives. 1/4 cup unsalted butter 1 tablespoon minced garlic 6 cups crustless cubed day-old bread (1/2-inch cubes) Sea salt, preferably gray salt, and freshly ground black pepper 6 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and preheat a cookie sheet in it. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook until it foams. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the bread cubes and toss to coat with the butter. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle with the cheese and toss again while warm to melt the cheese. Bake, stirring once or twice, until the croutons are crisp and lightly colored on the outside but still soft within, about 8 or 9 minutes. Let cool. Store in an airtight container. Michael&#39;s Notes: I use a serrated knife to remove the crust from day-old bread, then switch to a chef&#39;s knife to cut the cubes because it doesn&#39;t tear the bread. Also note that I recommend grating the Parmesan finely so that it will stick to the bread better. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 72426,&quot;Greek Meatball Hero 1 cup breadcrumbs 1 cup milk<br> 2 pounds ground beef<br> 1 cup crumbled feta<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan<br> 1 tablespoon dried oregano<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br> 2 eggs<br> 2 plum tomatoes, diced 1 English cucumber, diced<br> 1 red onion, thinly sliced<br> 3 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> Salt<br> 4 hero rolls<br> 8 ounces homemade or store-bought tzatziki Instructions: For the meatballs: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
