Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows firm, plush flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sour cherry candy tartness that's clean and piquant in the mouth.

Green is the dominant characteristic, from front to back.","designation":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"nz","description":"The bouquet here is confounding. It has some green vegetable and cat-pee qualities as well as white stone fruits, sulfur and popcorn. In a word, it's complicated. In the mouth, grapefrut and celery flavors mingle with green grapes, while on the back end it's chalky and rather tart. The overall acidity is high, and there's one important thing missing here: balance.","designation":"Marlborough"},{"country":"US","description":"Hailing from an emerging region northeast of Napa Valley, this SB is heavily oaked, and thus features big batches of butter and toast.

But it has positive qualities, including a rich and pleasant mouthfeel.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Wheat grass and hot peppers make for an intriguing if odd bouquet. A fair amount of vegetal flavor carries onto the palatemostly green beans and some pickle.

Ultimately, however, this wine is characterized more by its vegetal character than bright, clean fruit.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"There's a hint of saline or wet dog in the nose, and that keeps the wine from really taking off from the runway.

Oak is good, but still overshadows the fruit.","designation":"Casablanca Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Any SB boasting 14.5% alcohol is going to come across as being real big, and this one does for sure.

There's also a forest's worth of oak here, which makes it heavy rather than balanced.","designation":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Wipe away all Pinot preconceptions based on Burgundy, Oregon or elsewhere. This is the Tuscan version, and it has its own character, which is ripe, forward, hot and spicy, and overall much closer in style to the native Sangiovese than to typical Pinot. Racy acids pump loads of cranberry fruit, backed by a forest of spice-laden vanilla oak.","designation":"Tuscany"},{"country":"fr","description":"Aromas of spiced apples, lemon, mustard seed and mineral make for an attractive nose, but the palate is a tad tart, featuring mostly lemon, green apple and citrus rind. In general, it's light, lean and probably better as an aperitif than as an accompaniment to fine food.","designation":"Loire Valley"},{"country":"fr","description":"Honey, orange blossom and a little mustard make up the nose of this classic Loire Valley SB.

Made by Mia Klein of Etude fame.","designation":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"From a very warm site in pear country comes this Cabernet/Merlot blend.

There is a boatload of asparagus and green pepper to the nose, and in the mouth the fruit element, meaning papaya and mild citrus, gets gobbled up by a potent blast of green flavors. The finish is spicy and dry, but it's also heavy with the taste of green peas. Was ripeness a problem here? Seems like it was","designation":"California"},{"country":"nz","description":"Passion fruit and melon vie for attention on the bouquet with grassy, vegetal, herbaceous scents. In the mouth, citrus and dry Asian pear flavors intermingle with additional grassy, asparagus tones. The acids on the back end are intense, so the tang and zip on the finish is powerful. The biggest problem here is a persistent vegetal quality that won't let up.","designation":"Marlborough"},{"country":"US","description":"Strange aromas of chewing gum, silly putty, green beans and turnip make for an unconventional bouquet.

The roughly 50/50 mix of new and once-used barrels adds baking chocolate, licorice and charred toast to the finish; well-integrated and buttressed with crisp acids.
