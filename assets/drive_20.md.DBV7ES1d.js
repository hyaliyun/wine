seductive and oaky, but it subsides with time to integrate with the ripe melon, mango and yellow peach scents. developed and slightly honeyed, the palate is lush and round. almond, honeysuckle and soft sweet spice flavors stay through the long close. tasty now, but should age nicely through 2015.","designation":"Honeybunch Reserve"},{"country":"il","description":"this wine has a bouquet of cassis, violet and black pepper. well-integrated flavors of cassis, strawberry preserves, anise, fennel bulb and lavender are set amid silky tannins that feel as if they may go on forever but are surpassed at the finish when fruit flavors pull out all the stops.","designation":"Namura Single Vineyard Special Reserve"},{"country":"de","description":"verging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of de's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar. dried apricot aromas lead into orange marmalade flavors with an almost burnt, caramelized quality. finishes long, with a hint of bitterness that helps balance some of the intense sweetness.","designation":"Beerenauslese"},{"country":"us","description":"although it is not entirely laced together, this substantial wine makes a good impression with its ripe purple fruits and strong vanilla and coffee and coconut barrel notes. big flavors and firm tannins create an impression of strength and weight; what the wine lacks in finesse it makes up for in muscle. it's chunky and rough-hewn, but carries plenty of flavor. screwcap.","designation":"First Class"},{"country":"it","description":"made with 60% merlot and 40% cabernet sauvignon, this has a shy nose that eventually gives up whiffs of plum and scorched earth. the simple and zesty palate delivers black-skinned fruit and a hint of cedar. enjoy soon.","designation":"Zizzolo"},{"country":"us","description":"once again zach's ladder is entirely sourced from red mountain fruit, including klipsun and ciel du cheval. it's half syrah and half cabernet sauvignon, with a splash of petit verdot. fruity and forward in this cooler vintage, it shows lush red berry flavors with a kiss of cocoa. tangy and satisfying.","designation":"Zachary's Ladder"},{"country":"us","description":"a limited production blend, this opens with tart, brambly fruit flavors accented with mild herbs. the finish continues down a brambly, peppery path. best to give this until 2017 or so in bottle.","designation":"Griffin's Cuv√©e"},{"country":"fr","description":"this soft, gentle sparkling wine is fresh with raspberry fruits and acidity at the end. drink as an ap√©ritif.","designation":"Saint-Pierre Ros√©
