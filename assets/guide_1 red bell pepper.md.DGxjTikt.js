Add the leeks and fennel and saute for 5 to 7 minutes, until tender. Add the rice and stir for a minute to coat with the vegetables, oil, and butter. Add the white wine and simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until most of the wine has been absorbed. Add the chicken stock, 2 ladles at a time, stirring almost constantly and waiting for the stock to be absorbed before adding more. This process should take 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the asparagus diagonally in 1 1/2-inch lengths and discard the tough ends. Blanch in boiling salted water for 4 to 5 minutes, until al dente. Drain and cool immediately in ice water. (If using fresh peas, blanch them in boiling water for a few minutes until the starchiness is gone.) When the risotto has been cooking for 15 minutes, drain the asparagus and add it to the risotto with the peas, lemon zest, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Continue cooking and adding stock, stirring almost constantly, until the rice is tender but still firm. Whisk the lemon juice and mascarpone together in a small bowl. When the risotto is done, turn off the heat and stir in the mascarpone mixture plus the Parmesan cheese and chives.

Set aside. Add the egg, egg yolks, sugar, espresso powder, vanilla extract, salt and 1 tablespoon water to a medium heatproof bowl and whisk to combine. Set the bowl over a medium saucepan of gently simmering water (do not allow the bowl to touch the water). Whisk constantly until the mixture is pale, hot to the touch and has almost doubled in volume, about 4 to 6 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally with a rubber spatula, if necessary. Remove from the heat and continue whisking until cooled, about 2 minutes. Put the chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and set over the saucepan of gently simmering water (do not allow the bowl to touch the water). Stir occasionally with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and gently stir for about 3 minutes to cool slightly. Whisk the egg mixture into the melted chocolate in 3 additions until combined. (The mixture may get very thick.) Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture in 3 additions until it is fully incorporated. It is important that the chocolate mixture is not warm to ensure that it combines smoothly with the whipped cream without seizing up. Divide the chocolate mousse among four 4-ounce ramekins and chill until firm, about 1 hour. Whip the remaining 3/4 cup cold heavy cream to stiff peaks. Top each chocolate mousse with whipped cream and serve.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown and a small knife or wooden skewer can be inserted in cake and removed cleanly. To make the syrup: Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat and cool until lukewarm. Add the vanilla and rum. Brush the cakes with the syrup, let it soak in, then brush again. Repeat until all the syrup is used or the cakes will absorb no more syrup. Place the soaked cakes on individual plates. Garnish with Blood Orange Marmalade and whipped mascarpone. Slice the fruit very thin on a slicer or with a very sharp blade, removing all seeds as you go. You should have approximately 2 1/2 pounds of fruit. For every pound of fruit add 2 pints of water in a large heavy bottomed pot. Add the vanilla beans and cinnamon. Bring to a boil and cook until the fruit skin is tender, approximately 10 minutes. Remove from heat, cool and refrigerate overnight. Weigh the fruit and water mixture. You should have approximately 5 pounds. For each pound of fruit and water, add 1 pound of sugar. Bring to a boil and then continue to cook over medium heat, stirring frequently. To test, drip a small amount of the syrup onto a cool plate. When it&#39;s the consistency of honey at room temperature, it is ready (about 1 hour or more). Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Prepare chicken by cutting off the legs, neck, and wings. Remove skin from legs and de-bone both legs; reserve skin. Take the skin and roll it out until flat. Place between 2 silpat mats or greased parchment paper and bake with weighted iron until crisp and golden. Reserve both crisp skin and chicken for later. Leave oven at 250 degrees F. Beurre blanc: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until translucent and softened. Deglaze the pan with wine. Add cream and then slowly emulsify the remaining butter into the liquid until creamy and emulsified. Remove from the heat. Season the reserved chicken breasts with salt and pepper and then place breasts, wing side down, in a rondeau. Pour beurre blanc over the breasts and add thyme, lemon verbena, and cardamom. Make sure the chicken has enough room to \\swim\\ in the butter and is completely covered. Cover chicken with a round cut from parchment paper. Poach in the oven at 250 degrees F until fully cooked through and tender. Make sure butter does not exceed 140 degrees F. Roulade: Remove any tendons and sinew from the legs and lightly flatten the leg meat. Season the legs with salt and pepper and fill with a 4-ounce piece of foie gras that has been cut into a long rectangle. Repeat this step for the other leg. Roll the leg around the foie gras and let it rest on the fold. Soak the caul fat in salted water for 30 minutes. Unwrap the caul fat and lay it out to dry. Cut a square out of the caul fat about the same size as the length of the roulade. Allow enough fat to cover the roulade completely. Using butchers&#39; twine, tie up the roulade, allowing at least an inch in between each tie and making sure you do not tie the roulade too tight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the roulades in a large, hot, oven-safe skillet. Sear over high heat until evenly browned. Transfer skillet to the oven and roast until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. Remove from the heat and let rest. Garnish: Blanch the leeks and asparagus in boiling, salted water. Glaze with butter, thyme, and minced shallots. Season with sea salt and pepper. Arrange the leeks on 1 side of the plate diagonally from a pile of the asparagus. Place a slice of the poached chicken breast on top of the asparagus. Place a slice of the chicken roulade on top of the baby leeks. Garnish the plate with summer truffle slices, and a pluche of fine herbs. Finish with Fleur de Sel and crisp chicken skin. Sauce: Reduce your chicken jus until it reaches the desired flavor. Adjust the flavor with 50 percent red wine reduction, percent Port wine reduction, and a little foie gras fat.

My twists for this salad are to use chicken legs (not dry old breasts!), smoky pancetta and lovely rustic croutons to suck up all the juices. It&#39;s a lovely little salad with just a hint of attitude - and it&#39;s versatile, as you can serve it hot or cold. P.S. Use your imagination - if you have any other unusual salad leaves, flowers or herb shoots lying around, chuck some in to make it look a little less predictable. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the chicken legs in a snug-fitting roasting pan with the pieces of torn-up bread. Sprinkle with the chopped rosemary, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Mix with your hands to make sure everything is well coated, then lift the chicken legs up to the top, so they sit above the bread. This way, the bread will soak up all the lovely juices from the chicken, giving you the best croutons! Pop the pan into the preheated oven. After 45 minutes the chicken should be nicely cooked. Take the pan out of the oven, drape the pancetta or bacon over the chicken and croutons, and put back for another 15 to 20 minutes for everything to crisp up. The chicken legs are ready when you can pinch the meat off the bone easily. When they&#39;re cooked, remove the pan from the oven and set it aside for the chicken to cool down slightly. Pound the garlic and anchovy fillets in a pestle and mortar or a Flavor Shaker until you have a pulp. Scrape into a bowl and whisk in the Parmesan, creme fraiche, lemon juice and 3 times as much extra-virgin olive oil as lemon juice. Season dressing, to taste, with salt and pepper. Pull the chicken meat off the leg bones - you can use 2 forks to do this, or your hands if you&#39;re tough like me - and tear it up roughly with the croutons and the bacon. Wash, spin dry and separate the lettuce leaves, tear them up and toss with the chicken, croutons, bacon and creamy, cheesy dressing. Scatter with some Parmesan shavings. \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

In a medium-size skillet, over a medium heat, fry each tortilla in a little of the oil until just cooked, but not crisp. Dip each tortilla, as you build the stacks, quickly into the Salsa de cl Colorado, just to moisten. In an ovenproof baking dish large enough to hold 4 of the blue corn tortillas, side by side without touching, place the first 4 tortillas. Top each tortilla with 1/4 cup of the cooked chicken. Top the chicken with 1/4 cup of the grated cheese. Sprinkle the cheese with 1 teaspoon of the pine nuts and 1 teaspoon of the cilantro. Repeat layering 4 tortillas, 1/4 cup chicken, 1/4 cup cheese, 1 teaspoon pine nuts, and 1 teaspoon cilantro and finally top with the last 4 tortillas. You should have 4 stacks. Pour the remaining Salsa de cl Colorado over all the stacks. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer each stack to a plate, garnish with the red onion and the lime wedges, and serve immediately. On a comal, over a medium-high heat, toast the chiles until fragrant, about 30 to 60 seconds. Cover with the chicken stock and allow to soften, about 20 minutes. In a blender, place the chiles and stock. Blend until chopped. Add the garlic, oregano, cumin, vinegar, tomato, and salt and pepper. Blend until very smooth. Over a medium heat, in a heavy skillet, heat the oil. Pour the sauce into the oil and cook for about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 26288,&quot;Grilled Peach and Tomato Salsa 3 ripe peaches, halved and pitted 3 medium tomatoes, halved 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for grilling 3 tablespoons lime juice<br> 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 jalapeno, seeded and minced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/3 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat a grill or grill pan for cooking over medium-high heat.

Grind almond in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a baking sheet and toast in oven for 5 to 7 minutes, until fragrant and a shade darker. Roughly chop dates and add to food processor. Pulse until finely chopped and dates form a ball. Remove from processor to a bowl. Add half of the ground almonds to the dates, leaving the reserved almonds on the baking pan to roll the balls in once formed. Add honey to the date and almond mixture. Mix together until evenly incorporated and smooth. Coat hands with some vegetable oil so that mixture does not stick too much and form mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Roll each ball in chopped almonds to coat well. Place in a tightly sealed container until ready to eat. Any leftover chopped nuts for coating can be sprinkled over the balls to keep them from sticking together if transporting.

Line each cup with a slice of prosciutto, folding and overlapping so that the entire surface of the cup is covered and no metal is peeking through. Divide the mozzarella evenly among the cups. Repeat with the Parmesan, spinach and roasted red pepper. Whisk the eggs and cream in a large measuring cup or small pitcher; add some salt and a few grinds of pepper. Pour the egg mixture in each cup, making sure not to overfill. Bake until the eggs are set and wobble only slightly, 10 to 12 minutes (the eggs will continue to cook after they come out).

Coat an 18-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet or jelly roll pan with cooking spray; line the bottom with parchment paper and spray the parchment. Beat the cream of tartar and egg whites in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup of the sugar. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks with the milk, oil, vanilla and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; whisk into the yolk mixture until smooth. Stir one-third of the egg white mixture into the batter with a rubber spatula, then gently fold in the remaining egg white mixture in 2 batches. Spread the batter in the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the cake springs back when gently pressed, about 10 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Generously sift cocoa powder over the top of the warm cake and loosen the edges with a knife; lay a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) over the cake. Place another baking sheet over the towel and flip the cake with the baking sheets to invert it onto the towel. Remove the top baking sheet and parchment, then dust the top with cocoa powder. Starting at the long end, roll up the cake and towel together. Transfer seam-side down to a rack and let cool completely. For the filling: Whip the cream, corn syrup and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Refrigerate until ready to use. For the glaze: Heat the chocolate, cream, coconut oil and vanilla if using in the top of a double boiler, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and warm, about 4 minutes. Let cool slightly.<br> To assemble: Unroll the cake and spread with the filling. With one of the short edges facing you, slice the cake horizontally into 6 strips, then slice in half vertically so you have twelve 3-by-6 1/2-inch strips.

Fold over tortillas to enclose the stuffing, forming a triangle. Wrap the fish in tin foil. Repeat the wrapping and mounding process with the remaining fillets. To grill, cook 9 minutes on each side on a moderately hot spot on the grill. To bake, place the packets directly on the oven rack and cook for 20 - 25 minutes. To serve, unwrap and discard the foil and, with a spatula, transfer the fish to plates. Open the tortillas to resemble the leaves of a flower. Though they can be eaten, the real purpose of the tortillas is to add moisture and flavor. Serve with lime wedges as garnish. In large bowl combine all ingredients and stir until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Divide the dough into 24 golf ball size pieces for tacos and 23 large bowls for quesadillas. Place on a platter and cover with a damp towel. Toast or fry as desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 26393,&quot;Wild Mushroom Empanadas 1 pound mixed wild mushrooms, such as hen of the woods, chanterelles, trumpet and shiitake (about 8 cups) 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 teaspoons minced jalapeno 1 garlic clove, minced 1 medium shallot, finely chopped Kosher salt 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro 2 teaspoons lime juice Freshly ground black pepper 14 packaged empanada dough rounds, thawed Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Trim the mushrooms and cut or tear into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook the jalapenos, garlic and shallots until soft, about 2 minutes.

Bake the chicken: Toss the chicken with the grapeseed oil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a medium bowl, coating well. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake until cooked through, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the chutney: Combine the tomatoes, red onion, parsley, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Fry the chicken: Heat 3 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Combine the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl, then add the chicken and toss to coat. Fry the chicken until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool slightly, then cut each thigh in half. Assemble the sliders: Spread a thin layer of butter on the cut sides of the rolls. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the rolls, buttered-side down, in the pan and toast until golden, about 2 minutes. Spread with mayonnaise and sandwich with the chicken and chutney. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 26415,&quot;Lobster with Mayonnaise 1 lobster per serving 1 egg yolk* Dijon mustard Salt and pepper Salt and pepper<br> Light extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 pint (1 cup) olive oil/sunflower oil/ mixture of the two 2 egg yolks Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 level teaspoon Dijon mustard Lemon juice/white wine Vinegar Instructions: Fill a pan with lukewarm water and place over high heat. Place the lobster in the pan and cover. Once the water has come to the boil, cook the lobster for ten minutes or until it no longer has any blue hue and has turned a deep red-orange color. Remove the lobster from the pan and leave to cool. Once cool you can prepare the lobster in the traditional manner: with a sharp knife make an incision at the point where the head joins the body and cut down the length of the lobster towards the tail. Make sure that you have cut right the way through the body. Now turn the lobster 180 degrees and cut from the original incision back through the head. With you fingers gradually prise the shell apart so that it falls into two halves. Remove the front claws and set aside. With your index finger prise the meat out of the shell (trying to keep it in one piece, again working from the tail upwards. Replace the meat in the shell (this process makes it easier for your guests to keep their fingers clean) and repeat with the second half. Using a cleaver or hammer crack both sides of the claws. Remove the surrounding shell and extract the meat in a single piece. Arrange the two halves of lobster on a plate together with the claw meat and serve with mayonnaise, which you can make in the following way: Put eggs, mustard, pinch of salt, grinding of pepper and a small squeeze of lemon juice/vinegar in a basin and beat well with a wooden spoon, beater or whisk. Start adding the oil, drop by drop to begin with, stirring all the time. When the mixture starts to emulsify you may add more oil in steady dribblets but keep stirring until you get the required jelly-like substance, which is the consistency that proper mayonnaise should be. Finally test for more seasoning. Refrigerate until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 26416,&quot;Hot Fudge Calzone 4 ounces pizza dough 3 ounces premium quality hot fudge, room temperature 1/4 cup melted butter 1 tablespoon sugar in the raw Vanilla bean ice cream Powdered sugar Cocoa powder Instructions: Spread dough on floured pizza peel.

Yield: 3 quarts Cooking and cleaning the lobster: Bring the court bouillon to boil, and cook the lobsters (9 minutes for 1 1/2 pounds). Remove with a skimmer, and drain. When cold, put the lobster on its back, cut the tail in its center, pry open and remove the tail in 1 piece. Remove the vein. Slice 30 medallions and set aside. Break each claw under the joint and remove the flesh without breaking it. Flesh from the claws should remain whole. Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit Cooking the Beets and the French String Beans: Wrap the beets (skin on) in aluminum foil so that the juice will not run-out. Cook them for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Let them cool down, remove the skin and cut 30 slices of 1/8-inch (5 slices per portion). With a round die cut 1 3/4 inches in diameter cut a nice round circle from each slice. (Keep the parings to make a salad with potatoes, touch of garlic and olive oil). Place on the fire a pot of water to boil with a pinch of Hawaiian salt. Clean the string beans and place them in the boiling water and cook them quickly (if they cook too slowly they will turn yellow). They should be cooked in 3 to 4 minutes depending on quality and size. When you bite them they should be soft. Once cooked place them quickly in iced water so they keep their color. Drain and cut them into sections 1 1/2-inchs long, 6 pieces per portion. Set aside. Caviar Vinaigrette: Mix the olive oil with balsamic vinegar. Add the 3/4-ounce caviar and the chervil. Mix but do not add salt (there is enough salt in the caviar). Add a touch of pepper. On the top of the plate, place a bouquet of salad. At the bottom forming half a circle, place 5 petals of red beets. On the inside place 5 medallions of lobster on top of the petals. A lobster claw goes on top of the bouquet of lettuce, topped with a quenelle of caviar and a sprig of chervil. On the left a bunch of string beans and on the right a tomato rose. Coat the lobster medallions with caviar vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 26423,&quot;Pan Fried Tilapia 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons seafood seasoning 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds fresh tilapia fillets 2 tablespoons canola oil 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon chopped garlic 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Heat oven to 300 degrees F. In a shallow baking dish combine flour, seafood seasoning, salt and pepper. Add the tilapia and lightly coat each side. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Shake off any excess seasoned flour and place in the skillet. Brown on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Put the ham in a large roasting pan, fat-side up. Using a sharp knife, score the ham with cuts across the skin, about 2-inches apart and 1/2-inch deep. Cut diagonally down the slashes to form a diamond pattern; season the meat generously with salt and pepper. Chop about 8 of the sage leaves and put it in a bowl; mix with the oil to make a paste. Rub the sage-oil all over the ham, being sure to get the flavor into all the slits. Bake the ham for 2 hours. Now there is plenty of time to bang-out the tangerine glaze. For the glaze: Place a saucepan over medium heat. Add the chunks of butter, tangerines, tangerine juice, brown sugar, water, and spices. Slowly cook the liquid down to a syrupy glaze; this should take about 30 to 40 minutes. After the ham has been going for a couple of hours, pour the tangerine glaze all over it, with the pieces of fruit and all. Scatter the remaining sage leaves on top and stick the ham back in the oven and continue to cook for 11/2 hours, basting with the juices every 30 minutes. Scatter the carrots around the ham and coat in the tangerine glaze. Stick the ham once again back in the oven and cook for a final 30 minutes, until the carrots are tender, the ham is dark and crispy, and the whole thing is glistening with a sugary glaze. Set the ham on a cutting board to rest before carving. Serve the carrots and tangerine glaze on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 26425,&quot;Linguine with Clams and Pancetta Kosher salt 12 ounces linguine 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 8 cloves garlic 4 ounces diced pancetta 2 oil-packed anchovies 24 littleneck clams, scrubbed and rinsed well 1 cup dry white wine 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes Juice of 1/2 lemon Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain. Add 2/3 cup of the oil and the garlic to the skillet with the bacon drippings. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Peel the potatoes and slice the potato skins into very thin strips (the thinner your cut the strips the crispier they will be). Toss the strips with 1/4 teaspoon salt, some pepper and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Spread in an even layer and bake on an ungreased rimmed baking sheet, stirring once, until golden and crispy, about 15 minutes. Cut the peeled potatoes into 1-inch chunks and put in a saucepan. Cover with cold water by about 2 inches and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly. Pass the potatoes through a ricer into a medium bowl or mash with a potato masher until smooth. Pour the oil and garlic mixture into the bowl of a food processor and puree. Add the potatoes, vinegar, 1/3 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste and pulse until just creamy and combined; do not over process or the potatoes will become gluey. Add up to 3 tablespoons more water if necessary so that the dip is soft and spreadable. Season with additional salt and pepper. Transfer the dip to a shallow serving bowl. Crumble the bacon and sprinkle it over the dip along with the crispy potato skins and scallions.

Cream the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium for 3 minutes. Beat in the 2 beaten eggs and vanilla. Beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture 1 cup at a time. Divide the dough into 2 pieces and flatten them into neat rectangles about 3/4-inch thick. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill at least 3 hours. Set an oven rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it soften for about 10 minutes. Roll it out on a lightly-floured piece of parchment to 3/16-inch thick. Cut out rounds with a 3- to 3 1/4-inch cookie cutter and arrange them on the prepared cookie sheets at least 1 1/2 inches apart. Repeat with the second piece of dough, rerolling and cutting the scraps as necessary. To make ring imprints on the cookies, press the rim of a small glass or bowl (about 2 1/2-inches wide) halfway into each dough round. Freeze the cookies on the cookie sheets for 20 minutes. (This will help the cookies hold their imprints.) Combine the remaining egg with 6 drops of yellow food coloring and 1 teaspoon water. Whisk together with a fork to make an egg wash. At the top of each cookie, use a wide straw or the tip of a sharp paring knife to cut a circle or rectangle wide enough to thread a ribbon through. Working with 2 to 3 cookies at a time, lightly brush the rounds with egg wash (avoid the imprint) and sprinkle with the sanding sugar. Lightly tap each cookie on the counter to shake off excess (the frozen dough will be sturdy enough to withstand this). Bake the cookies until set and the edges are beginning to brown, 14 to 18 minutes, rotating the cookie sheets once. Transfer the sheets to a baking rack and cool the cookies completely on the sheets. (If the holes for the ribbon have closed up a bit, just cut away some of the dough with a paring knife while the cookies are still warm). Thread a yard of ribbon through each cookie and tie the ends. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26431,&quot;Tombstone and Coffin Grilled Cheeses 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar 1 cup shredded Gouda<br> 1 cup shredded mozzarella<br> 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack<br> 8 slices white sandwich bread (preferably the kind that has a bit of a heart shape on the top) 1/4 cup prepared pesto<br> 8 slices dark sandwich bread, such as pumpernickel or rye<br> 1/4 cup fig jam<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted<br> 1/2 cup ketchup in a squeeze bottle<br> 1/2 cup mustard in a squeeze bottle<br> 8 cups thinly shredded iceberg lettuce (about 1 head)<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Toss together the Cheddar, Gouda, mozzarella and Monterey Jack in a medium bowl. Lay the white bread on a work surface and spread the pesto evenly on half the slices. Spread half the cheese mixture (about 1/4 cup per sandwich) on the bread with the pesto and top with the remaining white bread to make 4 sandwiches; place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Lay the dark bread on the work surface and spread the fig jam evenly on half the slices. Use the remaining cheese mixture and bread to make 4 sandwiches. Add the sandwiches to the baking sheet. Brush both sides of the white bread and dark bread sandwiches with melted butter. Bake for 5 minutes, then flip and bake for 3 minutes more. Make the tombstones: Cut the crusts off the sides and curved tops of the white bread sandwiches, following the curves of the tops. Leave the bottom crusts on. Next, cut each sandwich in half lengthwise so that the pieces resembles tombstones. Make the coffins: Cut the crusts off 3 sides of each sandwich, leaving 1 short side uncut. Halve each sandwich crosswise to make 2 long rectangles.

Locate the major tendon that resembles a cooked piece of fettuccini and follow it up the drumstick with your boning knife to cut it out. Repeat for the 3 to 4 other major tendons. Using a pair of pliers, grab and pull out the minor tendon that resembles a cooked piece of spaghetti. Repeat for the 5 to 6 other minor tendons. Scrape the boning knife against the bone to clean up any leftover meat. For the marinade: Place the cranberries, rosemary, sage, allspice, cloves, and cinnamon stick in a large plastic container and add 1 to 2 cups boiling water just to cover. Allow to steep for 10 to 15 minutes. For the brine: In a large bowl, dissolve the salt with 1 to 2 cups boiling water, whisking until the salt has dissolved. For the injection mixture: In a 16-ounce pint glass, combine the garlic juice, onion juice, hot sauce, cl sauce, Worcestershire sauce and stir. Fill the glass with beer and stir. Add the marinade mixture to the brine mixture, and then pour in the remaining beer to cool it down. Inject each drumstick a couple of times with the injection mixture using a meat injector. Place the drumsticks in the marinade and add 1 gallon cold water to cover. Refrigerate overnight. Preheat the smoker to 250 to 300 degrees F. Remove the drumsticks from the marinade and place in the smoker. Place the applewood chips in the smoker and smoke for 30 to 40 minutes.

Stirring with a wooden spoon, add enough water until the dough just comes together. Stir in the olive oil. Flour your work surface and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Form the dough into a tight ball so the top is really nice and taut. Place it onto a floured baking sheet and form it into a long and thin baguette shape, thinner than usual as it will expand while it rises. Cover the tray with lightly oiled plastic wrap so it is airtight but not too tight so the dough has room to expand. Put in a warm place until the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour. I usually leave mine on a chair near the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Uncover the bread and sprinkle on some flour. Put the bread with the shortest edge facing you (or lengthwise) and, starting at the end furthest away from you, hold a pair of scissors so they are parallel to the bread, then tilt them so they are at a 45-degree angle. Make a large cut 4 inches away from the top of the dough, almost as if you were going to snip that bit off but it will still be attached, then take that piece and move it to the left. Make another snip about 4 inches down from the bottom of the last one and move that piece to the right. Keep on doing this until you reach the end of the bread. Sprinkle the top with flour and salt. Spray some water into the oven to create a steamy atmosphere. I usually spray 8 to 10 squirts from a spray bottle, then put the dough into the oven. Bake until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when you tap it on the bottom, about 25 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 26459,&quot;Saga Wagyu Sukiyaki 1 piece of Wagyu fat 12 oz of Saga wagyu beef thinly sliced 1/2 cup mirin 1/2 cup sake 1/3 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup sugar 8 oz firm tofu diced 1\\ X 1<br> 2 cups Nappa cabbage, cut into 1\\ pieces 12 fresh shiitake mushrooms 1 Tokyo scallion, or scallion, cut 1 1/2\\ long 1 cup Dashi 1 bunch Enoki mushrooms 2 bunches chrysanthemum leaves, or water cress 1 pack of yam noodles (shirataki) drained and rinsed, or substitute bean-noodles Instructions: Preheat a casserole type of large pan.

Butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the parchment and dust with cake flour, tapping out the excess; set aside. Whisk the cake flour, almond flour, baking powder and salt in a separate large bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla and coconut extracts. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with the milk. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until just combined. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans. Run a thin knife around the edges of the cakes and gently turn out onto the rack; remove the parchment and let cool completely.

Combine the warm water and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a liquid measuring cup. Turn the mixer to low and add the warm-water mixture to the dry ingredients, mixing until a loose ball forms, 1 to 2 minutes. (Alternately, do this by hand: Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, then add the warm water and oil and stir with a wooden spoon.) Increase the speed to medium-high and knead the dough until smooth and slightly tacky but not sticky, about 7 minutes. (If using your hands, gather the dough into a ball, turn it out onto a floured surface and knead, dusting your hands and the surface as needed with flour, about 5 minutes.) Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil into a large bowl, using your hands to coat the inside completely. Pour the remaining 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil into an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet, tilting and swirling to coat it with oil. Cover the bottom of the oiled pan with a single layer of the pepperoni, then crush and sprinkle the dried oregano evenly over the pepperoni. Using oiled hands, divide the dough in half, placing half into the oiled bowl, turning once to coat. Place the other half into the prepared pan, spreading gently with your hands. (Dough will not completely cover the pepperoni at the point; you will stretch it further later.) Dip a pastry brush in the oil on the baking sheet and brush oil over surface of dough. Cover both the baking sheet and bowl of dough loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until the dough fills about two-thirds of the baking sheet and the dough in the bowl doubles in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br> Remove plastic wrap from the baking sheet and bowl. Gently using your hands, press and stretch the dough to completely cover the bottom of the pan evenly, doing your best to keep the pepperoni in a single layer. Sprinkle mozzarella in an even layer over the dough. Using oiled hands, remove the dough from the bowl and stretch and gently press into an even layer over top of the mozzarella. Pour any remaining oil from the bowl over top of the dough and use a pastry brush to brush evenly over the surface. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume and extremely puffy, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F. Bake until the top is deep golden brown, bread has pulled away from sides of baking sheet and oil is sizzling around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven. Let cool for a few minutes before inverting onto a cutting board. Cut into squares with a pizza cutter and serve with warm marinara sauce for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 26488,&quot;Sparkling Baby Cakes 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2 large eggs, room temperature 2/3 cup sugar 3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 cup milk 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 to 3 tablespoons Prosecco or Champagne Sanding sugar or tiny candies, for decorating Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line the muffin tin with mini cupcake liners.<br> Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.<br> In another medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until light and foamy, about 2 minutes. While beating, gradually pour in the butter and then the vanilla.<br> While mixing slowly, add half the dry ingredients, then add all the milk, and follow with the rest of the dry ingredients. Take care not to over mix the batter. Divide the batter evenly in the prepared tins (about 2 teaspoon batter per cup cake.)<br> Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool cupcakes on a rack in the tin.<br> Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and Prosecco until smooth and sugar dissolves. (If cupcakes are not cool enough to ice, lay plastic film directly on top of the glaze to prevent it from drying out and set aside at room temperature until ready to use.) Dip the tops of each baby cake in the Prosecco glaze, sprinkle with sugar or top with tiny candies and return to the rack to set, about 25 minutes. Cooks Note: This is a great way to use up leftover bubbly. This recipe works just as well with flat Prosecco. For a full wine flavor, prick the mini cupcakes with toothpicks when they are cooling; then drizzle with some Prosecco before icing with the glaze. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Sparkling Shiraz, Brut Ros, Cava]&quot; 26489,&quot;Peking Duck 1 large pot 3/4 full with water, boiling 1 whole duck, head on 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup salt 1 teaspoon five-spice powder 1 cup molasses 2 cups oil, hot Instructions: Soak the whole duck in the large pot of boiling water. Remove it as soon as the skin changes color. Sprinkle the inside of the duck with sugar, salt, and five-spice powder. Rub the skin of the duck with molasses. Truss the duck with string and hang in an airing place for 2 hours, or put the duck in the refrigerator overnight without any cover. This will dry the skin of the duck so that it will be crispy. Preheat rotisserie oven to 375 degrees and bake for 45 minutes or until the skin is reddish brown. Before serving, pour hot oil over the skin to increase the crispiness. Carve the skin and meat from the duck, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26490,&quot;Macaroon Crusted Orange Tart 3 1/3 cups unsweetened shredded coconut 3 large egg whites 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 4 large egg yolks 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon orange oil or extract 1/2 cup orange juice 2 oranges, zested Instructions: For the Tart Shell: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, work the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle on 3 to 4 tablespoons of the eggy water, and mix it in with your fingers just until the dough comes together into a ball. Working on a lightly floured surface, take egg-sized pieces of the dough and smear them away from you with the heel of your hand into 6-inch streaks. Scrape up all the streaks of dough and pile them on top of one another to form a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Lightly butter a 9 1/2-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to 1/8-inch thickness and place in the prepared pan, trimming the edges, and bake until light golden brown, approximately 20 minutes. Let cool completely. Pour the butterscotch filling into the pie crust that is still inside the tart pan and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. Slice the bananas, making concentric circles and top with sugar. Torch bananas briefly until golden and all the sugar is caramelized. In a bowl, whisk the cornstarch into 1/2 cup of the milk. Let rest for 1 minute, then whisk again. Whisk in the eggs, yolks, and vanilla. In a saucepan, over medium heat, bring the brown sugar, butter, bourbon, and the remaining 2 1/2 cups milk just to the simmering point (it will start to wiggle in the pot). While constantly whisking, slowly drizzle the hot liquid into the egg mixture.

(\\Proofing\\ the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn&#39;t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes.<br> Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to an hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time.<br> While the dough is rising, prepare the pizza topping. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium- high heat in a large saucepan and saute garlic and onions until they begin to soften. Add parsley, salt, and tomatoes. Cook for about 20 minutes to allow flavors to integrate. (Begin the chicken as described below, while the sauce is cooking.) Remove from heat and whisk in instant flour to thicken. Mix with an immersion blender, then set aside briefly.<br> While the sauce is cooking, in a separate fry pan, heat the other tablespoon of olive oil over medium high heat, and brown the ground chicken, breaking up the pieces as it cooks. When the ground chicken has browned, remove from heat, crumble in blue cheese, and stir in buffalo wing sauce and yogurt. Fold this mixture into the tomato sauce. If the mix is absolutely too runny for a pizza topping, add more instant flour.<br> Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Divide the dough in half and stretch out 2 (14-inch) circles. Transfer them to pizza stones sprinkled with cornmeal. Top with the buffalo chicken pizza topping. Roll up and seal ends. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the dough is nicely browned. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 26500,&quot;Strawberry Lime Mousse One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk 1 cup frozen strawberries<br> 1 tablespoon sugar<br> 1 lime, zested and juiced<br> One 8-ounce carton frozen whipped topping, thawed<br> Vanilla wafer cookies, for serving<br> Instructions: Put the sweetened condensed milk, strawberries, sugar and lime juice in a blender.

Add the 1 cup warmed milk and blend. Add the flour, cinnamon, and salt and blend until smooth. Use a pastry brush to grease the hot muffin tin generously with the melted butter. Add any remaining butter to the batter and pulse to blend. Pour the batter into the warmed muffin tin, filling the muffin cups about three-quarters full. Bake until the popovers are golden, about 20 minutes. (Do NOT open the oven door!) Turn off the oven, keep the oven door closed, and continue to bake the popovers until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the cream cheese with the confectioners&#39; sugar and the remaining 2 tablespoons milk until smooth. Remove the popovers from the oven. Use the tip of a paring knife to poke a tiny slit at the top of each popover (this will allow steam to escape, and will keep your popovers from getting soggy). Brush the popovers with the glaze and serve warm.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26533,&quot;Minty Brownies 2 sticks unsalted butter, plus more for the pan 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (or chopped semisweet chocolate) 1 cup packed dark brown sugar 1 cup granulated sugar 4 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch of salt 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons green creme de menthe liqueur 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a glass 9-by-13-inch baking pan and line it with 2 overlapping pieces of parchment paper so the paper comes up over the edges of the pan. Butter the paper. Make the brownies: Place a small pot of water over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Place a heatproof bowl over the simmering water, add the butter and chocolate and gently melt them together, stirring to combine. (This can also be done in the microwave; heat in 15-second intervals.) Transfer the chocolate-butter mixture to a large mixing bowl. Add the brown and granulated sugars, eggs, vanilla and salt and whisk together. Add the flour and gently whisk to combine, then pour into the prepared baking pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out somewhat clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let the brownies cool completely in the pan. Make the buttercream: Combine the cream cheese and butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat until smooth. Add the creme de menthe and beat until combined. Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread the buttercream over the brownies, then refrigerate until firm. Use the parchment to remove the brownies from the baking dish.

Pulse the cookies in a food processor to fine crumbs. Add the cream cheese and pulse together until the mixture begins to ball up. Transfer to a large bowl and knead together a few times until completely combined.<br> Roll about 1/3 of the mixture into 18 truffles (about 1 level tablespoon each) and place on one of the prepared baking sheets. Roll the remaining mixture into 18 larger truffles, (about 1 heaping tablespoon each), and place on the second prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm and chilled through, about 1 hour.<br> While the truffles chill, prepare the decorations.<br> For the royal icing, combine the confectioner&#39;s sugar and meringue powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat on low speed just to combine. Add 2 1/2 teaspoons water and increase the speed to medium. Beat the mixture until the icing is stiff enough to hold a peak but soft enough to pipe, about 2 minutes. If the icing gets too stiff, add up to 1/2 teaspoon more water.<br> Divide the icing evenly between 2 bowls. Tint one bowl of icing bright pink using the pink food coloring. Tint the remaining bowl of icing with the black food coloring. Transfer the pink and black icings to separate piping bags (with no cut openings) or to resealable plastic bags and set aside.<br> For the white coating, combine the candy melting wafers and coconut oil in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the mixture in 20-second intervals, stirring between each, until the wafers are melted and the mixture is smooth, about 1 minute 20 seconds. Set aside.<br> Put some white sanding sugar and pink sanding sugar in separate bowls.<br> For the bunny tails: Cut 9 of the marshmallows crosswise to create 18 halves. Carefully dip one flat side of each marshmallow piece in the white candy coating, let the excess drip off and then dip in the white sanding sugar. Place each marshmallow piece sugar-side up on a plate to set. These will be the bunny tails.<br> For the bunny ears: Cut 18 of the marshmallows in half on the diagonal to create 18 pairs of bunny ears. Dip the cut side of each marshmallow piece in the pink sanding sugar. Place sugar-side up on the plate with the tails to set.<br> For the bunny feet: Cut the remaining 18 marshmallows in half lengthwise to create 18 pairs of feet. Set aside on the plate with the tails and ears.<br> Put a truffle in the white coating and use 2 forks to evenly coat. Lift out the truffle, letting any excess drip off, then return to the baking sheet. Continue with the remaining truffles (both sizes) until all are all coated. If the coating cools to room temperature during the dipping process, microwave it in 20-second intervals to reheat. Reserve the leftover white coating to use as glue for the tails, ears and feet.<br> For the heads: Dip the bottoms of 2 bunny ears in the leftover white coating, place on top of a small truffle and hold in place until the coating sets, about 15 seconds. Snip a very small tip off the corner of each bag of icing. Pipe a small pink heart for a nose on the front (face) of the truffle. Pipe a pair of eyes and mouth using the black royal icing. Repeat with the remaining small truffles.<br> For the bottoms: Dip the cut side of a marshmallow tail in the leftover white coating. Place the tail on top of one of the large truffles and hold in place until the coating sets, about 15 seconds. Dip the cut sides of two marshmallow feet in the leftover white coating. Position them on the truffle below the tail and hold until set in place. Use the pink royal icing to pipe a large oval on the top each foot and 3 small circles underneath for toes. Repeat with the remaining large truffles.<br> Return all the truffles to the refrigerator to set, about 10 minutes. Serve chilled. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26535,&quot;Triple Berry Mousse Tart 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, divided 3 tbsps. sugar, divided 1 2/3 cups vanilla wafer crumbs 1/3 cup quick rolled oats 3 tbsps. firmly packed brown sugar 5 tbsps. butter, melted 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract 1 (8 oz.) pkg. cream cheese, softened 3 tbsps. boiling water 1 envelope unflavored gelatine (2 teaspoons) 1 (12 oz.) jar Smucker&#39;s?

Thaw the tofu (still in its package) at room temperature by submerging it in a bowl of water, 3 to 4 hours. Repeat this process of freezing and thawing the tofu. Remove the thawed block of tofu from its package and gently squeeze between flattened palms to get rid of excess water. Break the tofu into craggy bite-size pieces (about 1 inch) and spread out on a paper towel-lined plate. Gently blot the top with more paper towel. Whisk the cornstarch, egg white, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon water in a medium bowl. Add the tofu pieces and gently toss until evenly coated. Heat about 1/2 inch of oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. When hot enough for the tofu to sizzle right away, fry the tofu (in 2 batches to avoid overcrowding), flipping halfway through frying, until very crisp and golden brown all over, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to blot excess oil. Reserve the oil. For the sauce: Whisk the soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, wine, cornstarch, sesame oil and 1/2 cup water in a bowl or measuring cup until the sugar and cornstarch have dissolved. For the stir-fry: Have the sauce, fried tofu, and remaining ingredients prepped and ready by the stovetop. Remove 2 tablespoons of oil from frying the tofu and heat in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the Sichuan peppercorns and chiles and stir briefly to start toasting, 5 to 10 seconds. Add the scallion bottoms, garlic and ginger; cook, stirring constantly until starting to brown, 10 to 20 seconds. Give the sauce a last-minute stir, then add to the skillet (be careful of the steam). Add the tofu and toss in the sauce. When the sauce is thickened, after 15 to 30 seconds, remove from the heat. Continue tossing the tofu until completely coated. Stir in the peanuts and scallion tops. Serve right away with hot rice. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 26542,&quot;Chocolate Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast with Strawberry Syrup 1/2 cup mascarpone, at room temperature 1 tablespoon heavy cream 1 tablespoon orange zest 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 ounce semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled, plus more for grating 12 slices day-old brioche, about 3/4-inch thick 3 large eggs 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, plus more if needed Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Strawberry Syrup, warmed, recipe follows 2 pints whole fresh or frozen strawberries, hulled 2/3 cup sugar, plus more if needed 1/4 cup corn syrup Pinch sea salt 1 tablespoon lemon juice Instructions: Cook&#39;s Note: Mascarpone is similar to cream cheese in flavor (but better) and has the consistency to match. It makes a great base for this super-easy yummy filling. Combine the mascarpone, heavy cream, orange zest and sugar in a bowl. Add the melted chocolate and mix until all the ingredients are incorporated. Using an offset spatula or butter knife, take a generous scoop of the chocolate-mascarpone filling, about 2 tablespoons, and slather it on 1 slice of the brioche, and then top with another slice of brioche. Repeat with the remaining slices and filling; you will make 6 sandwiches. In a shallow dish, whisk together the eggs and half-and-half to make an egg bath. (If you don&#39;t have half-and-half, milk or heavy cream will work just fine.) Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Preheat a nonstick griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet, moving it around to coat the surface. Dip each sandwich in the egg bath, turning over to coat and soak both sides. Place the sandwich on the hot griddle. (Place only as many sandwiches as will fit easily on the griddle, don&#39;t overcrowd.) Cook, in batches, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the sandwiches to an oven-safe platter and cover loosely with foil. Place in the oven to keep warm. Add more butter to the griddle, as necessary, and cook the remaining sandwiches. Cut the sandwiches diagonally in half, and serve 2 to 3 halves per person. Dust the sandwich with confectioners&#39; sugar and grate chocolate over the top. Ladle a generous portion of the Strawberry Syrup over the sandwiches, or serve alongside for your guests to serve themselves. In a large saucepan over high heat, add the strawberries and sugar. (A large saucepan is needed just in case the strawberry syrup starts to boil up the sides.) If the strawberries are not as ripe or sweet as you like, add 1/3 cup more sugar. Add 2/3 cup water, the corn syrup and sea salt to the pan. Stir together until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Strain out the strawberries and continue to boil the liquid until the mixture has thickened to a syrupy consistency, another 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and add the strawberries back to the saucepan. Gently stir to coat the strawberries in the syrup. (The syrup can be stored in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or cooled and frozen.) Cook&#39;s Note: For an orange-lover&#39;s option, use fresh orange juice instead of the lemon juice to finish the syrup. Alternately, for a rich, adult-friendly sauce, add a splash of orange liqueur, like Grand Marnier, to the sauce. Although the alcohol won&#39;t completely cook out, most will if cooked a few minutes longer.

To make the dough: In a small bowl, combine water, honey, and yeast. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours, oregano, crushed red pepper and salt. Add the yeast mixture and stir until a soft dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth, adding flour as needed if dough is sticky, about 10 minutes. Clean the bowl and coat it with vegetable spray. Form the dough into a ball, put it in the bowl and cover with a kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, to make the topping: Heat the olive oil and 1/4 cup wine in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, adding more wine, if needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the spinach and cook until just wilted, about 3 minutes more. Stir in tarragon and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside. Punch the dough down and let rest for 10 minutes. Sprinkle a large baking sheet with cornmeal. On a lightly floured surface, stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle, rolling the edge over slightly and pinching it together to form a thick rim. Place the dough on the baking sheet. Arrange the tomato slices over the crust and top with the spinach mixture. Scatter the mushrooms and bell pepper over the top, then sprinkle with the cheese and crushed red pepper. Bake until crust is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Sprinkle with garlic salt, cut into wedges and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 26550,&quot;Homemade Condensed Milk 6 cups nonfat milk 5 tablespoons sugar Instructions: In heavy saucepan pour milk and bring to a boil.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Sear both sides of the pork belly until charred (about 5 minutes per side). Immediately add the rice wine, carrot, celery, onion, salt, sugar, star anise, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns and red cl pepper and bring to a boil. Cover with aluminum foil and transfer to the oven. Let cook for 3 hours, then remove the pork belly from the liquid and allow to cool. Cut into 6-ounce portions. For the peach hoisin sauce: Put the peaches in a blender and blend into a puree. Pour into a bowl, then add the hoisin sauce and sugar and whisk until well blended. For the sandwich: Bring oil to 325 degrees F in a deep-fryer. Thickly slice a 6-ounce portion of braised pork belly (it should come out to 5 to 6 slices per portion). Fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Toast the bun. Place the fried pork belly on the bottom bun. Drizzle with peach hoisin sauce and serve with kimchi on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 26553,&quot;Sweet Potato Casserole 2 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 3) 1 orange, zested and juiced 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon honey 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup diced dried apricots 1/2 cup oatmeal 1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons butter, cut into pea-sized pieces 1/2 cup chopped walnuts Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the sweet potatoes on a sheet tray and roast for 35 to 40 minutes. The sweet potatoes might still be a little hard in the center- no problem! While the sweet potatoes are baking make the topping. In a food processor, combine the oatmeal, brown sugar, olive oil, butter, and walnuts and pulse until mixture comes together. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them and cut them into 1-inch chunks. Discard the skins. Put the potatoes into a large dish and add the remaining ingredients. Mash together with a potato masher until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a 2-quart casserole dish. Crumble the topping mixture over the potatoes. Bake until the mixture hot all the way through and the topping is brown and crispy, about 30 minutes. That&#39;s a hot sweet potato! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26554,&quot;Strawberry Rhubarb Pretzel Salad 2 cups pretzel crumbs (165 grams), from about 3 heaping cups salted small pretzels 1/3 cup (67 grams) sugar 12 tablespoons (179 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled One 8-ounce (225 grams) block cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup (96 grams) sugar 1 cup cold heavy cream 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract One 1/4-ounce packet powdered gelatin (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) 6 ounces (168 grams) fresh or frozen rhubarb, thick sliced (about 1 1/2 cups) 1/2 cup (96 grams) sugar 1/4 cup (80 grams) seedless strawberry jam 2 teaspoons rosewater 2 to 3 drops red food coloring, optional 2 cups hulled and sliced strawberries Instructions: Place an oven rack in the middle position and preheat to 325 F degrees. For the crust: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, add the pretzels and sugar and process into fine crumbs. Drizzle the melted butter over top and pulse to combine. Press the mixture into a clear glass 8-by-8-inch baking dish. (Use the bottom of a dry measuring cup to pack the crumbs tightly.) Bake the crust until crisp and pulls away slightly from the sides of the pan, about 15 to 17 minutes. Let cool completely. For the cream cheese layer: In a large mixing bowl, add the cream cheese and sugar. Using a hand mixer, beat until creamy. Drizzle in the cream and vanilla and continue to beat on a medium speed until light, fluffy and medium-stiff peaks form. Spread over the cooled crust and refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the gelatin layer. Sprinkle the gelatin over 1/2 cup cool water in a medium bowl and let bloom, about 5 minutes. Combine the rhubarb, sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan, bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook until the rhubarb is just tender, but still completely holds its shape, 1 to 2 minutes (add a minute or so more if cooking from frozen). Remove from the heat. Add the jam and rosewater. Stir to combine and thin the jam. Stir in the food coloring, if using. Pour the mixture over the bloomed gelatin and stir to completely dissolve the gelatin. Refrigerate until soft set, about 2 hours (it should look thick and syrupy). Once the cream cheese layer is set and the gelatin is soft set, stir the strawberries into the gelatin and spoon the gelatin mixture over the cream cheese layer and smooth the top. Refrigerate until completely set, at least 4 hours or overnight. To serve, grab a big spoon and dig in. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 26555,&quot;Chilaquiles Vegetable oil, for frying Three 5-inch corn tortillas, cut into quarters<br> One 15-ounce can green enchilada sauce<br> 2 tablespoons salted butter 2 large eggs<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese 2 tablespoons of your favorite salsa<br> Instructions: Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil over medium heat in a cast-iron skillet until it registers 350 degrees F on a candy/frying thermometer. (If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, carefully dip the corner of a tortilla wedge into the oil. If it sizzles, you are ready to fry.) Carefully drop the tortilla quarters into the hot oil and fry, turning them halfway through with tongs or a spider, until crisp but not yet browned, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Remove the tortilla quarters to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside. Heat the enchilada sauce in a small pan over medium-high heat until hot. While it is heating, fry the eggs. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the skillet and fry until the edges are nice and crispy, a minute or two. Season with salt and pepper. While the eggs are frying, assembled your chilaquiles. In a shallow 1-quart dish, arrange half of the fried tortillas in a layer. Sprinkle them with half of the cheese. Pour enough of the hot enchilada sauce over the tortillas and cheese to cover most of the chips. Add the remaining chips to the dish in an even layer. Top with the remaining cheese and more sauce. The amount you add here is up to you. You may end up with some leftover enchilada sauce depending on your preference. Top with the fried eggs and salsa of your choice.

Ragu`s should be rich without being heavy. A ragu is a meat sauce with tomato, it is not a tomato sauce with meat. Adapted from Splendid Table by Lynne Rossetto Kasper In a small sauce pot, bring the cream up to a simmer and reduce by 1/3. About 6 tablespoons of cream should be remaining. In a sauce pot, render the pancetta over medium heat, about 8 minutes, or until almost all the fat is rendered. Stir in the carrots, celery, and onions. Season with salt and pepper. Saute the vegetables for about 3 minutes or until the vegetables are translucent. In a mixing bowl, combine the meats. Season the meats with salt and pepper. Increase the heat and stir in the meat. Brown the meat for 5 minutes, or until the meat is medium brown in color. Stir in the wine, garlic and diluted tomato paste, and reduce the heat to very low. Cook partially covered for 2 hours. From time to time stir in a tablespoon or so of the milk, by the end of the two hours the milk should be incorporated. Stir in the reduced cream.

Add about a third of the chilled butter cubes and process until the butter is absorbed. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the butter is the size of peas, 5 or 6 pulses. Add the vinegar. Then, while pulsing quickly a few times, add the ice water through the tube. Squeeze some dough between your fingers; it should just hold its shape without feeling wet. If it is crumbly, add more ice water a tablespoon at a time. Pulse quickly; do not overwork the dough or the crust will be tough. Wrap the dough loosely in a large piece of plastic wrap, then firmly press and flatten it into a thin round. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Lightly dust a work surface with flour, then roll the dough into an 11- to 12-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Center the dough in a 9-inch pie plate, with an even overhang all around. Fold the edges and flute or crimp. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Press a piece of foil over the chilled crust, then fill with pie weights, raw beans or rice. Bake to set the crust, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and bake until the crust is light brown, 5 to 10 minutes more. Let cool slightly before adding the filling. For the filling: Sprinkle the shallot evenly into the crust. Put the Gouda, chicken and spinach in a medium bowl and toss to combine. Sprinkle it in an even layer over the shallots. Whisk together the half-and-half, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl. Pour the custard over the filling.

In a microwave-safe dish, bring the milk to a boil. Remove the milk from the microwave and add the cornmeal. Stir and let soak at room temperature for 30 minutes. Set aside. Melt the butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the brown sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and carefully place 1 slice of pineapple in the center of the pan. Place the other 5 slices around the center slice in a circle. Place the cherries in the centers of the pineapple slices and sprinkle the nuts evenly over the fruit. Drizzle the reserved pineapple syrup over top.

Prick the potato all over with the tip of a knife or a fork, place it on a double layer of aluminum foil, and bake it 1 hour 45 minutes. Yes, that&#39;s a long time, but you want the potato to really caramelize. Juices will bubble from the pricks and cook to a dark caramel, and the flesh will be creamy and sweet. Put the potato on a rack until it&#39;s cool enough to handle, then peel it and place the flesh in a small bowl. Scrape any caramelized flesh off the skin into the bowl, spoon in the Grand Marnier, and beat the potato with a fork until it&#39;s smooth. Beat the heavy cream until it holds soft peaks, then cover it and refrigerate. Put the sugar in a small deep saucepan (with a pouring spout, if you have one). Drizzle the syrup over it, then pour in 1/3 cup cold water. Use your finger to make an X in the sugar (this just makes sure it all gets moistened), then bring to a boil over medium-low heat. Once the syrup is boiling, increase the heat to medium, stick a candy thermometer in the pan, and start beating the egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed. By the time the whites have reached the soft-peak stage, the syrup should be at 240 degrees. Increase the speed to medium-high and carefully pour the syrup into the whites. Be careful not to burn yourself when you do this. Now increase the speed to high and continue beating until the bowl is cool, another 4 to 5 minutes. You&#39;ll have a very thick meringue. Transfer the meringue to a larger bowl and fold in the sweet potato thoroughly. Give the cream a whisk or two, then fold it in. Spoon the mixture into a 3-quart aluminum souffle dish or into individual molds. Wrap first with plastic, then with aluminum foil, and freeze for at least 3 hours. Serve with a pitcher of the chocolate sauce. Bring the cream and corn syrup to a boil in a saucepan. Turn off the heat. Add the chocolate and shake the pan so all the chocolate is covered with cream. Let it sit for a few minutes to melt the chocolate, then stir until it&#39;s smooth. Add the bourbon and a pinch of salt. The sauce should be warm, so reheat it over simmering water if it cools down before dessert or if you&#39;ve refrigerated it in the ubiquitous covered container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 26577,&quot;Pastitsio Kima: Baked Macaroni 1 pound ground beef 1 onion, chopped 1 clove garlic, chopped 1/2 cup red wine 3/4 cup tomato puree 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes 1/2 cup water Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, ground, plus more, for seasoning 1 1/2 pound uncut macaroni 2 tablespoons butter, plus 1/2 pound 3 eggs, separated 2 1/2 cups kefalotyri or kasseri, grated 2 quarts milk 1/2 pound flour Nutmeg Instructions: Brown beef in a pan.

If the potatoes are too thick, add more hot cream and butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26594,&quot;Christmas Tree Surprise Cake 3 batches Classic Vanilla Cake Batter, recipe follows Red and green food coloring<br> 2-inch round cookie cutter<br> 3 batches Vanilla Bean Buttercream Frosting 8-inch cake board<br> About 3 cups assorted candies<br> 5 ounces white melting chocolate, such as Candy Melts<br> About 20 colored hard mint candies, such as Tic Tacs<br> About 40 peanut filled candy coated chocolates, such as M and M&#39;s<br> Small star cookie cutter<br> 1 lollipop stick or skewer<br> Gold sanding sugar<br> 2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons salted butter 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons superfine sugar<br> 3 extra-large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1/2 vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 vanilla bean (halved crosswise), split lengthwise<br> 5 1/2 cups powdered sugar<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons whole milk<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour a 9 x 13-inch pan. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. You have to bake 3 cakes, but bake them one at a time, mixing up the batter only when you&#39;re ready to bake. For 2 of the cakes, tint the batter green. For the third cake, tint the batter red. Bake each cake until the center springs back when lightly touched, about 45 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then invert the cake onto a wire rack to cool. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes so the cake becomes firm. Carve and level the cakes: Using plates, bowls, glasses or round cookie cutters to trace around, cut the following: From the two green cakes, cut out 4 rounds: 8 inch, 6 inch, 4 inch, and 2 inch. Then from the red cake, cut out 4 rounds: 7 inch, 5 inch, 3 inch, and 1 inch. Take the round cookie cutter and cut a hole through the centers of the 4 inch, 5 inch, 6 inch, and 7 inch layers. (Save all the scraps for making Christmas-colored cake pop dough!) Make the buttercream frosting. Measure out 1 cup and tint it red. Tint the rest dark green. Spread a little green frosting on the cake board, lay down the 8 inch green cake layer, and spread a layer of frosting on top. Add the 7 inch red layer and repeat, taking care not to frost the inside edges of the center hole. Continue stacking and frosting gradually smaller cake layers until you reach the 4 inch layer. Take the 3 cups of candy and fill the center core of the tree, pressing down a little to compact the candy. Frost the top of the 4 inch layer and continue stacking and frosting until all the layers are stacked. Once stacked, take a serrated knife and gently carve away the sharp edges of the layers to form a tall cone shape. Apply a very thin \\crumb coat\\ of frosting all over the outside of the cake. Set in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the Christmas lights. Melt the Candy Melts. Cut the colored Tic Tac candies in half crosswise. Use a toothpick dipped in the melted candy to attach a Tic Tac to the end of a peanut M and M of the same color (the M and M is the bulb and the Tic Tac is the base). You will need about 40 of these. To make the star for the top of the tree, trace around a star cookie cutter onto parchment. Pipe an outline of white melted candy, then fill in the shape. Place a lollipop stick in the center and cover with more melted candy. Sprinkle with sanding sugar and let set at room temperature. Place the green frosting into a piping bag fitted with a number 21 open star tip. Starting at the top of the cake, pipe 3/4 inch long strands of frosting in neat rows around the entire cake, like layers of pine branches on a Christmas tree. Once the cake is covered, place the red frosting into a piping bag fitted with a number 21 piping tip and pipe draping lines of \\tinsel\\ around the cake. Attach the colored M and M lights directly to the red frosting. Work quickly here, as the frosting will start to form a crust, which can make attaching the decorations difficult. Take the star and flip it over. Coat the back with white melted candy and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Allow to set. Insert the lollipop stick into the center of the top of the tree. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour an 8 x 3 inch round cake pan. Line the bottom of the pan with a round of parchment paper. In a stand mixer, with the whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, and eggs on high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Using the tip of a sharp knife, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the mixer bowl. Add the oil to the creamed mixture and combine. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder. Add the flour mixture and milk to the creamed mixture and beat on high speed until the flour is completely mixed, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Scrape the batter into the pan and use an offset spatula to smooth the top. Bake until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Check after 45 minutes, and if the top is browning too much, tent with foil. Cool the cake in the pan for 15 minutes, then run a metal spatula around the edge of the cake and invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. In a stand mixer with the whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed for at least 5 minutes, until the butter has lightened in color and is thoroughly whipped. Using the tip of a sharp knife, scrape the vanilla seeds into the butter and beat to incorporate. Add 1 cup of the sugar and begin mixing on low speed to combine, then beat on high speed for about 2 minutes. Repeat this process 1 cup at a time until all the sugar has been added. Add milk a dash at a time if the mixture becomes too thick or dry. Scrape down the sides as needed and make sure no sugar is visible. The frosting will last for 1 month in the freezer, 2 weeks in the fridge, and 3 days at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26595,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Pumpkin and Chicken Bites with Sunny&#39;s Creme Fraiche Dipping Sauce One 15-ounce can pumpkin puree 1 rotisserie chicken, skin discarded, meat shredded or chopped 1 stalk celery, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, grated on a rasp 2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage, 3 to 4 leaves 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, 10 to 12 sprigs 1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped 2 scallions, finely chopped 1/2 cup dried cranberries, chopped 1 teaspoon Hungarian paprika Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cup shredded Swiss or gruyere 24 empanada wrappers, such as Goya discos 2 eggs Sunny&#39;s Creme Fraiche Dipping Sauce, to serve, recipe follows 8 ounces creme fraiche 3 scallions, cut into thirds 1 clove garlic, grated on a rasp 1 tablespoon hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s Red Hot Sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> For the filling: In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, chicken, celery, garlic, sage, thyme, walnuts, scallions, dried cranberries and Hungarian paprika. Taste, making sure to get a bit of each ingredient in the sample. There should be a nice balance of sweet and savory; adding a nice pinch of salt can bring you to the right place. Stir before tasting again and adjust as needed. Once done with the salt, add a few grinds of black pepper. Add the cheese and stir to combine. Refrigerate until mix is firm and less sticky, about 20 minutes.<br> For the wrappers: Wrappers should be packed with paper between each. Remove one wrapper at a time along with the paper and roll and flatten each slightly with a rolling pin. If not packed with paper, roll on a sheet of wax paper. Cut each in half to create 48 half circles. Fill one side of each half with a heaping tablespoon of filling and fold the empty side over the filled side to create a triangle with a curved edge. Then, using the tines of a fork, close both open sides by pressing them together with the top 1/2 inch of the fork. Repeat for the rest.<br> In a small bowl whisk the eggs and 1 tablespoon water. Lightly brush one side of each bite and place the brushed side up on a parchment or nonstick aluminum foil-lined baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 24 minutes. Serve with Sunny&#39;s Creme Fraiche Dipping Sauce. In a food processor, add the creme fraiche, scallions, garlic and hot sauce. Taste the dip and season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Blend again and taste, seasoning again if needed.

Using a muddler, crush the lime pieces while bruising the mint with the sugar. Fill the glass just below the rim with the ice. Add the mint syrup, coconut milk, pineapple juice, pineapple rum and the coconut rum. Use a shaker to vigorously shake the contents of the glass together for at least 30 seconds. Pour the mojito back in the glass, and top off the glass with seltzer water. Place a sugar cane stick in each glass and garnish with fresh mint leaves. Serve immediately. Place the sugar and the water in a small saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to help dissolve the sugar. While the syrup heats, rinse the mint leaves to eliminate any dirt. Once the sugar has dissolved, remove the syrup from the heat, and dump the mint leaves into the saucepan. Allow the syrup to cool for at least 1 hour before straining out the mint. Store the syrup in an airtight container and place in the refrigerator until ready to use. Syrup will keep, refrigerated, for several weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 26598,&quot;Waffle Fry Sliders 20 ounces frozen waffle fries 1 pound ground beef 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br> 2 slices American or Cheddar cheese, quartered<br> 4 baby Bibb lettuce leaves, torn into small pieces 8 teaspoons ketchup 8 teaspoons mayo 8 thin slices small red onion<br> 8 slices Roma tomato<br> 8 dill pickle slices Instructions: For the fries: Bake the waffle fries according to the instructions on the package.

Form a well in the center and add in the eggs, egg yolks and oil. Using a fork, whisk together the eggs and oil and slowly begin incorporating the flour. When the mixture becomes too clumpy and difficult to mix with a fork, use your hands to knead in the remaining flour until a smooth ball of dough forms. If there is any flour left on your board, just push it to the side and knead the dough, adding flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and bouncy when pressed. Cover with a towel and set aside to rest for 30 minutes, or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap in the fridge for up to one day. Divide the dough in half. Cover one dough ball to keep moist. Line a large baking sheet with a cooling rack. Roll out one dough ball on a lightly floured surface into an oblong shape 1 to 2 millimeters thick, adding more flour as needed. You want the dough to be thin enough so that you can see the shadow of your hand through it. Loosely fold or roll the dough along the longer side and using a sharp knife, cut crosswise into 2 1/2-millimeter-thick slices. Dust with a little more flour and use your fingers to gently shake and unravel the noodles. Transfer to the rack-lined baking sheet and continue with the remaining dough. Set the noodles aside. Repeat with remaining dough. If using fresh, prepare the clams by soaking in a large bowl of cold water for 20 to 30 minutes. Scrub the clams clean, then drain and set aside in the fridge. While the clams soak, make the topping: Heat the oil in a small skillet. Stir in the garlic, panko and red pepper flakes and season with salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown. Transfer to a dish and set aside for serving. For the sauce: In a high-sided saut pan fitted with a lid, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the shallot, season with salt and cook for 2 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute, or until the garlic has softened. Carefully pour in the wine and allow it to simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, until slightly reduced. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the clams into the wine and shallot mixture, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until their shells open. If using canned clams, add them to the pan along with their juices and bring to a simmer. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, parsley and tarragon. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 3 minutes until al dente. Reserve about a cup of pasta cooking liquid. Transfer the noodles to the sauce along with about 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking liquid and bring to a simmer. Gently toss with tongs until the sauce has thickened and coats the pasta, adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed. Serve immediately topped with the crunchy topping and a scattering of parsley and tarragon. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 26601,&quot;Fillet with Crushed Grape Tomatoes and Horseradish Extra-virgin olive oil 2 pounds beef tenderloin 1/2 cup grated prepared horseradish 1 cup sour cream 1 lemon, juiced 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper 1 pint grape tomatoes, halved 1/4 cup olive oil Watercress sprigs, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put a large, heavy cast iron or ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add a 2-count drizzle of oil and get it smoking hot. Put the tenderloin in the skillet and sear the outside of the meat all over, 5 to 8 minutes total. Put it in the oven and roast 15 to 20 minutes until rare (the internal temperature of the meat will be 120 degrees F). Take the meat out of the pan, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate until it gets until good and cold, 1 to 2 hours. While you wait for the beef to chill, stir the horseradish, sour cream, lemon juice and oil together in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. When the beef is cold, take a long, very sharp knife, and cut the meat into slices as thin as you can make them. Lay them out on a platter (they&#39;ll overlap \\u2013 that&#39;s fine). Now drizzle the horseradish sauce all over the meat. Hand crush the tomatoes in a bowl and add olive oil to make them saucy; season that with salt and pepper too so that it tastes really good.

Add the flour and salt and pulse until the dough forms a ball. Roll mounded teaspoons of the dough into balls about 1 inch wide and place on the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until the cookies are firm when gently pressed, completely dry and just beginning to crack at the top, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool the cookies on the sheets for 5 minutes; they will firm as they cool. Meanwhile, put the nutmeg and remaining 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar in a pie plate or wide baking dish and mix well. Toss the warm cookies very gently in the sugar mixture until evenly coated; the cookies need to be warm for the first coating of sugar to stick. Cool the cookies on a wire rack completely, about 30 minutes, then toss again in the sugar mixture so they are very white. Sprinkle with additional grated nutmeg.

Rub half the mixture all over the slab of spare ribs, on every side. Reserve the other half of the dry rub mix. Heat the oven to 215 degrees. While the oven is warming, soak the wood chips in cold water to cover (for about 20 minutes). Remove the chips from water and spread them evenly in the base of the smoker. Place the smoker, uncovered, on top of two stove-top burners set at medium-high heat. Let the wood chips smoke for about 3 minutes. Then place the slab of ribs on the smoker tray, place the tray over the wood chips, and cover the smoker tightly with its lid. Turn heat down to medium, and leave the smoker on the burners for 5 minutes. Then transfer smoker to the oven, placing it on the oven floor. After the ribs have been in the oven for 1 1/2 hours, remove the smoker and once again place it over two burners set at medium heat for 5 minutes. Return smoker to oven floor. After the ribs have been in the oven for one hour more, remove the smoker from the oven. Carefully lift up the tray holding the ribs, and pour off the liquid that has accumulated in the tray. Reserve. Return tray with ribs to middle portion of oven, and cook for one hour more. While ribs are cooking, de-grease the reserved cooking liquid, and measure 2 tablespoons of it into a bowl. If you don&#39;t have 2 tablespoons make up the difference with water. Add the vinegar and blend well. Reserve. Add the salt to the remaining dry rub mix and blend well. Reserve. Remove ribs from oven and brush top side with the cooking liquid-vinegar mixture. Then sprinkle the salted dry rub mix evenly over the top side of the ribs. Return to middle portion of oven, and cook one hour more. Remove ribs from oven. Let stand 15 minutes. Carve into individual ribs and serve.

Allow the water to slowly come to a simmer; this should take about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat immediately just as the stock reaches a boil. Let the stock sit for 1 to 2 minutes and then strain out the solids. Reserve 2 quarts of the dashi to use in the future as a base for soups and stews (it will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator or frozen for several months), and the remaining quart to prepare the miso soup. Pour the dashi into a wok and place over medium heat. Whisk the miso into the dashi, stirring until smooth. Toss in the mushrooms. Lightly coat the bottom of a 12-inch bamboo steamer with non-stick cooking spray. Season both sides of the fish fillets with salt and pepper; lay them side by side in the steamer, skin-side up. Cut the ginger lengthwise in strips and put it on top of the fish so the flavor can permeate; put the cilantro on top. Nestle the bok choy in the steamer, side by side, and cover with the bamboo lid. Set the steamer inside the wok, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes until the fish is cooked. Carefully remove the bamboo steamer and add the udon noodles and green onions into the soup. Cook for 1 minute or until the noodles are tender. To serve: Ladle the miso soup into 2 wide shallow bowls, scoop the noodles into the soup and lay the bok choy and fish on top of that.

Place in a large noncorrosive dish. The cl marinade: Heat a griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat. Tear the chiles into flat pieces and toast them a few at a time, pressing them against the hot surface with a metal spatula until they crackle and blister, then flipping them over and pressing them again. Cover with boiling water, weight with a plate to keep them submerged and soak 30 minutes. Roast the garlic on the hot griddle or skillet, turning frequently, until soft inside and blackened outside, about 15 minutes. Cool and peel. Drain the chiles and place in a blender jar with garlic, 1/4 teaspoon clove, 2 teaspoons lightly toasted sesame seeds and vinegar. Pulverize the cumin and peppercorns in a mortar or spice grinder, and add to the blender along with the salt and 3/4 cup water. Blend until smooth, then strain through a medium-mesh sieve. Remove 1/2 cup, stir in the sugar, cover and set aside for the final glazing. Spread the rest of the cl paste over the meat, cover and refrigerate overnight (at least 18 hours). Slow-steaming: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Set a roasting rack into a deep, wide kettle, a roasting pan with a rack or a stockpot. If it doesn=t sit at least 1-inch above the bottom of the pot, prop it up on custard cups, tin cans or the like. Measure in 4 cups of water, then lay the marinated meat on the rack and spread any remaining marinade over it. Add water to the masa (or masa harina mixture) to make a soft dough. Roll tennis ball-size pieces between your palms to make 3/4-inch ropes, then press them gently all around the top edge of your pot. Set the lid in place and press it into the masa to seal. Bake for 4 hours. Finishing the broth: Break the seal by tapping the hardened masa with the back of a cleaver or mallet, and take off the lid; then carefully remove the tender meat. Take out the rack, spoon the fat off the broth, then measure it. You need at least 1 quart, if necessary, add water to bring it to that level. Pour the broth into a small saucepan. Puree the tomato in a blender or food processor, add it to the broth along with the oregano, cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 45 minutes. Season with salt. Glazing and serving the birria: Shortly before serving, remove the bones, large pieces of gristle and excess fat from the meat, keeping the pieces of meat as large as possible. Set the meat on a baking sheet, brush lightly with the reserved cl paste glaze, then bake for 10 minutes to set the glaze. Either present the meat on a large platter and pass the warm broth separately, or slice the meat across the grain and serve it in deep plates, awash in the broth. Mix the onion and fresh coriander, and pass it with the lime at the table.

Wash the fingerling potatoes, pat dry, and season with olive oil spray and half of the salt, pepper, and fresh herbs. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and roast for 10 minutes or until soft to the touch. Slice the zucchini in thirds crosswise; slice each piece into quarters lengthwise. For a classic French presentation, round the angled sides to form 12 oval sticks Season the chicken with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and 1 teaspoon herbs. Heat a saute pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Sear the chicken breasts on 1 side for about 2 minutes and turn over. Add the leeks, carrots, mushrooms, zucchini, and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute to sear the vegetables. Add the white wine, and boil until the wine is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Stir in the stock and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the Swiss chard to 1 side of the pan to braise the greens in the cooking liquid, about 1 minute. To serve: Place 1/2 cup of the Swiss chard in the center of 4 large soup bowls. Slice each chicken breast on an angle into 5 pieces. Arrange the chicken on top of the Swiss chard. Divide the vegetables among the 4 bowls and ladle the broth around the vegetables. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 26628,&quot;Red Witch&#39;s Brew with Ginger and Blueberry Eyeballs 4 cups granulated sugar 8 hibiscus blueberry tea bags<br> 3 red rooibos tea bags<br> 1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh ginger<br> 1 lemon, peels cut off and juiced<br> Blueberries, for garnish Lemon sparkling water, for serving Instructions: Combine the sugar and 6 cups water together in a medium pot.

Add the garlic, salt, pepper and onion and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the broth, diced tomatoes with their liquid, tomato sauce, Parmesan rind and 1/4 cup of the basil and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes. Remove the Parmesan rind and puree the soup with an immersion blender until smooth. In a small saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter. Whisk in the flour and continue to cook, whisking, until the mixture is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cream and cook, stirring, until thickened. Add the cream mixture to the soup and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the soup has thickened, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over medium heat until foamy. Place 2 of the bread slices in the skillet; top each bread slice with 2 cheese slices, 2 tablespoons of the chopped basil and another bread slice. Cook until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes per side. Cut each sandwich into 9 pieces. Serve the soup with the grilled cheese croutons and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup basil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 26631,&quot;Pork Chops with Wine and Garlic 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons butter<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 bone-in T-bone pork chops, 1 inch thick 16 cloves garlic, peeled 1 1/2 cups red wine<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 1/2 cup beef broth, plus more if needed 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar Lemony Green Beans, recipe follows, for serving, optional 1 pound thin green beans 2 tablespoons butter<br> Zest and juice of 1 lemon<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy skillet over high heat. Salt and pepper both sides of the pork chops and sear them until they&#39;re nice and golden, about 2 minutes per side. (No need to completely cook the chops at this point.) Remove the chops from the skillet and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium high, then throw in the whole cloves of garlic. Stir them around and cook until they get nice and golden brown, a couple minutes. Pour in the red wine, then add the bay leaf. Stir it around and cook, raising the heat if necessary, until the sauce is reduced and thick, several minutes. Stir in the beef broth (you can add more if it needs the liquid) and add the chops back to the skillet, arranging them so they&#39;re swimming in the sauce. Cook the chops in the sauce for a few minutes, then add the balsamic. Shake the skillet to get it to distribute, then cook for a couple more minutes, or until the pork chops are done. Remove the chops from the skillet once more, then let the sauce reduce a little more if needed, until it&#39;s very thick and rich and the garlic is soft. Swirl in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and sprinkle in a little salt and pepper. Arrange the pork chops on a platter, then pour the whole skillet of sauce (including the garlic) over the top. Serve with Lemony Green Beans if desired. Snap off the stem ends of the green beans or cut them off in a big bunch with a knife. Heat a pan over a medium heat and add the butter. (It helps to use a pan with a light-colored bottom, so you can keep track of the color.) Swirl the pan occasionally so the butter cooks evenly. As the butter melts, it will begin to foam. The color will progress from lemony yellow to golden tan to, finally, a toasty brown. Once you smell that nutty aroma, add the green beans and saute for 3 to 4 minutes so the beans take on a little color. Add the lemon zest and juice, salt and pepper, then transfer to a platter in batches with tongs. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 26632,&quot;Green Goddess Dip 3/4 cup buttermilk 1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves 1/4 cup fresh dill 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 1/4 cup fresh tarragon leaves 1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon champagne vinegar 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons neutral oil 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: Combine the buttermilk, yogurt, basil, dill, parsley, tarragon, mustard and vinegar in a blender and blend for about 15 seconds. With the blender running, slowly drizzle in the neutral oil and extra-virgin olive oil until the mixture is emulsified. Season with salt and black pepper.

Open the meat like a book and pound with a mallet or heavy skillet into a 1-inch-thick rectangle, about 8 by 14 inches. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Season the pork with about 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. In a small bowl, mix the lemon zest, garlic, 2 teaspoons fennel seeds, the sage, rosemary and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper. Rub the mixture all over the pork, then roll it up tightly and tie with twine. Drizzle the roll with olive oil and rub all over; sprinkle with pepper and more fennel seeds. (The roll can be prepared up to 3 days in advance; refrigerate until roasting.) Place the pork roll on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the middle registers 180 degrees and the pork is crusty on the outside, about 2 hours. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing. While the pork roasts, make the pickled onions: Bring the vinegar, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, the bay leaf, fennel seeds and red pepper flakes to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion slices and simmer 1 minute, then remove from the heat and let the onion cool in the liquid. (Leftover pickled onions will keep in the liquid for weeks.) Prepare the polenta: Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil and fry the polenta until golden and crisp, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. To assemble, arrange the polenta on a platter or individual plates. Thinly slice the pork roll, then cut into bite-size pieces and pile on the polenta.

Grease three 8-inch round cake pans and two 6-inch round cake pans with flour-based baking spray. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the butter and granulated sugar and mix on medium speed until fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla. Mix well. In a small bowl, combine the liquid food coloring and cocoa powder. Stir until smooth. Add the mixture to the creamed butter mixture. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in three additions, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the flour. Scrape down the bowl and mix again on low speed until no pockets of flour remain. Combine the baking soda and vinegar in a small cup; the mixture will bubble and fizz. Pour into the cake batter and mix on medium-low speed until well incorporated. Divide the batter among the prepared pans and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when pressed in the center. Let the cakes cool slightly in the pans. Turn the cakes out onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely.<br> When the cakes are cool, use a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter to cut the centers from two of the 8-inch cake layers, or use a knife. Cut a large triangle from the center of each 6-inch cake layer; cut the triangles in half and set aside. Save all of the scraps from the 6-inch cakes for later use. For the buttercream frosting: In an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, mix together the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar on low speed. Add the vanilla extract and increase the speed to medium. Gradually add milk or cream a little at a time until the mixture thins to spreading consistency. Whip at high speed until the frosting is light and fluffy. Remove half of the frosting and transfer to a large disposable piping bag with a 1/2-inch hole snipped in the end.<br> Remove half of the remaining frosting to a separate large bowl and tint with the black, sky blue and royal blue food coloring. Mix in the food coloring 1/4 teaspoon at a time until the desired intensity of blue-grey hue is achieved. Transfer to a large piping bag with a 1/2-inch hole snipped in the end. Divide the remaining frosting into three separate small bowls; tint one bowl with red food coloring, one bowl with sky blue food coloring and the last bowl with black. Add the coloring 1/4 teaspoon at a time until the desired intensity is achieved. Transfer the red buttercream to a disposable piping bag with a 1/2-inch hole snipped in the end. Transfer the sky blue buttercream to a disposable piping bag with a 1/2-inch hole snipped in the end. Transfer the black buttercream to a disposable piping bag with a 1/8-inch hole snipped in the end. For the decors and assembly: Place a cake layer with the center removed on a cardboard cake round (8 inches or larger). Pipe a fat line of white (untinted) frosting on top of the cake around the opening. Place the second cake layer with the center removed on top of the first.<br> Combine the blue sprinkles and fish-shaped candy in a bowl or a jar; mix together. Pour the candy into the center of the cake, filling the empty hole to the top. Pipe a fat line of white icing around the filled hole in the center of the cake. Place the last, whole cake layer on top. Chill the cake in the refrigerator until the buttercream is set, about 20 minutes. Remove the chilled cake from the refrigerator and carefully cut away two sides of the cake so that the cake is an oval shape.<br> Place a fat line of white frosting on one long side of the cake; stack the four cake triangles (cut from the 6-inch cakes) upright onto the line of frosting. Frost the entire cake with a thin layer of frosting (crumb-coat). Refrigerate for 20 minutes, or until the frosting is firm.<br> Frost the cake with additional white frosting. Using an offset spatula, smooth and round the pointed triangle pieces with extra frosting so that it resembles a shark&#39;s snout. Refrigerate the cake for 20 minutes. Pipe a fat line of white frosting around the mouth of the shark and down the front of the cake. Smooth using an offset spatula. Pipe a thick covering of blue-grey frosting on the back of the cake and smooth with a spatula.<br> Pipe red frosting in the front mouth opening and use the back of a spoon to smooth it into the cavity. You will have leftover frosting; reserve for later use. Refrigerate the cake until well-chilled, about 20 minutes.<br> Transfer the cake on the cake board to a large 12-inch square cake drum. Pipe a line of blue-grey frosting around the right and left sides of the cake at the base. Use two of the 6-inch cake scraps with rounded edges to create the shark&#39;s flippers. Cover the pieces with blue-grey frosting and smooth with an offset spatula. Use one or two more of the rounded cake scraps to create a fin on the back center of the shark. Cover with blue-grey frosting. Make a divot on each side of the shark head with the back of a spoon; fill each divot with black frosting. While the frosting is still wet, add a single white confetti sprinkle to each eye.<br> Remove 35 white candy melting wafers and cut each to a point so they are shark tooth-shaped, using kitchen-dedicated scissors. Insert the teeth into the top and bottom edge of the mouth opening, creating a double row of teeth.<br> Pipe the sky blue buttercream around the bottom edge of the cake to create water around the shark. Pipe a small amount of leftover white frosting and blend into the blue portion. Place the remaining candy melting wafers in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in the microwave in 30-second intervals until the candy can be stirred smooth. Transfer the melted candy to a disposable piping bag and snip a small hole in the end. Pipe the candy into a nonstick donut pan. Chill until set, about 20 minutes.<br> Turn out the candy and place around the bottom of the shark cake in the blue frosting. Pipe four lines of leftover red buttercream to create the appearance of a life preserver. Allow the cake to come to room temperature before serving. Use a large serrated knife to open the shark&#39;s belly in front of an audience. Remove the slice to reveal a cascade of candy fish and ocean blue sprinkles. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 26655,&quot;Caviar Stuffed Eggs 6 hard boiled eggs, halved 1/4 cup sour cream 3 tablespoons chives, plus more, for garnish 1 lemon, juiced 1/2 teaspoon wasabi powder or dry mustard 4 ounces salmon caviar Instructions: Remove the yolks from the eggs.

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season the pork with salt and pepper and sear on all sides until golden brown. Transfer the pot to the oven and roast until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 125 degrees F, about 1 hour. Brush the pork liberally with the Molasses Glaze and continue roasting until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F. Remove the roast to a platter, brush with more of the glaze and let rest 15 minutes. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan and place on top of the stove over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook until soft, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the wine, increase the heat to high, and cook until reduced by half. Add the stock and the herbs, and bring to a boil, cook until reduced by 1/3. Reduce the heat to low and let the broth simmer. Drop the dumplings into the broth, cover, and simmer until they are puffed and cooked through, about 12 to 5 minutes. Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, black pepper, parsley, and thyme in a medium mixing bowl. Using your fingers, cut the shortening into the flour mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the milk, stirring just until the mixture is moistened.

(Squeeze the juice of the orange quarters into the brine before you chuck in the pieces.) Untie and remove any string or trussing attached to the turkey, shake it free and add it to the liquid. Add more water if the turkey is not completely submerged. Keep the mixture in a cold place, even outside overnight or for up 1 or 2 days before you cook it, remembering to take it out of its liquid (and wiping it dry with kitchen-towel) a good 40 or 50 minutes before it has to go into the oven. Turkeys - indeed this is the case for all meat - should be at room temperature before being put in the preheated oven. If you&#39;re at all concerned - the cold water in the brine will really chill this bird - then just cook the turkey for longer than its actual weight requires. For the basting glaze: Place the butter and syrup into a saucepan and cook over a low heat, while stirring, until the ingredients have melted and combined. Brush the turkey with the glaze before roasting, and baste periodically throughout the roasting time. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cook the turkey for 30 minutes at this relatively high temperature, then turn the oven down to 350 degrees F and continue cooking, turning the oven back up to 425 degrees F for the final15 minutes or so if you want to give a browning boost to the skin. For a 9 to 11-pound turkey, allow 2 1/2 to 3-hours in total. But remember that ovens vary enormously, so just check by piercing the flesh between leg and body with a small sharp knife: when the juices run clear, the turkey is cooked. Just as it&#39;s crucial to let the turkey come to room temperature before it goes in to the oven, so it&#39;s important to let it stand out of the oven for a good 20 minutes before you actually carve it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 26664,&quot;Bake-Sale Thumbprints 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup unsalted butter, (1 1/2 sticks), softened 2/3 cup sugar, plus more for rolling 1 large egg 1/2 vanilla bean, seeds scraped from pod or 1/8 teaspoon vanilla bean paste, or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/3 cup raspberry, cherry, or strawberry jam Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Allow to cool and then pulse in a food processor until very finely chopped but not ground. Combine the chopped pecans, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the brown sugar, yogurt, oil, vanilla extract, lemon zest and eggs in another bowl. Stir the carrots into the egg mixture. Fold the carrot-egg mixture into the flour mixture until just combined. Divide evenly among the prepared pans. (Don&#39;t be alarmed if the batter seems skimpy; the cakes will rise once baked.)

The butter must be cut into small pieces. To make the dough: Stir the yogurt and the ice water (strained of ice) together in a small bowl and set aside. Put the flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in a large bowl, tossing them once or twice. Work the butter into the flour mixture aiming for pieces that range in size from bread crumbs to small peas. The smaller pieces will make the dough tender, the larger ones will make it flaky. Sprinkle the yogurt/water mixture over the dough, one tablespoon at a time. With your hands, gather the curds of dough together. The dough will be soft. Do not overwork the dough. Divide the dough in half and shape into a disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least two hours or freeze up to one month. To bake: Preheat oven to 400. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Put dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll in into an 8 - inch circle about 1/8th inch thick. If it&#39;s sticky, throw a little extra flour on it, your hands and the rolling pin. Transfer dough to baking sheet. Top with any combination of sweet or savory ingredients. Leave a 2-3 inch border un-topped. Fold uncovered border of dough up over the filling, allowing the dough to pleat as you work your way around the galette. The dough will \\pleat\\ and fall naturally. Let it. If you&#39;re preparing a sweet or dessert galette, brush the crust with an egg wash and sprinkle with sugar just before baking. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until pastry is golden and fruits are bubbly. Transfer baking sheet to a cooling rack and let stand ten minutes or so. Slide galette on to a serving dish. Serve warm or room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26673,&quot;Pickled Jalapenos 1 lb jalapeno peppers 2 c. white vinegar (5-percent acidity) 2 c. filtered water 2 Tbsp pickling salt (4 Tbsp kosher salt) 2 cloves garlic (optional) 1 Tbsp whole black peppercorns (optional) 1 Tbsp honey or sugar (optional) Instructions: Prepare the jars and lids: Wash all jars and lids thoroughly with soap and water and rinse well. Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil. Prepare the brine: Add vinegar, water, salt and garlic and peppercorns or honey (if using) to a medium saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to keep at a simmer. Prepare the jalapenos: Wearing latex or plastic gloves, slice the jalapenos into 1/4-inch rings. Add the rings to the brine and bring back to the boil. Fill and close the jars: Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the jalapenos in the saucepan. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the jalapenos into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight. Seal the jars: Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 5 minutes. Remove and cool: Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately. Label and store: Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26674,&quot;Christina&#39;s Drunken-Pig Home-Fries 4 large pork sausage links (1 pound) 2 slices bacon 1 (12-ounce) beer 3 medium-size red potatoes, cut into 1/4-inch dice 1 medium onion, diced Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce 2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Put the sausage and bacon in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Cook, turning to brown evenly, until bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon from pan and set it aside. Add a 1/4 cup of the beer to the skillet and continue cooking the sausage until cooked through, about 10 minutes more. Remove the sausage from the pan and set aside. Add the potatoes and onion to the skillet, along with another 1/4 cup beer. Cook, stirring and adding more beer as needed, until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cut the sausages into 1/4-inch-thick rounds and stir into the potato mixture along with the barbecue sauce. Transfer to a serving dish and crumble the bacon over the top. Sprinkle with parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Zinfandel, Tempranillo]&quot; 26675,&quot;Tarte Tatin 6 firm apples such as Granny Smith, Pink Lady or Honeycrisp 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) salted butter, softened<br> 1 cup sugar<br> Pinch of kosher salt<br> Caviar from 1 vanilla bean<br> Juice of 1/2 lemon<br> 1 sheet puff pastry, chilled Whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Peel and core the apples, then cut them into quarters. Spread the butter on the bottom of a 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet. Mix the sugar, salt and vanilla together to evenly distribute the caviar. Sprinkle the sugar mixture evenly over the butter. Squeeze over the lemon juice. Place the apple quarters cut-side up on top. Remember, the bottom will become the top so make it look pretty. Put the pan over medium heat and cook until the sugar melts, caramelizes and begins to thicken. The apples will release their juices during this process, so it could take 10 to 15 minutes. If the juices start getting too dark, lower the heat a little. While the apples are cooking, take the puff pastry out of the fridge. Use a knife to cut a circle just big enough to fit over the top of the apples in the skillet. Keep chilled. When the sugar has caramelized, place the pastry circle over the apples, gently tucking in the sides. Transfer to the oven and bake until the pastry is risen and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Carefully turn the tarte tatin out onto a serving plate. Serve with whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26676,&quot;Cranberry-Walnut Jelly Roll 1 pound cranberries (fresh or frozen) 2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup fresh orange juice 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 cinnamon stick 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon cream of tartar 3 large eggs 1 cup granulated sugar Finely grated zest of 1 lemon Unsalted butter, softened, for the baking sheet 1/2 cup walnuts, roughly chopped Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting (optional) Whipped cream, for serving Instructions: Cook the cranberries: Combine the cranberries, sugar and orange juice in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low; stir in the allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon stick and simmer 5 to 7 minutes. Make the filling: Strain the cranberry mixture; set the berries aside. Return the liquid to the saucepan, bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook until syrupy, about 8 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick, then puree half of the cranberries in a blender; transfer to a bowl. Stir in the rest of the cranberries and the reduced syrup. Spread the mixture in a large baking dish so it cools more quickly. Refrigerate until completely cooled, about 20 minutes. Make the batter: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Sift the flour, baking powder and cream of tartar into a bowl. Combine the eggs, granulated sugar, lemon zest and 1/3 cup water in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on high speed until light and airy, 3 to 5 minutes. Gently fold the egg mixture into the flour mixture with a rubber spatula. Do not overmix: The batter will lose some volume, but small bubbles should remain. Bake the cake: Butter a 10-by-15-inch jelly roll pan, line with parchment paper and butter the parchment. Add the batter. Slowly tilt the pan back and forth to evenly distribute the batter. Bake until the cake is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Unmold the cake: While the cake is still warm, place a slightly damp kitchen towel on top; lay a cutting board over the towel. Hold the cutting board and baking sheet together and flip over. Lift off the pan, then peel off the parchment. Let the cake cool slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the filling: Dollop the cooled filling over the cake and spread gently, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. (Be careful not to tear the cake.) Sprinkle with the walnuts. Roll the cake: Position the cake with a shorter end facing you. Use the towel to tip the edge of the cake forward and gently roll it over, using the towel to guide it. Once you make one full roll, pull the towel away and gently squeeze the cake to make the roll compact. Continue rolling the cake, using the towel to guide it and gently squeezing as you go. Position the cake roll seam-side down and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Transfer to a platter and dust with confectioners&#39; sugar. Slice and serve with whipped cream. Chill the cake seam-side down to prevent it from unrolling. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 26677,&quot;Syrup of Figs for Constipation Juice of 1 lemon 2/3 ounce dried senna pods 1/2 cup boiling water 1/2 cup sugar 8 fresh figs, quartered Instructions: Place the senna pods in a glass bowl and pour over the boiling water.

Grease six 8-ounce ramekins with butter and set aside on a rimmed baking sheet. Cut six 1/2-inch thick slices from the baguette and place them on the baking sheet. Cut the remaining baguette into 1/2-inch cubes (you should have about 4 1/2 cups) and spread them out on the same baking sheet. Bake, tossing the cubes and flipping the slices halfway through, until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of black pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to soften, about 6 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are very soft and caramelized, 35 to 40 minutes. Add the wine, turn the heat to medium-high, bring to a boil and cook until the wine has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups water and the bouillon cube and stir until the cube dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil and let cook until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the heavy cream, chives, eggs and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add 1/2 cup bread cubes to each ramekin, sprinkle each with 1/4 cup Gruyere and top each with 1/4 cup bread cubes. Pour the egg mixture over the top. Divide the onion mixture among the ramekins. Top each ramekin with a slice of bread and 3/4 cup Gruyere. Set aside at room temperature for 15 minutes to allow the bread to absorb the egg mixture. Bake on the baking sheet until the custard is set and the bread pudding is puffed and golden, about 20 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 26693,&quot;Banana Daiquiri 1 scoop crushed ice 1/2 banana 1/4 lime, juiced 1 teaspoon sugar 1 3/4 ounces white rum Instructions: Mix in a blender.

Place a cast iron pan on the grill. Divide the meat into 4 equal portions (8-ounces each). Form each portion loosely into a 3/4-inch burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Brush each burger with oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Place the burger in the cast iron pan, or directly on the grill, until slightly charred on both sides and cooked to desired doneness. Brush the burgers with the BBQ sauce and add 2 slices of cheese to each burger during the last minute of cooking. Close the lid to melt the cheese. Place the burgers onto the toasted buns. Top each with bacon, onion rings, and top bun. Skewer with wooden skewer, if needed. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Add the onions and cook until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ketchup and water, bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients, salt and pepper, to taste, and simmer for an additional 10 minutes until thickened, stirring occasionally. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree until smooth, season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Pour into a bowl and allow to cool at room temperature. Sauce will keep for 1 week, in the refrigerator, stored in a tightly sealed container. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until it reaches 360 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. While the oil is heating, put the buttermilk in a large baking dish and season liberally with salt and pepper. Divide the flour between 2 large baking dishes and season both dishes liberally with salt and pepper and cayenne. Working in batches, dredge some of the onion rings in 1 of the dishes of flour and tap off the excess. Dip the rings in the buttermilk and allow excess to drain off and then dredge the rings in the second dish of flour making sure to coat the rings evenly. Tap off excess and put into the hot oil. Fry the rings until golden brown and tender, turning once or twice, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on the baking sheet lined with paper towels and season with more salt. Repeat with remaining onion rings. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 26696,&quot;Herbed Veal Chops with Bacon and Shallots 4 loin or rib veal chops (each about 1/3 pound; each about 3/4-inch thick) 1 to 2 tablespoons butter 4 slices of bacon, chopped 3 tablespoons minced shallots Juice of 1 lime Water 1 cup loosely packed chopped fresh herbs such as tarragon, mint, basil and parsley or a combination of your choice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Trim excess fat from the chops and season them lightly with pepper.

Truss the turkey with butcher&#39;s twine so it is compact, then mount the turkey on the rotisserie spit. Push in the spit forks so they are very secure; tighten the screws well.<br> Mix together the sugar, paprika, 2 tablespoons salt and 1 tablespoon pepper in a small bowl until combined. Rub the turkey all over with oil and sprinkle with the seasoning. Place the spit on the rotisserie. If you are using a large kettle-style charcoal grill, position a 9-by-13-inch disposable aluminum pan under the turkey. If you are using a multi-burner gas grill, position a 9-by-13-inch disposable aluminum pan or a half-sheet pan under the turkey, depending on the clearance between the bird and the grill grates; if necessary, remove the grill grates and place the pan on the bars below. Cover the grill and cook until the skin starts to brown slightly, about 20 minutes. Uncover the grill, drizzle the turkey slowly with the melted butter as it turns, then cover the grill and continue to cook for another 40 minutes.<br> For the stuffing (see Cook&#39;s Note): Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sage, thyme, celery, onions, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the broth and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat.<br> Beat the eggs with the parsley in a large bowl. Add the bread, then pour in the vegetable-broth mixture and toss to combine.<br> After the turkey has been roasting for 1 hour, uncover the grill and carefully spoon the stuffing into the pan under the turkey. Cover the grill and continue to cook until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F and the stuffing is golden on top and hot throughout, another 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes; remove the stuffing earlier if it starts to brown too quickly on the bottom. Remove the turkey from the spit and let rest for 30 minutes before carving. Keep the stuffing warm until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 26698,&quot;Asparagus Casserole Two bunches fresh asparagus 4 tablespoons butter<br> 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup milk<br> Pinch salt<br> 5 ounces Cheddar, grated<br> 4 hard-boiled eggs 1/2 cup saltine cracker crumbs (about 10 crackers)<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add the asparagus to a large pot of boiling water, keeping the bundles together with rubber bands or string. Cook for a couple of minutes; the asparagus should be bright green and still crunchy. List the bundles out of the water and slice off the tough ends of the asparagus. Drop the trimmed ends back in the boiling water and lower to a simmer. Run the asparagus tops under cold water to stop the cooking. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Whisk in the flour to make a roux. Cook for 1 minute, then whisk in the milk and 1 cup of the asparagus cooking liquid. Add the salt and continue cooking until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Add the grated Cheddar and cook, stirring, until melted, about 1 minute. Arrange the asparagus in the bottom of a 9-by-12-by-2-inch baking dish, alternating the stem ends so each serving includes both heads and stems. Thinly slice the hard-boiled eggs and arrange them over the asparagus. Pour the cheese sauce over the eggs and asparagus and sprinkle with the cracker crumbs.

Add the water and the 1/4 teaspoon of the salt to the saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Wrap the pan&#39;s lid tightly with a small kitchen towel and cover the saucepan. (Make sure the towel&#39;s edges are folded up well away from the heat.) Lower the heat to low and simmer covered, for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat (don&#39;t uncover) and set aside for 10 minutes. Fluff the millet with a fork and transfer to a large bowl. Using a box grater, grate the carrot and radish into the bowl of millet. Add the ginger, garlic, lime juice, mirin, and chili paste and stir to combine. Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil and salt it generously. Add the edamame, cover, and return to a boil; cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain and immediately add to the bowl of millet mixture (to lightly warm the vegetables). Stir to combine and set aside to cool. When cool, season the edamame mixture with the remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Transfer to a food processor and puree into a paste. Return the edamame to the bowl and stir in the panko and egg whites until incorporated. Using your hands, form the edamame mixture into 8 patties about 3 inches in diameter. Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate until set. Place a rack about 4 inches from the broiler element and preheat. Place the patties on a foil-lined baking sheet or broiler pan. Brush both sides of the patties lightly with oil and sprinkle with salt. Broil until the tops are lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and flip the patties with a spatula. Broil until lightly browned and hot, about 3 minutes more. Serve on grilled naan bread with sprouts, pickled ginger, and wasabi.

In a food processor, pulse the salt, granulated garlic, black pepper, bay leaves, thyme, orange zest and rosemary until still coarse but uniform, about 10 times. Rub the inside of the turkey with the salt mix. Then carefully slip your fingers under the breast skin and rub a liberal amount UNDER the skin. Flip the turkey on its side and sprinkle more of the salt mixture on the thigh, wing and leg. Repeat on other side. Place the bird in a large zipper-top bag or brining bag. (If neither is available, cover in plastic wrap.) Place the bird on a wire rack on a sheet pan breast-side up, and place in the fridge away from any raw food (on a lower shelf). Leave in the fridge for 3 days. On the night before cooking, remove the turkey from the fridge and take it out of the plastic. The skin should be dry and the salt should be dissolved. If any large patches of moisture are present, wipe with paper towels. Place back in the fridge, uncovered, for another 8 hours to dry out. On the day of, take the turkey out of the fridge 1 hour before cooking. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Fit a roasting pan with a wire v-rack.

Place the ground chicken in a large mixing bowl and flatten with a spatula to increase the surface area. Sprinkle with the kosher salt and cornstarch, then add the panko, sambal, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sugar, rice vinegar, sesame oil, five-spice powder, if using, ginger, scallions, garlic and egg. Fold together until evenly mixed. You can refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes to solidify the fats, which will help with shaping, or continue to form the meatballs. Divide the meat mixture into 6 portions. Lightly coat your hands with cornstarch and roll the meat into balls, placing them onto the cornstarch-dusted sheet tray. Set aside. To make the braising liquid: Combine the chicken broth, hoisin sauce, soy sauce and sambal in a large measuring cup and whisk together. Set aside. To make the cabbage: Remove 6 to 8 leaves from the outside of the cabbage and set aside for later, then cut remaining cabbage into 6 or 8 wedges. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heat 1/2 inch of neutral oil in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium heat until it is shimmery. Pan-fry the meatballs in 2 batches, 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until golden and the meatballs easily release from the bottom of the pan. Return the par-cooked meatballs to their tray. Carefully remove the excess oil, leaving just a light coating on the bottom of the pan. Arrange the cabbage wedges on the bottom. Nestle in the meatballs, then cover with the reserved whole cabbage leaves. Pour in the braising liquid. Increase the heat to medium high. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover the pan and transfer to the oven to braise for 1 hour until the meatballs are cooked and the cabbage is tender. Garnish with chopped scallions. For the yeasted scallion pancakes: Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt. Add the water, sesame oil and 2 tablespoons of the neutral oil. Mix on low speed until a shaggy dough comes together, scraping down the sides as necessary. Increase the speed to medium and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until the dough is soft and smooth and it pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove the dough from the bowl, divide in half and transfer each portion of dough to an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic or a clean towel and allow to double in size, about 1 hour. Turn out the doughs, one at a time, onto a lightly floured surface. Roll each into a 14-inch circle that is about 1/4 inch thick. Brush the surface of each with a thin layer of sesame oil and then scatter the scallions equally over each. Roll each into a tight jelly roll. Gently stretch each log and then coil into a spiral snail shape. Press to flatten slightly and set on a dusted baking sheet. Cover with plastic or a clean towel and allow to proof for 20 to 30 minutes or until puffy. Arrange an oven rack in the middle position. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat an ovensafe, 8-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of neutral oil, swirl it around and heat until shimmery. Take one of the pancakes and flatten with your hands to the size of the pan. Brush the top with water and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of the sesame seeds. Place the pancake in the oil, sesame-side facing up, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes (you can swirl it around but try not to disturb it too much), until the underside is deep golden. Flip with a spatula, transfer to the oven and bake for 10 minutes or until both sides are deep golden and it sounds hollow when you tap on it. Invert onto a rack and cool for a few minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough, neutral oil and sesame seeds. Cut each pancake into quarters and sprinkle with flaky salt. To make the sandwiches: Slice the meatballs (reserve the braised cabbage for another meal). Halve each scallion pancake quarter and schmear a thin layer of hoisin on the bottom of each. Layer on a slice of meatball, a couple slices of cucumber, sliced scallion, a handful of cilantro leaves and a squirt of mayonnaise and sriracha.

Line a 12-cup standard muffin tin with paper cupcake liners. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Stir the milk and vanilla together in a small bowl. Set aside. Beat the butter in a large bowl using an electric mixer on low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of the sugar. Increase the speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add about one-third of the flour mixture and beat until just combined. Add half the milk mixture and beat until smooth. Repeat, adding flour, then milk, and then the remaining flour, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat briefly to make a smooth batter; set aside. Put the egg whites in a clean bowl. Whip with an electric mixer on high speed until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue to beat until the egg whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks, about 10 minutes. Fold one-third of the whites into the batter to lighten it and then fold in the remaining whites. Divide the cake batter evenly between the cups of the prepared muffin tin. Bake, rotating the tin halfway through, until a tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes on a rack in the tin for 10 minutes, then remove from the tin and cool completely on the rack. Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan. Whisk together the egg whites, sugar, lemon juice, cream of tartar and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Set the bowl over the saucepan, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Continue whisking until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the water and whip with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until the meringue is cool and holds a soft peak, about 5 minutes. Add a few drops of desired food coloring to tint the frosting and continue beating until it holds stiff peaks. Spoon or pipe the frosting decoratively and generously on the cupcakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26779,&quot;Foil-Packet Steak and Asparagus 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram 2 cloves garlic, finely grated Kosher salt 1 1/2 pounds skirt steak, cut into eight 4-inch-long pieces 1 1/2 teaspoons cracked pepper Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high. Lay out four 12-by-18-inch sheets of heavy-duty foil on a work surface. Combine the asparagus, olive oil, marjoram, garlic and a pinch of salt in a large bowl and toss. Sprinkle the steak with a big pinch of salt and the pepper. Put 2 pieces of steak side by side in the center of each sheet of foil and top with the asparagus. Bring the 2 short ends of the foil together and fold twice; fold in the sides to seal. Put the foil packets steak-side down on the grill and cook, flipping halfway through, until the steak is cooked to medium and the asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 26780,&quot;Deep Chocolate Pudding 1 cup granulated sugar 4 tablespoon cornstarch 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1/8 teaspoon salt 2 1/2 cups whole milk or substitute 2 percent milk 4 large egg yolks 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 4 ounces good-quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped Lightly sweetened whipped cream, to serve, if desired Instructions: Place sugar in a large bowl. Sift over it the cornstarch, cocoa and salt. Add 1/2 cup of the milk and stir the mixture to make a thick paste. Lightly beat the egg yolks, then add these to the cornstarch mixture, whisking to blend well. Wrap a damp towel around the base of the bowl to prevent it from sliding around when the scalded milk is added. Meanwhile, in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan, combine the remaining 2 cups milk and the cream. Bring these just to the boil, then remove the pot from the heat. Pour a small amount of the hot liquid into the cornstarch-cocoa mixture, whisking constantly. Continue to whisk the milk-cream mixture into the bowl gradually, until all of the liquid has been incorporated, and the mixture is smooth. Rinse out the pot used to scald the milk and the cream, but don&#39;t dry it: this will help prevent the pudding from scorching on the bottom. Pour the custard into the clean pot and add the vanilla. Have ready a clean mesh sieve over a medium sized bowl. Return the pot to the stove and stir with a wooden spoon over low to medium-low heat until the custard thickens, about 5 to 7 minutes. It should approach but never quite reach, a boil and be about the consistency of mayonnaise when it&#39;s done. This custard behaves strangely, you may fear something has gone terribly wrong, but press on! It will get increasingly lumpy to the point where, just as it reaches the right thickness, it will seem downright chunky: never mind! Quickly remove the pot from the element and pour through the sieve into the clean bowl, pressing the custard through with a rubber spatula. Add the finely chopped or grated chocolate in 2 additions, stirring gently with a clean wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the chocolate is melted smoothly into the pudding. Spoon the pudding into 6 to 8 serving dishes or goblets and chill at least 6 hours or overnight. If you like the pudding with no skin on the top, press plastic wrap onto the surface of the warm pudding in the serving dishes. If a skin on your chocolate pudding makes you happily nostalgic, wait until the puddings are cold before covering. The pudding can be made up to 2 days ahead of time. Serve just as it is, or with a dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream for a truly decadent dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon]&quot; 26781,&quot;Noble Sausage 15 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 fennel bulb, finely chopped 1 bunch fresh basil 2 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon cumin 1 tablespoon coriander 1 tablespoon anise powder 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon salt 5 pounds ground pork Instructions: Combine the garlic, fennel and basil in a food processor and puree. Add the red pepper flakes, cumin, coriander, anise, black pepper and salt and keep mixing until well combined and no chunks remain; you can add a little water to help the mixing process if needed. This is your seasoning and fennel mixture. Put the ground pork in a wide pan with the seasoning and fennel mixture and mix well by hand. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring throughout and mixing with a spoon or potato masher, until fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Grease and flour a 13-by-9-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, salt and baking powder. Add the buttermilk, oil and vanilla. Stir until just combined. Add the coffee and mix well. Pour into the pan and bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool the cake completely. Crumble the cake into medium chunks, cover, and then set aside. For the pudding: In a large saucepan set over medium heat, combine the cocoa, sugar, cornstarch and salt, and mix well. Whisk in the milk. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon while the mixture comes to a low boil and thickens, 7 to 9 minutes. Reduce the heat to very low. Stir a couple tablespoons of the hot mixture into the egg yolks, then stir the egg yolks back into the hot mixture to temper. Stir constantly until the mixture thickens to the consistency of pudding, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming, and then cool. For the whipped cream: Using an electric mixer set on high speed, beat the cream, sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks form. Place half of the cake crumbles in the bottom of a trifle dish. Top with half of the pudding, then half of the cherries, and half of the whipped cream. Repeat the layering with the remaining cake, pudding, cherries and whipped cream. Save a few cherries or cake crumbs to garnish the top layer. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 1 day. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 26783,&quot;Peach Upside-Down Cake 2 sticks butter 1/2 cup sugar<br> 2 ripe peaches, pitted, sliced into eighths<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 cups buttermilk<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br> 3 eggs<br> Zest of 1/2 lemon<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place 1 tablespoon of the butter in 8 ramekins, and rub all around the inside. Divide 1/4 cup of the sugar between the ramekins and turn so the insides are coated with sugar. Divide the peaches between the ramekins. In a large bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir to incorporate. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, vanilla, eggs and lemon zest. Melt the remaining stick butter in a small saucepan and cook until brown; pour into the wet ingredients and mix together with a whisk. Add the wet mixture to the dry, and stir with a spatula until combined. Pour the batter over the peaches, filling to just below the top of the ramekins.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place the peanuts and confectioners&#39; sugar in a food processor and process until it reaches a flour consistency, about 5 minutes. Place the egg whites and granulated sugar in a stand mixer and whip until firm peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, slowly fold in the peanut/sugar mixture, one-third at a time, until fully incorporated, being careful not to let the mixture \\drop.\\ Pipe the batter using a piping bag or pastry bag onto the prepared baking sheets (six 3-inch rounds on each tray) about 1 inch apart. Bake until golden brown and nicely risen, 15 to 17 minutes. Let rest 20 minutes, and then remove the macaroons from the baking sheets. For the compote: Render the bacon in a saute pan over low heat until crispy and browned. Add the chopped bananas and cook while mashing. Then add the brown sugar, rum and lime juice, and continue to cook the mashed mixture until no liquid remains. For the marshmallow cream: Place the gelatin into the bowl of a stand mixer along with 1/2 cup of the water. Have the whisk attachment standing by. In a small saucepan, combine the remaining 1/2 cup water, the granulated sugar, corn syrup and salt. Place over medium-high heat, cover and allow to cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Uncover, clip a candy thermometer onto the side of the pan and continue to cook until the mixture reaches 240 degrees F, 7 to 8 minutes. Once the mixture reaches this temperature, immediately remove from the heat. Turn the mixer on low speed and, while running, slowly pour the sugar syrup down the side of the bowl into the gelatin mixture. Once you have added all of the syrup, increase the speed to high. Continue to whip until the mixture becomes very thick and is lukewarm, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the vanilla during the last minute of whipping. To assemble: Place one macaroon baked-side down. Add a scoop of the compote, about 3 tablespoons. Cover the compote with 1 tablespoon marshmallow whip. Using a hand torch, roast the marshmallow until browned. Top with another macaroon, baked-side up. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

In another bowl, beat the eggs and add them, with the vanilla extract, lemon zest and cinnamon, to the lukewarm milk. Stir the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients to make a medium-soft dough, being prepared to add more flour as necessary. I generally use about 2 1/3 cups in all, but advise you to start off with the smaller amount: just add more as needed. Work in the soft butter and knead by hand for about 10 minutes or half that time by machine. When the dough is ready it will appear smooth and springy: it suddenly seems to plump up into glossy life. Cover with a kitchen towel and leave until doubled in size (1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes). Or leave to rise slowly in a cold place overnight. Then punch down and press to line a jellyroll pan measuring 13 by 9-inches. You may think it&#39;s never going to stretch to fit, but it will, although you may need to let it rest for 10 minutes or so mid-stretch, especially if the dough has had a cold rise. When it&#39;s pressed out on the pan, leave it to rest for 15 to 20 minutes and then brush with the egg and cream mixture. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel and chop the apple and toss it in a bowl with the blackberries and the zest from the other half lemon. Set the bowl aside for the few minutes it takes to make the crumble topping. Put the flour, ground almonds and cinnamon in a medium-sized bowl, stir to combine, then add the cold, diced butter. Using the tips of your fingers - index and middle stroking the fleshly pads of your clumpy (this is very buttery mixture) oatmeal. Fork in the sugars and sliced almonds. Tumble the fruit over the egg-washed dough and then sprinkle the crumble on top of that. Put in the oven for 15 minutes, then turn down to 350 degrees F and cook for a further 20 minutes or so, until the dough is swelling and golden at its billowing edges and the crumble is set; don&#39;t expect it to be crunchy. Remove from the oven and, if you can, wait 5 minutes or so before cutting it into greed-satisfying slabs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 26787,&quot;Brioche French Toast with Caramelized Peaches 16 oz. sliced fresh peaches or one 16-oz. package frozen sliced peaches 1/2-cup sugar 1 Tbs. almond extract 6 Tbs. unsalted butter, cut up, plus 2 Tbs. 3 eggs 1 cup milk 1 tsp. ground cinnamon 6 muffin-sized brioches, halved lengthwise 1/2-cup sliced almonds, toasted (optional) Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until just combined and lightly fluffy. Beat in the molasses and egg yolk. Gradually add the dry ingredients and mix together on low speed until dough is just combined and still crumbly, about 3 minutes. Give dough a few turns with a spatula to bring together. Lay out wax paper on a clean work surface and put about 1/3 of the batter on top. Lightly press down and top with another sheet of wax paper. Using your hands or a rolling pin, gently pat into a rectangle. Roll out with a rolling pin until dough is as thin as possible without breaking, no thicker than 1/16 inch thick. This is the key to these cookies: they really can&#39;t be too thin. Gently peel back the layer of waxed paper and then replace it loosely. Transfer rolled batter to a flat baking sheet and freeze until firm and can easily be peeled away from the waxed paper, about 30 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough.

Add the onion, bouquet garni, some salt, the peppercorns and celery, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, skimming as you go. Meanwhile, prepare the stuffing. Soak the bread crumbs in the milk to moisten, then squeeze dry. Mix them with the gammon, garlic and parsley. Chop the chicken liver and heart, and add to the mixture with the beaten egg. Season with pepper and nutmeg (you may not need salt, but taste to see). Beat very well until thoroughly mixed. Stuff the bird and truss it. Add the bird to the pot with the shank and continue to simmer uncovered for 1 hour. Add the carrots, leeks, and turnips. Taste for seasoning, then continue to simmer for another hour or until everything is tender. Be sure that there is always enough liquid to cover everything. If you are going to serve the broth as a first course, strain 2 1/2 pints of the liquid into a separate pan, boil to reduce by one-third, remove as much fat as possible and adjust the seasoning. Either simmer the noodles in it for 5 minutes or serve with the diagonally sliced French bread - toasted in a preheated 350 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes.

Score the skin of the pork through the fat, the incisions should be about 1 centimeter apart. Turn over. Make a pocket for the stuffing by cutting an incision at an angle, about 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) deep in the center of the streaky part of the loin, working away from the eye meat. Starting slightly in from the side of the meat, slowly slice along the loin not quite to the end, this will ensure your stuffing won&#39;t fall out. Chop half the thyme with 1 clove of garlic and scrunch together with the butter, 1 tin of peaches, and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Push the butter into the pocket and pat back into shape. Lay the pancetta, bacon or Parma ham over the pork, leaving the skin side uncovered, and tie up firmly with 3 to 4 pieces of string. Place skin-side up in a roasting tray with the remaining peaches, the garlic cloves, thyme, and half of the white wine. Roast for around 1 hour until the skin is crisp and golden. When ready, remove the pork and peaches to a plate and leave to rest for 15 minutes whilst you finish the sauce. To do this, remove most of the fat from the roasting tray, then place the tray over a high heat. Squash the cooked garlic and add 1 tablespoon of flour. Stir and add the rest of the wine with a glass of water or stock. Simmer and leave to reduce for a few minutes. Strain and add any extra juices from the rested pork. Check the seasoning and consistency and serve drizzled over the sliced pork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 26800,&quot;Crimini Ragu with Spinach Crostini and Chicken Ragu with Whole Wheat Pasta 1 pound whole-wheat or whole-grain rigatoni or other short cut pasta 1 loaf crusty bread, bakery sliced (baguette or ciabatta) 1 pound crimini mushrooms, wiped clean 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 5 to 6 cloves garlic, peeled 1/4 pound pancetta, a couple thick slices, finely diced 1 1/2 pound chicken thighs, chopped into small bite-sized pieces 1 medium to large onion, chopped 1 carrot, peeled 2 to 3 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves stripped and finely chopped 1 bay leaf Salt and pepper 1/2 cup Marsala, a couple glugs 1 (28-ounce) can tomatoes (recommended: San Marzano) Couple handfuls fresh baby spinach Few grates nutmeg or a pinch of ground 1/4 cup aged balsamic vinegar Splash heavy cream Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Handful basil leaves, torn Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook to al dente, drain and keep warm.

Howzat!; The good thing about burgers is you can make them thin and big, fat and big, or even turn them into meatballs. In the early days of Cricketers, the pub where I grew up, I remember my dad used to serve a whopping great burger the size of a cricket-ball topped with a huge amount of Cheddar cheese and homemade tomato relish. He very classily called it the Botham burger.; That&#39;s what I love about Essex boys&#39; sheer taste. Feel free to add extra spices if that&#39;s what takes your fancy, but here&#39;s a really solid basic beefburger recipe. I never thought when I became a chef that I would come back round to respecting the famous beefburger. Unfortunately it hasn&#39;t been on the pub&#39;s menu for about 10 years, what a shame. This might change Dad&#39;s mind.; &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Malbec]</li></ol><p>&quot; 26846,&quot;Mexican Sliced Steak and Barley Soup 1/4 cup fresh cilantro or parsley leaves, finely chopped 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 large cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 fresh cl, such as Fresno or jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped<br> 1 lime, juiced 1 teaspoon dried marjoram or oregano 1/4 red onion, minced or grated 1 pound skirt steak Kosher salt and coarse black pepper Kosher salt and coarse black pepper<br> Salt 1 cup pearled barley 2 tablespoons EVOO, plus extra for drizzling 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 ribs celery, finely chopped 2 cl peppers, such as Fresno or jalepeno, seeded and chopped<br> 1 red onion, chopped 1 small bell pepper, finely chopped Freshly ground black pepper 4 cups beef stock One 32-ounce can stewed tomatoes A handful of fresh cilantro or parsley leaves, chopped Lime wedges, Worcestershire and hot sauce, to pass at table Instructions: For the marinade and steak: Combine the cilantro, Worcestershire, garlic, chiles, lime juice, marjoram and onions in a bag.

Wipe the ice and salt from the lid and the top of the can. Remove the lid. Pull up the dasher and scrape it off with a rubber spatula. Most people dig in right at this point and enjoy the ice cream even though it is still a little soft. Others like to remove the can and put it in a freezer (or put the ice cream into smaller containers) and harden the ice cream for a few hours before eating. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 26882,&quot;Citrus Warmer 2 cups grapefruit juice 1 cup orange juice 1/4 cup honey 1 lemon, sliced Dash of bitters Instructions: Combine ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a simmer.

Let the beans soak in the refrigerator overnight. Drain. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, make the adobo: In small bowl, whisk together cumin, coriander, salt, cayenne, and adobo seasoning. Add the garlic and bay leaves to the onion and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the beans, water, ham hocks, and half of the adobo. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender, about 2 hours. Remove the ham hocks and pull and shred the meat. Add the meat back to the stew and discard the bones. (The stew can be made up to this point up to 3 days ahead.) Make the meat: In a large bowl, toss the sausages with the remaining adobo. Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Working in batches, brown the sausages and transfer them to a plate. Roughly chop the sausages and stir them into the stew. Return the skillet to high heat and, working in batches, brown the beef and pork and add them to the stew. Return the stew to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes more. When ready to serve, arrange a mound of rice in the center of 8 plates and spoon some of the stew over the top of each. Spoon some of the pico de gallo and greens on opposite sides of the stew. Sprinkle with the farofa and chopped scallion and garnish with orange wedges. In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the greens and wine and cook, stirring, until wilted. Lower the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring, until its fat has rendered. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add manioc flour and cook, stirring, until golden brown and toasted. Add the butter and cook, stirring, until absorbed. Add the eggs and scallion and cook, stirring, until scrambled. Season with salt, to taste. Transfer to the farofa to a bowl and let cool slightly. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 26885,&quot;3-Ingredient Banana Petit Fours 2 bananas 1/2 cup peanut butter or chocolate-hazelnut spread, such as Nutella 1 cup trail mix or freeze-dried raspberries, crushed Instructions: Cut the bananas into 1 1/2-inch pieces.
