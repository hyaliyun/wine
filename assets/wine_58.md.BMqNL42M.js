That gives it an astringency that stings the palate, but still, the core of blackberries, cherries and sweet currants shines through.

Try after 2015, when it will be nine years old.","designation":"","title":"Atlas Peak 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)"},{"country":"US","description":"You'll want to age this Pinot because as currently constructed it's marked by youthful tannins and acids, as well as primary fruit flavors that have not meshed with the new oak. It's all over the place, with lavish raspberries, cherries, vanilla, sandalwood, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices all vying for first place. Give it until 2011 to begin to come together.","designation":"Bella Una","title":"Benovia 2007 Bella Una Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Here's one for the cellar. It's an intense, massively concentrated wine, packed with blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and crme de cassis flavors. If that sounds delicious, it is, and the tannins are as fine and complicated as Napa gets. So tasty now, you can drink it with a great steak, and should easily develop bottle complexity over the next 8C10 years, perhaps much longer.","designation":"Reserve","title":"ZD 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"fr","description":"A tight and steely wine, very much in its infancy.

Keep for 4C5 years and more.","designation":"Les Clos","title":"Simonnet-Febvre 2009 Les Clos  (Chablis)"},{"country":"it","description":"A beautiful wine from Palladino, a lovely very complex Barolo just beginning to hit maturity. It is made in an understated style, showing its quality in its lovely haunting complexity. It has all the telltale flavors, roses, anise, earth dark fruit, tobacco and woodsmoke.

This dramatic Cab will develop for the remainder of the decade.","designation":"Archimedes","title":"Francis Ford Coppola 2007 Archimedes Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)"},{"country":"US","description":"A terrific Cabernet, dry and rich and dramatically layered. Tremendous in blackberry and currant flavors, its firm tannnis come from both the grapes themselves and the oak barrels in which the wine was aged.

Based on Merlot, with nearly equal parts of the two Cabernets, it's softly smooth and delicious right now.

It's a big wine, with potent raspberry, cherry and blackberry fruit. Yet there's a delicacy to it, even considering the tannins, that's almost like a Pinot Noir, strange as that sounds.

Yes. But this is the kind of wine that tastes expensive and will impress just about everyone.

Dark, meaty aromas incorporate casses and cedar, while the palate is even blacker, with charred meat, black fruits and forest floor, with blueberry and cedar following. A bruiser, with a big feel and big tannins to match, the finish is a bit shut down, so buy a case and try a bottle over the next dozen years.","designation":"Vineyard in the Sky","title":"Delaire 2003 Vineyard in the Sky Red (Stellenbosch)"},{"country":"US","description":"Fruit is the hallmark of this blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon but with one-third Merlot.

It's a light and refreshing wine with crisp flavors of red berries and pressed violets.","designation":"Merlot and Pinot Noir 3 liter BIB","title":"Duca del Frassino 2009 Merlot and Pinot Noir 3 liter BIB Red (Venezie)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Stalky aromas suggest hay and green herbs, with raspberry in the backdrop. It's hot and short in terms of mouthfeel, with herbal flavors leading the way and berry fruit running behind. Dry red fruit and herbal notes dominate the finish.","designation":"Finca La Ni?a","title":"Don Cristobal 1492 2010 Finca La Ni?a Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Light and mostly neutral smelling, with a hint of pear and apple. The palate is zesty, lean and well cut, however the flavors are more pithy and bitter, with orange and nectarine notes. Finishes hot and peppery.","designation":"Portillo Estate Bottled","title":"Salentein 2010 Portillo Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Uco Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Thin in fruit but lopsided in oak, with vanilla, toast and caramel flavors swamping the pineapples and limes.","designation":"","title":"Three Saints 2009 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Light in the mouth and silky, like a Pinot Noir, with cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. A little one-dimensional, but okay now with a nice cheeseburger.","designation":"","title":"Sunc Vineyard &amp; Winery 2009 Mourvdre (Napa Valley)"},{"country":"za","description":"Reminiscent of strawberry and cherry hard candies, this is a Shiraz for those who like confectioned and somewhat artificial fruit flavors. Although the style may not be for everyone, it's balanced and easy pleasing.","designation":"Sweet","title":"Jam Jar 2010 Sweet Shiraz (Western Cape)"},{"country":"au","description":"Slightly confectionary, with cinnamon and vanilla notes alongside cherries and caramel. Finishes with a touch of warmth.","designation":"Reserve","title":"Jacob's Creek 2009 Reserve Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)"},{"country":"US","description":"Soft and sweet, with jammy berry and currant flavors, and the glyceriney sugar of high alcohol. Will appeal to fans of this style, but it's really too sweet for a dry table wine.","designation":"","title":"J. Keverson 2008 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a soft, simple Chardonnay, sugary sweet in vanilla, caramel, peach and pineapple jam and spice flavors. A good coat of acidity provides needed balance.","designation":"Elegance","title":"Manzanita Creek 2010 Elegance Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Sourced entirely from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an uneasy mix of dry and sweet, as if both styles were trying to come out in a single wine. The residual sugar is grainy and sweet, not quite integrated into the tart fruit flavors of nectarine and apricot.","designation":"","title":"Three Rivers 2009 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))"},{"country":"za","description":"An assertive menthol streak shines through the dark fruit core, along with a hint of spice cake. Soft and somewhat flabby on the midpalate; drink now.","designation":"Collection","title":"Riebeek Cellars 2009 Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Swartland)"},{"country":"US","description":"Acids and tannins dominate, at the expense of fruit, giving this Pinot Noir a hard, rustic feel. The cherry flavors aren't strong enough to bust through the dryness.","designation":"Winemaker's Reserve Zora's Estate Vineyard","title":"Sunc Vineyard &amp; Winery 2009 Winemaker's Reserve Zora's Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)"},{"country":"US","description":"Off-dry, with pineapple, lime, lemon, grapefruit and vanilla flavors, fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. A decent, clean and affordable white wine for cocktails.","designation":"Private Selection","title":"Robert Mondavi 2010 Private Selection Sauvignon Blanc (California)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Resiny oak is front and center on the nose, turning any and all fruit spicy. The palate is wet and basic, with a woody feel and oaky flavors that include spices and white fruits. Offers proper weight but smells and tastes overtly resiny.","designation":"Q","title":"Zuccardi 2010 Q Chardonnay (Mendoza)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Scratchy, generic red berry aromas are the opening. The palate runs narrow and tight, with clacky red berry flavors followed by a sugary sweetness. Candied and sweet on the finish before mild bitterness sets in.","designation":"","title":"Noble Aconcagua 2009 Malbec (Mendoza)"},{"country":"ar","description":"Hard cherry and spice aromas are varietally correct, while the palate is standard in feel, with toasty, creamy flavors of sweet berry. Has enough acidity and vibrancy to rank as juicy on the finish.","designation":"Reserva","title":"Nieto Senetiner 2010 Reserva Pinot Noir (Mendoza)"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine's dark cherry aromas veer into lipstick territory a bit and then the North Coast-sourced Merlot becomes overly tannic and a tiny bit green.
