Cut in half crosswise. Spread frosting on one half, then top with the second half. Cover the layer cake with frosting. Dust a flat surface with cornstarch. Using a rolling pin, roll out the white fondant to at least 16 by 18 inches large (about 1/8 inch thick). Drape the white fondant over the cake, covering the cake but leaving one short end exposed with a slight overhang, as shown. Smooth the fondant, then cut away any excess, except for the overhang. Roll out the red fondant on a cornstarch-dusted surface to /16 inch thick. Cut into about 15 strips that are 14 by 1/2 inch each. One at a time, spread some water on the back of each red fondant strip with your finger and attach to the cake, as shown, trimming the strips as needed. (Do not use too much water, or the red dye will bleed.) Press some of the caramel corn onto the uncovered side of the cake. Continue adding caramel corn until it looks like the bag is overflowing, using more frosting to stick the pieces together. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 34989,&quot;Cornmeal Apple Coffee Cake 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 2/3 cup stoneground cornmeal 1/3 cup brown sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda Pinch of salt 1/2 cup plain yogurt 1/4 cup whole milk 2 large eggs plus 1 egg white 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 large apples, peeled, cored and diced 1 teaspoon cinnamon Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Gently press a tortilla into the center of 7-inch spider to form a bowl. Using a 5-inch spider, gently press down into the tortilla to hold its shape. Carefully submerge the spiders into the hot oil and fry the tortilla until puffed, crispy and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and gently place upside down on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet to drain of excess oil. Season with salt. Repeat with the remaining 3 tortillas. To make the spicy salsa verde ranch: Mix together the ranch dressing and salsa verde in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. To assemble the salad: In a large mixing bowl, add the shredded lettuce, cilantro and about 1/3 cup of the salad dressing, adding more if desired. Divide the salad among the 4 tortilla bowls. Top each with 1/2 cup Al Pastor, radishes, Pickled Red Onions and 2 tablespoons queso fresco. Drizzle some dressing on top. Serve immediately. Heat the oil in a 12-inch cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Add the tomatillos, onion, poblano, garlic and jalape?o. Cook, flipping the veggies as needed to evenly char and soften, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Carefully remove the stem from the poblano cl, so as to not let the juices spill out (we want that yummy pepper juice!) and add to the carafe of a high-speed blender. Squeeze the garlic from the skins into the blender. Add the remaining roasted veggies and any juices from the bottom of the pan. Add the cilantro, lime juice, green onion and salt. Blend on high speed until pureed and smooth. In a large bowl, add the achiote paste, red wine vinegar, brown sugar, smoked paprika, cumin, salt, cloves, black pepper and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to fully combine into a paste. Add the pork and rub the paste all over to completely coat. Set aside. In the bowl of a pressure cooker, mix together the crushed pineapple, chicken broth, garlic, bay leaves, cl, onion, oregano and sage. Add the achiote-rubbed pork. Pressure cook on low for 4 hours or high for 1 hour until the pork is fork-tender. Carefully release the steam away from your face. Remove the pork to a plate or baking sheet and shred using 2 forks. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Add the pork and spoon some of the braising liquid over to moisten, as needed. Season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until crispy, 4 to 6 minutes. Set aside. Place the onions in a food storage container and set aside while you prepare the pickling liquid. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, add the vinegar, granulated sugar, salt, cumin seeds, bay leaf and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and cook until the sugar and salt are dissolved, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool completely. Pour the cooled pickling liquid over the onions and allow to pickle for at least 30 minutes. At this point, you can either strain the onions to prevent from further pickling and use immediately, or put the lid on top and store in the refrigerator to further pickle until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 34994,&quot;Steak Sandwiches With Blue Cheese and Peppadew Mayo 1 cup Peppadew peppers, drained 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese 2 tablespoons sour cream Freshly ground pepper Vegetable oil, for brushing 1 1/2 pounds skirt steak, cut into 4 pieces Kosher salt 4 ciabatta or other rustic rolls, split open Instructions: Put the Peppadew peppers and mayonnaise in a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped.

Refrigerate at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight. Heat 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 275 degrees F. Working in 2 batches, fry the wings, tossing occasionally, until pale brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes per batch. To test for doneness, lift a wing from the oil and pierce with a paring knife. If there is no resistance they are done. Transfer the wings with a slotted spoon to a clean rack set over a baking sheet and let cool for at least 30 minutes. (Make sure the oil returns to the proper temperature between batches.) Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the garlic, onion and cl and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly golden, about 12 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring until lightly caramelized, about 2 minutes. Stir in the peanut butter and bay leaf, then pour in the broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer then cook, stirring often, until it is thickened and slightly reduced, about 8 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat, discard the bay leaf and stir in the fish sauce. Finely grate the zest of 1 lime into the sauce, then add its juice. Season the sauce with salt and pepper, then pour it into a blender and puree until very smooth. Transfer the sauce to a small saucepan and keep warm. Increase the temperature of the frying oil to 425 degrees F. Working in 3 batches, fry the wings again until the skin is golden brown and very crisp, about 3 minutes per batch. Transfer the wings to a large bowl and season each batch with salt while hot. (Make sure the oil returns to the proper temperature between batches.) Pour two-thirds of the reserved peanut sauce over the wings and toss to coat evenly. Transfer the wings to a platter and sprinkle with the peanuts. Finely grate the zest of another lime over the wings then cut the remaining limes into wedges.

Lay the pork in the middle of a banana leaf and wrap the leaf around it. Rotate the pork a quarter turn and wrap with another leaf. Repeat with the remaining leaves. Wrap with heavy-duty foil twice to make sure it is completely encased. Line the bottom of an 8- to 10-quart cast-iron Dutch oven with a cast-iron lid with a damp paper towel. Put the pork on the paper towel and cover with the lid. Set aside. Fill a charcoal chimney completely full with charcoal and light it. Once it is lit and starting to ash over, carefully move the chimney to a heatproof surface. Remove the top grilling rack of a kettle-style charcoal grill (you will not need it for grilling). Put the Dutch oven in the middle of the bottom grate of the grill. Put unlit charcoal pieces all around the Dutch oven and then empty the chimney on top of it. Using metal tongs, spread out the hot coals so they are on top of the Dutch oven as well as all around the sides (depending on the size of your grill you may need to add another chimney full of charcoal). Keep the grill uncovered and fully vented for 10 to 15 minutes to get the unlit coals started. Then put the lid on and close the bottom and top vents about 90% of the way. Cook the pork, checking every so often to make sure the grill is still hot and the temperature is hovering around 250 degrees F (add more lit charcoal as needed to maintain temperature), until completely tender, about 10 hours.<br> For the coleslaw: Meanwhile, combine the coleslaw mix with the rice vinegar, chiles, mango, scallions, pineapple and 1 teaspoon salt.

Line one with parchment paper and set another piece of parchment paper aside. Unroll the puff pastry onto the parchment-lined baking sheet and poke the entire surface with a fork. Sprinkle with the granulated sugar. Place the second piece of parchment over the pastry and fit the second baking sheet on top to sandwich the pastry between both sheets. Bake the pastry for 25 minutes. Then remove the top baking sheet and parchment and continue baking for another 5 to 8 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Cool completely. Meanwhile, using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or a hand mixer, whip the cream cheese and peanut butter together on medium speed until smooth. Slowly pour in 1/4 cup cream then add in 3/4 cup icing sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Whip on high until stiff and fluffy. If desired, transfer the peanut butter cream to a pastry bag fitted with a medium round piping tip or a large zip top bag with the corner cut off. Add the remaining 1/2 cup cream to the bowl along with the remaining tablespoon of icing sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Whip to stiff peaks and set aside. Using a serrated knife, slice the puff pastry sheet along the long side into three equal pieces, each about 10-by-23 centimeters (4-by-9-inches), trimming the edges if needed. Spoon a small dollop of whipped cream or peanut butter cream onto the center of your serving dish and place one of the puff pastry pieces on top.

Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the vinegar and sugar; simmer, until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat. Place a skillet over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Saut the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes, until soft. Stir in the tomato paste, a splash of wine, parsley, and 1/2 cup of the prepared sweet and sour tomato sauce, mix to incorporate and then take it off the heat. Combine the ground meat in a large mixing bowl. Add the egg, the cooked rice, and the sauteed onion mixture. Toss the filling together with your hands to combine, season with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Remove the large, damaged outer leaves from the cabbages and set aside. Cut out the cores of the cabbages with a sharp knife and carefully pull off all the rest of the leaves, keeping them whole and as undamaged as possible, (get rid of all the small leaves and use them for coleslaw or whatever.) Blanch the cabbage leaves in the pot of boiling water for 5 minutes, or until pliable. Run the leaves under cool water then lay them out so you can assess just how many blankets you have to wrap up the filling. Next, carefully cut out the center vein from the leaves so they will be easier to roll up. Take the reserved big outer leaves and lay them on the bottom of a casserole pan, let part of the leaves hang out the sides of the pan. This insulation will prevent the cabbage rolls from burning on the bottom when baked. Use all the good looking leaves to make the cabbage rolls. Put about 1/2 cup of the meat filling in the center of the cabbage and starting at what was the stem-end, fold the sides in and roll up the cabbage to enclose the filling. Place the cabbage rolls side by side in rows, seam-side down, in a casserole pan. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the remaining sweet and sour tomato sauce over the cabbage rolls.

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Toss the butternut squash with the sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl. Spread out the squash on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with more foil and secure the edges. Roast until fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil from the top and continue to roast until slightly golden, about 10 more minutes. Let cool and then puree in a food processor and set aside. For the pecan jaconde: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites until frothy. Slowly add the granulated sugar and salt and whip until stiff peaks form. Add the egg yolks slowly and continue whipping until combined, about 2 minutes. Sift in the flour in 3 stages, folding carefully to prevent deflating and making sure there are no lumps. Fold in the melted butter. Spread on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with the pecans. Bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool and cut into two 8-inch circles. Tip: leftovers can be use in a trifle For the pecan rum cake syrup: Bring the granulated sugar, pecans and 1 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Boil for three minute or so to release the pecan oils. Remove from the heat and add the rum. Use warm to moisten the sponge while assembling the cake For the butternut squash pudding: In a pot, bring the sugar, cream, condensed milk, cinnamon sticks, pumpkin pie spice and 1 cup of the milk to a boil.. In a medium bowl, mix the cornstarch with the egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup milk. Remove the cinnamon sticks carefully from the milk mixture and temper the cornstarch mixture with it, whisking the hot mixture by the ladleful into the cornstarch mixture. Return the tempered mixture to the pot and add 2 cups of the squash puree (reserve the remaining puree for another use). Cook on medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the pudding thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the vanilla and butter and mix until incorporated. For the marshmallow meringue: In a small pot, bring the granulated sugar and 6 tablespoons water to a boil. Cook to 240 degrees F or the soft ball stage. Once the syrup has reached 210 degrees F, start whipping the egg whites. As soon as the syrup reaches 240 degrees F, add the syrup to the egg whites while whipping. Add the melted marshmallow and pumpkin pie spice and whip until cooled, 5 to 10 minutes. To assemble the cake: Use an 8-inch ring mold. Place a layer of pecan joconde sponge on the bottom and drench with half the syrup. Cover with a layer of the warm pudding as thick as the cake. Repeat with another layer of cake and pudding. Allow to cool in the refrigerator until the pudding sets, about 20 minutes. Once cooled, remove from the ring and decorate with the marshmallow meringue all around the cake. Torch the outside of the cake gently to create a brulee look.

Boil 2 to 3 minutes. Add the brown sugar, garlic, thyme, onion, 1/4 cup salt and several grinds of pepper and return to a boil; cook for 10 minutes. Add the ice cubes to the marinade and refrigerate it until cold, about 1 hour. Add the chicken to the brine and marinate at least 12 hours. Heat enough oil to coat the bottom of a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for about 2 minutes. Working in batches, remove the chicken from the brine, pat it dry, and add it, skin-side down, to the pan; reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low; flip the chicken and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 165 degrees F. Simmer the sweet tea over medium heat until it is reduced by half. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Set aside.

In a large heavy-bottomed high-sided saute pan, fry the chorizo in the oil until it is grainy but still soft, about 4 minutes, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon to break up the meat and prevent a crust from forming on the bottom of the pan. Set aside and keep hot.<br> In a large stockpot over medium-high heat, stir the salsa with a wooden spoon until hot and sputtering. Add half the tortilla chips and stir to coat with the salsa, then cook until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the rest of the tortilla chips, stir to coat with the salsa, and cook until beginning to soften, about 3 to 5 additional minutes. There should be a nice mix of very soft and still slightly crunchy chips when the chiliqueles are finished. Remove from the heat and use a slotted spoon or tongs to heap generous portions into each of 4 bowls. While still piping hot, top with the grated Cheddar and Montery Jack cheeses, chorizo, a dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkling of red onion and cilantro. Serve hot with Guacamole on the side. In a medium stock pot, place the tomatoes, onion, jalapeno, and garlic and cover with 2 quarts water. Bring to a boil over high heat and let cook 5 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables are very soft. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a blender and puree until smooth with the cilantro and salt. If the salsa is too thick (it should have the consistency of a very thick soup), add a little of the cooking liquid. Check seasoning and add additional salt, if necessary, and pepper, to taste.<br> In a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat, bring the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry the chips in small batches until crisp and lightly golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. (They will continue to darken while resting.) With tongs or a metal frying ladle, transfer the chips to a large bowl lined with paper towels. Season with the salt and paprika while still warm. Repeat with the remaining chips. (See Cook&#39;s Note) &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 35051,&quot;Overnight Monkey Bread 4 large egg yolks, room temperature 1 large whole egg, room temperature 2 ounces sugar, approximately 1/4 cup 3 ounces unsalted butter, melted, approximately 6 tablespoons 6 ounces buttermilk, room temperature 20 ounces all-purpose flour, approximately 4 cups, plus additional for dusting 1 package instant dry yeast, approximately 2 1/4 teaspoons 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt Vegetable oil or cooking spray 8 ounces unsalted butter, approximately 16 tablespoons 8 ounces light brown sugar, approximately 1 cup packed 1/2 teaspoon ground rosemary 3 ounces raisins, approximately 3/4 cup 2 1/2 ounces unsalted butter, melted, approximately 5 tablespoons 1 teaspoon ground rosemary Instructions: For the dough: in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, butter and buttermilk. Add approximately 2 cups of the flour along with the yeast and salt; whisk until moistened and combined. Remove the whisk attachment and replace with a dough hook. Add all but 3/4 cup of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. Check the consistency of the dough and add more flour if necessary; the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. Knead on low speed 5 minutes more or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead by hand about 30 seconds. Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl, lightly oil the top of the dough, cover and let double in volume, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the 8 ounces of unsalted butter, brown sugar, rosemary, and raisins. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted and the sugar is dissolved. Pour half of the topping into the bottom of 2 bundt pans and set aside. Cover and store the other half of the topping in the refrigerator until the next morning. Place the melted butter and rosemary for the coating in a medium shallow bowl and stir to combine. Once the dough has risen, turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Portion the dough into 1-ounce pieces; roll each piece into a ball. (You should have approximately 36 balls.) Roll the balls in the melted butter and rosemary. Divide the balls evenly between the 2 bundt pans. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight or up to 16 hours. Remove the bread from the refrigerator and place in an oven that is turned off. Fill a shallow pan 2/3-full of boiling water and set on the rack below the bread. Close the oven and let the bread rise until slightly puffy looking, 20 to 30 minutes. Once the bread has risen, remove it and the shallow pan of water from the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Once the oven is ready, place the bread on the middle rack and bake until slightly golden on top, approximately 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Place the remaining topping in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Reheat until the mixture is pourable, approximately 5 minutes. Fifteen minutes into baking, pour the remaining topping over the bread, and finish cooking. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes, then invert onto a platter or cutting board. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35052,&quot;Yellow Cake with Swiss Buttercream 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing 3 cups cake flour 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 extra-large eggs 1 1/4 cups whole milk Swiss Buttercream, recipe follows 6 extra-large egg whites, at room temperature 1 1/4 cup granulated sugar (not powdered; it won&#39;t work) 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice or white vinegar 4 sticks (1 pound) butter, plus more as needed, softened Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the bottom of two 8-inch round cake pans and line with waxed paper or parchment paper. Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder, then set aside. In a large bowl using an electric mixer, cream the granulated sugar and butter together until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and eggs and beat until thoroughly mixed. Alternate adding the flour and the milk, a little at a time, beating well after each addition, then continue beating for 1 minute. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and cool completely on the wire rack. Frost the top of one cake layer with Swiss Buttercream and place the second cake layer on top. Then frost the top and sides of the cake. Serve at room temperature. Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Start the machine on medium-slow speed and whip until the eggs begin to get frothy. Turn the speed to medium. Slowly add the sugar to the whipping egg whites, dropping the lemon juice in about halfway through the process. When all the sugar is in, speed up the mixer and whip until stiff peaks form and the meringue is smooth and super shiny. Turn the speed to medium-low and begin adding the butter. Add it bit by bit so the meringue doesn&#39;t slop over the sides of the bowl. At this point, the meringue will fall and look ruined and broken. It&#39;s not. This is what happens and it&#39;s okay. If the meringue doesn&#39;t fall, add a little butter until it does. Turn the speed back up to medium-high and walk away. Come back in 10 minutes. Does it look like buttercream? No? Walk away and repeat until it does. If it still doesn&#39;t look like buttercream after 30 minutes, add more butter until it does.

In a bowl, mix the meat. Form 4 (3-ounce patties) by using a scoop. Push them down and make little indentations in the middle to hold the flavors. Place a teaspoon of garlic paste in the middle of each patty and add a little chunk of blue cheese tucked right on top of the garlic paste. Add a good twist of black pepper. Take another 3 ounce scoop of meat, make it flat in your hand and place right on top of the other half. Take your fingers and just seal the 2 patties up and refrigerate until you are ready to grill. Meanwhile: Split the pieces of bread, and pull out some of the soft center to make a hole for the burger. Place the bread face down on the grill to toast. Place the burger in the bread, and top with your favorite condiments. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat an ovenproof saucepan on the stovetop. When it&#39;s hot, add the extra-virgin olive oil. Next, add the cloves and season with salt and pepper. Let the cloves begin to caramelize, then put the pan in the preheated oven. Roast cloves in the oven for about 30 minutes or until they are nicely browned. (Starting the garlic on the stove will save at least 20 minutes of roasting time). Let cool. When cool enough to handle easily, put the roasted garlic into a small bowl, mash with a fork and add oil from the pan until a paste forms.

Line a sheet pan with wood chips, then top with a rack. Sprinkle all sides of the steaks liberally with salt and pepper. Place on the prepared rack, then tent with foil. Bake until the desired internal temperature, 115 degrees F for medium-rare, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the steaks dry, if needed. Rub the steaks with the oil on both sides, then sear the steaks on the first side for about 2 minutes. Flip the steaks and add the butter, thyme and garlic cloves to the skillet. Once the butter has melted, continue to cook the steaks, continuously basting with the melted butter, until seared on the second side, about 45 seconds. Sear the fat cap as well to crisp up, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove the steaks from the skillet and loosely cover with foil. Set aside. For the white gravy: Without wiping out the skillet, add the onions and garlic and cook in the drippings over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and add the flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to lightly brown, about 5 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the broth, milk, Worcestershire, molasses, lemon zest, cayenne and thyme. Gradually add to the skillet, stirring constantly, until well incorporated. Bring the mixture to a boil and let cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and season to taste with salt. Serve with the Grits Souffle and Potlikker Greens. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Butter eight 6-ounce ramekins. Bring the milk, grits, salt and 3 cups water to a boil, stirring occasionally, in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue boiling, stirring often, for 20 minutes. Add the butter and stir until melted. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the grits are soft, about 15 minutes more. Remove from the heat and cool for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Vigorously stir in the cheese and egg yolks. Cool to lukewarm, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. (The mixture needs to stay loose and not clump.) Gradually stir in another 1/2 cup water, as needed, to loosen up the grits. Whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Stir a third of the beaten whites into the grits mixture to loosen it. Fold in half of the remaining whites until incorporated, then fold in the remaining whites until only a few white streaks are left. Pour the mixture into the prepared ramekins and smooth the tops. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 35 minutes. Immediately top with more Cheddar and the chives. Serve hot or warm. In a large pot, combine the turkey, red pepper flakes, garlic, onion and 2 quarts water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the collards: Set aside 4 whole collard leaves. Working in batches on the remaining collards, hold the stems with one hand and the leaves with the other, folding up the leaves together like the wings on a butterfly. Pull the leaves down, leaving the stems clean. (If the leaves are really large, cut them down the center.) Working in batches, stack the leaves, then roll them like a cigar. Slice the rolls thinly. Add the sliced greens to the pot and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pull the meat from the turkey leg, then discard the bone and return the meat to the pot along with the vinegar. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil and generously salt. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Add the reserved whole collard green leaves to the boiling water and boil until vibrant green, about 20 seconds. Remove with tongs, and immediately transfer to the ice water. Preheat the broiler and line a baking sheet with foil. Pat the whole leaves dry and lay on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly brush with the oil. Broil the leaves until lightly charred in spots, about 90 seconds. Stuff each leaf with collard greens and serve additional potlikker on the side in a ramekin. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 35073,&quot;Fluffy Shredded Pancake (Kaiserschmarrn) with Plum Sauce 4 large eggs, separated 6 tablespoons (74 grams) sugar, divided<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 cup (120 grams) all-purpose flour<br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> 3/4 cup (184 grams) whole milk<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon almond extract<br> 6 tablespoons (85 grams) melted and cooled unsalted butter<br> Plum Sauce, recipe follows Confectioner\\u2019s sugar, for dusting<br> 3 medium purple plums, pitted and chopped into 1/2 inch pieces (about 330 grams) 1/2 cup (160 grams) plum jam or preserves<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 2 tablespoons water<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Whisk the egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until foamy. Stream in 3 tablespoons of the sugar and the salt. Whisk on medium high just until the whites form stiff peaks, about 2 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks in a large bowl until lightened, about 30 seconds. Add the flour, nutmeg, milk, vanilla and almond extracts. Whisk until smooth. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the melted butter just to combine. Stir in about a third of the egg whites to loosen the mixture, then use a large rubber spatula to gently fold in the remaining egg whites just until combined. Heat a medium (10-inch) nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the melted butter and swirl to coat the skillet. Add the pancake batter and spread out gently with a spatula. Let cook on the stovetop just until the edges begin to set, about 1 minute. Transfer to the oven and bake until the top is puffed and the pancake is set, 12 to 14 minutes. When the pancake is done, remove from the oven and place on the stovetop over low heat. Use 2 metal spatulas or large metal spoons to quarter the pancake, then turn all of the pieces and cut into rough (about bite sized) chunks in the skillet. Sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar and remaining melted butter. Toss well to fully coat. Cook and toss over low heat until the edges of the pieces are caramelized and golden, 3 to 4 minutes. To serve, dust with confectioner\\u2019s sugar and serve with the warm plum sauce. While the pancake bakes, make the plum sauce. In a small saucepan, stir together the plums, jam or preserves, lemon juice, water and salt. Bring to a simmer over medium low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the plums are tender and the mixture is syrupy, about 4 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 35074,&quot;Whole Wheat Fusilli with Kale and Walnut Pesto Pasta Kosher salt 1 pound whole wheat fusilli 1/2 cup walnut halves<br> 2 cloves garlic<br> 1 1/2 cups packed baby arugula<br> 1 1/2 cups packed chopped kale<br> 1 cup fresh basil leaves<br> 1/2 cup grated Pecorino-Romano, plus more for garnish<br> 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br> 1/2 teaspoon sea salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br> Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt generously.

Line three 9-inch round baking pans with parchment and spray the sides with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and ginger. In a separate, large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the brown sugar and oil until fully combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time and then the vanilla, scraping down the sides if necessary to ensure that all is thoroughly combined. Gently stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Stir in the carrots, pineapple and pecans until they are evenly distributed, taking care not to overmix the batter. Pour a third of the batter into each of the cake pans and bake until the cake is fully set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool completely in the pans on a rack, about 1 hour. For the frosting: Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, orange extract and orange zest with an electric mixer in a medium bowl until smooth and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. When completely cool, remove the cake layers from the pans. Place one layer on a cake plate. Using an offset spatula, spread a quarter to a third of the frosting over the top of the layer, taking care to spread it all the way to the edges. Top with a cake layer and repeat with the remaining frosting and cake layer, smoothing the frosting neatly over the top layer. Scatter zest over the frosting on the top layer. If a more uniform finish is desired, use a pastry bag fitted with a round tip to pipe additional frosting into the remaining gaps between the layers, turning the plate as you go. Use the end of a spoon or the tip of a knife to smooth the rounded edge of the piped frosting and close any gaps. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 35088,&quot;Sugarplum Soda Syrup 1 cup golden raisins 1 1/2 cups sugar 1/2 cup dried apricots, roughly chopped 1/2 cup pitted dates, chopped 1/2 cup honey 3 cardamom pods 1 cinnamon stick 1/2 a whole nutmeg 1 teaspoon almond extract Purple food coloring, as desired Instructions: Combine the raisins, sugar, apricots, dates, honey, cardamom, cinnamon stick and nutmeg in 2 1/2 cups water in a medium saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.

Place the chicken, skin side up, along with the marinade in one layer in a large (15-by-18-inch) roasting pan, sprinkle with the brown sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper, and pour the wine around (not over!) the chicken. Roast for 45 to 55 minutes, until the internal temperature of the chicken is 145 degrees F. Remove the pan from the oven, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Transfer the chicken, prunes, and olives to a serving platter, sprinkle with salt, and serve hot with the pan juices. &quot;,&quot;[Reds: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Zinfandel]</p><p>Whites: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 35091,&quot;Caramelized Onion Potato Tart 1 large onion, sliced Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 large Russet potatoes, washed 2 to 3 tablespoons butter, broken into small pieces Special equipment: parchment paper cut into large circle to fit saute pan Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Set a large skillet over medium heat and add 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Add sliced onions and cook over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes until they are tender and brown all over. Using a mandolin (or sharp knife), finely slice the potatoes into rounds (you can place them in a bowl with a wet towel over the top to stop them from going brown while you work). Place the potatoes into a bowl and season with salt and pepper. When ready, add the onions and toss to combine without breaking potatoes. Add about 1 tablespoon water to the same pan the onions were cooked in and allow it to come to a bubble. Using layered paper towels, wipe the pan clean. Add some extra-virgin olive oil to the pan and add the potatoes to the pan, making sure the potatoes are flat. Top with the diced butter. Take a piece of parchment paper and fold in half. Find the middle of the parchment along the crease and hold in place with your finger. Taking the right side of the parchment, pull it towards the center and fold it straight down to create a diagonal edge. Fold the parchment in half to create a triangle. Place the pointed edge in the middle of the saute pan on top of the potatoes to find its radius. Make a marker of where the pan edge ends (or starts). At this point you can cut the parchment at this marker and open to reveal a circle. Cover the potatoes with the parchment paper and press down. Drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil over the top so it down burn and rub it in. Place the pan into the oven on the top rack and bake for about 45 minutes. When done remove from oven and run a knife around the edge to separate from the pan. Place a large plate on top of the saute pan and flip. Remove the saute pan. Allow to cool slightly before cutting into slices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35092,&quot;Grilled Baguettes with Seasoned Butter 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons crab boil seasoning (recommended: Old Bay) 1 cup (1/2-pound) unsalted butter, room temperature Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 lemon, zested 4 pounds Portuguese linguica sausage, grilled Baguettes Instructions: Heat the olive oil over medium-low heat in small saucepan. Once the oil begins to warm, whisk in crab boil seasoning. Bring the mixture up to a simmer and when it starts to foam, remove from heat and allow it to cool completely. Process the butter in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Add the seasoned olive oil and a pinch of salt, the lemon zest, and process until blended well. Purchase your favorite baguettes, slice lengthwise. Place baguettes over medium heat on the grill, cook on each side until a golden brown color is achieved. Remove from grill, slather with seasoned butter, cut and serve with grilled linguica sausage. Cook&#39;s note: The seasoned butter can be refrigerated for 1 week and frozen for up to 6 months. Refrigerate until just firm enough to shape into a log roll. Put an 18-inch sheet of foil on work surface. Lay the butter down the center of the foil, forming a log about 1 1/2 inches thick. Wrap in foil and twist the ends to make a sealed log, like a tootsie roll. Remove your seasoned butter from the refrigerator and allow to reach room temperature before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35093,&quot;Traditional New Mexico Red cl Cheese \\Stacked\\ Enchiladas 6 corn tortillas Oil (optional) 1 1/2 to 2 cups red cl sauce, recipe follows 1 cup shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese 1/2 small chopped onion 2 fried eggs 1 cup shredded lettuce 3/4 cup chopped tomato 20 dried cl pods 1/4 cup water 6 garlic cloves Salt Pinch Mexican oregano 1 pound diced pork (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Each serving will contain 3 corn tortillas. Take the tortilla and dip it in hot oil or dip it in the red cl sauce and put on plate. Top this with cheese and onion and more sauce and put another dipped tortilla on top and repeat this 2 times. Heat in the oven or under the broiler until cheese melts and top with a fried egg. Garnish the plate with the lettuce and tomato. You can serve this with fried potatoes or pinto beans. To make a casserole, you can layer the above in a baking dish with the final layer on top being cheese, do not put eggs on the casserole. Bake for about 20 minutes, until all is warm and melted. Garnish with lettuce and tomato. Can also serve with sour cream, chopped olives and guacamole. Remove the stems and seeds of the cl pods. Soak the pods in water or simmer on stove for about 10 minutes. Place cl and garlic in a blender with 1/4 cup water and puree until smooth. (Use 6 to 8 pods of cl and 2 cloves of garlic at a time, which will make the puree smoother and easier to work with.) Add more water as needed to get a medium consistency. In a sauce pan, add pureed cl with Mexican Oregano and salt to taste. Bring to a slow boil, and then simmer for 20 minutes. Pork can be browned and added to sauce while simmering. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, Zinfandel]</p><p>&quot; 35094,&quot;Szechuan Peppercorn Pancakes 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon crushed Szechuan peppercorns 1 scallion, minced 1 1/2 cup boiling water Vegetable oil Cooked duck skin from 1 duck, cut into strips 4 scallions, cut into thin strips 1 cucumber, seeded and cut into thin strips Hoisin sauce Instructions: A peppery Szechuan pancakes recipe - a Chinese classic, Chuck style. For the pancakes: In a large bowl, mix the flour with the salt and the Szechuan peppercorns. Add the scallions. Add the boiling water slowly and begin stirring it in immediately. Knead the warm dough until it&#39;s smooth. Place the dough ball in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 2 hours at room temperature.<br> Turn the rested dough out onto a floured surface and divide into 8 equal parts. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll each piece out until it&#39;s 1/4-inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut out 5-inch circles of dough (or just cut them out using a knife). Cover the prepared pancakes with a damp towel to keep them from drying out while making the rest. For best results, layer the pancakes on pieces of parchment paper to keep them from sticking.<br> Heat a little vegetable oil in a heavy frying pan over low heat. Add the pancakes and cook until browned on both sides (about 2 minutes altogether; the second side will cook more quickly than the first side). Continue with the remainder of the pancakes, placing the cooked ones on a tray lined with paper towels to absorb some of the oil.<br> For the garnish: To crisp up the duck skin, saute in a pan over medium heat until crispy, about 2 minutes (do not add oil). Once cooked, place the skin on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.<br> Top the pancakes with the shredded duck meat, crispy duck skin, scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 35095,&quot;Chia Lime Water 1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice 2 quarts water 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup chia seeds Several sprigs of fresh sage for garnish Instructions: Squeeze the limes with a Mexican lime squeezer.

Split the vanilla bean in half with a small paring knife, and scrape out the seeds; discard the pod. Add the seeds to the cream in a 1 1/2 quart saucepan; scald the cream and keep the saucepan near the stove so that if the cream cools too much when needed, you can reheat it briefly. In a deep, heavy-bottomed 4-quart saucepan over low heat, blend the corn syrup and the sugar, stirring occasionally until the mixture becomes more fluid and most of the sugar appears dissolved. Stop stirring, raise heat to medium-high, and gently boil until a candy thermometer registers 305 degrees F (hard crack stage), about 9 to 12 minutes. Add the butter and salt to the sugar mixture, stirring constantly. Pour in the warm vanilla-flavored cream in a slow but steady stream without letting the boiling stop (be careful-mixture foams up and is steamy). Lower heat to medium and continue to boil gently until the thermometer registers about 248 degrees F, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, about 14 to 15 minutes. Let the candy stand about 3 minutes to allow bubbling to subside, then pour into the prepared pan without scraping the saucepan; allow to cool at least 5 hours. Invert onto a clean cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips; then cut across the strips to form 1/2-inch squares. To apply a patch of gold leaf to each square, use a small artist&#39;s brush. With the brush, lift a tiny patch about the size of an oatmeal flake of gold leaf and deposit it on top of the caramels for decoration. Cut caramels tend to stick together and not hold their shape unless individually wrapped, so for easiest storage wrap the block of caramels in aluminum foil and cut off portions as needed. Store cut caramels in layers, separated by aluminum foil in an airtight metal or plastic container in a cool place for up to 3 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 35101,&quot;Pimento Cheese 1 pound freshly grated extra-sharp Cheddar (about 4 cups) 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1/2 sweet onion, grated One 4-ounce jar pimentos, drained and finely chopped Dash of hot sauce Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Crackers, for serving Celery sticks, for serving Instructions: Combine the cheese, mayonnaise and onions in a bowl.

Rinse the neck and giblets and put them in a plastic bag in the fridge; you&#39;ll need them for the gravy. Rinse the turkey thoroughly with cold water. Place the turkey into a large brining bag or pot. Pour in My Favorite Turkey Brine and place in the fridge for 16 to 18 hours so the brine can work its magic. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse thoroughly, inside and out. Soak the turkey in cold water for 15 minutes, then rinse again and pat dry. Truss the bird or tuck the legs and wings however you like. Place the bird, breast-side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan. Cover the whole pan, tenting the bird, with heavy-duty foil so that it&#39;s well sealed. Place in the oven and roast the turkey for about 10 minutes per pound. (So, for a 20-pound turkey, about 3 1/2 hours; for a 15-pound turkey, about 2 1/2 hours.) Note: There will still be more cooking time after this, but it&#39;ll be at a different temperature. When it&#39;s time to remove the turkey from the oven, mix together the butter, rosemary and orange zest. Remove the turkey from the oven and increase the temperature to 375 degrees F. Remove the foil and set aside. (Put stuffing in the bird if you wish at this point.) Rub the butter mixture all over the skin of the turkey, getting in the crevices. Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer into the thigh, near the hip joint. Place the turkey, uncovered, back into the oven and continue roasting, basting/brushing with the juices in the pan every 30 minutes, until the thermometer registers 165 degrees F and until the juices no longer run pink. This will take another 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, depending on the size of the bird. Remove from the oven and cover lightly with foil until you are ready to carve. Combine the water, cider, brown sugar, salt, peppercorns, bay leaves, garlic, orange strips and rosemary in a large pot. Stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved. Bring to a boil, then cover and turn off the heat. Allow to cool completely before placing in the fridge to chill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 35119,&quot;Spinach and Smoked Salmon Cocktail Knishes 1 pound peeled baking potatoes, like russets or waxy potatoes, like Yukon Golds 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 large Spanish onion, minced (2 cups) 1/2 cup spinach, cooked, drained, and coarsely chopped 3/4 cup vegetable oil 3/4 cup water 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1/4 teaspoon turmeric 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 pound smoked salmon, shredded 1/4 bunch flat leaf parsley, washed Instructions: Make the filling: Place the potatoes in a pot of water and boil until fork-tender (20 minutes). Drain. Meanwhile, saute the onions in the oil until softened. Mash the potatoes and stir in the onion mixture and spinach. Make the dough: In a mixer fitted with the paddle, combine the oil, water, cumin, turmeric, salt and 1 1/2 cups flour. If necessary, add additional flour or water to make a soft dough. Form into two balls. Wrap in plastic and let rest, at room temperature for 30 minutes. Assembly: Roll the dough out into 2 rectangles, 1/8-inch thick (approximately 15 by 10-inches). Lay filling down center in a squared off log. Place the salmon in a layer on top of the filling. Trim dough and roll up. Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Slice into 2-inch pieces. Set, seam side down, on a non-stick cookie sheet or a sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 30 minutes, until golden. Garnish platter with flat-leaf parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35120,&quot;Layered Ham and Cheese Biscuits 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 tablespoons baking powder 1 tablespoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes 1 cup shredded mild Cheddar 1 cup buttermilk, plus more for brushing 2 thin slices black forest ham, roughly chopped (about 2 ounces) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Pulse the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter and 1/2 cup of the Cheddar and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter remaining. Add the buttermilk and pulse a few times, until the dough just comes together.<br> Turn the dough out onto a work surface that\\u2019s lightly dusted with flour, then pat into a 7-by-7-inch square that&#39;s about 1 inch thick. Scatter half of the ham and 1/4 cup of the Cheddar on half of the dough, then fold the other half of dough over like a book; gently pinch the edges to seal. Pat the dough out again into a 7-by-7-inch square, scatter the remaining ham and 1/4 cup of cheese on top and fold the dough over like a book. Press once more into a 7-by-7-inch square.<br> Use a sharp chef\\u2019s knife to cut the dough into 12 even rectangular pieces.

Set aside 30 minutes. Meanwhile, puree the beef with 2 teaspoons water, the onion powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a food processor until smooth. Draw a 6-by-12-inch rectangle on a piece of parchment paper; flip over the paper so the pencil side is down (you should still be able to see the rectangle). Press the beef into the rectangle; cover with another piece of parchment and press until the beef is very thin and fills the rectangle completely. Uncover and score the beef into eight 3-inch-square patties. Poke 5 holes into each patty with a chopstick (one in the center and one near each corner). Slide the beef on the parchment onto a baking sheet, loosely cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 10 to 15 minutes. Trim the edges of the rectangle to make it even; cut patties along the scored lines. Heat an extra-large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and liquid; bring to a boil. Stir in the butter and arrange the patties over the onion. Cook until the meat is no longer pink around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Put a bun bottom upside down on each patty. To steam the bun tops, rest each across 2 bun bottoms (like a bridge). Continue cooking until the patties are completely cooked through, about 2 more minutes, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons water if the skillet is too dry or if the onion starts browning. Remove the bun tops from the skillet. Slide a spatula under each patty, picking up the onions and bun bottoms along with the meat; flip over onto a plate. Top each with a pickle and a bun top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 35122,&quot;Chicken Noodle Soup - Asian Style 1-ounce dried Shiitake mushrooms, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes, drained, trimmed and sliced 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 cup minced onion 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger 1 cup sliced carrot 1 1/2 cups sliced Napa Cabbage or Bok Choy 6 cups chicken stock or broth 1/2 package dried Asian egg noodles 1 cup broccoli florets 1 cup cooked sliced chicken 1 tablespoon soy sauce 2 tablespoons rice vinegar Sesame oil to taste Minced whole scallion for garnish Instructions: In a large saucepan set over moderate heat, heat the oil until it is hot.

Meanwhile, cook the sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely melted, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, add the chopped basil and stir until completely wilted. Cool completely at room temperature, at least 1 hour. When the watermelon is completely frozen, put half in a blender. Strain the basil syrup into the blender, use the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to press down on the basil to extract as much flavor as possible, and discard the basil. Add the lemon juice, and blend until the mixture is mostly smooth, pushing it down with a wooden spoon or spatula if needed. Add the remaining watermelon, and continue to blend until the mixture is completely smooth. Spoon the mixture into 4 short glasses (or wineglasses, if you want to be fancy), and garnish each with a basil leaf. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 35125,&quot;Tropical Salsa Fresca 1/4 of a fresh pineapple, peeled, cored, and chopped 1 mango, peeled and chopped 1/2 onion, chopped fine 1/2 red bell pepper, chopped fine 1/2 orange bell pepper, chopped fine 1 large jalapeno, seeded, deveined, and minced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 tomato, chopped 2 limes, juiced 3/4 cup minced cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon salt Instructions: Toss and serve with chips or as an accompaniment to pork, chicken, or fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 35126,&quot;Sweet Potato Lyonnaise 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, halved and thinly sliced (but not too thin) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 medium sweet potatoes, 2 to 3 inches in diameter (about 1 1/2 pounds) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup chicken broth or water Instructions: Heat the oil in a large skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the onions. Season with salt and pepper and cook the onions, stirring often, until softened and browned around the edges, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl. While the onions are cooking, peel and cut the sweet potatoes into 1/4-inch slices. Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter to the skillet, swirling to prevent burning. When the butter has melted, cover the bottom of the skillet with as many potato slices that will fit in one layer (this should be about half of the potatoes). Cook until the potatoes are deeply browned on one side, about 4 minutes. Remove to the bowl with the onions. Add the remaining potato slices, and then spread the cooked onions/potatoes over top. Season with salt and pepper, pour in the chicken broth and cover the skillet. When the potatoes are partly tender with some resistance, about 3 minutes, use a metal spatula to flip the bottom layer to the top and continue cooking. (Don&#39;t worry; it will take 3 to 4 flips to transfer all the browned potatoes to the top.) Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 2 more minutes. Remove the lid, raising the heat to medium-high and allow the remaining liquid to evaporate, about 3 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35127,&quot;Spicy Shrimp Tamales with Roasted Tomatillo Sauce and Goat Cheese 1 pound tomatillos, husked 1 white onion, peeled 4 garlic cloves 2 Anaheim green chiles, stems removed 2 teaspoons cumin 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup cilantro 2 cups prepared masa 6 ounces goat cheese, room temperature 1 bag dried cornhusks, cleaned and soaked 2 pounds jumbo shrimp, cleaned 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon chili powder 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon coriander Salt and pepper, to taste 2 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: Place tomatillos, onion, garlic, and green chiles in a roasting pan and bake in a preheated 400 degree F oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the roasted vegetables to a food processor along with any juices that are at the bottom of the pan. Add the cumin, salt, and cilantro. Pulse the mixture until combined but still chunky. You may add a bit of water or broth if the mixture is too thick. Reserve half the sauce to serve with the tamales. In a deep bowl, combine the masa and remaining half of the tomatillo sauce. Beat until fully incorporated and the dough is green. Fold in the softened goat cheese. Set the cornhusks on a sheet pan covered by a damp towel. Lay the husk flat on a plate with the smooth side up and the narrow end facing you. Spread a thin, even layer of the masa mixture over the surface of the husk with a tablespoon that is dipped in water. Fold the narrow end up to the center then fold both sides together to enclose the filling. The sticky masa will form a seal. Pinch the wide top closed. Stand the tamales up in a large steamer or colander with the pinched end up. Load the steamer into a large pot filled with 2-inches of water. The water should not touch the tamales. Lay a damp cloth over the tamales and cover with lid. Keep the water at a low boil, checking periodically to make sure the water doesn&#39;t boil away. Steam the tamales for 2 hours. Coat the shrimp with cumin, chili powder, cayenne, coriander, salt, and pepper. Heat oil in a saute pan, cook the shrimp for 5 minutes until pink. To serve, unfold the tamales, top with the spicy shrimp and spoon the reserved tomatillo sauce over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 35128,&quot;Batty Chocolate Mousse with Chocolate Cookie Wings Chocolate Cookie dough, recipe follows 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate 1 cup heavy cream, plus 1 cup 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate 2 tablespoons butter, softened 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup water 3 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 8 ounces (2 sticks) butter, cut into 1-inch pieces, room temperature 1 1/2 cups sugar 2 eggs 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup cocoa powder Instructions: Cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position the rack to the center position. Dust the work surface with flour. Place the dough on the table and dust with flour. With a rolling pin, work the dough, rolling back and forth.

Cut out 6 (3-inch) circles and 12 bat-wing shapes, gathering the scraps and rerolling as necessary. Place on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature. Batty Chocolate Mousse: Chop up the chocolate very fine and place in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan bring 1 cup of the cream to a boil. Remove from the heat and pour the cream over the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute. Then, whisk together until smooth and set aside and cool. Whip the remaining 1 cup of the heavy cream to soft peaks. Fold the soft whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. Spoon into 6 (3-inch) dome molds. Schmear with a spatula across the top and top with a cookie disk. Place in the freezer for at least 4 hours. Chocolate Glaze: Chop the chocolate into 1/4-inch fine pieces and place in a medium size mixing bowl with butter. In a small saucepot over medium flame, bring the sugar and water to a boil, stirring to combine. Pour the sugar syrup over the chocolate and stir until smooth. Assembly: Unmold onto a wire rack. Place the rack on a parchment-lined sheet tray. Pour over the chocolate glaze. Stick 2 wing cookies in the side of each dome. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 days. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl and reserve. Place the butter in a large mixing bowl and soften by hand. Add the sugar and continue to blend with hands or a rubber spatula for 2 minutes, until the mixture resembles light yellow-colored mashed potatoes. Transfer to a mixer. Crack the eggs, 1 at a time, into the butter mixture and combine until well blended. Add the vanilla extract. Add the sifted flour mixture and continue to blend for 2 to 3 minutes until a dough is formed. Remove dough from the mixer and divide in half. Place 1/2 of the dough back into the mixer. On low speed, add the cocoa powder and continue to mix until you have a chocolate dough. Wrap both doughs in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to overnight. Use chocolate dough for the Batty Chocolate Mousse recipe and the plain dough for the Witches Finger Cookies.

Set aside. To make the nougat: In a medium, heat-resistant bowl, add the marshmallow creme and set aside. Heat the butter in a small saucepan over low heat until it\\u2019s melted and toasty and the milk solids are browned but not burned and settled at the bottom of the pan, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour the browned butter over the marshmallow. Add the vanilla and salt and use a fork or small whisk to incorporate (be careful as the butter is hot). Once fully incorporated, add the powdered sugar and use a rubber spatula to combine. Once it starts coming together into a homogenous mixture, use your hands to knead into a smooth round disk. Cut off a piece of the nougat and roll it into a 1/2-inch-thick log. Cut the log into 3-inch lengths. Continue with the remaining nougat; you should end up with about twenty-four 3-inch logs. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. To make the caramel: In a small saucepan over low heat, add the butter and cook until it\\u2019s melted and toasty and the milk solids are browned but not burned and settled at the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Add the caramels and heavy cream. Cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula to ensure the butter and caramel don\\u2019t burn, until the caramels are melted. Turn off the heat and let cool in the pan until warm to the touch, 30 to 45 minutes. (If the caramel is becoming too thick or hardened, simply warm it on a very low heat and stir until pliable.) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside. To assemble the nut rolls: Add the whole and chopped peanuts to a large, shallow bowl. Using 2 forks, roll each log of nougat in the caramel to fully coat. Transfer the caramel-coated nougat into the bowl with the peanuts and use your hands to gently press the peanuts into the layer of caramel to stick. Place onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with all of the nougat, caramel and peanuts, placing them all on the baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.

Bring the remaining cranberries, sugar, vinegar, orange zest, cinnamon stick, ginger, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves and the cranberries soften, about 3 minutes. Add the figs and raisins, raise the heat to bring the mixture to a high simmer, then cook until the cranberries burst and the chutney is saucy and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the reserved 1/2 cup cranberries. Let the chutney cool to room temperature. Transfer it to an airtight container or resealable plastic bag, label and date, and freeze for up to 2 weeks. Let the chutney thaw in the refrigerator the night before you plan to serve it. To serve, heat it in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments until the chill is gone. If the chutney is too thick, thin it out with a few tablespoons of water. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 35135,&quot;No-Chop Garlic Bread 1 head garlic 1 teaspoon olive oil<br> One 12-inch loaf soft Italian bread<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 teaspoon garlic salt<br> Instructions: Slice off and discard the top of the head of garlic. Place the garlic in a microwave-safe bowl and drizzle with the oil; pour 2 tablespoons water into the bowl. Cover with a plate (to act as a lid) and microwave on 50-percent power until the garlic is very soft, 8 to 9 minutes. Let cool until comfortable to handle. Meanwhile, slice the bread in half lengthwise. Put the softened butter in a small bowl, squeeze in the garlic cloves and add the garlic salt. Stir until well blended. Generously spread the bread with garlic butter. Preheat the broiler to high. Place the bread, buttered-side up, on a baking sheet and broil until lightly golden on top, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35136,&quot;Panini with Roasted Peppers 8 slices crusty Italian semolina bread 1 pound fresh or fresh smoked mozzarella, sliced 1 (8 to 10-ounce) container roasted peppers, drained 2 tablespoons green salad olives, sliced with pimientos Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing Instructions: Make 4 sandwiches with the bread, cheese, roasted pepper, and a sprinkling of sliced olives; keep your ingredients in single layers. Heat a nonstick griddle pan over medium heat. Wrap a brick completely in foil. Brush sandwiches on both sides with oil. Place sandwiches on grill and top with the foil wrapped bricks.

Add the spices. Score ham in a diamond pattern through the skin and fat, taking care not to cut into the meat. Add ham to brine, weight it with a plate to keep it submerged, and refrigerate for at least 4 but no more than 8 hours. Drain, rinse, pat the ham dry, and refrigerate. One hour before roasting, remove the ham from the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. For the rub: Pulse the olive oil, mustard, parsley, sage, garlic, red pepper, salt, and black pepper in a food processor to make a paste. Rub it all over ham. In a large roasting pan, toss the onion wedges with 1 cup of the apple cider, and set the ham on top. Roast the ham for 30 minutes, reduce the oven temperature 325 degrees F, and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 165 degrees F, about 4 hours. After the first hour, loosely wrap aluminum foil around the bone to keep it from burning. Meanwhile, for the glaze: Boil, then simmer, the remaining apple cider in a saucepan, skimming as needed, until syrupy and reduced to about 2 cups, about 1 1/2 hours. During the last 1 1/2 hours of cooking the ham, brush it with the glaze every 30 minutes. Transfer the cooked ham to an ovenproof platter and let it rest in the turned-off oven for 30 minutes. Loosely cover the onions in a bowl, and put them in the oven as well. Strain the pan juices into a saucepan, skim off any excess fat, and bring to a boil. Make a paste with the flour and butter and whisk a bit at a time into the juices. Boil until thick. Carve the ham and serve with the onions and sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35138,&quot;Honey-Apple-Almond Cake 4 large egg whites 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon almond extract 3 sticks unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, at room temperature 3 tablespoons honey Basic Vanilla Cake, recipe follows, baked and cooled 3/4 cup apple butter Sliced almonds, toasted, for topping 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups sugar 4 large eggs, at room temperature 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: Make the frosting: Whisk the egg whites and sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water) until the mixture is warm and the sugar dissolves, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, 6 to 8 minutes. Beat in the almond extract, then beat in the butter a few pieces at a time. Continue beating until the frosting is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. (Don&#39;t worry if the mixture looks separated at first; keep beating and it will come together.) Assemble the cake: Bring the honey and 2 tablespoons water to a gentle simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat; let cool slightly. Place 1 cake layer on a platter; brush with half of the honey mixture and spread the apple butter on top, stopping about 1/2 inch from the edge. Top with the second cake layer and press down gently; brush with the remaining honey mixture. Cover the whole cake with the frosting and top with sliced almonds.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Mix 1/2 cup water with the cream in a liquid measuring cup or bowl. Beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the cream mixture, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and the centers spring back when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 35139,&quot;Udon Noodles with Lemon Grass Clam Broth Canola oil 2 pounds manila or little neck clams, cleaned 6 stalks lemon grass, sliced, white part only 4 slices ginger 2 Thai bird chiles 1 white onion sliced 1/3 cup mirin 4 cups chicken stock 2 packages udon noodles 1/2 pound spinach leaves 1 tablespoon butter (optional, but really good) 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Salt and white pepper to taste Instructions: In a very hot stock pot, add 1 tablespoon oil, add clams and stir for 2 minutes. Add lemon grass, ginger, chiles and onion and stir for 2 more minutes. Season. Deglaze with mirin and reduce liquid by 80 per cent. Add chicken stock and turn heat down to simmer. When clams are open, remove and continue slowly simmering the broth. Check for seasoning. Reduce broth by 20 per cent, which should take about 30 minutes, then strain. Bring broth back to a boil; add udon, spinach, clams and butter. Add lemon juice and serve in large bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 35140,&quot;Grilled Peaches with Amaretti 8 ripe peaches, cut in 1/2 and pitted 1/4 cup vanilla sugar, recipe follows 1/4 cup good dark rum (recommended: Mount Gay) 1/4 cup good almond liqueur (recommended: Amaretto Di Savonna) 8 amaretti cookies, crumbled Creme fraiche or vanilla ice cream to serve, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat a grill with a single layer of charcoal. When the coals are hot, brush the grill with a little oil to make sure the peaches don&#39;t stick. Place the peaches, cut side down, on the grill and cook for a few minutes, until they&#39;re slightly charred. Place the peaches in an oven-proof dish, sprinkle each half with a little vanilla sugar. Combine the rum and amaretto and drizzle 1/2 of it on the peaches. Bake the peaches for about 10 minutes, until they&#39;re very tender. Serve hot, at room temperature, or cold with crumbled amaretti cookies on top or with the cookies on the side. I like to serve them with a dollop of creme fraiche or vanilla ice cream. Vanilla Sugar: Find a jar tall enough to hold 2 vanilla beans. Fill the bottle with sugar and cover tightly. Store on a pantry shelf. After about 3 months you will have a wonderful ingredient for cooking and baking. Keep adding vanilla beans and sugar to the jar and you will have it for years. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 35141,&quot;Pot Roast and Vegetable Gravy 1 (10 to 12 pound) bolar roast, (chuck roast), hand tied tight to a 4-inch diameter 3 tablespoons tomato paste 2 kernels fresh garlic, smashed 2 bay leaves 1 tablespoon pure ground black pepper 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon onion salt 5 large red bliss potatoes, cubed 12 small carrots or 2 yellow rutabagas 2 onions 1/2 stalk celery 10 ounces flour 10 pounds peeled large red bliss potatoes 2 ounces horseradish 2 onions, ground 1 teaspoon white pepper 1 tablespoon salt 8 ounces drawn butter 8 ounces warm half-and-half 1 -ounce parsley, chopped 10 pounds of potatoes 4 medium onions 8 eggs 2 ounces salt 1/2 bunch parsley 1 teaspoon white pepper 2 pounds flour 1 tablespoon baking powder Instructions: Pot Roast: Preheat oven to 275 degrees. Place roast in a pan and season with tomato paste, garlic, bay leaves, pepper, salt and onion salt. Put 1 1/2-inche of water in the bottom of the pan. Surround the roast with 1/2-inch cubes or stew cuts of fresh vegetables. Cover the roast pan with another interlocking roast pan of the same size and roast for 2 hours. Then turn over and cook for another 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Gravy: Separate the vegetables from the natural gravy stock. Pour the stock into a heavy gauge pot. Scrape the bottom of the roast pan and add to stock. You should have about 3 quarts of stock, if not add bouillon broth. Simmer and skim off the fat, then put 1 1/2 pints of the stock in a pan and add flour and whip until smooth. Gradually add this slurry to the simmering stock until a smooth thickness is achieved. Add the roasted vegetables to the gravy. Mashed Potatoes: Boil or steam potatoes until well done. Place in a mixing bowl and add the above ingredients. Whip, then serve. Potato Pancake: Rice potatoes through fine hole attachment. Dice onions fine in buffalo chopper and add to potatoes. Combine this with eggs, salt, parsley and white pepper. Add 2pounds of flour and check consistency then add baking powder. If batter seems too loose or watery, add more flour until thick but not too stiff. In a large skillet, add enough vegetable oil so that when melted it will equal about 1/8-inch in bottom. Oil must be very hot before using or pancakes will turn out greasy. Spoon batter into pan about 2-ounce ovals. When brown, place on paper towel to absorb excess oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot]&quot; 35142,&quot;Italian Cheese Sticks 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a 17.3-ounce package, such as Pepperidge Farm), thawed in the refrigerator 2 tablespoons salted butter, melted<br> 1 cup grated mozzarella (hard, not fresh)<br> 3/4 cup grated Parmesan<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil<br> 1 large egg<br> Warm marinara, for serving Instructions: Line a baking sheet with parchment.

When the pan is hot, add just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and add the garlic. Cook, stirring frequently until golden brown (3 to 5 minutes). Remove from the oil. At this point, the greens can be quickly Sauteed for a mild garlic flavor. If you&#39;re looking for something a little stronger, thinly sliver 1 clove and add it to the pan stirring constantly (burned garlic is not Good Eats, nor is anything that touches it). Once the slivers turn golden, add the greens and toss to coat with the hot oil. Season with salt and pepper as soon as the greens start to wilt and plate immediately. If you&#39;re looking for even more garlic flavor, finely mince a clove of garlic and toss it into the greens during the last 30 seconds of cooking and toss the greens to distribute. Keep the pan and the greens moving constantly, if you can.

Put the potatoes in a large bowl with salt, baking powder, and egg white. Add the flour a little at a time and mix with your hands until the mixture forms a rough dough. Do not over-work the dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Gently knead the dough for 1 or 2 minutes until smooth, adding a little bit more flour, if necessary, to keep it from sticking. Break off a piece of the dough and roll it back and forth into a rope, about the thickness of your index finger. Cut the rope into 1-inch pieces. Gently roll each piece down a wooden gnocchi board while pressing a small dimple with your finger. The gnocchi should be slightly curved and marked with ridges. This will allow the pillows to hold sauce when served. Boil the gnocchi in batches in plenty of salted water. The gnocchi are done about 2 minutes after they float to the surface, remove with a slotted spoon, and serve. If not cooking immediately, place the gnocchi in a single layer on a baking pan dusted with flour. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 12 hours. Note: If the gnocchi start to feather and fall apart in boiling water, you need more flour. If the gnocchi don&#39;t float after 2 minutes and are hard, you used too much flour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35159,&quot;Seared Tuna with Coconut Sauce Coconut Curry Sauce: 1 cup homemade fish stock or bottled clam juice 1 cup canned coconut milk 1/2 cup canned cream of coconut 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger 1/2 cup minced scallions 2 tablespoons chopped lemon grass (optional) 2 tablespoons curry powder 2 tablespoons light soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes 4 (8-ounce) tuna steaks 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil Instructions: Combine all sauce ingredients in a medium-size saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat and strain the sauce through a sieve, pressing as much of the sauce through as possible. Return the sauce to a clean saucepan and keep it warm. Rinse the tuna steaks and pat them dry with paper towels. Rub them with the salt and coarse pepper. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and sear the steaks for 3 to 4 minutes on each side (or to taste). Spoon a pool of Coconut Curry Sauce onto each plate, and set the tuna on top of the sauce. Serve immediately.; &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gewrztraminer, Riesling]&quot; 35160,&quot;Dry Rub 1/4 cup paprika 1 cup ancho cl powder 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons mustard powder 2 teaspoons dried oregano 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Combine all the ingredients in a medium bowl. Divide among small spice containers and store for up to 4 months. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 35161,&quot;Chocolate Caramel-Creme Candy Cake 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled, plus more for the pan 1 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note), plus more for the pan 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup buttermilk, at room temperature 1 large egg, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin (about 1/2 of one 1/4-ounce packet) 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/2 cup sour cream, at room temperature 8 ounces milk chocolate chips or bars, finely chopped 3/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 8-inch square cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the parchment and dust with flour, tapping out excess. Whisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the melted butter, buttermilk, egg, vanilla and 1/2 cup water together in another bowl until smooth. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking until just combined. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans, smoothing the tops. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through cooking, until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 15 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Discard the parchment paper and flip the cakes right side up again. Let the cakes cool completely. Make the caramel creme: Heat 1/2 cup sugar in a small nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring with a rubber spatula, until it turns dark amber in color, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and pour in the heavy cream (mixture will bubble up). When the bubbles subside, add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and the salt and stir until both dissolve in the caramel. Scrape the caramel into the bowl of a food processor and let cool completely. Combine the gelatin with 1 tablespoon cold water in a small bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Heat the gelatin in the microwave until it melts completely, about 10 seconds, stirring to dissolve. Add the gelatin mixture, cream cheese and sour cream to the food processor and process until smooth. Scrape the caramel creme filling into a bowl and refrigerate, checking every 5 minutes, until it is just thick enough to spread, 5 to 15 minutes. (Do not let the filling firm up too much.) Before layering the cake, give the mixture a good whisking to aerate it slightly. This will make for a lighter texture. Place one cake on a cake stand and pile the caramel filling in the center, spreading it in a thick layer almost to the edge. Top with the remaining cake, aligning the layers directly on top of each other so the cake does not lean. Refrigerate the assembled cake for 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the chocolate ganache: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan then remove from the heat. Add the chocolate, shaking the pan gently to submerge it. Allow the pan to stand, off the heat, for 3 minutes to melt the chocolate. Whisk the ganache until smooth, then refrigerate until it is just thick enough to spread (like mayonnaise), about 15 minutes. (Do not let the ganache harden too much.) Stir the ganache again and scoop it on top of the cake, spreading it over the top and sides. Refrigerate the cake until the ganache is set, at least 2 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah]&quot; 35162,&quot;St. Joseph&#39;s Day Soup 4 ounces chickpeas 4 ounces cannellini beans 4 ounces dried peeled fava beans 4 ounces lentils 4 ounces split peas 1 medium fennel bulb, finely chopped 1 cup chopped canned Italian peeled tomatoes 1 large onion, chopped 1/4 cup olive oil 8 ounces borage, escarole, or other leafy green vegetable, trimmed, rinsed, and cut into1-inch pieces Salt and freshly ground black pepper About 2 cups Italian bread cut into bite-size cubes Instructions: Place the chickpeas and both beans in a large bowl, add water to cover by several inches, and refrigerate for several hours or overnight; drain. In a large pot, combine the chickpeas and beans, add cold water to cover by 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1 hour, adding more water if needed. Add the lentils, split peas, fennel, tomatoes, onion, olive oil, and water to cover as necessary. Cook for 1 hour more. Add the greens and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 30 minutes, or until the soup is thick and all of the legumes are tender. (The fava beans and split peas will break apart and thicken the soup.) Just before serving, heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the bread cubes with the oil and spread them in a single layer in a roasting pan.

Drain, rinse and place in a large saucepan and cover with 2 quarts water. Add the baking soda and bring to a boil. Cook until the beans are firm but tender, about 1 hour. (Garbanzo beans can be tricky and can require as much as 2 hours to cook so keep testing them. You want the beans tender but not mushy). Drain and cover with cool water. Agitate the beans to remove as many of the skins as possible. They will separate and float to the surface and can be removed with a small strainer (this will make the texture of your hummus nice and smooth). Drain the beans and allow them to cool completely. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat the red pepper with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil and place on a baking sheet. Bake until the outside is charred, 30 to 40 minutes. Alternatively grill the pepper until it is charred and soft. Place the pepper in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow the skin to steam off, about 15 minutes or until cool enough to handle. Once the pepper has cooled, remove the skin, stem and seeds and coarsely chop. Place the roasted red pepper, garlic, tahini, lemon juice, hot sauce, salt, cumin, black pepper, 3 cups of garbanzo beans and the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a food processor and process until creamy, 5 to 7 minutes. To serve, drizzle with olive oil and top with the crumbled feta cheese if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 35176,&quot;Fried Green Tomato Stack with Kentucky Tomme on a Fresh Tomato Concasse, Topped with Baby Arugula, Garnished with Nasturtium Flowers 4 large tomatoes, ripe (suggest one Black Russian, one Green Zebra, one Lemon Boy, and 1 red Better Boy; if available) 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 4 large green tomatoes 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 3/4 cup stone-ground white cornmeal 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup bacon fat 1/4 pound Kentucky Tomme (This cheese is a firm, highly flavored goat cheese from Judy Shad&#39;s Capriole Farm in southern Indiana. Can substitute with Swiss gruyere.) Micro-Greens, for garnish Instructions: Tomato Concasse: Blanch tomatoes briefly in boiling water to loosen the skins, then peel, seed and juice them. Dice the tomato flesh. Add chives, salt, and white pepper. Fried Green Tomatoes: Tomatoes that are showing a little pink coloration amid the green, as they just begin to turn red, are thought to have the best flavor. Slice them, skin on, so that you have 3 (1/4-inch) slices from each. Sprinkle the slices with a mixture of kosher salt, sugar, and black pepper. For the coating, mix together the best stone-ground white cornmeal you can find (Weisenberger Mills cornmeal is excellent), and flour. Dip the seasoned tomato slices in the cornmeal mixture. Film a heavy skillet (in Kentucky, a black cast iron skillet is favored) with a generous amount of bacon fat. (Have more bacon fat ready to add to the skillet if the tomatoes absorb too much. If you&#39;ve dietary qualms about this, use half bacon fat and half canola oil. For the saute, any kind of fat or oil will do, but the bacon clearly gives the best and most authentic taste.) Heat the oil until fairly hot, but not quite smoking. Fry the coated tomatoes approximately 2 to 3 minutes on each side, being sure not to crowd the skillet. Drain the slices on paper towels, and keep warm in a very low oven. To assemble: Slice cheese into very thin slices. Make sure the fried green tomatoes are still very warm (you may want to slightly increase the oven temperature at the last minute to make sure). On each of 4 warmed plates, spoon out a thin layer of the tomato concasse in a circle that will extend beyond the tomato stack. Place a tomato slice on each plate, and cover (overlapping just a bit) with the thin cheese slices; place another tomato slice on each, and repeat the cheese placement; top each with the remaining slices. Do this as quickly as you can so that the cheese melts just slightly (you may place the plates briefly back in the oven to do this, but guard against the tomato crusts becoming soggy). When ready to serve, top each stack with micro-greens (we like baby arugula for this extra taste treat), and garnish the plates with nasturtium flowers, adding the piquant taste of watercress to the dish. (If you don&#39;t have nasturtium flowers, you might dot the plate with droplets of reduced balsamic vinegar.) Serve at once. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 35177,&quot;Panzanella Bread Salad Handful of fresh basil 4 slices of day-old sourdough bread, cubed 1/2 cup/125 ml of olive oil 12 cherry tomatoes, halved Handful of dandelions 1 red bell pepper, charred, peeled and diced 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced 8 capers berries 1 clove garlic, smashed 3 or 4 large tomatoes, halved 1/2 pound/225 g of asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces 1 tablespoon/15 ml butter 15 medium-size shrimp, deveined but tails intact Salt and freshly ground pepper 1 burrata cheese, mozzarella di buffalo, or feta cheese Instructions: Preheat oven at 350 degrees F/200 degrees C. Place the sourdough bread on a parchment paper-lined baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes or until the bread is golden brown.<br> Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix together the dandelions, fresh basil, cherry tomatoes, roasted pepper, red onion, and caper berries. Keep aside in the refrigerator.<br> Chop a garlic clove in half, and rub it on the bottom and sides of a large bowl. While the croutons are still hot, add them into the bowl to infuse the garlic flavor. Squeeze the tomato halves over the croutons to allow their juices to mix in. Once the tomatoes have been juiced, cut up the remainder of the tomatoes and toss in with the crouton mixture. Drizzle with olive oil and let it rest at room temperature for 2 hours for the bread to soak all the juices from the tomatoes and olive oil.<br> In a pan on medium-high heat, saute the asparagus in butter for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the pan and toss it with the croutons. Add the shrimp to the same pan and saute in olive oil for 1 minute, on each side. Add the garlic. Season with salt and pepper.<br> Combine the croutons and asparagus with the dandelion salad.<br> For serving: Cut the burrata cheese on the serving plate, season with salt and pepper. Pile the panzanella salad and the garlic shrimp on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 35178,&quot;Charred Romaine Spears with Grilled Bison NY Strip and BBQ Vinaigrette ? cup of your favorite BBQ sauce ? cup extra virgin olive oil ? cup red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 bunch of radishes 2 cucumbers 1 avocado ? medium red onion, thinly sliced 4 oz. of blue cheese, crumbled 2 large heads of Romaine lettuce cut in 1/2 lengthwise 2 (10 oz.) Bison NY Strip Steaks 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil ? teaspoon garlic powder ? teaspoon black pepper ? teaspoon sea salt Instructions: These first two steps can be prepared ahead of time and will keep in the refrigerator for 1-2 days until you are ready to grill. Keep all of the ingredients separate. If you do these steps ahead, do not cut the avocado until you are ready to eat because it will oxidize and turn brown. To make BBQ Vinaigrette: Combine BBQ sauce, olive oil, vinegar, garlic and pepper. Wisk to combine and set aside. For Salad Garnishes: Cut radishes into quarters. Cut cucumbers into 2 inch julienne strips. Remove pit and skin of avocado then cut into thick slices or chunks. Thinly slice ? of a medium red onion and crumble the blue cheese. To Make Grilled Lettuce Spears and the NY Strip Steaks: Preheat grill on high for 15-20 minutes. Brush the flat side of the romaine spears liberally with the BBQ vinaigrette and place on grill BBQ side down for 5-6 minutes. Remove immediately to prevent too much charring and return to refrigerator to keep cold. Toss NY strips in 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, pepper and sea salt. Char on grill 4 minutes the first side, and 3 minutes on the second side or until you can see the juices from the steak coming to the surface. Remove from the grill immediately and place on a platter to rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing. Assemble the salad with the garnishes and dress the romaine with additional BBQ vinaigrette if needed. Slice the NY strips thinly just before serving.

Spread the walnuts on a baking sheet and toast, tossing once, until fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli and cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer the cooked broccoli to an ice bath and let cool, about 3 minutes. Remove from the ice bath and drain well. Transfer the broccoli to a food processor. Add the garlic, walnuts, honey, lemon zest, lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt and process until finely chopped. With the machine running, gradually pour in the olive oil. Transfer the pesto to a small bowl and stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Cover and set aside. For the sandwich: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the bread until toasted and golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Season the chicken cutlets with the pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt and drizzle with the olive oil. Place the cutlets on the grill pan and cook until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Squeeze the lemon juice over the cooked chicken while it is still on the grill pan. Remove the chicken to a plate. To assemble the sandwiches, spread about 1 tablespoon of the pesto on each slice of bread. Place 2 pieces of tomato on 4 of the slices. Top the tomatoes with the chicken cutlets and the remaining slices of bread. Cut each sandwich in half to serve. Cook&#39;s Note: The pesto makes more than enough for the sandwiches.

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until al dente, about 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.<br> Meanwhile, add the crackers to a large bowl and crush into fine crumbs with the back of a measuring cup. Add the breadcrumbs and mix to combine. Coat a 6-cavity nonstick doughnut pan with nonstick spray. Add half of the breadcrumb mixture to the cavities, tilting the pan and gently tapping it to spread around the breadcrumbs so they cover as much of each cavity as possible. It&#39;s okay if a few extra breadcrumbs remain at the bottom of each cavity.<br> Heat the half-and-half and cayenne in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the mixture just comes to a simmer. Continue to simmer over medium-low heat until the half-and-half is reduced by a little more than half, about 2 minutes. Add the cream cheese and stir until melted. Stir in the Cheddar until all of the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Add the macaroni to the saucepan and stir to combine. Season with salt if needed.<br> Carefully fill each doughnut pan cavity halfway with the macaroni and cheese. Top each with a layer of mozzarella slices, then the remaining macaroni and cheese. Evenly cover each with the remaining breadcrumb mixture and gently pack down each ring with your fingertips. Lightly spray the top of each with nonstick spray.<br> Bake until the cheese is bubbly and the breadcrumbs are lightly browned and crispy, 7 to 9 minutes. Let rest in the molds until the macaroni and cheese mixture stays together in a ring when you lift it out with the help of a butter knife, 5 to 10 minutes.

Combine the oats, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, flax seeds, poppy seeds and 2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl and stir to combine with a rubber spatula. Add the olive oil, maple syrup and hot water and stir to incorporate. Allow the mixture to rest for 15 minutes.<br> Stir the mixture to ensure any residual liquid on the bottom is evenly dispersed and then pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Place a second piece of parchment on top and then use the palms of your hands to press and spread the mixture into an even layer (1/8 to 1/4 inch thick), making sure to spread all the way to edges of the pan (gently running a small offset spatula over the parchment also helps to spread the mixture evenly). Remove the top piece of parchment and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bake until the edges are slightly golden brown and beginning to pull away from the sides of the baking sheet, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cut into 24 pieces (each 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches) using a pizza cutter or sharp knife (see Cook\\u2019s Note).

With a slotted spoon remove mushrooms and scallions to a utility platter and keep covered (with aluminum foil or a lid) in a warm place. (Leave room on the platter for the chicken.) Add seasoned chicken to the skillet, searing all sides. Deglaze the pan with white wine, let sizzle for a few minutes and spoon the wine and juices over the chicken to coat, and then cover pan and transfer to oven. Bake until fork tender, about 25 minutes. While the chicken is in the oven, heat the mushroom soup in a small saucepan and whisk in demi-glace to give it additional flavor. Cover and let simmer over low heat. Remove chicken from oven (be sure to use an oven mitt - the handle on that pan will be hot!) and use tongs to transfer the chicken to the utility platter (alongside the mushroom mixture). Cover and keep warm. Add about 1/2 cup water to the pan in which the chicken was baking and stir to loosen the browned bits of flavor on the bottom. Place a strainer over the pot of mushroom soup and demi-glace and (still using an oven mitt for that hot handle) pour the juice from the chicken pan through the strainer into the sauce.

In a large saute pan, heat the oil. Add the onion, garlic, and pepper and saute. When they&#39;re soft, add the oregano, tomato sauce, raisins, and chopped olives. This should be at medium heat from now on. Add the ground beef. Pour the wine over the beef mixture and cover to cook through. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Once its almost cooked, uncover, and let dry up to a juicy but dry look to it. Never use if it is runny. That&#39;s the trick. Sift the flour with the baking powder and the salt. Pour this into a large bowl. Pour in the rest of the ingredients. Work this with a fork, trying to bring together all the ingredients but never beating or mixing. Once it?s all \\together\\ and not sticky...you&#39;re ready to make Empanadillas. ASSEMBLING THE EMPANADILLAS: Prepare your table by spreading some flour to keep the mixture from sticking. You will need a roller, a knife and a fork. Your filling should be at hand. Take a small amount of the flour mixture (a ball that can fit in your hand) and you roll it out in the shape of a plate to a thickness of about 1/8-inch. Take a spoonful of the filling and place it in the middle half of the pastry and fold the top over the filling to look like a half moon. Seal the inside of the pastry by wetting your fingers with water and rubbing the border of the half moon. Take a knife and cut a perfect pastry half-moon. Now take the fork and press down the borders of the circular shape to seal. Fry the half moon in hot oil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha]</li></ol><p>&quot; 35205,&quot;Bruschetta with White Beans, Sun-dried Tomatoes and Basil 3/4 cup cannelloni beans 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 garlic clove, peeled 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 small baguette, sliced into thick pieces 1 tablespoon thinly sliced garlic, plus 1 garlic clove, peeled, for coating bread 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes 8 to 10 basil leaves 1/3 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained and sliced 1/4-inch thick 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley Lemon juice Salt and fresh black pepper 2 ounces ricotta salata cheese, grated large Instructions: Rinse the beans well and then put in a 1-quart saucepan. Cover with water to 1-inch over the top of the beans. On medium-high heat, bring to a boil. Immediately take the pot away from the burner, cover and hold for 1 hour. Change the water; add half of the extra-virgin olive oil, 1 garlic clove and the bay leaf. Cook beans on low. Simmer for about 40 minutes or until tender. During last 10 minutes, add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in carefully. Remove from heat and hold in the saucepan with the cooking liquid until cool. This may be done 1 to 2 days before serving, and kept refrigerated. For the bruschetta topping: Preheat a grill or stove-top grill pan. Grill the bread on both sides until crispy. Be careful on high heat as bread burns easily. While bread is grilling, in a saute pan on medium heat, toast the sliced garlic in the olive oil. When it is light golden, add the chili flakes, cook for 10 seconds and then add the basil leaves. Do this carefully, as the basil may spatter some oil. With a slotted spoon, transfer the beans to the pan. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the bean cooking liquid (or liquid from canned beans) and mix all together. Hold warm. Adjust consistency, as necessary, with the bean liquid, a little at a time. When the basil leaves are wilted, remove mixture from the heat. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and chopped parsley. Toss to combine and adjust the seasoning with lemon juice, to taste, and salt and pepper. Lightly swipe the remaining garlic clove on 1 side of the bread. Arrange the toasted bruschetta on a serving platter and drizzle with the remaining extra-virgin olive oil. Top each piece with some of the tomato-bean mixture, then evenly divide the ricotta salata over the mixture. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 35206,&quot;Molded Chicken Cocoa butter, melted Various powdered food coloring 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered 48 ounces white chocolate, tempered Special Equipment, see source link for information: Chicken mold Instructions: Make some \\paint\\ by mixing the cocoa butter and a small amount of powdered food coloring. Make a few colors. It will be easier if you use yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint the inside of the mold, applying color where you are inspired to do so (eyes, beak, etc.). Using the paintbrush, very lightly paint the bittersweet chocolate into the feathers of the chicken. Using a ladle, fill the mold with white chocolate. When it is full, empty the excess chocolate back into the bowl. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated. Wipe the lip of the plastic mold clean and place the mold upside down on a wire rack over a sheet pan. Repeat with the other half of the mold. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip of the mold clean again with a paring knife. It is important to do this because when the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate harden. If the chocolate is properly tempered, it will easily release from the mold. To unmold, rest your thumbs on the outside, and place your first two fingers on the inside and gently begin to lift the chocolate from the mold. Do not press or pull too hard, or you will break it. You will need to apply this lifting pressure to each side to loosen the chocolate from the mold. Glue the 2 halves of the chicken together with melted chocolate. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 35207,&quot;Shrimp Po\\u2019Boy 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 cup cornmeal 1 tablespoon salt-free Cajun seasoning<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 cups whole milk 1 teaspoon hot sauce (preferably Louisiana-style) 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled, deveined and patted dry Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons minced dill pickles 2 tablespoons minced shallot or sweet onion 2 teaspoons hot sauce (preferably Louisiana- style), plus more for serving Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 French-bread rolls, split Shredded lettuce and sliced tomatoes, for serving Instructions: Make the shrimp: Whisk the flour, cornmeal, Cajun seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl.

Add the oil and sausage and cook, stirring often and breaking apart the sausage with the back of a wooden spoon, until beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Add the onion, carrot and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant and the vegetables are almost cooked through, about 4 minutes. Deglaze with the wine, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato puree and cheese rind. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Season the water generously with salt. Add the Pappardelle and cook until the pasta is floating and barely al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain well. Remove and discard the Parmesan rind from the sauce. Add the pasta to the sauce and sprinkle the bare pasta with the Parmesan cheese and basil. Add 1/2 cup pasta water and toss well to coat, adding more pasta water as needed to maintain a light sauce. Serve with more Parmesan cheese on top if desired. In a large bowl, combine the 00 and semolina flours and salt and form a well. Add the egg and yolks to the center of the well. Using a fork, slowly start to incorporate the flour into the eggs to form a rough dough. You may add a splash of water if the dough is too dry or a dusting of flour if it is too wet. Lightly flour a smooth work surface and pour the dough onto the flour. Knead the dough until it springs back when you press a finger into it, 10 to 12 minutes. Flatten the dough into an even square. Wrap the dough well in plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Cut the dough into 3 pieces. Set up a pasta roller according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions and set it at the widest setting. Dust one section of the dough with semolina flour and press firmly to flatten the dough to 1/4 inch. Roll the dough through the machine on the widest setting. Fold the pasta dough in thirds and dust the outside with flour. Send it through the widest setting again. Reduce the setting to the next setting. Send the dough through the machine. Fold it in thirds once again and send through the setting one more time. Continue sending the dough through the machine, reducing the setting each time, until the desired thickness is reached, about 1/8 inch. Lay the sheet out on the counter and dust with flour. Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut strips 1 inch by 10 inches. Dust the strips with more flour. Continue with the remaining dough. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 35221,&quot;Cream-Filled Puff Pastries Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking sheet and molds 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (from a 17.3-ounce package), thawed in the fridge 12 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for garnish 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup blackberry preserves<br> Blackberries, for garnish<br> Fresh mint leaves, for garnish<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Add the water and mix with the dough hook until a smooth dough forms. Divide the dough into 2 balls. Wrap in plastic and rest for 30 minutes. Cut each ball into 4 planks. Flatten out a plank with your palms and roll the dough to number 6 on a pasta machine. Fold the dough into a trifold and turn so that the folded sides are on the sides of the dough and the open sides are the front and back of the dough. Roll the dough to number 3 on the machine. Coat the dough with cornstarch and cut into square pieces. Repeat with the remaining dough. For the filling: To prepare the sofrito, combine the apple, ginger and onion in a pan with a little oil and sweat until translucent. Cool in a thin layer. Prepare the pork mixture: Combine the pork, stock, fatback, sesame oil, tamari, white pepper, mushroom seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt and sofrito in a mixing bowl and mix by hand in the same direction until the texture is slightly bouncy/tacky. Build the dumplings: Place about 1 tablespoon of pork into the center of each dumpling wrapper, wet the edges and fold to desired shape; store on parchment-lined sheet tray uncovered in the fridge. When ready to cook, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, add the dumplings and cook 4 minutes. For the fragrant soy and dumpling tare: To make the fragrant soy, combine the cinnamon stick, orange peel, star anise, white peppercorns and licorice in a small pan and toast until fragrant. Add to a pot with the soy, water and brown sugar and bring to a simmer. Let steep for 10 minutes, then strain the liquid. Pour the fragrant soy back into the pot. Add the black vinegar, salt and mushroom MSG to the fragrant soy and heat over high heat, stirring, until it comes to a boil and the ingredients are incorporated together. For the fragrant Sichuan chili oil: Fry the ginger, Sichuan peppercorns, guajillo chiles, arbol chiles, star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, ginger, scallion, red onion, cardamom, orange peel and bay leaf in the oil for 30 to 45 minutes at 275 to 300 degrees F. (Do not go over 350 degrees F.). Strain the oil, discard the spices and vegetables, add the chili flake and salt and whisk. Once the temperature drops to 225 to 250 degrees F, add the chili powder and let sit until cool. Then strain through a fine filter. For the chili crisp: Starting from cold oil in a pot, add the shallots and bring it up to 300 degrees F, stirring regularly until golden. Scoop ALL of them out with a spider or slotted spoon. Next, add the ginger and cook, stirring often, until golden and crispy; remove ALL with a spider. Do the same with the garlic, and then all the chiles together. Remove the oil from the heat, add the star anise and cardamom and let cool down. Strain the oil through a fine filter. Reserve all the solids (discard the star anise and cardamom). Let the oil cool down naturally. Meanwhile, toast and grind the black pepper, cumin and Sichuan pepper in a blender or spice grinder. Grind the sugar, salt and mushroom seasoning as well. Once the oil is cool, combine the reserved solids and ground spices in the food processor. Stream in the oil until the desired consistency is reached. For serving: To assemble, pan-fry the dumplings with the cup sides down in the oil. Once they have browned a bit on the edges, add 2 tablespoon water and cover so that the top side steams out. Once the popping in your pan has calmed down, all the water has evaporated and it is safe to take the lid off. Remove the dumplings and arrange on a plate. First, top the dumplings with the tare, and then the fragrant Sichuan chili oil, and then the chili crisp.

Flip again and cook for 2 minutes. Flip once more and add 4 tablespoons of the butter and the thyme and garlic. Let cook, undisturbed, until the butter stops foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Tilt the pan slightly so the butter pools and spoon it over the steaks. Continue to cook the steaks, basting constantly, until they are medium rare and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 118 degrees F, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the steaks to a plate to rest. Discard the garlic, thyme and fat from the skillet, but do not wipe out the browned bits.<br> Place the same skillet over medium heat and add the shallots and 1 tablespoon butter. Cook, scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon, until softened, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the brandy. Return the skillet to the heat and continue to cook over medium until the skillet is dry, being careful as it may ignite, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook until the liquid reduces by half, about 3 minutes. Add the beef stock and bring to a boil. Whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Add salt and pepper to taste.<br> To serve, slice the steak, spoon the sauce over the top and sprinkle with the chives.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 35232,&quot;Apple and Dried Fruit Lattice Pie 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 large egg, beaten 1 14-ounce box refrigerated pie dough All-purpose flour, for dusting 2 pounds crisp apples (such as Granny Smith or Gala) 1/2 cup golden raisins 1 cup pitted dried plums 1 cup dried figs 1/2 cup dried cherries 1/3 cup sugar 1 tablespoon instant tapioca 2 teaspoons orange-flavored liqueur or apple brandy 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out 1 piece of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate; chill until ready to use. Make the filling: Peel and chop the apples.

Resting on the cut side slice thinly into half circles. Measure out 6 cups. Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat; when foam subsides add the onions. Cover and cook, over medium low heat, until wilted, about 15 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking over medium heat, stirring often and adjusting heat so that onions brown slowly, until the onions are a dark golden brown and very tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in the chopped thyme, salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Select 6 (5-ounce) custard cups; brush generously with softened butter. Arrange in a 13 by 9-inch baking pan. Set a kettle of water on to boil. Combine the milk and cream in a saucepan and heat until small bubbles appear around the edges. In a large bowl whisk the eggs and egg yolks until blended. Slowly add the hot milk, whisking gently until blended. Place a strainer over a large measuring cup with a pouring spout and strain the custard. Using a tongs distribute distribute the Sauteed onions evenly among the 6 custard cups (they should be about 1/4 filled). Add the custard, distributing evenly. Run a knife through the custards so that the custard will seep through the layer of onion. Place the baking pan in the oven and carefully pour hot water into the pan until it is 1-inch up sides of the cups. Bake until custards are lightly browned and set, about 25 minutes.

If you are using a gas grill you want to set it to medium-high heat. If you are using charcoal the right time to start the peppers will probably be about 5 minutes after all the coals are glowing. If the heat is too hot, the peppers will burn and not cook properly.<br> Grill the peppers and turn them every few minutes for even cooking. They are done when the pepper starts to collapse on itself and is soft to the touch. Remove immediately, and place in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap. The steam will pull the skin away from the flesh and they will be much easier to peel.<br> Meanwhile, in a large saute pan over high heat, heat 2 tablespoons canola oil. Add the shallots and ginger and cook until they develop a nice deep brown. Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes. Next, add the chorizo and cook until browned and crumbly. Add the sweet soy, fish sauce, and basil. Turn heat down to medium and cook for another 5 minutes. Turn the mixture out onto a cookie sheet to cool.<br> Take a grilled pepper and lay it flat on a cutting board. Peel down from the top to where the seed pod ends. Cut the pepper right at that point. It should be about half way down the pepper. Put the tip to the side. Slice off the pepper top, just the very top and pull the stem to remove the entire seed pod along with the stem. From the flesh of the pepper, peel away that thin plastic like membrane, being careful not to tear the pepper itself. Repeat with all of the peppers. Remove the seed pods and stems from the pepper tops and dice up the flesh.<br> In a large bowl, whisk together the peanuts, shallots, canola oil, lime juice, fish sauce, and honey along with the chopped pepper tops.<br> Stuff each pepper with the chorizo mixture. You can use as much or as little stuffing as you want just try not to rip the pepper. Once you stuff them all, you can serve them right away or reheat them on the grill. To serve, spoon the vinaigrette over the peppers. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Tempranillo]&quot; 35248,&quot;Charlie Trotter&#39;s Salmon with Olympia Oysters, Hijiki Seaweed, and Ginger-Shiso-Mirin Broth 1 tablespoon dried hijiki seaweed 2 teaspoon grapeseed oil 4 (2 ounces) salmon pieces, skin on Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup leeks, cut into rings 1 tablespoon preserved ginger 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 3 tablespoons mirin 2/3 cup fish stock 28 Olympia oysters 1 tablespoon shiso Instructions: Soak the hijiki seaweed in cold water for 20 minutes.

Add the wings and refrigerate for 6 hours. For the ham hock gravy: Combine the ham hocks and 2 quarts water in a large pot, bring to a simmer and cook for 3 hours. Add the celery, carrot and onion and simmer for 1 more hour. Strain the stock and keep the ham hocks. Pick the meat off the ham hocks and reserve for the gravy. Return the stock to the pot, bring to a boil and cook until reduced to 1 quart, about 30 minutes. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour to make a roux. Cook the roux, stirring, until it gets a nice nutty brown color, about 5 minutes. Slowly whisk the reduced stock into the roux to avoid lumps. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring regularly, for 5 minutes. Add the ham hock meat and heavy cream, season with salt and pepper and continue to simmer for 15 minutes more. For the waffle batter: Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs and melted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk to combine. Some lumps in the batter are acceptable but not too many. Preheat a Belgian-waffle iron and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the batter into the center of the waffle iron (depending on the size of the waffle iron) and close. Cook until the waffle is golden brown, 3 to 6 minutes, depending on the iron. Repeat with the remaining batter. For the wing breading: Preheat the oil to 325 degrees F in a deep pot or deep fryer. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a shallow bowl or plate.

In a large bowl, combine bread crumbs, eggs, milk, 1/2 cup of the Romano and the parsley, and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. Add beef and gently combine, being careful not to overwork the meat. Shape into bite-size meatballs. Roll each meatball in flour to coat, shaking off excess. In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain pasta in a colander and set aside. If not using immediately, cover top with plastic wrap so that pasta does not dry out. Do not rinse pasta with water since you want to retain the pasta&#39;s natural starches so that the sauce will cling to the ziti. In a large skillet heat the oil over medium-high heat. When almost smoking, add meatballs in batches and without moving or turning the meat, allow it to brown for about 3 minutes. Turn meatballs and brown other side. Continue to cook until all sides are golden brown. Remove meatballs to a plate. In a large bowl, combine the tomato sauce and ricotta and mix well. Add the cooked ziti and meatballs and toss gently.

Transfer to a medium bowl and stir in the pizza sauce. Let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Coat the back of a baking sheet with cooking spray. Unroll both cans of crescent dough and separate unto 16 triangles. Put a 5-inch ramekin in the center of the prepared baking sheet. Arrange the triangles in a ring around the ramekin so the short sides of the dough are touching the ramekin, overlapping slightly, and the pointed ends are facing outward (it should look like a giant sun).<br> Spoon the sausage mixture over the short ends of the triangles closest to the ramekin. Cover the sausage with the ham slices. Top the ham with the pepperoni and then cover pepperoni with cheese slices. Remove the ramekin. Take hold of the pointed end of one of the triangles and fold it up and over the filling, tucking the tip under the bottom edge of dough to secure (the dough will not cover the filling completely).

Swirl the star anise, cloves, fructis amomi seed, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, coriander, fennel seeds and cardamom around in the skillet until lightly toasty and fragrant. Add to the stockpot. Cover with 2 gallons water. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours. Strain through a fine colander into another pot. Add the brisket drippings and fish sauce. Adjust with salt and pepper to taste. Your broth is now ready. For the pho assembly: Bring pho broth to a rolling boil. Place a handful of rice noodles in each of 10 to 12 soup bowls. Lay a few slices of smoked brisket over the rice noodles. Ladle 2 to 3 cups boiling broth over each portion of brisket and noodles. Put some freshly grated ginger, toasted sesame oil and a small handful of very thinly sliced white onion over each portion. Sprinkle fresh green onions on top. Serve with each portion with its own aromatic plate of the following: Thai basil, 3 slices red radish, 3 slices jalapeno, 1/4 cup bean sprouts, 1/4 cup cilantro, a ramekin with 1 tablespoon cl sambal, a ramekin with 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce and a lime wedge. Light some charcoal in a smoker until coals are red. Blend together the kosher salt, coarse black pepper, chili powder and granulated garlic in a small bowl with a whisk. Trim brisket fat to a 1/4 inch with a sharp boning knife. Sprinkle seasoning blend all over the brisket. Add a few hickory chunks and more charcoal to the smoker. Bring temperature up to 265 degrees F. Use a wave affect by adding unlit coals to the other side of the burning charcoal continuously throughout the process. This will keep a steady temperature through the cooking process. Add 10 chunks charcoal and 2 chunks wood every 30 to 45 minutes. Place the brisket in the smoker and let cook, 3 hours. Spritz the brisket with apple cider vinegar, then continue to cook and spritz once an hour. Wrap the brisket tightly with butcher paper when it reaches 160 to 170 degrees F, at the eighth or ninth hour. Bring the smoker temperature down to 225 degrees F. Continue to cook until the brisket reaches 206 degrees F, 1 to 6 hours more. Let brisket rest for 1 hour at least. Your brisket is now ready for slicing! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz, Tempranillo]&quot; 35284,&quot;Rib of Beef 4-pound rib roast, with 2 ribs, preferably aged 24 days Kosher salt Horseradish Cream, recipe follows 1/4 cup freshly grated horseradish 1/4 cup creme fraiche 1/2 lemon, juiced Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Let the beef sit at room temperature for about 1 hour.

Place the steak in a zip-top bag, add the marinade and rub the flank steak all over. Let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature to marinate and to allow the steak to come to room temperature. While the steak marinates, place the potatoes in a medium pot, add a generous pinch of salt and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender and easily pierced with the tip of a knife, about 15 minutes. Add the green beans to the water in the last 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Preheat the grill over medium heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the vinegar with the mustard, shallots, honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Grill the steak, flipping once, until the internal temperature reads about 130 degrees F, 7 to 8 minutes per side. Let rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes, and then thinly slice across the grain. To serve, toss the baby spinach with 2 tablespoons of the dressing and divide among 4 plates. Evenly top with the potatoes, green beans, olives, tomatoes and sliced steak.

With the mixer still running, add the butter and beat it on the lowest speed for 5 minutes, until the mixture resembles damp cornmeal. Add the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla and beat the mixture on high until the dough coats the sides of the bowl. Add the peanut butter and mix just to combine it. Transfer the dough to a glass bowl, cover it, and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours for the best results. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat mats. Spoon out a heaping tablespoon-size dollop of the dough (45 g) and roll it between your hands to form a ball. Pour 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar on a plate and shake to level it. Roll the balls in the sugar and set them on the lined baking sheets. Stagger the cookie portions, leaving 2 inches (5 cm) between each. Press a peanut half into the top of each ball of dough. Bake the cookies for 8 to 10 minutes, until they are golden. Let cool on the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. These cookies keep beautifully in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. The dough can be frozen, double-wrapped, for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35288,&quot;Blue Cheese Chicken Meatballs 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into chunks 2 eggs 1 tablespoon celery salt A few grinds freshly ground white pepper 1 cup panko breadcrumbs 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese Grapeseed oil, for cooking 2 cups flour Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 cups tomato juice 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons hot sauce (recommended: Tabasco) Pinch celery salt Few grinds white pepper Salt 1/4 cup grapeseed oil Instructions: For the meatballs: Place the chicken thighs, eggs, celery salt, and white pepper in a food processor. Pulse until the meat is ground but still a little bit chunky. Do not make a smooth paste! Transfer the chicken mixture to a bowl. Stir together the breadcrumbs and blue cheese until combined. Fill a small bowl with water. To form the meatballs, wet your hands a little and shape the mixture into 1-inch balls. Lay the meatballs on a sheet tray. Heat a large, deep pan over medium-high heat and add the oil to fill about 1/4-inch up the sides. Do not fill the pan completely with oil. Pour the flour into a shallow dish and season with salt and pepper. Roll each meatball in the flour to give it a light coating. When the oil is hot, add the meatballs and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Flip the meatballs halfway through cooking. You may have to cook them in batches if they don&#39;t fit in the pan, adding more oil if needed. Drain the cooked meatballs on a paper towel-lined plate. For the sauce: Combine the tomato juice, rice wine vinegar, hot sauce, celery salt, white pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the oil until well blended and slightly thickened. For serving: Transfer half the meatballs to a large bowl. Pour some of the sauce over top, just enough to coat the meatballs. Gently toss the meatballs around to coat in the sauce. Using tongs, transfer the meatballs to serving plate and insert a toothpick. Repeat with remaining meatballs.

Line another baking sheet with parchment. Dust a work surface with flour, and roll the puff pastry sheet out into a 10-by-15-inch rectangle. Transfer the pastry to the prepared baking sheet. Measure a half-inch border around it, and lightly score the border with a knife (don&#39;t cut all the way through). Prick the pastry inside the border all over with a fork (don&#39;t prick the border). Brush the pastry all over with the egg, put the baking sheet with the pastry on it on top of the preheated baking stone, and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes. If you find that the pastry has puffed up in some places, use the bottom of a measuring cup or glass to press it down. Let the pastry cool completely on the baking sheet. (The cooled pastry can be wrapped and stored at room temperature for 1 day.) Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and a large pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and deeply golden, about 10 minutes. Add the vinegar, and stir until it has been completely absorbed. Remove the skillet from the heat, and let the caramelized onions cool completely. (They can be refrigerated for 1 day.) Scatter the fontina all over the pastry within the border. Top with the caramelized onions, figs and walnuts. Sprinkle the whole tart with the feta, thyme and some salt and pepper. Drizzle all over with oil. Return the tart on the baking sheet to the oven, putting it on the preheated baking stone. Bake until the fontina melts, 10 to 15 minutes.

The water should go cloudy. Drain, and wash again in fresh water. Repeat this process until the water runs clear (4 to 5 times). Fill the bowl with fresh water and let the rice soak about 30 minutes (this will give you nice long, delicate grains of rice). Drain, reserving 2 cups of the water for later. The grains should have fattened up a bit and turned opaque. In a small heavy-bottomed pot set over medium heat, add the oil and butter. Once the butter has melted and the foam has subsided, add the cumin seeds. They should sizzle when they hit the fat! Once the cumin seeds have darkened, add the asfoetida powder (this is an Indian trick said to prevent the less desirable after effects of the beans!). Stir, and then add the onions, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick and cloves. Sprinkle with a touch of salt to draw out some of the onion&#39;s moisture. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the Fresno cl and saute for 30 seconds. Add the rice - as soon as it hits the fat, it will release its loamy fragrance into your kitchen. Sheer bliss! Stir gently, because the grains are pretty fragile at this point. Cook, stirring frequently but gently, until the grains turn translucent again and don&#39;t clump together, 2 to 3 minutes. Each grain should be its own emancipated self! Add the black-eyed peas, water and salt. Bring to a full boil, turn down to a simmer and cook, partially covered, until the rice is cooked and fluffy, about 15 minutes. Turn the heat off, cover and allow to steam 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and serve! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 35308,&quot;Prosciutto-Wrapped Chicken Kebabs Vegetable oil, for the grill 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 24 pieces (about 1 1/2 inches each) 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon white or red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary 1 clove garlic, grated 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes Pinch of kosher salt 4 ounces Fontina cheese, cut into 24 cubes (about 1/2 inch each) 24 thin slices prosciutto (about 6 ounces) 1 pint grape tomatoes Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high and brush the grates with vegetable oil. Toss the chicken with the olive oil, vinegar, rosemary, garlic, red pepper flakes and salt in a large bowl. Place a cheese cube on a piece of chicken and wrap tightly with a slice of prosciutto. Repeat with the remaining cheese, chicken and prosciutto. Thread the chicken bundles onto eight 10-inch skewers along with the tomatoes. Grill the kebabs, covered, turning occasionally, until the prosciutto is crisp and the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 35309,&quot;Deep-Fried Turkey 1 12-pound turkey (thawed if frozen) 2 to 3 gallons vegetable oil 1/2 cup Cajun or Creole seasoning 1 tablespoon granulated onion Instructions: Remove the neck, giblets and any excess fat from the turkey; discard. Remove and discard the plastic pop-up thermometer. Rinse the turkey under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Refrigerate overnight, uncovered, to let the turkey dry. (It must be completely dry before frying, or the oil will splatter.) Fill a turkey fryer with the vegetable oil according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions and heat to 400 degrees F. Meanwhile, mix the Cajun seasoning and granulated onion in a small bowl. Rub the spice mixture inside the turkey cavity and all over the skin. Make sure the hole at the neck is open at least 2 inches so the oil can flow through the bird. Place the turkey in the drain basket, neck-end first, and slowly lower the basket into the hot oil until the turkey is completely submerged. Once the oil temperature climbs back up to 350 degrees F, start timing: Fry the turkey until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 180 degrees F, about 3 1/2 minutes per pound. (A 12-pound bird will take about 50 minutes from the time you lower it into the oil.) Carefully remove the basket from the oil and transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Let the turkey rest at least 30 minutes. Make sure that all of the oil has drained out of the cavity, then transfer to a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 35310,&quot;Chocolate Dream Brownies with Marshmallow Creme 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped 8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, plus 1 tablespoon for greasing pan.<br> 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1 heaping cup marshmallow creme<br> 1 cup sugar<br> 2 eggs<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla<br> 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> Pinch salt<br> 1/4 cup chocolate chips<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line two 12-cup standard muffin tins with paper cupcake liners.<br> Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Warm the grape jelly in the microwave until loosened, 20 to 30 seconds, and whisk until smooth. Set aside.<br> Beat together the sugar and eggs in another medium bowl with an electric mixer until light and foamy, about 2 minutes. While beating, gradually pour in the butter and then the vanilla.<br> While mixing slowly, add half the dry ingredients and then all of the milk. Follow with the rest of the dry ingredients, taking care not to over mix the batter.<br> Remove 2 cups of the batter and stir in the grape jelly. Evenly fill the liners about two-thirds full, alternating with yellow and grape batter.<br> Bake until a tester inserted in the center of the cupcakes comes out clean and the tops spring back lightly to the touch, 20 to 22 minutes. Place the pan on a rack to cool for 10 minutes, and then remove the cupcakes to the rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.<br> For the frosting: Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl until fluffy and combined. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until smooth and fluffy. Beat in the milk one tablespoon at a time until the frosting has a nice spreadable consistency. Add the crushed cookies and continue to beat until any large chunks are crushed to smaller bits and the frosting has a speckled, greyish look.<br> For the decorations: Arrange the cupcakes in 4 rows on a large serving plate or cutting board. Fit a marshmallow between each cupcake, 5 marshmallows per row, to fill in the gaps between the cupcakes. Spread the frosting over the whole rectangle so it looks like one cake. Sprinkle with the cookie crumbs and black decorating sugar.<br> To make the tombstones: Use the black decorating icing and a small round tip to write \\RIP\\ or other one-word epitaphs on the top half of the oval sandwich cookies and stick into the cupcakes randomly around the graveyard.<br> To make the ghosts: Remove two-thirds of the tube of marzipan and place between 2 sheets of wax paper or parchment. Roll about 1/8-inch thick and cut into 3 rounds using a 4-inch biscuit cutter. You may need to gather and re-roll the scraps for all 3 rounds. Drape over the wrapped lollipops and stick into the cupcakes around the tombstone. Using the black decorating icing and the same round tip, dot eyes and a mouth on the ghosts.<br> To make the pumpkins and leaves: Divide the remaining marzipan into 4 small pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll in the orange sugar until coated and place around the graveyard. Use the black icing to pipe a small stem. Fit the tube of green decorating icing with a leaf or ribbon tip to dot bits of green grass poking through the dirt around the graveyard and pumpkins.<br> To make a border: Use 6 pieces of the licorice, trimming to fit, to make a border around the cake, leaving the middle of the front side open. Bend the seventh piece into an upside down \\U\\ and stick into 2 cupcakes in the front to make an arched gateway. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35313,&quot;Smoked Salmon and Dill Egg Salad Tea Sandwiches 6 eggs 2 ounces smoked salmon, finely chopped 2 teaspoons chopped dill 2 teaspoons nonpareil capers 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 14 slices sturdy white sandwich bread 1/4 cup chopped chives, for garnish Instructions: Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. Boil the eggs for exactly 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit 10 more minute before draining. Run under cold water and peel the eggs immediately - the shell will come off much more easily while the eggs are still wet and warm. Using a box grater, grate the eggs on the shredder side into a bowl. Add the salmon, dill, capers, 1/4 cup of the mayonnaise, salt and pepper. Mix well. Lay out 7 slices of the bread and spread 1/4 cup of the egg salad onto each slice. Cover with the remaining bread slices. Trim the crust off of all the sandwiches and cut each sandwich crosswise into four triangles. Spread the long side of each triangle with a little mayonnaise and dip each one into the chopped chives. Arrange decoratively on a platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35314,&quot;Sticky Onion Crunch Wings 3 pounds chicken wings, whole or separated Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Peanut or vegetable oil, for frying<br> 1/2 cup French-fried onions (I like French&#39;s), crushed<br> 1 cup hoisin sauce 1/2 cup pomegranate juice<br> 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar<br> 2 garlic cloves, grated or minced<br> 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish<br> 4 scallions (white and green parts), finely chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Put the wings on a baking sheet and season both sides with salt and pepper. Let stand at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours. To make the sauce, in a small saucepan, mix together the hoisin, pomegranate juice, brown sugar, garlic, horseradish, scallions, and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring, over medium-high heat. When the sauce starts to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt. In a deep heavy pot, Dutch oven, or deep fryer, fill with oil to a depth of about 6 inches, and heat to 360 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the wings; the oil temperature will settle at about 350 degrees ? try to maintain that temperature by adjusting the heat while you fry. Fry the wings until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Put some of the sauce in a large mixing bowl and toss the wings in batches, adding more sauce as needed, until completely coated. Put the onions into another large bowl, add the sauced wings in batches and toss to thoroughly coat. Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35315,&quot;Pickled Onions 2 large red onions, peeled and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon olive oil 3 cups red wine vinegar 1/4 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons sugar 6 whole black peppercorns 4 sprigs fresh thyme Garnish: 2 tablespoons finely chopped thyme Instructions: Saute the onions over low heat in 1 tablespoon of olive oil until soft. Place the vinegar, 1/4 cup of olive oil, sugar, peppercorns and thyme in a large noncorrosive saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the onions to the hot liquid and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and allow the onions to steep for at least 2 hours or overnight. (if storing overnight, place in a bowl and cover.) When ready to serve, drain the liquid and top with thyme. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35316,&quot;Mangalore Buns 1 medium very ripe banana 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon cane sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon toasted cumin seeds<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric<br> 2 tablespoons plus 1 pint plain full-fat Greek yogurt 1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br> Neutral oil, for frying (I use canola)<br> Flaky salt, to finish<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Peel the banana and drop into a large, wide bowl. Sprinkle with the kosher salt, then mash with a potato masher or a fork until mostly smooth. Add the cane sugar, cumin seeds, baking soda, turmeric and 2 tablespoons yogurt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the mashed banana and stir on low speed until the mixture is well combined. Add the flour, about a tablespoon at a time, mixing on low speed, until a dough forms. (You may need the whole cup, or you may not, depending on the size of your banana (there&#39;s a joke in there, but I&#39;m not touching it!). If your banana was large, then feel free to add more flour, one tablespoon at a time, until a smooth, soft dough forms and there are no longer any sticky bits around the rim of the bowl. If your dough is too dry, wet your palms ever so slightly and knead the dough. Now, place the ball of dough in the center of a large piece of plastic wrap and wrap securely. Allow to rest in the fridge 8 hours or up to overnight. Remove the dough from the fridge and let it come to room temperature. Fill a medium saucepan with oil and set over medium to medium-high heat until it reaches 350 degrees F or preheat a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F. Set the oven to the lowest temperature it can reach. Place a cooling rack on a baking sheet, then place it in the oven. Lightly flour your work surface, then turn out your dough. Separate into 10 equal balls. Sprinkle with flour if they are sticky. Roll each ball into a circle 3 to 4 inches wide, making sure they&#39;re of even thickness all the way around. Flap each circle between your hands, back and forth, to remove excess flour. Line a plate with several layers of paper towel. Drop one circle of dough into the oil. It will sink to the bottom, then quickly rise to the surface and start to puff up. To encourage it to puff up all the way around, push gently on the raised bubbles with a flat spatula. Once the bottom is golden brown (about 30 seconds), flip and cook the remaining side, about 45 seconds. Remove to the paper towel-lined plate, then carefully sprinkle with flaky salt. Place on the baking sheet in the oven and continue to fry the buns. Combine the remaining pint of Greek yogurt with the honey and a lot of freshly ground black pepper. Serve the buns immediately with the seasoned yogurt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 35317,&quot;Gingerbread Cutouts 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1 teaspoon ground ginger 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/3 cup molasses 1/3 cup superfine sugar 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar Instructions: Whisk the flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, allspice, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, molasses and superfine sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low; add the flour mixture in 2 batches and beat until just incorporated. Divide the dough in half, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes or overnight. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out shapes using 3-inch cookie cutters and arrange on 2 ungreased baking sheets. Gather the scraps and refrigerate until firm; reroll once to cut out more cookies. Refrigerate the cutouts until firm, about 10 minutes. Bake the cookies, switching the position of the pans halfway through, until the edges are just browned and set, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool 2 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the icing: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar with 1 tablespoon boiling water in a small bowl; add 1 teaspoon water if the icing is too thick. Transfer to a resealable plastic bag; snip off a small corner and pipe the icing onto the cookies. Let set, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35318,&quot;Grass Jelly Dessert One 14-ounce can unsweetened full-fat coconut milk 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk<br> 5 ice cubes<br> Kosher salt<br> One 19-ounce can grass jelly, cubed<br> 1 ripe large mango (or 2 champagne mangoes), peeled, pitted and cubed<br> 8 strawberries, hulled and diced<br> 1 cup cooked and cooled tapioca pearls, prepared according to package instructions (See Cook\\u2019s Note)<br> 1 pint vanilla, matcha or ube ice cream, optional Instructions: Whisk together the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, ice cubes and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl or 4-cup pitcher.

Transfer the bacon and rendered fat to a small bowl. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.<br> Peel the potatoes and grate them on the small holes of a box grater over a large bowl (keep all the liquid). Add the flour, egg and 1 tablespoon salt. Stir to combine; the batter should be thick but pourable (like really thick pancake batter). Put the bryndza cheese (or feta-yogurt mixture) in a large serving bowl and set near the boiling water.<br> Set a spaetzle maker or colander over the boiling water (make sure the bottom is not touching the water; remove some water if you need to). Add about a third of the batter to the spaetzle maker and push through into the water according to the equipment instructions. Alternatively, use a rubber spatula to push the batter through the perforations of the colander into the water. Boil the dumplings until firm and tender, about 3 minutes. Remove with a large slotted spoon or spider, shaking off excess water, and drop them onto the cheese in the bowl. Continue with the rest of the batter, making sure the water is back at a rolling boil before each batch.<br> Toss to coat the hot dumplings with the cheese (it will look slightly like risotto). Spoon the bacon with the rendered fat over the dumplings and scatter the scallions on top, if using.

Smash the anchovies into a paste with the back of your knife or a mortar and pestle. Remove the Italian sausage from its casing and add to a large bowl with the hamburger meat, smashed anchovies, onion, mint, garlic, Italian spice, salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients well. On a clean work surface, or a cutting board covered with plastic wrap, pour out the meat mixture and shape into a flat rectangle approximately the width of the loaf of bread and about 1 inch thick. Cook&#39;s note: You can make the rectangle a bit larger than the loaf of bread since the meat will shrink slightly during cooking. Cut the flattened hamburger in half, making 2 large patties for grilling. Place the patties on the preheated grill and cook until the ground meat reaches an internal temperature of 155 degrees F. To prepare the bread, first saute the garlic cloves and minced onion in olive oil until they soften, about 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cut the loaf in half horizontally through the center to create 2 long pieces, top and bottom halves of the loaf. Paint the inside of each piece of bread with the oil mixture, coating them well. Remove the burgers from the heat and hold on a covered plate. Place the 2 bread halves on the coals, painted side down, to toast. To serve, place the burger patties on half of the toasted bread, add the lettuce and tomato slices, if using, and then top with the other half of the bread and cut into 1- to 2-inch slices. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Valpolicella]&quot; 35324,&quot;Coconut Shrimp 5 large shrimp 3 tablespoons flour 1/2 egg 3 tablespoons beer Salt and pepper Sugar 1/2 cup shredded coconut 1 cup frying oil Instructions: Remove skin from shrimp, leave tails attached.

With the blender still running, add the vinegar, corn syrup, shallot and rosemary, 1 at a time, and pour the oil in a slow steady stream into the vinegar mixture very slowly to emulsify. Remove to a container and season with salt and pepper, to taste. For the spring greens: Tear the greens into bite-sized pieces, and remove the stems if using arugula. (Make sure greens are no longer wet from being rinsed.) Toss greens with Parmesan, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and set aside. For the filling: Heat the clarified butter over medium heat in a large saute pan. Add the onion and cook for about 15 minutes until translucent and beginning to caramelize, then add the portobellos and white mushrooms to the onions. Cook for another 10 minutes then reduce heat to low and add the tomatoes, chives, salt, and pepper, and allow flavors to integrate. For the vol-au-vent (tart pastry): Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out puff pastry dough, and using a 4-inch circle cutter (aka biscuit cutter), cut out 8 dough rounds. Place 4 of the dough rounds on a lightly greased baking sheet. Using a 3-inch circle or biscuit cutter, cut a concentric circle in the middle of the remaining 4-inch dough rounds to create a 1/2-inch wide circle of dough. These 1/2-inch wide circles of dough are to be used without the 3-inch pieces from the center. Place 1 of these 1/2-inch wide circles of dough on top of each of the rounds already on the baking sheet, matching up the edges. Brush egg wash over the surface of each of the paired dough circles and rounds. Then use a fork to prick through the dough around the perimeter (that is, through each dough circle and into the accompanying round beneath it). Place in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. The center of each will rise. Remove pastry shells from oven and allow to cool slightly. Using the tip of a butter knife, break through the risen center part of each pastry shell to make a crater. Spoon some of the mushroom mixture into each of these craters. Place some greens on top of each tart and drizzle with lime balsamic vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 35339,&quot;Swedish Meatballs in a Bag 1 cup fresh bread crumbs 1/2 to 3/4 cup water 1 tablespoon instant flour (recommended: Wondra) 1 1/2 pounds ground beef 1 onion, finely diced 1 egg 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 cup canola oil 2 tablespoons butter, cubed 1 cup beef stock 1/4 cup dry sherry 1/4 cup heavy cream 1 bay leaf 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons honey mustard Instructions: Hydrate bread crumbs in a mixing bowl by pouring water (1/2 to 3/4 cup) over them. To cook en papillote (in the oven, enclosed in foil), use a large foil oven pouch, or make an oven pouch out of a 3 foot length of heavy duty foil by bringing the 2 ends to the center, folding the sides to seal, and leaving an opening at the center through which to place the sauce and meatballs. Shake flour in the pouch to coat the inside, and (for safety reasons) place in a roasting pan. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. To cook en papillote on the grill, follow the same procedure with the foil pouch and preheat grill to medium-high heat. (The foil pouch method is great for cooking and cleanup, but because the liquids inside will become very hot, use a roasting pan to support the weight of the pouch for safety reasons.) To the bowl of hydrated bread crumbs, add ground beef, onion, egg, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and allspice. With an electric mixer, beat the meat mixture until fluffy. Heat oil in a large skillet to sear off meatballs. (In the episode, we seared the meatballs in a deep-fryer.) Form meat mixture into small meatballs, and sear them in the skillet or deep-fryer. Remove to paper toweling to drain briefly. Add butter, beef stock, sherry, cream and bay leaf to foil pouch (which you have placed into a roasting pan for safety reasons to support the weight of the \\floppy\\ pouch). Transfer meatballs to the oven pouch and seal the pouch. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or grill for about 15 to 20 minutes. Use extra care in dealing with the hot liquids in the foil pouch or oven bag. Pour the sauce from the bag into a small saucepan. Remove bay leaf from sauce before serving. Whisk in Dijon mustard and honey mustard and heat for a few minutes to thicken, and serve with meatballs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35340,&quot;Bramble Pancake Cake 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 cup milk<br> 1/2 cup gin<br> 3 tablespoons melted butter<br> 1 tablespoon lemon juice plus zest of 1 lemon<br> 1 egg<br> Nonstick cooking spray or additional melted butter, for greasing the skillet 1 cup heavy cream<br> 1/4 cup maple syrup<br> 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint 1 quart blackberries, sliced in half<br> Instructions: Add flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda to a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Add milk, gin, melted butter, lemon juice, zest and egg to a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Add wet ingredients to dry and mix until just combined and slightly lumpy. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Spray with cooking spray or brush with melted butter. Add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup batter to the skillet for each pancake. Cook until golden brown on the bottom and bubbles begin to form on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on reverse side, about 2 more minutes. Transfer to a plate and continue with remaining batter. Add the heavy cream and maple syrup to a large chilled bowl. Mix until stiff peaks form using a hand mixer. Add mint and fold to combine. Spread the whipped cream on each pancake. Stack the pancakes with cream and a few blackberries followed by another pancake with cream and berries. Continue in this manner, finishing with cream and berries on top.

Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the heat to high and, without stirring, cook until the syrup is golden amber or until a candy thermometer reads between 250 to 265 degrees F (hard-ball stage), about 10 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note*). Promptly remove the saucepan from the heat. Working quickly, drop 3 cranberries into the caramel. Use 2 forks to coat the cranberries completely in the syrup and pull together into a cluster. Place the cranberry cluster on a waxed paper lined baking tray. Repeat with the remaining cranberries. Reheat the syrup briefly over low heat if it starts to thicken. Let the clusters cool to harden. Melt the white chocolate in a stainless-steel bowl over barely simmering water. Stir constantly with a rubber spatula until the white chocolate is almost completely melted. Be careful that no moisture gets into the chocolate, or it will harden. Remove the bowl from the heat and allow the white chocolate to cool slightly. Dip the bottom of the cranberry cluster into the white chocolate and place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet to set for approximately 20 minutes. Place clusters in paper candy cups and store in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35342,&quot;Mexican Style Hot Dog 4 hot dogs 4 hot dog buns<br> Ketchup<br> Mayonnaise<br> Mustard<br> Sliced pickled jalapenos<br> Mexican-style potato chips, crushed<br> Instructions: Grill, steam or boil the hot dogs, and then place in the buns.

To make parcels: Place one phyllo square on flat surface, brush with butter, place another square on top of first with corners turned 45 degrees. Continue in this way, turning each square before placing on top of the other so the corners do not lay on top of one another. Each parcel should contain 6 sheets of phyllo. Keep phyllo covered as you&#39;re working so it doesn&#39;t dry out. Spoon 2 tablespoons of mushrooms into center of each packet. Place tenderloin on top of mushrooms. Top tenderloin with another 2 tablespoons of mushrooms. Gather edges of phyllo together and gently twist. Tie with a leek ribbon.

Place the breadcrumbs on a large plate. Form the potato mix into 12 golf-ball-sized balls. The mixture will be a little sticky, so wet your hands a little as you go. Place the balls directly on the breadcrumbs and roll each ball in the breadcrumbs, pressing to make sure they stick well. Put the breadcrumbed balls on a plate. Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven to 375 degrees F, or until the mixture bubbles when a breadcrumb is added. Add the balls to the oil and fry until golden brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes total. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle immediately with salt. Garnish with more Parmesan and parsley. Peel and cut the potatoes into pieces of approximately the same size. Bring a large pot of water to a simmer and add the potatoes. Bring to a boil and cook until a fork easily slides into the potatoes with no resistance and the potatoes almost, but not totally, fall apart, 30 to 35 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Drain the potatoes in a large colander. Place them back into the dry pot and put the pot on the stove. Mash the potatoes over a low heat, allowing all the steam to escape.

F. Arrange two racks evenly spaced in the oven. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and spread the sugar so it\\u2019s a perfectly even thickness on the paper right to the edge of the sugar, leaving a border on the paper so the sugar doesn\\u2019t spill onto the pan. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the edges start to brown lightly. Watch carefully! Lower the oven to 250? F.<br> Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Just before the sugar is ready, whisk the egg whites on high speed for 1 minute, until frothy. With the mixer on low, slowly add the hot sugar to the egg whites. (I use a large spoon at first, then pick up the paper and pour the sugar in slowly.) Add the vanilla and continue to whisk on high for 10 minutes, until the egg whites are room temperature. (The bowl may still be warm.) The meringue will be very thick and glossy. Using two large serving spoons, scoop 6 very large, messy oval dollops of meringue onto each of two sheet pans lined with parchment paper, spacing them out because they will expand while they bake. Sprinkle the pistachios on top and bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (make sure your oven isn\\u2019t above 250?

Make a small hole in the extra skin on the chicken legs and poke the end of the drumsticks through to form a perfect package. Toss the chickens generously with olive oil and salt. Arrange the chicken on a sheet tray or a baking dish lined with parchment or a silicone mat. Roast the chickens until they are about three-quarters of the way done, 20 to 25 minutes. The skin should start to brown and crisp. While the chickens are roasting, combine the maple syrup and cayenne in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the syrup is reduced by half to three-quarters, or until the syrup is very thick and syrupy. After the chickens have roasted for 20 to 25 minutes, brush each piece of chicken generously with the reduced syrup. Continue to roast for another 10 to 12 minutes, brushing the skin with the syrup 1 or 2 more times while cooking. The skin should start to become very dark and sticky. If the skin starts to get too dark, cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Transfer the chickens to a serving platter and let rest about 10 minutes before serving.

Salt the water, bring it to a simmer over medium heat, cover partially, and cook until the potatoes are tender enough to stick a fork into but still on the firm side of done, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and let cool. (You can boil the potatoes up to a day ahead of time and keep them in the refrigerator if you like.) While the potatoes are cooking, clarify the butter: Heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat until it foams and starts to turn dark blond on top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the butter sit for a few minutes. Then tilt the skillet toward you and gently spoon off and discard the layer of foam. Pour the clear golden butter into a bowl, discarding the dark dregs at the bottom of the skillet. Coarsely grate the potatoes, skins and all, onto a baking sheet, making sure to keep them loose and not to pack them down. Combine 1/2 teaspoon salt and the black pepper in a small bowl. Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, and add half of the clarified butter. Add a third of the potatoes in an even layer, keeping them loose. Top with half of the onions and season with some of the salt and pepper mixture. Add another third of the potatoes and the rest of the onions, and season again with salt and pepper. Add the remaining potatoes, season again, and then reduce the heat to medium and cook the potato cake until the bottom turns dark amber brown, about 15 minutes. (Peek on the sides: If it&#39;s browning too quickly, turn the heat down to medium-low.) Put a large plate upside down over the skillet, and using two thick oven mitts, grab the sides of the skillet and turn it upside down, releasing the hash-brown cake onto the plate. Put the empty skillet back on the burner and add all but 1 tablespoon of the remaining clarified butter. Slide the potato cake back into the skillet. Cook until the underside turns dark amber brown, 10 to 15 minutes. While the potato cake is cooking, fry the peppers: Heat a large saute pan over medium heat and add the remaining tablespoon of the clarified butter. Add the peppers and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and cook, flipping them often, until they blister and feel tender throughout, about 10 minutes. To serve, lay the large plate upside down over the skillet, and using oven mitts, invert as before. (If the first side was prettier, invert the cake again onto another serving plate.) Top with a jumble of fried peppers. Cut into wedges and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 35368,&quot;Yogurt Parfait Cruller Nonstick cooking spray 180 grams butter 30 grams sugar 3 grams salt 340 grams all-purpose flour 6 large eggs plus 2 large egg whites Oil, for frying 1 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg 1 cup whipping cream 1/4 cup strawberry or raspberry jam 1 cup Greek yogurt Zest of 2 lemons 1/2 cup bran flakes 1/2 cup rolled oats 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon ginger 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg Pinch salt 1/2 cup whipping cream 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/8 cup butter Additional jam, optional Honey for drizzling, optional Zest of 1 lemon Instructions: For the spiced crullers: Spray the parchment paper with nonstick cooking spray, then cut into 4-inch squares. Set aside. Combine the butter, sugar and salt with 375 grams water in a small pot and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and add the flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until your muscles are tired and some of the moisture has evaporated. Stir for at least 1 minute, not allowing the dough to stick to the bottom of the pot. Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed to cool. Whisk together the whole eggs and egg whites in a separate bowl. Once the dough is no longer hot to the touch and no longer gives off steam, turn the mixer to low speed and add the eggs, 1 tablespoon at a time, being sure to let each addition incorporate fully before adding the next. Scrape down the side of the bowl between additions. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with the large star tip. Pipe a circle onto a parchment square, letting the ends meet but not overlap. Repeat with the remaining dough. For the spiced sugar: Stir together the sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a small bowl. In a large Dutch oven, bring several inches oil to 370 degrees F. Carefully slide 4 crullers into the oil and fry until fully browned, 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to the bowl of spiced sugar and coat both sides; transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with remaining crullers. Cool, 5 minutes. For the yogurt topping: Beat together the cream and jam with an electric mixer on high until soft peaks form. Fold the yogurt into the whipped cream, then fold in the zest. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a round tip or use a spoon to drop dollops into the middles of the crullers. For the granola topping: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine the bran flakes, oats, pumpkin seeds, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt in a medium bowl.

Combine the yeast and 3/4 cup warm (110 degrees F) water in a large bowl; stir to dissolve the yeast, then set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes. Sift 3/4 cup flour into the bowl and blend with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add 1 teaspoon salt, a few grinds of pepper and the honey and mix to blend. Sift the remaining 1 cup flour into the bowl and mix until incorporated. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Brush a large bowl with olive oil and add the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Roast the grapes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the grapes with 2 tablespoons olive oil on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast until wrinkled, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the vinegar, sugar and mustard seeds to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced by about half, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the grapes from the oven (leave the oven on) and let cool slightly. Combine the grapes and the vinegar mixture in a bowl; set aside. Cook the broccoli. Heat a large ovenproof saute pan over high heat. When it gets hot, remove from the heat and add 3 tablespoons olive oil and the broccoli; season with salt and the red pepper flakes. Return to the heat and cook, stirring from time to time, until the broccoli chars, 10 to 12 minutes, adding 1 more tablespoon olive oil and the garlic during the last 2 minutes of cooking. (Add a splash of water if the pan is too dry.) Place the pan in the oven and cook until the broccoli is tender, about 5 more minutes. Set aside to cool; leave the oven on. Prepare the ricotta. Put the ricotta in a medium bowl. Season with salt and stir in the thyme and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Taste for seasoning. Set aside. Roll out the dough. Press the dough gently and turn it out onto a floured surface. Divide in half and roll each piece into a loose ball. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest 15 minutes. Flatten the dough, then roll out each piece into an 8-inch round. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Cook the flatbread. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 9-to-10-inch ovenproof saute pan over medium-high heat. When it begins to smoke lightly, turn off the heat and add one round of dough. Return to medium-high heat and cook, pressing the dough gently with a spatula to keep it flat, until slightly brown on the underside, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the dough lightly with salt and pepper, then flip and press with the spatula. Pour off any excess oil from the pan. Add the toppings. While the underside cooks, spread half of the ricotta mixture on top. Arrange half of the grapes and broccoli on the ricotta. Transfer the pan to the oven to warm through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the flatbread to a cutting board, cut it into slices and top with parmesan cheese. Repeat to make another flatbread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 35373,&quot;3-Shot Cocktail (\\Bandera and Sangrita) Tequila, 1-ounce per serving Fresh lime juice, 1-ounce (about 2 tablespoons) per serving Red part (Sangrita)* (See Cook&#39;s Note) 3/4 cups orange juice 3/4 cups regular or spicy tomato juice 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 1 medium jalapeno cl, stemmed, seeded and coarsely chopped Pinch salt Instructions: White part: Fill tequila shot glasses with tequila.

Set aside. In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, cook the sugar, corn syrup, and water, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to high and bring the mixture to a full rolling boil. Cook until a dark amber color, about 1 to 2 minutes, without stirring. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour the cream mixture into the sugar mixture. (Take care, since the sugar will bubble up when the cream is added.) Whisk until smooth. Put the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Pour the hot cream/sugar mixture over the chocolate. Add the vanilla and whisk until smooth. Serve the hot fudge sauce warm. Store the sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Set aside. Trim off and discard the ends of the yellow squash but do not peel. Cut the squash into quarters. Cut each quarter into 1-inch or slightly longer lengths. There should be about 11/2 cups, no more. Set aside. Cut each asparagus spear into thirds. Set aside. Cook each of the green vegetables separately in boiling salted water to cover. The essential thing is to cook each vegetable so that it remains crisp-tender. Cook the broccoli, squash, green beans, and asparagus for about 5 minutes. Drain well, run under cold water to chill, and drain thoroughly. Combine them in a mixing bowl. Cook the peas and snow peas for about minute if fresh, or 30 seconds if frozen. Drain, chill, and drain again. Combine them in a mixing bowl. Heat the peanut oil in a skillet and add the mushrooms. Add salt and pepper to taste, shaking the skillet and stirring. Cook for about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms to the vegetables. Add the chopped chilies and parsley. Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a saucepan and add half the garlic, the tomatoes, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook for about 4 minutes, stirring gently so as not to break up the tomatoes more than is essential. Add the basil, stir and set aside. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet and add the remaining garlic and the vegetable mixture. Cook, stirring gently, just to heat through. Drop the spaghetti into boiling salted water. Cook until al dente. The spaghetti when ready must retain just a slight resilience in the center. Drain well. Melt the butter in a utensil large enough to hold the drained spaghetti and vegetables. Add the chicken broth, 1/2 cup cream, and cheese, stirring constantly. Cook gently on and off the heat until smooth. Add the spaghetti and toss quickly to blend. Add half the vegetables and pour in the liquid from the tomatoes, tossing and stirring over very low heat. Add the remaining vegetables and, if the sauce seems too dry, add about 1/4 cup more cream. The sauce should not be soupy. Add the pine nuts and give the mixture one final tossing. Serve equal portions of the spaghetti bowls. Spoon equal amounts of the tomatoes over each serving. Serve immediately.

Place the bagels in a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Pour the cream mixture over the top and set aside to soak for 2 hours.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cover the baking pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil from the pan and continue cooking for 15 minutes. Cool the bread pudding completely.<br> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Separate the bagel pieces and place on a baking sheet. Toast until the edges turn golden brown, 5 minutes.<br> For the onions: In a 14-inch skillet or a medium high-sided saute pan, heat the oil over high heat and pour in the sliced onions. Do NOT stir the onions or shake the pan. When the pan gets hot again and the onions begin to sizzle, add the salt and stir. The onions at the bottom of the pan should be brown. Reduce the heat to medium and continue stirring. The onions will begin to soften and release their juices (the natural sugars in the juices will caramelize the onions). Cook for 15 minutes, and then reduce the heat to low. Continue cooking, stirring the onions periodically to make sure they don&#39;t stick to the pan, until completely soft and a rich dark brown color, 30 minutes.<br> For the soup: In a large saucepot set over medium heat, melt the butter until it starts to bubble. Add in the caramelized onions, then add the sherry and cook at a low simmer until the alcohol cooks out, 5 minutes. Add the bay leaf and stock, and cook for 30 minutes. Season with salt as the soup cooks. Portion the soup into serving bowls and top with some toasted bagel bread pudding croutons. Garnish each serving with 2 tablespoons gruyere if using, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 35386,&quot;Yucca Fries 3 cups canola oil 1 tablespoon fine sea salt 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 pounds fresh yucca 1 lime zested Instructions: In medium Dutch oven heat oil to 350 degrees F.

When it starts to get hot, add the garlic, ginger and onions, and cook until the onions are golden, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste, cumin, garam masala, brown sugar, chili flakes, salt and turmeric, and cook for 2 minutes. Add the chicken and stir well to coat. Stir in the yogurt and 1/2 cup water and cook until the chicken is done, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool, and then shred the meat using a fork or your fingers. For the parathas: Combine the flour, coriander, cumin, salt and 1/2 to 1 cup water in a large bowl and mix with your hands until it begins to form a ball. If it there is excess flour and it seems dry, add more water. Knead until it has a smooth consistency, like pizza dough. The dough should be soft and smooth. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and roll each into a smooth ball. Pat a ball into a disc and then place on a floured surface and roll it out into a very thin circle, about 6 inches in diameter, like a tortilla. Place 1/2 cup butter chicken filling onto the disc, and then roll out a second ball and place it over the butter chicken. Lightly go over the paratha with the rolling pin to seal it, taking care not to push the filling out of the edges. Continue to roll and fill the remaining discs. Place a nonstick pan over medium-low heat and gently place a paratha into it. Brush the top with a little of the flaxseed oil and let it cook until the dough begins to bubble and turn brown, about 1 minute. Flip the paratha, oil it lightly and continue to cook it until it&#39;s golden and crispy. Brush the top with a little more of the oil. Repeat the process for the remaining parathas. Serve with Sweet Tomato Chutney. Put the sugar, salt, cardamom and tomatoes into a saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently until it has reduced and thickened significantly, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Season generously with salt and pepper and set aside. In a deep, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 375 degrees F. Fit a baking sheet with a wire rack. Season the wings with salt and pepper. Fry in batches until very crisp and golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spider to remove the wings to the prepared baking sheet and, while the wings are still hot, season with more salt. Once all the wings are fried, place them in a large bowl and toss with 1/4 cup of the sauce. Transfer the wings to a large platter, garnish with sliced scallions, drizzle generously with more sauce and serve the remaining sauce alongside for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 35407,&quot;Pork and Beef Ragu 1/4 cup virgin olive oil 1 pound chuck roast, room temperature<br> 1 pound pork shoulder, room temperature<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 large cans whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano<br> 8 to 10 cloves fresh garlic, peeled, ends removed<br> 2 to 3 small cans tomato paste<br> 1/2 cup fresh basil, torn into small pieces<br> Hot pasta, for serving Grated cheese, for serving Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy pot. Take care not to overheat or burn the oil. Sprinkle the chuck and pork liberally with salt and pepper. Once the oil is hot, drop in the meat and sear until brown on all sides. Remove the meat and set aside. Add the tomatoes along with the juices from the cans. Lower the heat and slowly cook the tomatoes, breaking up into small pieces using a large spoon. Continue to cut the large pieces as the tomatoes cook; cutting them will become easier. Peel the garlic and remove the ends. Crush with the blade of a large chef&#39;s knife and drop into the sauce. Don&#39;t worry about the garlic pieces being too large; they, too, will break down as they cook. Return the meat to the sauce and continue cooking until the sauce has a chunky, but uniform consistency, 2 to 3 hours. Add the tomato paste, 1/2 can at a time, to somewhat thicken the sauce. Simmer until desired consistency, and then stir in the basil and cook for another few minutes before serving over hot pasta (any shape will do!). This is a fresh, but hearty sauce, and every serving should have a small piece of meat served on the plate. Garnish with your favorite grated cheese and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 35408,&quot;Spirograph Cake 8 ounces white fondant Confectioners&#39; sugar, if needed Fine-tipped food color markers in assorted colors Flour-based cooking spray, for the baking pans 6 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 large eggs 3/4 cup unsweetened dark cocoa powder 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup sour cream 1 cup hot brewed coffee 1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 2 pounds confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon clear vanilla extract 1/3 to 2/3 cup heavy cream Pink, orange and lavender gel food color Assorted sprinkles and nonpareils Instructions: For the Spirograph? decor: Knead the fondant until smooth and pliable. If the fondant is sticky, knead in a little confectioners&#39; sugar until the fondant is elastic and does not cling to your hands. Roll out the fondant between 2 sheets of parchment paper to 1/4-inch thickness using a rolling pin. Remove the top sheet of parchment paper and allow the fondant to stand until the surface is firm and dry. This can take 2 to 4 hours (and up to overnight), depending on the surrounding humidity of the room in which you&#39;re working. The fondant can be tested for readiness by attempting a Spirograph? design. Place the Spirograph? tools on top of the fondant and begin to draw using light pressure with a food color marker. If the tip of the pen sinks into the fondant, it is not dry enough to use and needs to stand longer. If the pen glides across the surface, then it&#39;s ready to use. Use the Spirograph? tools to practice drawing on a piece of copy paper before you begin drawing on the fondant. Choose your favorite designs to replicate on the fondant. Place the Spirograph? tools on the dry fondant and use the food color pens to draw designs onto its surface. Make various sizes and patterns. You&#39;ll need about 14 designs to cover the entire cake. Allow the drawings to dry for 10 minutes, then use the cookie cutters to stamp out the designs. Store the stamped-out circles in a single layer between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. For the chocolate cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray three 6-inch round baking pans (or two 8-inch pans) with flour-based baking spray. Beat the butter and granulated sugar together in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the oil; beat in the eggs 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition.<br> Whisk together the cocoa powder, flour, baking soda and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the flour mixture to the creamed butter mixture alternately with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Add the hot coffee at the end and mix on low speed until just combined. Use a spatula to scrape down the bowl and mix again on low until the batter is smooth. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans, filling each pan no more than three-quarters full. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when pressed in their centers. Turn the cakes out onto wire racks to cool. When the cakes are completely cool, level the tops using a large serrated knife or cake leveler For the buttercream frosting: Cream together the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar on low speed in the bowl of an electric mixer. When the mixture is combined, increase the speed to high and whip until light in color, about 3 minutes. Turn the mixer off and add the vanilla extract and 1/3 cup heavy cream. Beat again until the frosting is light and fluffy, about another 3 minutes. Add additional heavy cream if the mixture is too thick to spread or pipe.<br> Place 1 cup of buttercream in a medium bowl. Drape a damp towel across the bowl to prevent the frosting from drying. Set aside. Place the remaining frosting in a large piping bag. Use the buttercream to fill the cake layers and to apply a thin crumb coat to the outside of the cake. Use an offset spatula or bench scraper to even the frosting. Place the cake in the refrigerator to chill until the frosting is firm, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, divide the reserved 1 cup of frosting into 3 parts in separate bowls and tint each portion with one of the 3 gel food colors.<br> When the crumb coat layer is well chilled, apply a second layer of white frosting and even the edges of the cake with a bench scraper. Use an offset spatula to randomly place dabs of pink, orange and lavender tinted buttercream over the edges and top of the cake. Carefully scrape away some of the tinted frosting using a single motion with a bench scraper. The colors will smear and blend together, creating a watercolor effect. Add more color dabs of frosting and repeat the process as desired. Transfer the cake to the refrigerator to chill. When the cake is well chilled, apply the fondant Spirograph? designs to the sides of the cake using buttercream as an adhesive. Use leftover white buttercream to pipe small mounds of frosting on top of the cake; cover the buttercream with assorted sprinkles and nonpareils. Place 1 fondant Spirograph? design on top of the cake if desired.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35409,&quot;New Orleans-Style Barbequed Shrimp 4 pounds fresh or frozen large or extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 count/per pound), in the shell, see note 5 tablespoons chili powder 1 tablespoon salt, plus 2 teaspoons 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter 2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 1 cup ketchup 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 5 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 cup Worcestershire sauce 1 lemon, sliced 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 1 lemon) 3 bay leaves 2 teaspoons dried oregano 2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper Several dashes Louisiana-style hot sauce Instructions: Cook&#39;s Note: You can buy large, frozen tiger shrimp that have been deveined but are still in the shell. If you use these, thaw them according to the package directions. If using fresh shrimp, you can ask the person at the fish counter to devein them for you in the shell. You can also do this yourself: Using kitchen shears, cut the shell along the vein and pull the vein out with your fingers. Or, you can just skip the deveining process. The vein won&#39;t hurt you. Combine 3 tablespoons of the chili powder and 1 tablespoon of the salt in a small bowl. Rub the shrimp with this mixture, making sure you rub some into the open cut where the shrimp as been deveined (if applicable) to season the shrimp inside the shell. Place the shrimp in a shallow, non-reactive pan, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you make the sauce. In a saucepan set over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until soft, but not browned. Add the ketchup, oil, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, lemon, lemon juice, bay leaves, oregano, thyme, and cayenne, as well as the remaining 2 tablespoons chili powder and 2 teaspoons salt. Stir to mix. Reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until thick. Remove from the heat, uncover, and cool to room temperature. Remove and discard the lemon slices and bay leaves. Pour 1 1/2 cups of the sauce over the shrimp. Toss to coat well. Cover and refrigerate the shrimp for 1 to 2 hours. Cover and refrigerate the remaining sauce separately and save for dipping. Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill for direct grilling over high heat. While the grill is heating, reheat the remaining sauce in a small, covered saucepan over very low heat, it will only take a few minutes. Watch the sauce carefully so that it doesn&#39;t burn. Remove the shrimp from the pan and discard the marinade. Grill the shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until the shells are orangey-pink. To test for doneness, take a shrimp off the grill, remove the shell and cut the shrimp in half: The flesh should be white and firm throughout. Serve with the warm sauce for dipping, and a large bowl for the shells. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 35410,&quot;Linguine with Raw Tomato Sauce 3 pounds very ripe tomatoes 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 cup torn basil leaves 2 tablespoons finely-chopped garlic 1 pound linguine 1/2 cup freshly-grated Parmesan cheese Instructions: Coarsely chop tomatoes, reserving juice. In a large bowl combine tomatoes and their juice, vinegar, 3 tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil and basil. In a very small skillet heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Saute garlic 3 minutes, without allowing garlic to brown. Scrape garlic and oil into tomato mixture and season to taste with salt and pepper. Marinate tomato sauce at room temperature, 5 to 6 hours.

Set aside 5 minutes. In a food processor fitted with the dough blade, pulse the whole-wheat flour, 2 cups all-purpose flour and the sea salt. Add 1 egg and the yeast mixture and pulse in 10-second intervals until the dough comes together, about 3 pulses. Turn out onto a floured board. Knead 10 to 12 times, adding up to 3/4 cup more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cut the dough into 4 equal portions; cover with a clean towel. On a floured board, roll out one piece of dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle, 1/4 inch thick, with a shorter side facing you. Spread 2 1/2 tablespoons cream cheese across the middle of the dough; fold the bottom third of the dough over the cheese, then spread another 2 1/2 tablespoons cream cheese and 2 tablespoons pesto over the folded part. Fold the top third of the dough over the pesto. Reroll the dough into a 14-by-11-inch rectangle. Cut into seven 11-by-2-inch strips. One at a time, pinch the cut long edges of each strip together and roll into a 12-inch rope with your hands. Transfer the rope to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Grab the ends and bring them toward each other, forming a U shape, then cross the left end over the right end to make a pretzel shape. Cross the left end over the right again to make a twist in the middle. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough and the remaining cream cheese and pesto, spacing the pretzels 3 inches apart. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes; preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl. Brush the pretzels with the egg; sprinkle with coarse sea salt and dried basil. Bake until browned, 16 to 18 minutes, checking on the pretzels every 5 minutes to avoid overbaking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 35412,&quot;Chicken Satay Salad Sammies 1 1/2 pounds thin cut chicken breast meat (cutlets) 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Grill seasoning (recommended: Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick) or coarse salt and pepper 3 rounded tablespoons chunky peanut butter 3 tablespoons dark soy sauce, Tamari, eyeball it 1/4 cup apple juice, eyeball it 2 teaspoons hot sauce, eyeball it 1 lime, juiced 1/4 seedless cucumber, thinly sliced lengthwise then cut into sticks 1 cup shredded carrots 2 cups shredded lettuce, iceberg or hearts of romaine 4 crusty rolls, Kaiser&#39;s or subs, split Instructions: Heat a grill pan or large nonstick skillet to medium high to high heat.

Set a wire rack on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Whisk 1 3/4 cups flour, the sugar, baking powder, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl. In small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk the eggs with the milk and vanilla extract. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large well-seasoned cast-iron or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry mixture, and whisk just long enough to make a thick batter, (if there are a couple lumps that&#39;s okay). Using a melon baller or an apple corer, peel and core the apples keeping them whole. Slice the apples crosswise to make 1/4-inch rounds. Put some flour on a plate and dredge the apple slices until lightly coated, shaking off any excess flour. In the same skillet over medium to medium-low heat, place 3 apple slices about 3-inches apart in the skillet. Cook without turning until browned, about 3 minutes. Ladle about 2 tablespoons of the batter over each apple ring. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add a nut-sized bit of butter to the skillet, as needed, and flip the pancakes, cook until golden on the underside, about 1 minute more. Serve immediately or transfer to oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining apples and batter. Serve with warm maple syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 35422,&quot;Caramel Bread Pudding for Two 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more butter for greasing the cups 2 croissants (about 2 ounces each), torn into 1-inch pieces 1 large egg 2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar 3/4 cup half-and-half 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 4 soft caramel candies, chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly butter 2 ovenproof 6-ounce tea or coffee cups. Tear a loosely packed 1/2 cup of the croissant pieces into slightly smaller pieces, and toss them with the melted butter in a small bowl; set aside. Whisk the egg with 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a medium bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Whisk in the half-and-half and vanilla. Stir in the remaining 1-inch croissant pieces and the caramels, and let the mixture sit, folding occasionally, for about 15 minutes. Don&#39;t worry if the mixture seems too wet; the excess moisture will be absorbed as the pudding bakes. Divide the soaked bread mixture between the prepared cups. Top each with half the buttered croissant pieces, and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the remaining sugar. Bake until the bread pudding puffs above the rim of the cups and is set, about 30 minutes. Let cool a few minutes (the pudding will sink), and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35423,&quot;Spicy Linguine with Clams and Mussels 1 pound linguine pasta 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 large or 4 small shallots, sliced Kosher salt, for seasoning, plus 2 teaspoons Freshly ground black pepper, for seasoning, plus 1 teaspoon 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup white wine (recommended: Pinot Grigio) 1 cup vegetable broth 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 12 littleneck clams, cleaned 12 mussels, cleaned Instructions: Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large serving bowl. Add the butter and parsley and toss until coated. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds until aromatic. Add the wine and simmer until the liquid has reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Stir in the broth, red pepper flakes, clams and mussels. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook until all the shellfish have opened, about 5 to 8 minutes. Discard any unopened shellfish.

In a separate large saucepan on an adjacent burner, heat the oil and saute onion until it is translucent. Add barley (or rice) and lightly saute to toast the barley. Add wine and stir for about 2 minutes until it is absorbed. Begin slowly adding broth, 1 ladle-full at a time, to the barley pan, stirring as you go. The friction of the stirring will bring out the starch in the barley. As the mixture absorbs the broth, ladle more into the pot. When all of the broth has been ladled into the barley pot, slowly simmer until barley is soft and creamy. Stir in ricotta to add creaminess, then crumble in goat cheese (to add cohesiveness), stir, cover and set aside. For the pesto: Place basil in food processor, add pine nuts and garlic, and pulse until chopped. Scrape into a bowl, add Parmesan and stir in oil to form a thick smooth paste. Add black pepper, to taste. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spread half of the barley (or rice) mixture over the bottom of a lasagna dish or large casserole. Top with half of the sun-dried tomatoes and then with half of the basil pesto. Repeat for a second layer. Bake covered with foil for 25 minutes, then remove foil and continue to bake for 5 minutes to let top layer of pesto become toasted. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Serve garnished with fresh basil sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 35425,&quot;Sicilian Stick to Your Ribs Meal: Meatloaf Brasciole (Roll Ups), Pasta, Broccolini and Ricotta 1 1/2 pounds ground beef, pork and veal mix from the butcher&#39;s counter (meatloaf mix) Salt and pepper 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs 1 egg 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 small white onion, grated 2 tablespoons golden or dark raisins, chopped 3 tablespoons pine nuts, chopped 3 tablespoons grated cheese, Parmigiano or Romano 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley 1 cup arugula leaves or baby spinach 6 slices prosciutto di Parma 6 slices deli sliced provolone Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 1/2 pound cavatappi (corkscrew shaped hollow pasta) or rigatoni 1 pound broccolini, trimmed into florets 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup ricotta cheese 2 teaspoons lemon zest 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 12 grape or small vine tomatoes, halved Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.<br> Put water on to boil for your pasta.<br> Mix meat and next 10 ingredients as if you were making meatloaf.

When the grill, slightly inclined, is very hot, put on the meat and grill it without turning and without piercing it in any way. Another secret is to cook it very quickly so as to sear and seal in the meat juices. After 5 to 6 minutes, turn the steak over using a spatula and season with salt and pepper.

Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, cooking until it&#39;s soft and a little brown around the edges, about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the guava paste, tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, star anise, allspice, and curry powder. Simmer until the guava paste has melted, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and let the sauce cool slightly. Discard the star anise; transfer the mixture to your blender and puree. With the motor running add the lime juice and rum. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside, or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. For the salsa: Whisk the olive oil, garlic, lime juice, salt and pepper together in a large bowl. Add the mangoes, peppers, red onions, cl, and cilantro and toss to coat. Add the beans and gently toss everything together. For the salmon: Heat your broiler to high. Line a large flameproof baking dish or rimmed flameproof baking sheet with a double layer of aluminum foil and grease the foil with some olive oil or nonstick cooking spray. Place the salmon in the prepared baking dish and tuck about 2-inches of the tail end under the fish, so you have a somewhat uniform shape. Pour the barbecue sauce over the salmon and cook it under the broiler until the sauce caramelizes and chars around the edges and the salmon is firm and flakes easily, 8 to 12 minutes for rare (the salmon will still be pink in the middle) or 12 to 15 minutes for well done (the salmon will be cooked throughout). Spread the salsa on the serving platter and carefully lift the salmon out of the baking dish and arrange it on top of the salsa (use 2 large spatulas to transfer it). Squeeze a few lime wedges over the fish and serve with additional lime wedges on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 35466,&quot;Herb Roasted Pork Loin with Parsley Shallot Sauce 2 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon) 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons olive oil 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage leaves or 1 teaspoon dried sage 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves or 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crumbled 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper One 2 1/2-pound center cut boneless pork loin, trimmed of all visible fat 1/2 cup Parsley Shallot Sauce, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups lightly packed flat-leaf parsley leaves 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped shallot 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons water 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Mash the garlic and salt together with a fork until it forms a coarse paste.

Season liberally with pepper, salt and the Worchestershire sauce. Coat with olive oil, tossing lightly. Put a few of the tomatoes in the blender and liquefy - this will make it easier to puree the rest of the solids. Add the fennel/tomato/jalapeno mixture to a blender and puree until liquefied. Store in refrigerator up to 6 hours until chilled.<br> Hint: If you can find them, heirloom tomatoes can really boost the flavor of this drink. Heirloom tomatoes are typically varieties that were grown over 50 years ago, before tomatoes were bred for ease of picking and distribution. Heirlooms tend to be a little more acidic than modern commercial tomatoes, and often the fresh tomato flavor is more pronounced.<br> Assembling the cocktail: Rub a cut lemon around the rim of a chilled martini glass. Dip the glass, upside down, in salt or your favorite spice rub. Slice the tip of a red jalapeno pepper vertically and slip over the rim. Place 1 or 2 of the jalapeno ice cubes in each glass, pour chilled bloody maria mixture on top, and top each glass with 1 ounce of lemon vodka. Stir carefully and serve.<br> Hint: If you don&#39;t have lemon vodka, use regular vodka and squeeze a little lemon juice in each glass. Remove the tops and stems of the jalapenos and slice. Place the water in a blender and add the jalapenos, seeds and all. Add the lemon to the blender, peel and all. Add the basil, a pinch of salt, and some ground black pepper, to taste. Puree in the blender until everything is incorporated. Strain through a sieve and pour into ice cube trays and freeze overnight until solid. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 35478,&quot;Pizza Dough 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 1 teaspoon honey 1 cup warm water, 105 to 115 degrees F 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing Instructions: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4 cup warm water. In a food processor, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and process until the mixture forms a ball. (The pizza dough can also be made in a mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed until the mixture comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and starts to climb up the dough hook). Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a cool spot for about 2 hours. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 1 hour. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 35479,&quot;Sea Scallops with Guacamole 1-ounce olive oil 6 diver or jumbo sea scallops (10 to 20 count per pound), side muscle pulled off Salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 pieces white toast 1 California avocado, seeded and peeled 1/2 tablespoon lime juice 1/4 teaspoon crushed clove garlic 1/2-ounce finely chopped onion 1 teaspoon chopped cilantro leaves Splash hot red pepper sauce Instructions: Heat olive oil in a nonstick pan, over moderate-high heat.

Add the butter and pulse until evenly combined and the size of small pebbles. Pour in the vinegar and pulse 1 to 2 times until just combined. With the food processor running, slowly pour in the cold water, adding just enough for the dough to form a ball. You may not need the entire 1/3 cup of water. Remove the dough from the food processor and form it into a ball. Cut off about a third of the ball so you have a small piece (about 10 ounces) and a larger piece (about 1 pound 6 ounces; see Cook&#39;s Note). Form both pieces of dough into discs, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet very lightly with cooking spray. Dust a work surface lightly with flour. Roll the larger disc of dough into a rectangle that is 2 inches larger on all sides than the baking sheet. Roll the dough onto the rolling pin and then unfold it over the baking sheet, gently guiding the dough into the baking sheet and lightly pressing it into the corners, sides and bottom. Refrigerate while you prepare the rest of the pie. Lightly dust the work surface with flour and roll out the smaller disc of dough into a 20-by-12-inch rectangle. Place a ruler along the 12-inch side of the dough and make a mark with a pizza cutter every 1/2 inch. Turn the ruler along each mark and use it as a guide to cut a straight line, making twelve 1/2-inch strips that are 20 inches long. Transfer the strips of dough to a baking sheet, laying them diagonally so they fit and dusting the strips with flour as you lay them down. Refrigerate while you make the filling so the dough does not begin to stick together. For the filling: In a large bowl, mix together the plums, granulated sugar, cornstarch, almond extract, orange zest and juice, cinnamon, ginger and salt, making sure the plums are evenly coated. Let sit no more than 5 minutes. To assemble: Evenly spread the filling over the crust on the baking sheet. Lay one of the dough strips diagonally across the baking sheet from one corner to the other. Repeat laying strips parallel to the first piece evenly across the rest of the pie. You can cut strips down to size as you work your way towards the end of the pie, making sure to leave a bit of overhang on both sides. Take every other strip of dough and fold it back over itself so that it exposes a little more than half of the filling. Lay a long strip of dough in the opposite direction, going diagonally from one corner to the other. Fold the dough strips back down and you will begin to see a lattice form. Fold back every other strip of dough that you didn&#39;t fold back before, and then lay another strip of dough diagonally across the pie, working towards a corner. Continue this process until half the pie has a lattice top. Then rotate the pan and repeat the same process on the other side to finish the lattice. Fold the dough hanging over the sides of the pie up and over the edge, tucking the ends of the strips from the lattice top inside. This will ensure the strips of dough stay anchored to the edges of the pie. Crimp the edges of the dough using your pointer fingers and thumb to pinch the dough together. Whisk together the heavy cream and egg and brush evenly over the lattice top and edges of the pie. Sprinkle the entire pie with turbinado sugar and bake until the crust is a deep golden brown and bubbles form towards the middle of the pie, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Let cool completely, at least 40 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35496,&quot;Greek Roll 2 sheets nori 4 ounces roasted red peppers, cut into thin strips (if canned, drain before using) 8 to 10 kalamata olives, pitted and halved 1 to 2 ounces crumbled feta cheese 1 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced into thin strips Pickled ginger, for serving Wasabi, for serving Soy sauce, for serving Instructions: Place 1 sheet of nori lengthwise on a bamboo mat, shiny-side down. Position the sheet about 1-inch from the side of the mat closest to you. Wet your hands in cool water and take a handful of sushi rice. Place the rice in the center of the nori and use your fingers to spread the rice evenly over it. Next place the roasted red peppers, olives, feta, and cucumber horizontally across the roll. Use the mat to roll up the sushi, pinching and squeezing the mat to shape it into a round cigar shape. Slice into 1-inch thick rolls with a sharp knife. Turn rolls onto their sides so the rice is facing upwards, and serve with the pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce. 3 cups water 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup short-grain sushi rice 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar Place the water and salt in a medium sized saucepan and cover it with a tight-fitting lid.

Lightly beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk about 1/4 cup of the warm corn mixture into the beaten egg yolks, then pour into the saucepan and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon, about 5 minutes. Transfer the hot custard to a blender and pulse until smooth (keep the filler cap slightly open to let steam escape). Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; discard the solids. Stir often until the mixture cools to room temperature. Lightly press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. (For faster chilling, set the bowl of custard in a bowl of ice water and stir until cold.) Freeze the cold custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, 2 to 3 hours. Scoop the ice cream into bowls. Top with caramel corn or a splash of bourbon, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35500,&quot;When Pigs Fly Po-Boys 4 (1 to 1 1/4 pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed 1 quart apple cider 1/4 cup sugar 2 ounces salt 2 ounces pork magic seasoning 2 ounces Creole mustard 4 pieces (2 feet long) aluminum foil 3 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes 3 large onions, sliced into 1-inch rounds 4 ounces red cabbage, shredded 4 ounces green cabbage, shredded 2 ounces Vidalia onion dressing 1 carrot, shredded 8 ounces butter 2 ounces Haco Swiss Fond Lis (brown gravy) 1 quart water 6 French bread pistolettes, halved Instructions: Clean the pork tenderloins of all fat.

Spray a football cake pan with nonstick cooking spray and put on a baking sheet. Prepare one of the cake mixes according to the package instructions. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Let cool in the pan for about 20 minutes, then remove from the pan to a cooling rack. Repeat with the second cake mix to make another football cake layer. Level each cake: Using a serrated knife, slice the uneven top of each cake to create a smooth, flat, even surface. Leave one cake trimmed-side up and flip the other cake over so the domed football shape/side is facing up. For the mouth: The mouth should be oriented 2 inches from the tip of the cake. On the cake half with the domed football shape facing up, measure about 2 1/2 inches from the pointed end of the football down toward the center. This point will be the top of the mouth. From that point, using a paring knife, carefully outline a half oval or crescent shape to form a mouth. The mouth opening should be roughly 6 inches wide and 3 1/2 inches from top to bottom. The edge points of the mouth should be about 1/2 inch from the edge of the cake. Once you have created an outline, go back and cut into the outline about halfway down into the cake. Carefully remove the cut-out piece to form the mouth. Scoop out some of the cake with a spoon if needed to make the mouth deeper. To assemble, frost and decorate: Transfer 1 3/4 cans of white frosting to a disposable pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip (or cut off the tip of the bag to create about a 1/2-inch opening). For the blue-grey frosting (shark back): Mix together 1 can of frosting with the black gel food coloring and 5 drops of the blue gel food coloring. Mix until uniform in color. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip (or cut off the tip of the bag to create about a 1/2-inch opening). For the red frosting (shark jaw): Combine 1/4 can of frosting with 10 to 15 drops of red gel food coloring. Mix until uniform in color. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip (or cut off the tip of the bag to create about a 1/2-inch opening). For the blue frosting (water): Mix together 1 can of frosting with the remaining 5 drops of blue gel food coloring. Mix until uniform in color. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip (or cut off the tip of the bag to create about a 1/2-inch opening). Pipe a layer of white frosting on the flat top of the football cake layer (the layer without the mouth cut out) and spread the frosting with an offset spatula. Place the other cake layer with the mouth cut out flat-side down on top to form a football-shaped cake. Slice off 4 inches from the tip of the bottom of the cake to create a flat bottom. Pipe some frosting in the center of a 12-inch cardboard cake round. Carefully stand the cake upright, flat-bottom down, onto the frosting on the cardboard cake round. Apply a thin crumb coat of white frosting over the entire cake except in the cut-out mouth. Smooth out the frosting with an offset spatula. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes to harden the frosting. Pipe the white frosting on the bottom/belly of the shark around the mouth and smooth it out with an offset spatula. Pipe the blue grey frosting on the top/back of the shark and smooth out with an offset spatula. Pipe the red frosting around the perimeter of the mouth to create jaws. Insert the pumpkin seeds and slivered almonds in rows into the red frosting to form the teeth. Press the chocolate-covered mint candies on either side of the shark into the grey frosting to form the eyes. Dab a little white frosting on each eye to create a reflection. Towards the top of the shark head/nose, press the end of a chopstick into the white frosting to make 2 nostril holes. Pipe blue and white frosting around the base of the shark cake to create water and white-tipped waves around the shark. Sprinkle the white sugar pearls onto the white frosting to mimic little bubbles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 35506,&quot;Hearty and Healthy 3 Bean Minestrone 8 cups Parmigiano and Herb-Fortified Stock, recipe follows 4 Roasted Tomatoes, chopped, recipe follows 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus some for drizzling 1 1/8-inch-thick slice prosciutto di Parma, about 1/4 pound, optional 1 onion, chopped 2 to 3 ribs celery, finely chopped 2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped 4 cloves roasted garlic (from roasted tomato recipe), recipe follows 1 red cl pepper, finely chopped or thinly sliced (recommended: Fresno or Holland) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 pound small potatoes, chopped or 1 cup small pasta 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained 1 (15 to 15.5-ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained 5 ounces fresh, thin green beans, cut into thirds 1 small head escarole or small bundle chard, shredded Lemon zest Parmesan cheese, shredded, for topping Hot, crusty bread for mopping 1 large rind trimmed from a hunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or a few small pieces rind perhaps saved-up Herb bundle of several sprigs each fresh thyme, parsley and rosemary, tied 1 onion, peeled and quartered 2 ribs celery, sliced on angle 2 carrots, sliced on angle Peeled rind of 1 lemon 2 fresh bay leaves 4 cups chicken stock 12 cups (3 quarts) water 24 ripe organic vine tomatoes or large plum tomatoes Several cloves garlic, crushed Extra-virgin olive oil, for liberal drizzling Instructions: Set aside or prepare the stock and roasted tomatoes. Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium to medium-high heat, add extra-virgin olive oil, a couple of turns of the pan. Add the prosciutto and stir a couple of minutes. Add the chopped onions, celery, carrots, garlic, and cl pepper, season with salt, and pepper. If you are using potatoes, add them here. If you are using pasta, heat a second medium pot of water to a boil for the pasta and cook according to package directions for al dente. Cool the pasta and drizzle with a touch of extra-virgin olive oil. Cover and store separately from the soup. Cover the pan and sweat the vegetables 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cannellini beans, garbanzo beans, prepared stock and prepared tomatoes. Bring the soup to a boil and add the green beans. Bring the soup back to a bubble, then turn off the heat and cool the soup. Store the soup in the refrigerator for a make-ahead meal. To reheat the soup: Place the soup over medium-high heat. Crisp up the bread in a warm oven. When the soup comes to a boil, stir in the cooked pasta, escarole, and a little lemon zest. Turn off the heat when pasta is warmed through. Serve the soup in shallow bowls and top with cheese, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, and crusty bread alongside for mopping. For the stock: Place the cheese rind, herb bundle, onion, celery, carrots, lemon rind, bay leaves, chicken stock, and water into a pot and bring to a bubble, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer at least 1 hour, and then remove the rind, herb bundle, and vegetables with a slotted spoon or strainer. For the tomatoes: Heat the oven to 500 degrees F.

Turn off the mixer and use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl, pushing everything back towards the center. Then add the salt, vanilla and egg, and blend until combined. Lower the speed of the mixer and add the flour in 1/2-cup intervals. Between each addition be sure to completely blend in all the flour and scrape the sides as before. Once completely combined, scrape the dough out of the mixer, add to a container with a lid and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator and, using a tablespoon, scoop out the dough and roll into a ball between your hands. Then roll the formed ball in the turbinado sugar and place on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat for the rest of the balls, making sure to separate them on the sheet by about 1 inch. Try chopping roasted peanuts and adding them to the sugar before rolling out all the balls or add a drop of food coloring to the sugar to make the cookies even more festive! Once all the balls are on the baking sheet, make an indentation in the center of each using the rounded end of a wooden spoon, the back of a rounded teaspoon or your good old-fashioned thumb. Fill the center of each with about 1/2 teaspoon strawberry preserves. Bake until lightly golden, about 12 minutes. Remove to a wire rack. Let cool before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 35530,&quot;Shrimp, Spiced Mango, and Avocado Salad with Citrus Dressing 1/4 cup grapeseed oil 2 tablespoons Spanish-style smoked paprika 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest 1 tablespoon coarsely cracked black pepper 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne 3 cloves garlic, minced 12 extra-large shrimp (U-12), peeled and deveined 2 tablespoons lime juice 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/4 teaspoon finely grated lime zest 1/4 cup grape seed oil 1/4 cup olive oil Coarse salt 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 loosely packed cups torn, soft lettuces, such as red oak and lolla rossa 1/4 cup finely diced red onion 1 mango, peeled, seeded, and diced 1 Haas avocado, peeled, seeded, and diced Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Make the marinade: Whisk together all the ingredients in a large bowl. Reserve 2 teaspoons of the marinade. Add the shrimp to the marinade and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 6. Make the vinaigrette: In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, mustard, zest, and reserved marinade. While whisking, drizzle in the oils to form a smooth vinaigrette. Set aside. Make the salad: Remove the shrimp from the marinade; scrape off any excess marinade from the shrimp. Season the shrimp, to taste, with salt. Heat the oil in a large skillet over a medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook, turning once, until just cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Remove the skillet from the heat. In a bowl, toss together the onion, mango and avocado. Dress lightly with some of the vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. In a another bowl, lightly toss the lettuce with some of the vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper.

Crush the tomatoes with your hands. Put the olive oil and garlic in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the garlic is translucent and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until warm, about 30 seconds, then add the tomatoes. Fill each reserved can halfway with water, swish to collect any remaining tomato juice and add to the pan. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 35 minutes. Stir in the whole basil sprigs, season with salt and black pepper and remove from the heat. You should have about 6 cups of sauce. For the crepes: Puree the eggs, flour, milk, water and 1 teaspoon salt in a blender until smooth. Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Heat an 8-inch stainless steel skillet over medium-low heat (see Cook&#39;s Note). Pour 1/4 cup of the batter off center into the pan with a ladle or measuring cup, then swirl to coat the bottom. Cook until the crepe looks dry and pulls away from the sides of the pan, 1 to 2 minutes per side. The crepes should not take on any color. (It usually takes one or two tries to get it right so adjust the heat as needed.) Transfer the crepe to a plate. Continue cooking the crepes with the remaining batter, stacking them on the plate when they are done. You should have about 16 good crepes. At this point the crepes can be wrapped tightly and stored on the plate in the refrigerator up to 1 day. For the filling: Combine the ricotta, mozzarella, Parmigiano, Pecorino, parsley, nutmeg, 1 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. To assemble, preheat the oven to 375F. Cover the bottom of each of two 9-by-13-inch baking dishes with 1 1/2 cups sauce (it is fine to also add the basil sprigs to the bottom of the dish if you like). Divide the filling among the crepes (about 1/4 cup each) and spread it in a line down the center of each crepe. Roll the crepes into cylinders (leaving the ends open) and fit them snugly in the baking dishes, seam-side down. Spoon 1 cup of the sauce in a line down the center of each baking dish (it will only partially cover the crepes). The manicotti can be assembled up to this point, covered tightly and refrigerated overnight; remove the covering before baking. Cover the baking dishes with lids or aluminum foil and bake until the filling is heated through and the sauce is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the cover, sprinkle with some Parmigiano and continue to bake until the cheese is melted and the edges are light brown, 5 to 10 minutes more. Heat the remaining sauce in a small saucepan or the microwave and serve alongside the manicotti. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 35548,&quot;Dark Chocolate Whoopie Pies with Toasted Almond Cream 4 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped<br> 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, cubed<br> 1 cup sugar<br> 3 large eggs<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1/3 cup dark cocoa powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking sheets 1 1/4 cups whole milk 1 cup slivered almonds, toasted<br> 1/3 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 3 large egg yolks<br> 1 teaspoon almond extract<br> 1/2 cup melted dark chocolate, optional Instructions: For the whoopee pies: Position 2 oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Combine both kinds of chocolate and the butter in a medium heatproof bowl. Fill a medium pot about a third of the way with water and bring to a simmer. Place the over the simmering water and lower the heat. Melt the chocolate and butter gently together, stirring and scraping the sides to avoid scorching, until melted, then remove the bowl from the heat. Cool 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk together the sugar, eggs and vanilla in another bowl. Set aside. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking powder in another bowl. Whisk in the egg and then the chocolate mixture. Do not overmix. Spray 2 baking sheets with nonstick spray and drop the batter on them in large spoonfuls about 2 inches in diameter, leaving room between each to allow spreading. Bake, rotating and switching the positions of baking sheets halfway through, until the whoopee pies puff up slightly and settle, 6 to 8 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheet before gingerly lifting them off and transferring to a flat surface. For the filling: Heat the milk in a medium saucepan until hot and add 3/4 cup toasted almonds. Turn off the heat. Allow the almonds to steep in the milk 25 to 30 minutes. Strain the milk and pour it back into the same pan. Beat together the sugar, cornstarch, flour and egg yolks in an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour some of the hot milk mixture over the eggs and blend. Pour the egg mixture back into the milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the almond extract and continue to cook until the mixture begins to bubble, then cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring. Transfer to a bowl and cover with a layer of plastic pressed against the surface so the cream doesn&#39;t form a skin. Refrigerate 1 hour. Sandwich some of the cream and the remaining 1/4 cup toasted almonds between chocolate rounds. Drizzle with melted chocolate if using.

Liberally sprinkle the pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat the canola oil in a large ovenproof skillet or grill pan set over high heat. Once the oil is hot, sear the pork chops for about 3 minutes on each side. Stick the pan in the oven to finish cooking the pork, 18 to 20 minutes. This should result in medium to medium-well chops, still slightly pink in the middle. If you prefer a more well-done chop, add a few more minutes to the cooking time in the oven.

Put the chicken into a heavy resealable bag or 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Add the oil, parsley, shallots and garlic; sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and mix in the bag or toss in the baking dish until the chicken is coated in the marinade. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Using tongs, remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing the oil to drain. (It&#39;s ok if some of the garlic and shallots still cling to the chicken.) Discard the marinade. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large (12- to 14-inch) skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the chicken breasts, 2 at a time, being sure to space them out in the skillet. (Avoid over-crowding, or you won&#39;t get a good sear.) Sear until light golden on the first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and sear on the other side until the chicken is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Cook the remaining 2 chicken breasts, adding another tablespoon of oil if needed. Reserve the skillet for the sauce. For the pan sauce: In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes, basil if using and the garlic; season with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Set aside. Pour out all but 2 tablespoons oil from the skillet. If the skillet is dry and more oil is needed, add about 2 tablespoons. Over medium heat, add the olives and shallots and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the vinegar and cook, scraping up any browned bits in the skillet. Whisk in the chicken broth and any pan juices the chicken released on the platter and bring to a simmer. Cook until the liquid has reduced by half. Stir in the mustard, add the seasoned tomatoes and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 1 minute; season with salt and pepper if needed. Spoon the sauce over the chicken on the platter, garnish with chopped herbs if using and serve immediately with the Winter Greens Salad on the side if desired. Put the arugula, frisee and radicchio into a salad bowl and toss to combine. Drizzle the vinegar over the greens and toss until coated; drizzle the oil over the top and toss again.

Make the Filling: In a large saucepan, combine the milk and cream and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Immediately remove from the heat and set aside. Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring constantly, until caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. (You&#39;ll smell a characteristic nutty caramel odor when the butter browns, signaling that the mixture is ready.) Whisking constantly, gradually add the butter/brown sugar mixture to the hot milk/cream mixture. If the mixture isn&#39;t smooth, blend for 20 seconds with a hand blender or pour through a fine sieve. Put the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture. Whisk in the cornstarch and salt until dissolved. Whisk the cornstarch mixture back into the hot milk mixture in the saucepan. Whisk in the Scotch. While whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Turn off the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour into the prebaked pie shell and set aside while you make the meringue. Make the Meringue: In a standing mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip the whites in a clean dry bowl on low speed until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and continue whipping on medium speed until soft peaks are formed. Gradually pour in the sugar and continue whipping on high speed until stiff and glossy. Pile the meringue onto the pie and swirl to cover, spreading it to the edge. (Making sure it touches the edge.) Bake the pie until the meringue is lightly browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Chill the pie, uncovered, at least 2 hours or overnight before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 35579,&quot;Taco Pie 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 8 corn tortillas, halved 1 small onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced Pinch of cayenne pepper 3/4 pound ground pork Kosher salt 1 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes 2 4.25-ounce cans chopped green chiles 1 cup frozen corn 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1 cup shredded mozzarella (preferably reduced sodium) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

To make the coconut meringue, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks. Add the sugar slowly and continue to whip until sugar is dissolved and meringue reaches the stiff peak stage. Fold in the toasted shredded coconut and place meringue into a pastry bag with a plain round tip. Pipe the meringue onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper into a circular motion to create a disk the diameter of 4-ounce ramekins. Bake until light golden brown, about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. For the mango Tart Tatin: In a medium skillet, over medium high heat, combine the water, sugar, honey, and lemon juice. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and add them to the skillet. Cook until the mixture just starts to caramelize, and add the mangos. Stir until the mangos are coated. Continue to cook for 2 minutes, and then remove from heat. With a slotted spoon remove mangos from cooking liquid. Place mangos into a container and let cool to room temperature. Reserve the cooking liquid for the sauce. When the mangos have cooled, pack them into a buttered, 4-ounce ceramic ramekin and bake approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and invert onto a coconut meringue disk. To make the tangerine honey sauce, add the mint leaves to the warm cooking liquid from the mangos. Stir to incorporate, set aside, and keep at room temperature. To make the papaya sorbet, dissolve the sugar and water in a large container. Add the papaya puree and lemon juice and freeze in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer&#39;s directions. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.

Whip the egg yolks with 2 tablespoons sugar until creamy and yellow. Whip the egg whites to soft peaks and add the remaining sugar to the whites. Continue to whip the whites to stiff peaks. Carefully fold the beaten egg whites into the yolk/sugar combination. Using the same care, fold in the sifted flour. Line a cookie sheet with the baker=s parchment paper, pour the cake batter, and spread the batter out to evenly coat the pan. Bake in the center of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Cool the cake quickly near an open window and on a rack. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Assemble the baked Alaska by cutting the sponge cake to the basic shape of the bombe mold. The largest piece will be used for lining the mold and a smaller piece will be used for the top which later will be inverted to become the bottom. Line the bombe mold with plastic wrap and then line the plastic with the larger piece of baked and cooled cake. Remove the ice cream and sorbet from the freezer and allow to soften for 10 minutes. Spoon or scoop the sorbet first into the cake lined mold and create an even layer on the bottom (later the top) of the mold. Cover the sorbet with the ice cream in the same fashion, smoothing out the ice cream as you go, into one even layer. Place the remaining layer of cake on top of the ice cream layer to act as a seal and place the whole bombe into the freezer for 4 to 5 hours. This can be done well in advance of finishing the baked Alaska. To finish the Alaska whip the egg whites to soft peaks, add the sugar and continue to whip to stiff but not dry peaks. Pour the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a star tube and unmold the bombe. Use hot towels to help loosen the bombe if necessary and invert the bombe onto a heat proof serving platter. Remove the plastic wrap and pipe a decorative design of meringue all around the base of the, now revealed, cake covered bombe. Cover the entire bombe with this meringue in as decorative a design as you can manage, being as creative as you like, but working quickly to avoid melting too much of the ice cream and sorbet.

Grind the Paniolo spice together with the coffee and salt (or the coffee with paprika, cumin, salt and pepper). Rub spice mixture over all the ribs. Place ribs in a heavy roasting pan and cook uncovered for 12 minutes, drain off excess fat. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Mix together water and Worcestershire sauce and pour around ribs. Cover pan tightly with foil and bake until tender, about 1 hour 45 minutes. Ribs may be prepared to this point a few days in advance. To prepare barbecue, light the Keawe wood and allow it to burn until coals are medium hot and spread out. Cook ribs 3 minutes on each side and dip or brush ribs in the sauce and cook slowly for another 5 to 6 minutes. Be careful not to burn the ribs. Warm a little Kona Coffee BBQ sauce to serve on the side. Serve with grilled corn and campfire potato salad or your favorite sides. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 35601,&quot;Spicy Chili with Chicken Finger Dumplings 12 ounces cooked frozen chicken fingers and/or chicken nuggets, thawed 1/2 cup milk Two 15.5-ounce cans pinto beans 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon chili powder One 16-ounce jar salsa Kosher salt 4 cups chicken broth 1 large egg, beaten 3 tablespoons cornstarch 1/3 cup sour cream 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Using your hands or the back of a paring knife, scrape off half of the breading from the chicken fingers. Discard the excess breading. Put the chicken fingers into a mixing bowl with the milk and use your hands to break up the chicken into smaller pieces. Place 1 can of the pinto beans along with its liquid into the bowl of a food processor. Blend until completely smooth. Transfer to a bowl and reserve. Do not wash the food processor; you will be using it again to make the chicken dumplings. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chili powder and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the salsa and cook for 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth and blended pinto beans. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the chicken finger dumplings. Add the chicken fingers and egg to the used food processor bowl. Blend until it resembles a chunky puree (similar to tuna fish). Transfer the puree to a mixing bowl and stir in the cornstarch. Add the remaining can of beans with their liquid to the stew. Then drop rounded teaspoons of the dumpling batter into the stew, making about 24 dumplings. Cover with a lid and cook until the dumplings are cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. To serve, divide the stew among 6 bowls. Top with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of cilantro leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 35602,&quot;Gina&#39;s Drunken Goat Grilled Cheese 4 slices sourdough bread Roasted Shallot Mayo, recipe follows 1 cup (4 ounces) drunken goat cheese, grated Baby arugula Butter, room temperature 1 shallot, peeled 1 clove garlic, peeled Olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup mayonnaise Instructions: Heat a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat.
