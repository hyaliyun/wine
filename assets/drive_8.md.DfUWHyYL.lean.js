Let the tannins unwind for another year or two, then drink up to catch the remaining fruit.","province":"Tuscany"},{"country":"fr","description":"Soft, ripe and rounded, this shows a gentle side of Bordeaux. The tannins are sweet, just hinting at wood, but this is more about blackberries and a finishing sweetness.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"US","description":"A welcome barnyard funk of sour cherry, wet leather and mulched shrubbery kicks off the nose on this wine from the likable Joey Gummere, once know for the Kenneth-Crawford wines. Fennel seed flavors and violet characters emerge on the very pretty palate, which has both tannins and mouth-washing acid on the finish.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The name means ‚Äúfive chosen‚Äù and references the barrels selected for this reserve-level wine.

The taut, luminous palate offers sour cherry and star anise accompanied by polished tannins and racy acidity.","province":"Piedmont"},{"country":"US","description":"Dry and silky in the mouth, it has cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. However, the wine is compromised by a mushroomy, vegetal unripeness.

It's high-toned and slightly volatile, with some heat in the finish.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Awesomely rich, with massive tropical fruit, pear, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors, finished with cinnamon spice. Acidity is high and crisp, and a bright scour of minerals brings balance. Made in the modern style, this is a Chardonnay to drink with lobster and scallops.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A solid Cabernet. Ripe, tannic and well-oaked, it displays a range of blackberry, currant, cedar and spice flavors, girded with a firm minerality. Dry and balanced, it's a bit astringent and young now, and could develop interesting bottle complexities.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Enticing fragrances suggest alpine wild flower, stone fruit and savory herb.

It's an elegant, tightly structured wine that's stunning now but will hold nicely through 2020.","province":"Mosel"},{"country":"es","description":"Opaque in color, with blackberry and licorice aromas but also a distinct streak of brambly herbs and green. Later on, pine needle and tartness enter the fray. This is a commendable modern Rioja but it does have a few issues, namely a green herbal component.","province":"Northern es"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a new project from Christophe Baron. The aromas pop, with notes of earth, plum, nori, iron, sea salt, herb, olive tapenade, black pepper and smoked meat. The palate is concentrated and structured, with rich yet restrained bacon fat and smoke flavors that bring a sense of vibrancy and richness along with a near endless finish. It brings a fair amount of tannic heft that will benefit from some additional time in the bottle. Best from 2024-2028.","province":"Oregon"},{"country":"cl","description":"If you like a ton of oak, then this may be up your alley. Early aromas of tea and cherry quickly step aside as heavy, toasted wood notes take over. The palate is full and round, with weight, thickness and heavy berry and chocolate flavors. There's some Pinot character here, but put it on the scale and it's going to weigh out on the heavy side. To our taste, it's very New World and clumsy.","province":"Leyda Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"Floral and fresh from notes of crisp apple and lemon, this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc is piercingly brisk with tight, nervy effervescence. A hint of roasted nuts lingers on the medium-long finish.","province":"New York"},{"country":"fr","description":"There is a vivid pink color on this caramel and ripe fruit-flavored wine. It has weight, probably too much, losing the freshness and acidity. Vanilla and super-ripe strawberries dominate.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"cl","description":"This blend of Syrah, Carmen√®re and Malbec is better than EW's varietal wines made from those same grapes, which proves that sometimes blends are best. It offers plum, currant and floral aromas before a fairly rich palate.

It's rich with nicely chalky tannins on the palate, with flavors of cooked black cherry, black tea and licorice.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency.

There's a good sizzle of acidity to the palate and a steely texture, but it's a tad ripe with lemon candy and spun-sugar flavors.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"An interesting and complex wine, dry and crisp, and unique among California Sauvignon Blancs. Although there's plenty of citrus fruit, it's marked by other things, such as minerals and herbs, and the sweet, olivaceous taste that the variety's Sauvignon nature contributes in a cool vintage.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a textured, dense and concentrated selection that has notes of white fruits and white flowers. It's a wine for medium-term aging.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"US","description":"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but that's part of its charm. Without such ripeness, the wine wouldn't have the briary berry, sweet dried currant and leathery flavors. New oak, to the tune of 25%, adds an even richer layer of char. Quite an accomplishment. Drink with barbecue or big, hearty beef dishes.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A blend of Evergreen vineyard fruit and old-vine Riesling sourced from a pair of Yakima Valley vineyards, this feels drier than its 1.8% residual sugar.

It has the heft to take on a range of spicy foods.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"This wine is comprised of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc.

The only problem is a lasting salty, wood-dominated essence.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"de","description":"Even tasted blind, this wine comes across as a bit warm. The 15% alcohol imparts a thick, rich consistency in the mouth, while the flavors stay true to the site, showing notes of ripe peaches, citrus and hints of home heating oil. It's certainly impressive, but the alcohol shows through a bit on the finish, suggesting near-term consumption.","province":"Rheingau"},{"country":"at","description":"Very slight peppery accents peek though the citrus and yeast notes of this light-bodied, very slender wine.
