This Moscatel sweetie is solid in feel, but mostly around the edges; the middle palate is a bit weak. Flavors of brown sugar and caramel are more sweet and simple than complex.","designation":"Premium Moscatel"},{"country":"us","description":"With 5% Riesling in the blend, this bone-dry Sauv Blanc gains just a touch of roundness and spice. Clear, crisp flavors mix celery, gooseberry and tart melon fruit. It's very fresh, almost delicate.","designation":"Brunos Blend"},{"country":"us","description":"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices. As good as it is, it lacks a refined elegance, and its hope lies in the cellar.","designation":"Rosemary's Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Juicy Fruit gum and citrus blossom meet a chemical plastic note on the nose.

Smoke and vanilla notes add interest to the juicy, easy-to-drink cassis fruit. There's ample but not too much weight on the palate. Supple tannins. Perhaps it just needs additional cellaring time to warrant the price, although it doesn't come across as needing it in the structural sense.","designation":"Ashmead Single Vineyard"},{"country":"turkey","description":"Exotic spice and savory meat tones add dimension to sultry black-fruit and fig flavors. Dry and full bodied in style, it's richly textured with a bold yet velvety tannin structure.","designation":"Vintage Single Vineyard Collectible Series #5"},{"country":"ar","description":"The foxy muddled berry aromas are puzzling.

Hollow lactic foxy red-fruit flavors are crisp but not fully convincing, while abrasive, hard-edged tannins scrape across the finish.","designation":"Colecci√≥n"},{"country":"cl","description":"Rubbery, herbaceous aromas of iodine, grass and black olive are challenging to say the least. This is high in tartaric acid, with saucy, herbal berry flavors that finish with residual olive notes.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"it","description":"Poggio di Sotto has steadily worked over the years to produce extremely elegant and polished expressions of Brunello that show the best of the local territory.

But there's just enough fresh cherry fruit to make your mouth pucker.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"us","description":"Golden-yellow in color, this bottling of a rarely planted grape from it's Campania region shows soft chamomile and sliced yellow apples on the pleasant nose. Squeezed lemon, light mandarin juice and a touch of walnut oil show on the sip, where the acid rises late and lasts long.","designation":"Oakenshield Vineyard"},{"country":"pt","description":"If you haven't tried Portuguese wines before, this impressively rich wine is a good place to start.

Shows many of the same characteristics of Napa Cabs costing far more, which makes it a relative bargain.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"The alcohol on this bottling is lower than most Fe Ciegas have been in the past, reflecting the cool vintage. The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show.

Give this several more years before drinking, certainly don't try it before 2020.","designation":"Cuv√©e Prestige"},{"country":"de","description":"Smoke, earth and bramble tones meander amidst tart stone fruit and tangerine flavors in this bristling kabinett. Off dry in style, it's juicy and effortlessly quaffable, yet subtly nuanced with lingering hints of blossom, saffron and herb.","designation":"Brauneberger Kabinett"},{"country":"us","description":"This bottling from John Tyler has been variable over the years. The 2009 offering is dry, silky and crisp, and it bears pleasant red currant, sour cherry candy and persimmon flavors. Drink now‚Äì2015.","designation":"Bacigalupi Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"This blend of 71% Roussanne, 21% Grenache Blanc and 8% Picpoul Blanc offers cut Meyer lemon, tangerine and pink-grapefruit aromas on the nose, along with the promise of a creamy palate. Instead, the palate is quite tight and restrained, starting tart but opening toward lemon rinds and pear flesh, and wiping up clean on the finish.","designation":"Esprit Blanc de Tablas"},{"country":"us","description":"A Bordeaux blend with a Right Bank inclination, this offers forward fruit aromas and flavors of bright, candied cherry. A puckery, peppery finish comes up quickly. Some 2007 Washington reds seem to be entering a dumb phase; this may need some extra bottle age to open up again.","designation":"domenica"},{"country":"it","description":"Despite its young age now, the 2006 Dardi Le Rose Bussia Barolo will go on record as a classy, charming wine with long aging potential. The mineral tones are well etched and are followed by luscious layers of red fruit and spice. The tannins still need time to soften.","designation":"Dardi Le Rose Bussia"},{"country":"fr","description":"From vines around the village of Epfig (‚ÄúE‚Äù), this is a wonderfully pure wine that's fragrant and crisp. It has apple and citrus flavors lightly blessed by honey. Acidity cuts right through the fruitiness, giving the wine a tight and steely aftertaste.","designation":"Vignoble d'E"},{"country":"pt","description":"This is a sweet, soft Port, with plenty of fruit. Sultana and orange jelly flavors are cut with some spirit. The wine leans much more towards fruit than wood, unusual for a 20-year old. The wine, like all aged tawnies, is ready to drink.","designation":"20 Anos Tawny"},{"country":"serbia","description":"This aged Riesling is medium gold colored, with pleasant aromas of lemon peel and petrol. It is round and generous on the palate, with flavors of lemon custard and green olive tapenade. The finish is long, with lingering flavors of lemon pith.","designation":"Margus Margi"},{"country":"it","description":"This crisp sparkler is characterized by drying mineral tones and delicate aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The wine is foamy and slightly sweet in the mouth and does an excellent job of representing this category of Italian wine.","designation":"Col del Sas Extra Dry"},{"country":"us","description":"There's lots of flavor going on here for a modest price. It starts with sharp, well-defined red fruit, tight and acidic, but interesting and nuanced. There's a pretty fair streak of vanilla, which suggests some sort of oak chip treatment, but it fills out the middle and delivers the sort of flavors that many consumers will love.","designation":"Traditions"},{"country":"fr","description":"A very rich, almost Port-like ripeness and dense black fruits give this wine powerful presence. It has weight and sweet fruitiness that is happily cut with acidity. Tannins provide a light reminder of the chance to age this wine. Drink now and until 2019.","designation":"Cuv√©e Prestige"},{"country":"us","description":"Ripe melons and pears dance a delicate duet on the palate‚Äîsoftly and gently shifting ever so slightly from honeydew to Bosc and back, before turning lean and citrusy on the finish.","designation":"Estate"},{"country":"fr","description":"This wine is tight, nervy and crisp, with a strongly mineral texture. There is good acidity, crisp and textured. Apples and citrus dominate this structured wine. Drink from 2019.","designation":"Mont√©e de Tonnerre Premier Cru"},{"country":"us","description":"Subtle fruit flavors mingle mountain berries, plums and cherries with enticing baking spices. There's a touch of herb, earth and tanned leather also, bringing complexity and texture into a lingering finish. Drink now through 2020.","designation":"Merci Reserve"},{"country":"cl","description":"This has a powdery nose and melony, tropical fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is pleasant and round, with vital acidity. Flavors of baked apple, buttercup and briny apricot finish smooth, with a pinch of salt.","designation":"La Joya Gran Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of sweet blue fruit, herb and spice are followed by plump, plush plum flavors that go down easy. It brings a sense of deliciousness.","designation":"The Spellbinder"},{"country":"us","description":"This wine defines luxurious texture, at once velvety, richly layered and bright. From one of the warmer sites in a cool climate zone, it complements its fruit concentration with deeper sarsaparilla, vanilla, tea and cardamom scents, the finish delightfully playful in orange peel accents.","designation":"UV Lucky Well Vineyard"}]`),V={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},M={class:"card-container"};function D(s,i,t,c,u,a){const y=p("PoemCard");return n(),r(l,null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâWine Reviewsü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",M,[(n(!0),r(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(o,f)=>(n(),m(y,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(n(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...o)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...o))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const P=h(V,[["render",D]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/39.md","filePath":"drive/39.md"}'),j={name:"drive/39.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(n(),r("div",null,[w(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,L as default};
