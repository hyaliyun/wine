When the peppers have settled into the pan, add the tomatoes and the potatoes. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste, stir well over medium-low heat, cook for about 1 hour. Use the vegetable stock to help the sauce come together, by adding a ladleful to the peperonata here and there while cooking. Depending on the tomatoes you are using and the degree of ripeness of the peppers, you might not need to use all the broth indicated in the ingredient list. Look for a nice balance between sauce and vegetables, at the end you are working on a vegetable stew...consistency of the final dish should be thicker than a pasta sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 19333,&quot;Yuca con Mojo 4 medium sized yucas, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces, or 1 pack frozen yuca 1 large Spanish onion, thinly sliced 1/2 cup sour orange juice, if unavailable, combine 1/8 cup orange juice and 1/8 cup lime juice 1 tablespoon cilantro 6 garlic cloves, crushed 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil Instructions: Boil the yuca until tender and set aside in a bowl.

Whisk the yolk mixture into the flour mixture until just combined. The batter will be lumpy. Allow the batter to rest while you whip the egg whites.<br> Put the egg whites in another medium bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat the whites until stiff peaks form, about 1 minute. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.<br> Heat an ebelskiver pan on medium heat for 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low heat. Put a cube of butter into 4 of the wells; it should barely sizzle when it hits the pan. Use the back of a spoon to slide the butter up the sides of the wells so that each well is coated and some butter pools at the bottom. Fill the buttered wells almost to the top with batter, about 2 tablespoons each. Repeat with the butter and batter in the remaining 4 wells. (You are working in batches to prevent the butter from burning.)<br> Cook until the batter puffs and bubbles on top, 3 to 4 minutes. Then take a wooden skewer, push it through the raw batter and into the bottom crust of each ebelskiver to turn it and confirm the bottom is set into a golden brown crust (if it&#39;s not, return the dumpling to its original position and let it continue to cook). Using the skewer, turn the ebelskivers so the cooked parts are half-in, half-out of the cups. Raw batter will spill into the wells but the dumplings should hold their shape. (If a dumpling does not slide up easily or hold its shape, slide it back to its original position and give it more time to cook and set.)<br> Cook until the new undersides are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Carefully stuff the desired filling into the openings. (For each ebelskiver use 1 large or 2 small raspberries, 3 or 4 semi-sweet chocolate chips or a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of fruit preserves or jam.) Use up to 1 teaspoon of additional batter to top the filling in each ebelskiver. Using the skewer and a finger, if necessary, turn the ebelskivers once more so the additional batter is now on the bottom of the wells. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more.<br> Check all sides of the ebelskivers: If there are pale spots on some, turn them down so they brown against the bottom of the pan for a few seconds. When they are done, the ebelskivers should be evenly deep golden brown and a skewer inserted deep into the dough, avoiding the filling, comes out clean. If you find that some are cooking much more quickly than others, rotate the pan occasionally to even out the heat.<br> Remove the ebelskivers from the pan. Repeat the buttering and turning process with the remaining batter to make 6 or 7 more ebelskivers. By the second batch, the pan will be significantly hotter, so you won&#39;t need to increase the heat to medium to get started and the ebelskivers will cook more quickly.<br> Dust the ebelskivers with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve warm with maple syrup.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 19367,&quot;Crespelle con Prosciutto Cotto e Fontina 1 egg 3/4 cup milk 1/4 cup flour 1 tablespoon butter, plus 1 tablespoon 6 thin slices roasted ham 6 thin slices fontina 3 fresh sage leaves 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

You want the butter to be cool but pliable.<br> You can crush the tea with a mortar and pestle or you can put it between pieces of parchment or wax paper and crush with the bottom of a glass. Any way you do it, you want to end up with enough crushed tea to measure 1 1/2 teaspoons.<br> Put the tea, sugar and salt in a large bowl and, using your fingertips, rub the ingredients together until you smell the aroma of the tea. Add the flour and stir everything together to mix well.<br> Cut the butter into 16 pieces. Drop them into the bowl, toss with your fingertips just to coat the pieces and then set to work rubbing the butter into the flour mixture to make a soft dough that will stick together when you press it between your fingers. Knead the dough gently to work it into a ball and then divide the ball in half.<br> Shape each piece of dough into a log about 7 inches long. Take care that the logs are solid-it&#39;s easy to end up with hollows (you can feel them), which will turn into holes in the cookies. Wrap the logs and refrigerate them for at least 3 hours, or freeze for at least 1 hour.<br> When you&#39;re ready to bake: Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.<br> Sprinkle some raw, sanding or granulated sugar on the counter and roll the logs in it, just to coat the exterior. Trim the ends of the logs if they&#39;re ragged, then slice into rounds that are 1/3 inch thick. Put the cookies on the baking sheets, at least 1 inch apart.<br> Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom and front to back at the midway point, or until the cookies are golden brown on the edges and bottom but still pale on top.

Toss until the cornstarch dissolves. Let stand at room temperature until juicy, about 30 minutes. (If using frozen cherries, leave them frozen and toss them with the above ingredients). Adjust an oven rack to the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease the bottom and sides of a 10-by-15-inch baking sheet with butter. For the crust: To form the bottom crust, place 1 pie crust between two large pieces of floured parchment paper and roll into a 14-inch round. Lay the round over half of the prepared baking sheet; there will be overhang on the edges. Repeat the rolling process with a second pie crust. Lay it over the remaining exposed side of the baking sheet so that the two crusts overlap in the center of the pan; there will be overhang on the edges. Press together the overlapping crusts to make a tight seal. Transfer the filling to the crust and spread in an even layer. Dot the top with the butter. For the lattice crust: Repeat rolling the remaining 2 pie crusts into two 14-inch rounds. With a chef&#39;s knife or a pizza cutter, cut each crust into 1-inch-wide strips. Lay half the strips diagonally across the entire pie, about 1-inch apart. Weave the remaining strips diagonally across the first strips to make a lattice pattern. Trim the the lattice ends leaving an overhang, Press together the ends and the bottom edge of the crust to seal, then fold and crimp the edge as desired. Brush the lattice and edge of the crust with the cream and sprinkle generously with some granulated sugar. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 45 to 55 minutes. (If the crust browns too quickly during baking, cover the pie loosely with foil.) Let cool. For the topping: Meanwhile, whip the cream, sour cream and brown sugar in a large bowl to medium peaks. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides and place skin-side down in the pot. Brown for 4 to 6 minutes on the first side, then flip and brown for 4 to 6 minutes on the other side. Remove to a plate and set aside. Add the mushrooms, garlic, bell peppers, onion, thyme and turmeric to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and the edges are starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for an additional minute. Pour in the white wine, bring to a simmer and simmer for 3 minutes. Use your spoon to scrape the sides and bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits that might be stuck there. Add the chicken stock, diced tomatoes and chicken thighs. Season the soup with a healthy pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Fill a 4-quart pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook the egg noodles until al dente according to the package directions. Drain the noodles, put back into the pot they were cooked in and toss with a scant tablespoon of olive oil; set aside. When the chicken is ready, transfer it to a cutting board. Using 2 forks, remove the chicken from the bones and shred. Some skin will end up in the mix, which is totally fine. Add the shredded meat back to the soup. Discard the skin and bones. Add the noodles to the soup, as well as the heavy cream and 2 tablespoons of the parsley. Simmer for a few minutes to heat everything through. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as needed. Serve hot in bowls and garnish with the remaining chopped parsley. If you are making this soup ahead of time, undercook the noodles by 2 minutes as directed on the package, so they don&#39;t overcook when the soup is reheated. Alternatively, cook the noodles, drain, toss in olive oil and store separately, adding them to the soup once it has been reheated.

In a blender of a food processor, blend on high speed until the mixture becomes a smooth paste. Refrigerate overnight before use. For the shrimp: Make a small incision in the outside of the backside of the shrimp. Working with the shrimp&#39;s natural curvature, poke the tail of the shrimp up through the incision to expose the tail. Pull the tail completely through the whole so that the tail can easily serve as a toothpick. To assemble: Heat cooking oil in a large saute pan over high heat - cooking oil should coat the bottom of the pan. Add half the shrimp to the pan to cook. Move them around constantly so they will cook completely and evenly. Once the shrimp are fully cooked, add 2 heaping tablespoons of the glaze to the pan while moving the shrimp. Allow the glaze to evenly coat all the shrimp and lightly caramelize on the shrimp. Remove the shrimp from the pan. Wash the pan and repeat the process with the next 8 shrimp. Once all the shrimp have been cooked and glazed, garnish them individually with a basil leaf by sticking the leaf in through the incision made for the tail. Serve the shrimp warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 19410,&quot;Steamed-Chicken Rice Balls with Dipping Sauce 1 cup uncooked short-grain white rice 1 pound ground chicken 1 egg, well beaten 3/4 cup finely chopped onion 1 can (8 ounces) water chestnuts, finely chopped 5 pickled jalapenos, minced 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 tablespoon salt Lettuce or cabbage leaves to prevent rice balls from sticking 6 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 teaspoons simple syrup (equal amounts of sugar and water heated until sugar melts, then cooled) Instructions: Rinse rice and soak for 2 to 3 hours.

Put the apples in a medium saucepan, and add the water, sugar, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, over medium-high heat. stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Cover, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the apples are very tender, stirring frequently, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat. Gently mash the apples with fork or potato masher until the mixture is very soft, but still chunky. Cool completely. The filling can be made 2 days in advance. Cover and refrigerate. Position 1 rack in the top third of the oven, and 1 rack in the bottom third, and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Pastry: If using a 14-ounce package (1 sheet), roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to 15-inch square. If using a 16-ounce package (2 sheets), stack the pastry sheets together, and then roll them out on a lightly floured surface to a 15-inch square. Cut the pastry into 9 (5-inch) squares. Put 1 generous tablespoon of filling in the center of each of 8 squares, reserve the remaining square for another use). Lightly brush the edges of each square with beaten egg. Fold half of the pastry square over the filling, forming triangles. Press and pinch the pastry edges with fingertips to seal tightly. Lightly brush the pastry triangles with beaten egg, and sprinkle lightly with superfine sugar, if desired. Using a thin, sharp knife, make 3 small slits on top of each triangle to allow the steam to escape. Put the triangles on the prepared baking sheets. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Bake the turnovers until they are beginning to color, about 15 minutes. Reverse the baking sheets from top to bottom. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, and continue baking until the turnovers are firm and golden, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Cool at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature with and Caramel Sauce and vanilla ice cream. Over low heat, mix the water, and sugar in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook until the sugar dissolves, about 5 to 10 minutes. Do not stir. Increase the heat to medium and boil uncovered until the sugar turns a warm chestnut brown (about 350 degrees F on a candy thermometer), about 5 to 7 minutes, gently swirling the pan to stir the mixture. Be careful - the mixture is extremely hot! Watch the mixture very carefully at the end, as it will go from caramel to burnt very quickly. Turn off the heat, and stand back to avoid splattering. Slowly add the cream. Don&#39;t panic - the cream will bubble violently, and the caramel will solidify. Simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, until the caramel dissolves and the sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature, at least 4 hours. It will thicken as it sits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 19425,&quot;Marinated Mixed Olives Mixed green and black olives Olive oil, to taste Lemon zest, to taste Crushed red pepper flakes, to taste 2 rosemary sprigs, crushed Kosher salt, to taste Slivered garlic, to taste Instructions: If olives are in brine, drain and discard liquid.

I spread my potato starch onto parchment paper lined baking sheets and placed them in a slightly warm oven for a few hours. In the interim, determine or make your candy mold. You could use a Champagne cork that is cut in half. Insert a wooden dowel into the cork. I used another method. I filled a regular polycarbonate candy mold with chocolate. When the chocolate cooled, I unmolded the pieces and glued them to a flat piece of wood measuring 1-inch by 15 inches. I did it that way so I could make more indentations faster. Place the potato starch in a container that will allow you to have a layer of starch at least 1 1/2-inches deep. Carefully press the mold into the potato starch to make the indentation. Carefully remove the mold. Repeat as many times as your container will allow. Place the sugar and water in a saucepan and boil to 119 degrees C (246 degrees F). When it reaches that temperature, remove it from heat and add the alcohol. Pour the mix into the funnel tool and carefully fill the impression with the candy mixture. Carefully cover the filled impressions with more potato starch. Allow to set at warm room temperature for about 10 hours. If the candies do not have a strong setting, leave them for an additional 4 to 6 hours. Be very careful that the container is not moved or the candy mixture will not set. Be mindful of excess vibrations as well. After about 10 hours, delicately remove the candies from the potato starch. At this stage, they can be served or coated with chocolate. Serve. Jacques\\u2019 tips: The candies can also be air-brushed with color. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 19434,&quot;Garbanzo Bean Burger with Tehina Onion Sauce 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil 1/2 cup diced onions 1/2 cup carrots, grated 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon celery seed 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 cup walnuts 1 1/2 cups cooked garbanzo beans (or 1 (15 1/2-ounce) can, drained) 5 tablespoons gluten flour 2 tablespoons arrowroot powder 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped finely Oil for frying Tehina Onion Sauce, recipe follows 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 onion, minced 4 scallions, sliced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 cup tehina (tahini) 1 tablespoon white miso or sea salt, to taste 3/4 cup water 1 teaspoon rice vinegar Fresh parsley, minced Instructions: Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and saute the onions, carrots, garlic, cumin, celery seed, and salt over medium heat until the onions are transparent.

Place sweet hot mustard in a bowl. Whisk in Tamari sauce. Add stock and sesame oil to the broth and soy. Set aside. Slice the pork chop very thinly against the grain. When water for pasta boils, heat a large nonstick skillet over medium high to high heat. To the skillet, add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 2 turns of the pan in a slow stream. Add crushed pepper flakes to the oil, then the thinly sliced pork. Season pork with salt and pepper. Cook pork 2 minutes to caramelize the meat, then turn and stir-fry. Add salt to pasta water, then carrots. Blanch carrots for a minute, then remove with a slotted spoon. Add fresh linguini to boiling water. Transfer carrots to pork stir-fry. Add mushrooms, ginger, red bell pepper, scallions and bean sprouts. Toss and stir-fry veggies with pork for 2 minutes. Cook pasta to al dente. Drain and add to the pork and veggies. Pour Tamari and broth mixture over the noodles and pork. Toss and allow the noodles to completely soak up the liquids, a minute or so. Remove from heat.

Sift flour into a large bowl, 1 big enough to get both hands inside. Cut the shortening into the flour with a fork until it becomes the texture of moist meal. Add buttermilk and stir it in with a fork. Add another dash or two if dough isn&#39;t sticky. The trick is to get dough just as moist and sticky as possible, but not too sticky to work. Work dough into a ball in the center of the bowl and sprinkle lightly with flour so it won&#39;t stick to your hands. Lift ball of dough out and knead gently on a floured dough board or smooth surface. Fold the dough over in a clockwise manner with one hand and press it out with the other hand. Don&#39;t over knead ? just to the point where the dough is soft and consistent. Pinch off a golf ball size ball and press out between the palms to about a quarter to 1/2-inch thickness and lay out on a slightly greased (with shortening) bread pan. Bake in oven for about 15 minutes. The secret here is to learn, through trial and error, how to get the dough as full of buttermilk as possible and yet keep it manageable. The nostalgic, real homemade taste comes from the buttermilk-soaked dough. Biscuits can be served with butter or a ladle of gravy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 19447,&quot;Lemon Curd Trifle with Fresh Berries 6 large egg yolks 1 cup sugar 4 lemons, zested and juiced 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut in chunks 1 pint fresh strawberries, stemmed and halved lengthwise 1 pint fresh blueberries 1 pint fresh blackberries 2 cups sweetened whipped cream 1 prepared lemon pound cake, sliced 1/4 cup Limoncello or Grand Marnier liqueur (optional) Fresh mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: To make the lemon curd: Bring a pot of water to a simmer over medium-low heat. Combine the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, and zest in a metal or glass heat-resistant bowl and whisk until smooth. Set the bowl over the simmering water, without letting the bottom touch, and continue to whisk. Keep working-out that arm and whisk it vigorously for a good 10 minutes, until the curd has doubled in volume and is very thick and yellow. Don&#39;t let it boil. Remove the bowl from heat and whisk in the butter, a couple of chunks at a time, until melted. Refrigerate until the custard is cold and firm. To build the trifle: put the berries in a mixing bowl and toss them together so they are evenly distributed. Fold the whipped cream into the chilled lemon curd to lighten it up into a mousse. Line a glass trifle bowl with pieces of pound cake to fit. Drizzle or brush the cake with the Limoncello, spoon a layer of the lemon curd over the cake, and then a layer of mixed berries. Repeat the layers until the ingredients are used up, the last layer looks best if it&#39;s the berries. Chill before serving. Garnish with fresh mint. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 19448,&quot;Chicken Liver Pate 4 large onions, thinly sliced 1/4 cup/60 ml olive oil, plus more if needed Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds/675 g chicken livers, trimmed 2 small carrots, cooked 4 hard-boiled eggs A pinch of nutmeg Bread, toast or crackers, for serving Instructions: In a skillet over medium heat, saute the onions in half of the olive oil until caramelized, about 30 minutes. Remove half of the onions from the skillet and set aside. Add the remaining olive oil and continue cooking over high heat until the onions are crispy and golden brown; add more olive oil if necessary. Drain on paper towels, season with salt and pepper and set aside for garnish. In a small pot of salted simmering water, poach the chicken livers for 5 minutes on low heat. Drain on paper towels. In a food processor, puree the livers with the carrots, 2 hard-boiled eggs and the caramelized onions until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Add nutmeg. Push through a fine mesh sieve if desired. Pack the mousse into a serving dish and smooth the top. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Garnish with the crispy onions and grate the remaining 2 hard-boiled eggs right before serving.

Combine milk and half of the sugar in a large saucepan and heat gently. Place the almonds on a sheet pan and toast in the oven, shaking the pan occasionally, for 5 to 6 minutes or until almonds are light brown. Add the almonds immediately to the milk and sugar mixture. Once the milk mixture comes to a gentle boil, remove from the heat, cover and let steep 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, place the milk mixture on low heat. While this is heating, combine the remaining sugar with the egg yolks and either by hand or with an electric mixer, whisk until the eggs become pale in color, about 3 minutes. Slowly drizzle a little of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture to increase the temperature of the yolk mixture. Next, slowly whisk the yolk mixture into the milk mixture. Cook the mixture over a low heat, stirring constantly. Once the mixture has thickened and coats the back of the spoon, about 3 to 5 minutes, remove from heat and strain through a find sieve into a high-sided canister. Add the saffron and amaretto and place in a large bowl of ice water. Stir occasionally and when completely cool, place in an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. The texture will then be best if you transfer the ice cream to another container and place in freezer for at least 3 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 19450,&quot;Curried Shrimp and Corn Chowder 1 tablespoon coconut oil 1 onion, diced<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 teaspoons curry powder<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> 3 ears corn, shucked, kernels cut off the cobs, cobs reserved<br> 1 quart low-sodium chicken stock<br> One 15-ounce can light coconut milk<br> 2 teaspoons tamarind paste<br> 1 teaspoon brown sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 pound (51/60 count) shrimp, shells removed, deveined<br> Juice of 1/2 lime<br> Fresh cilantro leaves and thinly sliced Fresno cl, for serving<br> Instructions: Heat coconut oil in a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.

Line a large rimmed baking pan with foil. Place the ribs on the prepared baking pan meat-side up. Sprinkle them with the paprika, garlic powder, 1 tablespoon salt and a generous amount of pepper. Rub the spices all over the ribs. Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake until the meat is very tender and can easily be pulled off the bone, about 2 hours. For the barbecue sauce: Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring often, until very soft and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the ketchup, orange juice, Worcestershire, chipotles and adobo and 1/2 cup water. Increase the heat to bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to keep at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth (be careful when blending hot liquids). Alternately, an immersion blender can be used in the pot. Finish the ribs: Preheat the grill to medium-high (or set the oven to broil). Reserve about a cup of the barbecue sauce for serving alongside the ribs. Brush a small amount of the remaining sauce on the bone side of the ribs and a generous amount on the meaty side. Grill the ribs, meaty-side up, until the underside is lightly charred, about 3 minutes. Turn the ribs over and grill until the meaty side is charred in spots, 3 to 5 minutes (if using the oven, simply broil for 3 to 5 minutes). Transfer to a cutting board and cut each rack in half. Serve immediately with the reserved sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Zinfandel, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 19453,&quot;Tomato and Spinach Soup 2 tablespoons evoo, extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 1 large shallot, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice, drained 1 can crushed tomatoes, 28 ounces 2 cups good quality vegetable stock, available in soup aisle 1/2 ten-ounce sack triple washed spinach, stems removed and spinach shredded with knife Salt and pepper to your taste Instructions: Heat a medium soup pot over moderate heat.

Keep the milk on low heat. Make a white roux by melting butter over low-medium heat in a thick-bottomed saucepan. Just as the foam subsides, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to coat the flour and remove the starchy taste. Do not allow to brown. Remove from heat, then gradually add a bit of the warm milk to the roux and whisk vigorously. Return the saucepan to the heat and bring up to a low simmer, continuing to add more milk and whisk. Cook for 5 minutes until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Check seasoning; add salt, white pepper, garlic and the remaining bay leaf. To prevent a skin from forming as the sauce cools, lay a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface.

On the stovetop, brown the lamp, fat-side down, in a large roasting pan. Remove when nicely browned across its middle (you won&#39;t get much more than this) and set aside while you fry the shallots, garlic and carrot briefly. Just tip them into the pan - you won&#39;t need to add any more fat - and cook them, sprinkled with the salt, gently for a couple of minutes. Pour the water over and then replace the lamb, this time fat side up. Let the liquid in the pan come to a boil, then tent with foil and put in the preheated oven. Now just leave it there while you sleep. I find that if I put the lamb in before I go to bed, it&#39;s perfect by lunchtime the next day. But the point is, at this temperature, nothing&#39;s going to go wrong with the lamb if you cook it for a little less or a little more. If you want to cook the lamb the day you&#39;re going to eat it, heat the oven to 325 degrees F and give it 5 hours or so. The point is to find a way of cooking that suits you: you know what sort of pottering relaxes you and what makes you feel constrained; how much time you&#39;ve got, and how you want to use it. Don&#39;t let the food, the kitchen or the imagined expectations of other people bully you. With the homily over, about 1 hour before you want to eat, remove the lamb from the pan to a large plate or carving board - not that it needs carving; the deal here is that it&#39;s unfashionably overcooked, falling to tender shreds a the touch of a fork. This is the best way to deal with shoulder of lamb: it&#39;s cheaper than leg, and the flavor it deeper, better, truer, but even good carvers, which I most definitely am not, can get unstuck trying to slice it. To finish the lamb salad, simply pull it into pieces with a couple of forks on a large plate. Sprinkle with more sea salt and some freshly chopped mint, then cut the pomegranate in 1/2 and dot with the seeds from 1 of the halves. This is easily done; there&#39;s a simple trick, which means you never have to think of winkling out the jeweled pips with a safety pin ever again. Simply hold the pomegranate 1/2 above the plate, take a wooden spoon and start bashing the curved skin side with it. Nothing will happen for a few seconds, but have faith. In a short while the glassy red, juicy beads will start raining down. Take the other 1/2 and squeeze the preposterously pink juices over the warm shredded meat. Take to the table and serve. What I do with the leftovers is warm a pita bread in the microwave, and then spread it with a greedy dollop of hummus, then take the chill off the refrigerated lamb in the microwave and stuff the already gooey pita with it. Add freshly chopped mint, black pepper and whatever else you like; raw, finely chopped red onion goes dangerously well. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 19460,&quot;Jicama and Carrot Cole Slaw 1/2 cup orange juice 2 tablespoons lime juice 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/4 teaspoon minced basil 1 teaspoon orange zest 1 teaspoon lime zest Salt and pepper, to taste 1 jicama 3 carrots Instructions: In a large bowl, whisk orange juice, lime juice, oil, basil, zests and salt and pepper.

Melt the chocolate and butter over a double boiler on medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside. Combine the egg yolks, 1 tablespoon water, and half the sugar in a second metal bowl and whisk over the double boiler set over medium heat.

Season the water with a pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Spread the pasta in the pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking together. Allow the pasta water to reduce; do not add more, as you want the starchy water to be minimal when the remaining ingredients are added. Meanwhile, add the coarse black pepper to a separate small pan over medium heat. Toast a minute or two until fragrant. Once the pasta is al dente and the pasta water has reduced so only a slight coating remains at the bottom of the pan, turn off the heat and add the toasted ground black pepper and Pecorino-Romano. Stir and toss vigorously until both ingredients are well incorporated into the pasta. Toss in the olive oil and season with salt.

Prepare two baking sheets by greasing them and lining with parchment. Sift the matzo cake meal, potato starch and salt together, set aside. In a mixer whip the eggs and sugar, for about 8 minutes. The eggs should be very light in color and a thick foam. At the very end, add the vanilla and zest. Sift the dry ingredients over the egg foam. Very gently, but thoroughly, fold the dry ingredients into the egg foam. Pour the batter into one of the prepared pans and spread evenly with a spatula. Bake the cake for about 18 minutes or until golden and dry when poked with a cake tester. Repeat with the second cake layer. To make the buttercream: In a small pot, fitted with a candy thermometer, heat 2 cups sugar, water and cream of tartar to 242 degrees F. This will take several minutes, so get your eggs started. Whisk together the eggs, yolks and 1/3 cup sugar. Beat the eggs on medium high speed until light in color and thick. Once the sugar has reached 242 degrees F, add it very carefully and slowly to the eggs, while the beater is going on slow speed. Be sure to pour the syrup along the edge of the bowl, not directly onto the beater or it will splatter. Continue beating the egg mixture on medium-high speed until the eggs have cooled, about 8 minutes. Once the eggs are cooled, add the butter 2 tablespoons at a time. The mixture will go through a stage when it looks soupy and curdled, but keep adding the butter and it will come together. After all the butter is added, mix in the vanilla. The buttercream will be smooth and glossy. Divide 1/3 of the buttercream into a separate bowl and add the poppy seed paste. To the remaining buttercream, add the melted chocolate. If you are not going to use the buttercream right away, cover it and leave it at room temperature for up to 24 hours. When you are ready to use it, give it a good stirring or put it back in the mixer and beat with the paddle attachment until smooth. To make the soaking syrup: In a small saucepan heat the sugar, water and zest over medium heat until the sugar has fully dissolved. Cut each sheet of cake into 4 equal pieces (they will be about 4 inches wide and 12 inches long). Lay the first layer of cake on the serving platter and brush with the soaking syrup. You want to dab the syrup on, but don&#39;t overly saturate the cake or it will be soggy. Spread a thin layer of the poppy seed buttercream over the soaked layer. Repeat with 5 more layers and then finish with the 7th layer of cake. This will leave you with one extra. Since my cake is not traditional anyway, you should feel free to use up that last layer. If you want to keep it to seven layers, then I suggest you use that lonely extra layer as a snack. If your layers need squaring up, just trim them with a sharp serrated bread knife. Stir the chocolate buttercream to make sure it is smooth and cover the entire cake in a nice even layer. It is okay if it isn&#39;t perfectly smooth, because we&#39;re going to add some rough stripes to the outside. Take a small blob of buttercream on the end of your spatula, and starting at the end of the cake, on the bottom, spread that blob in a stripe along the cake. Repeat over and over again, but alternate which side you start on. Repeat this on the top as well. You will end up with rough stripes all over the cake, which gives the cake some texture. Using a sharp chef&#39;s knife, scrape the smooth side of a bar of chocolate with the blade, so that the chocolate curls up. If the chocolate is very cold and brittle, try sitting it in the sun for a few minutes and the curls will come more easily. Cover the top with the chocolate shavings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19467,&quot;Watermelon Spritzy 2 cups watermelon, chopped or watermelon puree 2 cups lemon-lime soda, cold 1 tablespoon grenadine 1/2 cup frozen mixed berries, optional, use instead of ice Fresh mint sprigs, for garnish Instructions: Put watermelon, lemon-lime soda, and grenadine into a blender.

Spray a 14-inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray. Prepare cake mix according to the package instructions. Pour into the prepared cake pan and bake until set, well-browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan, then invert onto a rack to remove it from the pan. Put the vanilla frosting in a bowl. Mix 5 to 8 drops of brown food coloring into the frosting and mix until well blended for a light brown pizza crust color. Add more food coloring if need. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip. Invert the cake back onto a large round platter, pizza pan or 14-inch cardboard cake round so that it is right-side up. Cut a scored line around the cake about 3/4 inch from the edge using a paring knife, cutting only about 1/4 inch deep. Scoop out the center of the cake about 1/4 inch deep to form a shallow well and give it a raised pizza crust look. Press down on the middle of the cake to slightly compress the cake and make it less crumbly in texture. Pipe frosting over the entire cake and spread and smooth with an offset spatula. Place in the freezer to let the frosting firm up, for about 1 hour. Meanwhile, prep the \\toppings.<br> For \\Sausage Crumbles:\\ Break up the chocolate rice cereal treats into chunks to resemble sausage crumbles. Set aside. For \\Pepperoni:\\ Unroll the fruit leather and place on a cutting board. Cut out 12 rounds from the fruit leather using a 1 1/2-inch round cutter to create pepperoni slices. Set aside. For \\Green Peppers:\\ Cut the green gummy candies into quarters. Set aside. For \\Mushrooms:\\ Roll the marzipan into a log about 6 inches long and 1 inch in diameter. Score 2 lines into the length of the log using the back of a butter knife to form the stem of the mushroom. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes to harden up. Combine 2 drops brown food coloring with 1/4 cup of water. Remove the formed marzipan log from freezer and slice into 1/2-inch-thick slices (you should get 10 slices). Place the \\mushroom\\ slices on a plate and paint all over with the brown food coloring and water mixture. Set aside. For the \\Tomato Sauce:\\ Put the strawberry jam in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until it has a pourable consistency similar to pancake batter, 30 to 45 seconds. Whisk in the red frosting until well blended. Let cool until room temperature but still pourable, about 5 minutes. For the \\Melted Cheese:\\ Put the cream cheese frosting in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until it has a pourable consistency similar to pancake batter, about 10 seconds. If the constancy is too thin, let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes to thicken it up. Assemble: Remove the cake from the freezer and pour strawberry \\sauce\\ in the center. Spread the sauce out to the edge of the crust using an offset spatula. Pour the cream cheese frosting over the sauce into individual pools to mimic the look of melted cheese, making sure to leave some of the sauce around the edge near the crust exposed. Arrange the toppings over the \\melted cheese.\\ Finish with a sprinkle of grated white chocolate to mimic grated Parmesan and chopped pistachios to mimic dried oregano.

Lay the beef in a large roasting pan with the bone side down. (The ribs act as a natural roasting rack.) In a small bowl mash together the garlic, horseradish, salt, pepper, and olive oil to make a paste. Massage the paste generously over the entire roast. Scatter the vegetables and halved garlic around the meat and drizzle them with a 2-count of oil. Put the pan in the oven and roast the beef for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours for medium-rare (or approximately 20 minutes per pound). Check the internal temperature of the roast in several places with an instant-read thermometer; it should register 125 degrees F. for medium-rare. Remove the beef to a carving board and let it rest for 20 minutes. The internal temperature of the meat will continue to rise by about 10 degrees. Remove the vegetables and set aside. Pour the pan juices into a fat separator or small bowl and set aside to allow the fat and beef juices to separate. Pour off and discard the fat. You will use the tasty beef juices for the mushrooms. Place a clean skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and a 2-count drizzle of oil. When the butter starts to foam. add the mushrooms and thyme; and season with salt and pepper.

Put the chocolate, vanilla, orange zest and salt in a large bowl; set aside. Heat the cream and butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until very hot and steaming; pour over the chocolate, then let sit for 10 minutes. Stir until all the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. (If all the chocolate has not melted, microwave the mixture in 30-second increments, stirring after each, until smooth.) Add the pecans, apricots and prunes, and stir to combine. Transfer the chocolate-fruit mixture to a large baking dish, and let cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until the mixture has hardened but is still soft enough to scoop, about 3 hours. (The mixture can be made up to 2 days in advance; let soften at room temperature until scoopable, about 30 minutes.) Line a baking sheet with parchment. Scoop heaping teaspoonfuls of truffle mixture, and place them on the prepared sheet. Once all the mixture has been divided up, roll the mounds into smooth, round balls. (Using food-safe gloves for this helps keep it from getting too messy.) Roll each ball into sanding sugar right before serving or wrapping. Keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 19535,&quot;South Indian-Style Yellow Rice 1 cup basmati rice 1 1/2 cups vegetable stock or water<br> 1 teaspoon ground turmeric<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoon ghee, coconut oil or olive oil<br> 1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds<br> 1/4 cup peanuts or broken cashew nuts<br> 1 tablespoon split white urad dal<br> 1/2 teaspoon asafetida<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red chiles<br> 10 to 15 fresh curry leaves (see Cook\\u2019s Note)<br> 1 lemon, zested and juiced<br> Instructions: Wash the rice in cold water until the water is no longer cloudy, 3 or 4 times, then drain. This step is important as it removes the starch from the rice and prevents it from clumping up. Heat the stock or water in a heavy pan with a tight-fitting lid. Add the turmeric, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the drained rice. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes. Do not disturb the rice or take a peek while it\\u2019s in the middle of cooking. Turn off the heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5 to 7 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, heat the ghee or oil in a pan large enough to fit the rice over medium-high heat. Add the mustard seeds and let sizzle until you hear popping sounds, about 30 seconds. Add the nuts and cook until golden brown and crunchy, about 2 minutes. Lower the heat to medium and add the urad dal, asafetida, crushed red chiles and curry leaves. Be careful as the curry leaves might sputter. Cook until the urad dal turn golden brown, about 3 minutes. Gently mix in the cooked rice.<br> Remove from the heat and add the lemon zest and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice.

F. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the pork fat-side down and cook until it starts to turn golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside. Add the onions, garlic, ginger, cloves and star anise and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the brown sugar and cook, stirring frequently, until melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the soy sauce and vinegar and stir to combine. Add the pork back to the pot, fat-side down and add enough water to cover about three-quarters of the way. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Cook until the pork is tender and easily shredded with a fork, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Meanwhile, place the eggs in a medium pot and cover with cold water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, immediately turn off the heat and cover the pot. Let the eggs sit in the hot water for 3 minutes. Drain the water and submerge the eggs in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Peel the eggs and cut 4 or 5 small slits into the whites of each egg. Refrigerate the eggs until needed. Remove the pork from the pot and set the pot over high heat. Bring the liquid left in the pot to a boil and cook until reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Add the eggs to the pot and cook for an additional 5 to 6 minutes so the sweet and salty sauce gets into the yolks of the eggs. Remove the eggs, then strain the sauce into a bowl or gravy strainer and skim off the fat. Slice the pork and spoon the sauce over the top. Serve with the eggs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 19540,&quot;Artichoke Confit with Almonds, Manila Clams, and Vermouth 4 large artichokes 2 lemons 2 cups vegetable oil 1 bottle dry vermouth 8 ounces clam juice 20 manila clams, washed and scrubbed 2 large shallots, minced 1/4 cup olive oil 4 Roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced 3 tablespoons champagne vinegar 8 leaves flat parsley 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt 4 pearl onions, peeled and sliced 12 chives, minced 1/2 cup slivered and toasted almonds Instructions: For the artichokes, fill a bowl with water, and squeeze in the juice of half the lemon. Take each artichoke, and remove all outer leaves, and discard. Slice the stem of the artichokes down to 1-inch length, and using a knife, peel away all the outer skin. Rub generously with the remaining lemon. Cut the remaining leaves at the bottom of the base, exposing the hairy choke. With a spoon, scoop out the choke, and discard. Rub the entire surface of the artichoke with lemon, and place in the water. Repeat this process for all the artichokes. Working quickly, slice each artichoke into 4 quarters, and return the pieces to the water. Set aside. Place 2 cups of vegetable oil in a heavy saucepan, and heat over medium heat. To make the vinaigrette, add the vermouth to a saucepan and cook over medium heat until reduced by 3/4 (the alcohol will probably catch on fire, but do not worry). Add the clam juice and continue to reduce until mixture equals 1 cup. Add the clams, cover pot, and steam until barely open. Immediately remove the clams to a small bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Strain the liquid through cheesecloth, rinse pan, and return liquid to pan. Add the shallots, and reduce until mixture has thickened slightly, about 1/4 cup. Add the olive oil, tomatoes, a drop of lemon juice, chopped parsley, and set aside in a warm spot. Remove clams from shells, and season them lightly with salt. Set aside. Drain the artichokes and add them to the oil, and cook gently for 10 minutes. They will bubble vigorously as the moisture evaporates. The artichokes will be done when golden and slightly wrinkled (test one to be sure). Remove from oil, season with salt, and set aside. To serve, place a small pile of artichokes in the center of four plates. Place 5 clams around each pile, and spoon the vinaigrette over them. Sprinkle top with toasted almonds, and garnish with a few drops of lemon juice, sliced pearl onions, and sprinkle with chives.

Season the chicken thighs generously with salt and pepper. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, add oil, and heat until shimmering. Cook chicken skin side down until golden and crispy, about 8 minutes. Turn chicken and brown for another 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. Pour off 1 tablespoon of the pan drippings and reserve; leave just enough oil in the skillet to evenly cover the bottom, discard the rest. Add the fennel, onions, garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes to the skillet and cook until the vegetables just begin to wilt, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and olives. Arrange the chicken, skin side up, on top of the vegetable mixture and bake, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 to 30 minutes. While the chicken bakes, make the couscous: Rinse the couscous in a fine mesh sieve under cold water until the water runs clear. Put couscous into a medium bowl and set aside. In a small saucepan add the chicken broth, reserved drippings, the 1 teaspoon salt, nutmeg, cayenne, and black pepper and bring to a boil. Add the broth to the couscous and cover with plastic wrap and set aside until the liquid has been absorbed and the couscous is plump, about 5 minutes. Toast the pine nuts in a small skillet over medium-high heat, tossing in the pan until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the orange zest, fennel fronds and parsley. When ready to serve, fold the parsley mixture into the couscous and fluff with a fork. Mound the couscous on a warm serving platter and arrange the chicken around the couscous. Stir 2 to 3 tablespoons water or broth into the fennel mixture so they look glazed.

Lightly oil bread slices with olive oil and place them on a baking sheet. Place in oven and toast until golden brown and crisp. While toast is still warm, rub 1 side of each slice with the fresh garlic. Place 2 sardine fillets, silver skin side facing up, on each toast and put back on the baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Bake for 4 to 6 minutes. Remove tray from oven and garnish with just a squeeze of lemon juice and chopped parsley. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Vermentino, Grner Veltliner, Sauvignon Blanc, Albari?o]&quot; 19560,&quot;Sole Meuniere Extra-virgin olive oil 4 sole fillets Kosher salt 2 cups all-purpose flour 6 tablespoons butter 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley Instructions: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Generously coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Season 2 of the fillets with salt. Dredge the fillets in flour and place them immediately in the pan with the hot oil. Do not flour the fish ahead of time or it will be gummy and mushy on the outside rather than crispy. When the fish has turned from translucent to opaque, about 2/3 of the way through the cooking, turn the fish over and cook on the other side. Remove the fish from the pan and reserve on a sheet tray in the oven. Repeat the process with the remaining 2 fish fillets. Keep the cooked fish fillets warm in the oven while you make the sauce. Remove any excess oil from the pan. Add the butter and thyme leaves. Shake the pan frequently to prevent scorching. When the butter has melted and is very bubbly, add in the lemon juice and whisk to combine. As the butter becomes bubbly again and starts to turn a nutty brown, season with salt and whisk in the chopped parsley. Taste to make sure it is delicious. Remove the fish fillets from the oven and plate them, spooning the sauce over the fish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 19561,&quot;Junior&#39;s Sugar-Free New York Cheesecake 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus more for greasing the pan 2/3 cup almond flour 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons xylitol sweetener 1 teaspoon salt 1 to 2 tablespoons heavy or whipping cream 1 extra-large egg yolk, slightly beaten with fork 1 cup xylitol sweetener 3 tablespoons arrowroot, dissolved in 2 tablespoons cold water Four 8-ounce packages cream cheese (use only full fat), room temperature 2 extra-large eggs Instructions: For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan (preferably nonstick). Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the side, so water will not leak into the cake as it bakes.<br> Place both flours, the xylitol and salt in a food processor and process for 15 seconds. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture pulls together, about 30 seconds. Add 1 tablespoon of the cream and the egg yolk. Pulse until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms. If it is still stiff, add another tablespoon of cream. Flour your fingers and gently press the dough into the bottom of the prepared springform pan until it is covered. Bake the crust just until it no longer looks moist on the top and feels set when you touch it (do not overbake), 7 to 8 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack. Leave the oven on.<br> For the filling: Beat together 1/2 cup of the Xylitol, the arrowroot and one package of the cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer (using the paddle attachment if you have it) on low about 3 minutes to make a stable starter batter. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, scraping down the bowl after adding each one, about another 3 minutes.<br> Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining 1/2 cup xylitol. Add the eggs, beating well. The batter will look light, creamy, airy, and almost like billowy clouds. Be careful not to over mix!<br> Spoon the batter over the baked shortbread crust. Place the springform pan in the center of a large shallow pan and add hot water to the larger pan so that it comes about 1 inch up the side of the springform. Bake until the edge is light golden brown and the cake is light yellow beige, about 1 hour. If the center is still very jiggly, let the cake bake for 5 to 10 minutes more.<br> Gently remove the cake from the water bath, transfer it to a wire rack, remove the foil, and leave it on the rack for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. The less you move it, the less likely it is the cake will crack. Once it has cooled, leave the cake in the pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight until it is completely cold.<br> To serve, remove the springform ring from the cake and serve from the bottom of the pan (do not try to transfer it to a serving platter). Cover any leftover cake and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Do not freeze this cake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19562,&quot;Pork Soup Dumplings 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Kosher salt 1 3/4 cups chicken stock 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 1/4-ounce envelope gelatin powder (about 1 tablespoon) 1 pound ground pork Kosher salt 2 tablespoons soy sauce, plus more for serving 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger 1 tablespoon sambal oelek, plus more for serving 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 1 tablespoon rice vinegar, plus more for serving 4 scallions, finely chopped Instructions: Make the wrappers: Combine the flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl and create a well in the middle. Add 1/2 cup boiling water and mix it in with a spatula, then incorporate with your hands until you have a mealy, shaggy mixture. Mix in 1/2 cup cold water and bring everything together into a dough, then turn it out onto a work surface and knead, adding more flour if it gets too sticky to work with, until you have a smooth and slightly sticky dough, 7 to 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and set aside for 30 minutes while you make the filling. Make the soup gelatin: Heat the chicken stock in a saucepan until hot, then add the soy sauce and gelatin powder. Whisk to combine. Pour into a shallow dish and chill until set, about 1 hour. Break up the gelatin by fluffing it with a fork. Set aside. Make the filling: Put the pork in a large bowl and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add the soy sauce, ginger, sambal oelek, sesame oil, rice vinegar and scallions. Mix with your hands (don\\u2019t overmix), then set up your dumpling folding station. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and dust with flour. To assemble the dumplings, divide the dough into 32 balls (keep them covered when you\\u2019re not working with them). Roll out the balls into 3 1/2- to 4-inch circles, flouring the surface as needed. Put a wrapper in your non-dominant hand and make a cup. Place 1/2 tablespoon pork filling in the center and top with 1/2 tablespoon soup gelatin. Begin gathering and pleating the dumpling wrapper using your thumb and pointer finger. Work your way around the edge of the wrapper until you\\u2019ve gathered all the dough; your thumb stays in the same place \\u2014 it\\u2019s the pointer finger doing all the work. Twist it at the end, pinching everything in the center. Repeat with the remaining wrappers, filling and soup gelatin and place the dumplings on the sheet pan. (You can freeze the dumplings at this point and steam them directly from the freezer.) To steam the dumplings, line a bamboo steamer with cabbage leaves or parchment paper with a few holes cut out. Place a single layer of dumplings in the steamer, leaving a bit of room between them, then set the steamer over a pot of boiling water. Steam in batches until cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. (Alternately, line a plate with cabbage or parchment. Place in a pot of boiling water, making sure the water doesn\\u2019t cover the plate; cook 8 to 10 minutes.) Let the dumplings cool slightly, then enjoy with a sauce of equal parts vinegar and soy sauce with sambal oelek to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 19563,&quot;Roasted Corn and Lobster Chowder 4 ears fresh sweet corn, brushed lightly with butter and grilled until toasted on all sides (about 2 cups cut corn) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 large onion, peeled and diced (about 1 cup) 2 celery stalks, diced 1 leek, split, cleaned, and diced 1 large sweet red pepper, diced 2 to 3 jalapeno peppers seeded and diced 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped out 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 quarts hot chicken stock 1 (2 pound) lobster, tail hacked into sections, claws cracked, body tied in cheesecloth 1/2 cup creme fraiche Instructions: Cut the roasted corn off of their cobs, reserving the corn to add later.

Put a medium saucepan on the stove over high heat. Put the figs, honey, and water in the pan, stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and allow the water to simmer. The honey and natural sugars from the figs should thicken the water. Continue to simmer figs until a sauce is achieved that is thick enough to cover the back of a spoon. When sauce has reached that consistency, remove from heat. Put \\fig sauce\\ in a refrigerator-safe container, and allow cooling for at least 20 minutes. Spread a sheet of puff pastry out on a clean, lightly floured surface. Scoop a small amount of fig sauce on the puff pastry sheet with about 2 inches around the sauce on every side. Put a piece of Brie on top of the sauce. Carefully fold the edges of the puff pastry over the cheese. Squeeze the edges of the pastry together then carefully flip the pastry over, so the smooth surface of the pastry is facing up. Gently take the pastry and put it on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. Repeat this until all the cheese is used. You should have 8 small stuffed pastries. When all the pastries are on the sheet tray, take a pastry brush, and lightly brush egg whites on the top and sides of each pastry, this will give the pastry a shine when it comes out of the oven. Drizzle a small amount of honey on top of each pastry. Bake the pastries until the puff pastry is a golden brown. This should take about 15 minutes, but keep your eyes on the baking process. When the pastries are golden brown, remove from the oven, and allow them to cool on a cooling rack. Allow them to cool for 3-5 minutes, then serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</li></ol><p>&quot; 19590,&quot;Olive Oil Poached Tuna Infused with Thyme, Lemon, and Shallots Four 5-ounce pieces sushi-grade tuna (have the fishmonger cut the tuna in 5-ounce blocks, more like filet mignon, rather than steaks) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cups extra-virgin olive oil 10 sprigs thyme 1/2 lemon, sliced 3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper 2 shallots, sliced Rosemary Stewed Lentils, recipe below Fleur de Sel, for seasoning Serving suggestion: sauteed broccoli rabe 2 pounds French green lentils 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 4 shallots, finely chopped 6 cloves garlic chopped fine 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper 4 sprigs rosemary, leaves removed and chopped 1 cup tomato puree Instructions: Season the tuna with salt and pepper and set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the sherry, soy sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch, and sugar. Add the beef and mix well. Set aside. Preheat a large non-stick skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and heat until very hot. Add the scallion whites and beef mixture to the skillet, arrange it in a single layer, and cook, without stirring, until well-browned on the bottom and still pinkish inside, about 1 minute. (It is key to only partially cook the meat at this stage, since it will be finish cooking later in the sauce.) Transfer to a bowl. Return the skillet to the heat and add the remaining oil. Add the ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (only a few seconds if using young ginger). Add the scallion greens and tomatoes and cook until slightly softened and saucy, and tomato skin begins to wrinkle, about 1 minute. Return the beef and any collected juice to the skillet, add the hoisin sauce, and cook, stirring, until thick, about 30 seconds more. Season, to taste.

Reheat very gently and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 19632,&quot;Chef Anne&#39;s Pappardelle 1 pound all-purpose flour 4 whole eggs, plus 1 yolk 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Instructions: Place the flour on a clean, dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil, salt and 1 to 2 tablespoons water. Using a fork, beat the eggs together with the olive oil, water (or more if needed) and salt. Using the fork, begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture, be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous mixture, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple dough. When done, the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately, do not refrigerate. To roll the pasta: Cut off 1/3 of the pasta dough, reserve the rest and keep it covered. Squash the pasta with the heels of your hands to facilitate it going through the pasta roller. Dust with flour. Put the pasta through the roller set on number one. Roll the dough through 2 times, dusting it with flour if it feels sticky or tacky. Fold the pasta into thirds and put it through the machine on number one again. Change the setting on the pasta roller to number two and run the pasta through. Continue to roll the pasta through the machine, changing the setting each time to a larger number (this will make the opening on the pasta machine smaller). When you get to the desired thin-ness (I recommend number six), cut the pasta into 10-inch lengths. Flour the dough generously and stack them in a pile. Cover the stack with plastic or a clean tea towel and proceed rolling the rest of the pasta. When the pasta is all rolled, take 3 sheets of pasta and fold both ends of the pasta over each other until they meet in the middle. Using a sharp knife, cut the pasta rolls into 1-inch widths. Unroll the pasta \\ribbons\\ and dust with semolina and reserve on sheet trays. When ready to use, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 19633,&quot;Asian Noodles 1 lime, juiced 1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves 1-inch piece ginger, minced 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon honey 2 teaspoons sesame oil 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1 (14-ounce) bag Oriental-style rice vermicelli 1 carrot, grated 1 scallion, thinly sliced 1/2 cucumber, peeled and grated 3 tablespoons peanuts 1 red beet, peeled and grated Instructions: Whisk lime juice, rice vinegar, cilantro, ginger, garlic, honey, sesame oil and pepper flakes in a small bowl.

Place in oven, cook for 45 minutes to an hour, flip over and cook for another hour or until firm and dry. Turn oven up to 400 degrees. Clean 4 cloves of garlic of excess skin, but be sure to leave 1 layer on. Place in small pot and cover with oil. Place on moderate fire until slow simmer, about 5 minutes. Once simmer is reached, turn fire down very low and let garlic cook in oil. Be careful at this point, excessive heat will cause garlic cloves to explode, shooting hot oil in all directions. Use a splatter guard if unsure. Cook for an additional 10 minutes, remove from heat and let cool in oil. Crack femur bone and kneecap. Cut scrap meat, from lamb carcass, into large dice. Heat large roasting pan, add half of garlic \\confit\\ oil. Carefully place lamb bones and scraps in pan and place in oven. Let roast, stirring occasionally, until dark golden brown. At this point, remove from oven, add 2 crushed cloves of garlic, 1 small piece each of rosemary and thyme and deglaze with 4 cups of water. Make sure to scrape pan bottom well to loosen all of the meat bits that adhered during the roasting period. Transfer into saucepot large enough to fit everything, and simmer, skimming frequently, until reduced by half. Add demi-glace and reduce further until 12 ounces remains. Pass this fragrant lamb \\Jus\\ through a strainer or coffee filter, and season to taste. Drain beans and place into thick bottomed pot. Cut carrot, celery and onion in half, add to pot.

Make a well in the center. Combine the whole eggs, yolks, milk and olive oil in a small bowl and pour it into the well. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed until the dough just starts to come together, then increase the speed to medium and mix for 5 minutes. Lightly flour your work surface and turn the dough onto it. Knead the dough by hand until it is smooth and elastic, and springs back when you press it with your finger, about 10 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. For the filling: Combine the ricotta, mascarpone and Parmesan in a small bowl. Put the mixture in a pastry bag and refrigerate until needed. For the ragu: Put the beef stock, red wine and porcinis in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat and let the mixture simmer. Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the beef, hot and sweet Italian sausages and prosciutto and cook, breaking up the beef and sausage with a whisk, until well browned, about 10 minutes. Season with some salt and pepper. Stir the tomato paste into the meat, then stir in the rosemary, thyme, garlic, bay leaves and onions and cook, stirring, until the onions soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Strain the beef stock mixture into the meat. Add the tomatoes and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat so the mixture simmers and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 45 minutes. Add the cream and continue to simmer another 15 minutes or so. Stir in the parsley. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. To fill and finish the agnolotti: Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Set a pasta roller at the widest setting. Pass the first piece of dough through the roller, fold it in half and run it through again. Fold the dough in half again, dust it with flour, and run it through the roller again. Reduce the width setting on the roller and run the dough through. Continue to run the dough through, reducing the width with each pass, until the pasta is thin enough so that you can see the shadow of your hand through the other side. Lightly flour your work surface and lay the pasta sheet on top. Pipe 1 teaspoon of filling about 1 inch from the edge. Continue to pipe additional teaspoons of filling 1 inch apart, from one end to the other. Fold the dough over so that it extends about an inch past the filling (it won?t extend to the opposite edge), press to seal the long edge and then trim the excess dough from the sealed side. With your fingers perpendicular to the table, pinch between the mounds to seal the filling in. Then use the cutter to cut between each mound, through the pinch, creating little purses. Dust the finished agnolotti with flour. Refrigerate until ready to cook. Repeat the process with the 3 remaining pieces of dough and the filling.

Place the unpeeled garlic cloves in a small ovenproof container and cover with the olive oil. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil. Place in the oven and roast for 20 minutes, or until the cloves are tender when tested with the tip of a knife. Remove the garlic cloves and place on a plate to cool. Strain the olive oil and reserve for later use. Squeeze the roasted garlic out of the skins when cool enough to handle. Puree the garlic by chopping and smashing it with the blade and side of a knife, or with a mortar and pestle. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into 2-inch pieces. (There will be about 8 cups potatoes.) Place them in a large saucepan. Add enough water to cover the potates by 1-inch. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt, place the pan over high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover the saucepan with lid placed slightly ajar, and simmer the potatoes for 20 to 30 minutes, or until tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. Combine the milk and goat cheese in small saucepan and heat to a simmer, stirring until there are no lumps. When the potates are cooked, drain them, return them to the pan, and place in the still-warm oven, uncovered to dry out for 10 minutes. Remove the potatotes from the oven and pass them, along with the garlic, through a potato ricer or a food mill fitted with the fine disk. Alternatively, the potatoes can be whipped using an electric mixer. Add the reserved garlic oil and the goat cheese-milk mixture and whip the potatoes with a mixer or by hand, adding additional milk if too dry. Reheat, covered, over very low heat if necessary.

Add the vanilla bean paste and egg and mix to combine. Reduce the speed to low. Add the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add the dark and white chocolate chunks and chopped pecans and walnuts and mix until just combined. Cover the dough with plastic wrap, pressing it directly on the surface, then cover the bowl with another piece of plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (or 320 degrees F if using a convection oven). Line a sheet pan with parchment. Grease seven 3 1/2-inch-diameter tart rings with nonstick cooking spray and place on the prepared sheet pan.<br> Portion the dough into 7 balls, each about 1/4 cup (75 grams), and place one in the center of each tart ring. Press down to flatten the dough slightly, then arrange 1 each of the chocolate-covered almonds and whole walnuts and pecans on the top. Bake until the internal temperature is 195 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 14 to 16 minutes. The cookies should have puffed slightly and the tops should be matte when done. Cool 5 minutes on the sheet pan, then transfer to a wire rack and unmold from the rings once the cookies are cool enough to handle.<br> For the marshmallow topping: Bloom the gelatin in a medium bowl of ice water for 5 minutes until softened, then drain well.<br> Heat the granulated sugar, water and corn syrup in a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer over medium-high heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves and then stop stirring and continue to cook, washing down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush, until the temperature reaches 230 degrees F, 5 to 6 minutes.<br> Once the temperature of the sugar syrup reaches 230 degrees F, begin whipping the egg whites and cream of tartar in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed until medium peaks, about 1 minute (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> Continue to cook the sugar syrup, washing down the sides of the pan, until it reaches a final temperature of 255 degrees F. When it is almost ready, microwave the gelatin for 10 seconds on high in a heatproof bowl to melt it.<br> With the mixer on low speed, slowly drizzle the 255-degrees F sugar syrup into the egg whites. Pour in the gelatin and whip on medium-high speed until thickened and cooled (the sides of the bowl should only be warm to the touch), about 8 minutes. Add the vanilla bean paste and whisk to combine. You want to be able to pipe the meringue marshmallow through a piping bag, so it should hold a stiff peak when the whisk attachment is turned upside down.<br> Add the marshmallow to a large pastry bag fitted with a 1-inch or larger round pastry tip. Pipe a large mound of marshmallow on the top of each cookie, then brulee lightly with a kitchen blow torch.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 19687,&quot;Kimchee Beef Scallion Pancakes Neutral cooking oil, to coat the pan 1 pound Wagyu ground beef<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon chopped garlic<br> 1 tablespoon chopped ginger<br> 1 cup kimchee<br> 2 tablespoons gochujang 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more if needed 2 cups boiling water (approximately) 1/2 cup kimchee juice 2 tablespoons chopped kimchee<br> 2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 1 thinly sliced jalapeno with seeds<br> 2 tablespoons sliced scallions<br> 2 tablespoons sesame oil 1/2 cup grapeseed oil, plus more for the pan<br> Kosher salt<br> 2 bunches thinly sliced scallions (reserving 2 to 3 tablespoons for the dipping sauce) Instructions: For the kimchee beef mix: Add 2 tablespoons oil to a 12-inch cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Once heated, add the ground beef, sprinkle with salt and pepper and begin to brown and break up the meat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until the beef is evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and spread on a sheet tray to slightly cool. In the same hot pan, coat with another 1 tablespoon oil and sear the kimchee until it&#39;s crispy. Add the gochujang and stir until evenly combined. Remove from the heat and add to another sheet tray to cool. Meanwhile, as everything is cooling, make the dough mix. For the scallion pancake dough mix: To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, add the flour and 2/3 of the boiling water. Turn the mixer on to stir and keep adding water until well mixed, a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. This will take 3 to 5 minutes. You may need to sprinkle a little flour if it gets too wet. On a floured surface, transfer and knead the dough until it becomes a smooth elastic ball, 5 to 8 minutes. Place back in the bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for 15 to 30 minutes at room temperature. For the dipping sauce: Add the kimchee juice, kimchee, soy sauce, jalapeno and scallions to a bowl and stir to combine. Add to a serving dish and set aside. For the pancake assembly: On a floured surface, roll out dough into a log. Cut the log into four pieces. Roll one piece into an 1/8-inch-thick circle/oval shape. Combine the sesame oil and grapeseed oil in a small bowl. Brush the oil over the pancake and sprinkle liberally with salt. Sprinkle a quarter each of the beef mixture, kimchi and scallions all over the dough. Make sure to press it down so it sticks into the dough. Starting with the long side nearest you, roll the dough, jelly-roll fashion, to make a tight log. Twist each end of the log in opposite direction 4 or 5 times (this will make additional pancake layers), then wrap the log around itself to make a coil, tucking the outside end beneath the coil. With a rolling pin, flatten the coil to 1/3-inch thick, dusting with flour as needed so it doesn&#39;t stick to your work surface. Roll out to a pancake. Repeat to make 4 pancakes. Heat a wok or 12-inch cast-iron pan over medium heat. Add grapeseed oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the pancakes, one at a time, and cook until brown and crispy on both sides, turning once, moving and spinning the pancake for even cooking, 3 to 5 minutes per side, until golden brown and delicious. Sprinkle lightly with salt and cut the pancakes into wedges. Serve with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19688,&quot;Dark Chocolate Oatmeal 1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1/3 cup honey<br> 1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts 2 bananas, sliced into coins<br> 1/2 cup dried cherries, plumped in warm water<br> Instructions: Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat.

For the barbecue pork: In a medium saucepan, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the butter and garlic and continue to cook until the garlic is softened. Add the ketchup, molasses, vinegar, hot sauce, mustard and brown sugar and simmer until the sugar is melted and the ingredients have combined, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender and carefully blend until smooth. Return to the pan, add Trisha&#39;s Pulled Pork and keep over low heat to warm through. For the cheese sauce: Heat the cream and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat until it just begins to steam, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the cheese, stirring until the cheese is completely melted. Keep warm, adding a bit more cream if the sauce becomes too thick. For the nachos: In a shallow casserole dish, spread the shredded romaine and then top with the tortilla and potato chips mixed together. Spread the pork over the chips and cover with the shredded Cheddar. Bake until the cheese has melted, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour the cheese sauce over top and garnish with the red onions and scallions.

Give the orange halves a squeeze over the pork and tuck the juiced halves into the pork. Cook on high heat until it reaches a boil, then turn down the heat slightly and allow the pork to simmer until very tender, about 2 hours. (As the pork cooks, the liquid will evaporate off, and towards the end of the cooking time, the pork will begin to fry in its own fat. The carnitas are done when they are cooked through, break apart easily with a fork, and are beginning to brown. If you notice that your pork is cooked but not frying, try adding some oil.) To assemble a torta, butter both sides of a bun and press in a panini press at 350 degrees F until slightly toasted and steaming on the inside, about a minute. Fill the bun with 1/2 cup carnitas, shaking off any excess liquid from the meat. Top the carnitas with a generous helping of Habanero Slaw and a few sprigs of cilantro. Close the torta and cut crosswise on a bias. Pour 3/4 cup hot Ahogada Salsa over each torta (make sure the plates you use have a bit of a rim to contain the salsa!). Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 11 more tortas. Best eaten with your hands! Halve the onion and slice very thinly. Seed the habanero chiles (we recommend using gloves as the seeds are very hot!) and slice very thinly. Combine onions, habanero chiles, oregano, salt and lime in a small bowl. Allow to rest in the refrigerator at least one hour (and up to one day) before using so that the onions become slightly soft and pickled. Combine the tomato-cl sauce and the chicken drippings in a medium saucepan. Whisk over medium-high heat and cook until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.

Line 3 baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats. (If you don&#39;t have 3 pans, simply cool the pan between batches.) Put the butter, unsweetened chocolate and 4 ounces semisweet chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 75 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir and heat again until melted, up to 2 minutes more. (Alternatively, put the chocolates and butter in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching the water, and stir occasionally until melted and smooth.) Stir the granulated and light brown sugars and vanilla into the chocolate mixture with a wooden spoon. Add the eggs and buttermilk and beat vigorously until thick and glossy. Whisk together the flour, 1/2 cup cocoa and the salt in another bowl. Add them to the egg mixture and stir until just mixed. Stir in the remaining chip-size semisweet chocolate. Cover and refrigerate the dough until firm enough to scoop, about 1 hour. Roll the dough into scant 1 tablespoon (about 3/4 inch) balls and place 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Put the remaining 1/2 cup cocoa powder and the confectioners&#39; sugar in two separate bowls for rolling.

Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil, add the geoduck and cook for about 20 seconds. Immediately immerse in iced water. Drain and remove the outer skin and discard. Cut in half lengthwise and thinly slice on a bias (the thinner the better as it will marinate and pick up more flavor). In a stainless steel bowl mix together the prepared geoduck, onions, and mushrooms. Cover and set aside in refrigerator for about 20 minutes. In a small bowl add the oil, rice wine vinegar and mustard and combine well. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. At this point carefully add hot sauce to your liking.

Pierce the potatoes a few times with a fork then bake in the oven for 45 minutes, or until fork tender, flipping halfway through. Cut the potatoes in half and allow them to cool until cool enough to handle. Remove the potato flesh from the skins and, using a potato ricer or masher, rice or thoroughly mash the potatoes until smooth. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and allow them to cool to room temperature. Lightly beat the egg yolks, drizzle them over the potatoes and lightly mix together. Add the flour and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Mix just until a soft, not too sticky dough comes together, adding more flour if needed. Do not overwork the dough as that will lead to dense gnocchi. Lightly dust a rimmed baking sheet with flour and divide the dough into four pieces. On a lightly floured work surface, roll each piece into roughly a 2-centimeter (1-inch) thick log. Cut each log into roughly 2-centimeter (1-inch) lengths and transfer them onto the prepared baking sheet and set aside until ready to cook. For the sauce: Melt the butter in a large high-sided pan over medium heat. Add the shallot, season with salt and pepper and cook until lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds before adding the tomato paste. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the vodka. Allow the vodka to cook down for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the alcohol to cook off, then turn the heat down to low and stir in the cream. Keep the sauce warm over low heat while you cook the gnocchi. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook the gnocchi in two batches for 3 to 4 minutes each, or about 1 minute after they have floated to the surface. When the gnocchi are cooked, transfer them directly into the sauce using a slotted spoon. When all of the gnocchi are cooked, gently stir about 1/4 cup of the gnocchi cooking liquid into the sauce and finish with the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper. If the sauce is a little thick, stir in another few tablespoons of cooking liquid. Serve immediately scattered with more Parmigiano-Reggiano, fresh basil and freshly ground black pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 19720,&quot;Pain Perdue with Fresh Peaches and Vanilla Butter 2 ripe peaches, skin removed, pitted and sliced into eighths 2 ripe white peaches, skin removed, pitted and sliced into eighths 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons light brown muscovado sugar 3 tablespoons peach eau de vie 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 tablespoon chiffonade mint leaves 4 large eggs 1/4 cup sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2 cups whole milk, plus more if needed 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 8 (3/4-inch thick) slices day old brioche 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 tablespoons canola oil 3 cups feuilletine, crushed Vanilla Bean Butter, to top, recipe follows Maple syrup, to serve 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves, to garnish 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, slightly softened 1 vanilla bean, halved horizontally, and seeds scraped 1 tablespoon sugar Pinch fine sea salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

If not using right away, store in an airtight container for up to 2 months. For the turkey: Measure out 1 tablespoon of the 5-Alarm Dry Brine per 5 pounds of turkey (a 12-pound turkey will take 2 1/2 tablespoons). Rub the measured brine all over the exterior of the turkey. Add an additional tablespoon of the brine to the inside of the bird, rubbing it on the underside of the breast. Let the turkey sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, then pat the turkey dry with paper towels. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place one strip of bacon down the center of the turkey breast, making sure that at least 1 inch of the bacon hangs over the breast on both the neck and cavity side. Continue to layer the bacon vertically along the breast of the turkey with a slight overlap, making sure to maintain the overhang on both ends. The bacon on the far edges of the breast may not reach the end of the cavity, so tuck those pieces in the crease between the thigh and the body. Gather all of the bacon ends on the neck side and pierce the ends through with a single sprig of rosemary. Use the same rosemary to pin the bacon to the breast near the wishbone. On the cavity side use 1 onion cut into quarters to secure the bacon against the back side of the breast. Arrange the carrots, celery and remaining sprigs rosemary in a roasting pan and rest a rack on top. Carefully transfer the turkey to the rack. Roast the turkey until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (avoid touching bone) registers 160 degrees F, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.

With children it makes more sense to leave the soup fairly solid, but you can add water from a boiled kettle toward the end of cooking time if you want a thinner soup rather than liquid tomato-rice stew. Grate Parmesan on top and eat - with bibs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 19743,&quot;Fried Chai-Apple Hand Pies Two 17.5-ounce boxes frozen puff pastry sheets (4 sheets) 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 pound apples (about 2 large apples), chopped into 1/4-inch pieces 1/4 cup maple syrup 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Juice of 1/2 small lemon (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) Pinch salt 3/4 cup granulated sugar 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons cornstarch 1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice 1 teaspoon ground cardamom 1 teaspoon ground cloves Vegetable oil, for frying All-purpose flour, for dusting Instructions: Remove the puff pastry from the freezer and let it sit on the countertop for 30 minutes to defrost. Put the butter in a medium saucepan and place over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, add the apples, maple syrup, vanilla, lemon juice, salt, and 1/4 cup of the sugar and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon. Stir and cook until the apples are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Combine the cornstarch and 2 teaspoons water in a small bowl and mix until a smooth paste forms. Pour the cornstarch mixture into the apples and continue cooking until the apples become glossy and a thick sauce forms, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the apples to a heatproof bowl to cool, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the sugar coating by mixing together the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and remaining 2 teaspoons cinnamon with the allspice, cardamom and cloves in a medium bowl. Set aside. Line a sheet pan with a wire rack and set aside. Fill a large Dutch oven with 4 inches of vegetable oil and place over medium heat. Clip a deep-fry thermometer to the side of the pot and heat to 375 degrees F. While the oil is heating, begin to prepare the hand pies. Lightly dust a clean surface with flour and place the puff pastry sheets on it. Cut each sheet into 6 even pieces, resulting in 24 total squares. Place a tablespoon of apple filling in the center of 12 pastry squares; don\\u2019t overfill the squares or place the filling too close to the edges. Top each square with a remaining pastry square. Crimp the edges with your fingers or a fork to seal and ensure the filling doesn&#39;t seep out when frying. Once the oil reaches 375 degrees F, begin to fry the hand pies. Depending on the size of your Dutch oven, fry 3 to 4 hand pies at a time. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove the pies from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. While still hot, generously sprinkle the pies on both sides with the spiced sugar. Allow the pies to cool for at least 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19744,&quot;Bollito Misto 4 pounds beef brisket or top round Salt and freshly ground pepper 4 cups beef stock or broth About 4 cups water, enough to cover the beef 2 onions, peeled and quartered 4 celery stalks, cut in 1/2 1 bay leaf 4 carrots, peeled and cut into thirds 1 pound small boiling potatoes 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Gorgonzola Sauce, recipe follows Spicy Salsa Verde, recipe follows 4 ounces Gorgonzola 2 cups mayonnaise 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup chopped parsley leaves, about 1 bunch 2 shallots, chopped 2 tablespoons chopped capers 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons hot sauce, or 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Heat a large braising pot over medium-high heat.

Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft. Add the wine and cook until reduced. Add the thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste. For the Potatoes: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Pour 2 tablespoons of the clarified butter into an iron skillet and heat over high heat. Arrange potatoes slices in the pan in concentric circles, overlapping the slices, drizzle each layer with butter, season with salt and pepper and spread some of the mushroom duxelle over the entire surface. Repeat to make 4 to 5 layers. Heat the pan on top of the stove until the butter bubbles. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the potatoes are golden brown and soft, 20 to 25 minutes. Press the potatoes with a pot lid during the baking once or twice to keep them flat. Remove from the oven and pour out excess butter.

Slowly add the sliced potatoes to the pan. Cook until the potatoes are slightly translucent and soft. Do not overcook. Strain the water from the pan and let the potatoes cool. Wrap the tender potato slices around each fish fillet, until the fish is completely covered. Wrap each fillet tightly in plastic wrap so that the potatoes stick to the fish. Heat enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom of a medium sized skillet over medium-high heat. Unwrap the fish fillets from the plastic wrap and brown each side of the fish. Reduce the heat and continue cooking the fish over medium-low heat until the bottom side is brown and the fish is cooked through. Top with Horseradish Cream Sauce. Melt the butter in a medium pan, then add the shallots and saute until tender. Slowly add the wine to the shallots. Reduce the mixture until it is nearly dry. Add heavy cream and allow the sauce to simmer until it is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 15 minutes. Pour the cream sauce into a blender and add grated horseradish. Blend the ingredients together and then strain through a fine sieve. Add salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste. Slice radishes and use for garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 19769,&quot;Peach Streusel Slab Pie 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut into small pieces, plus more for greasing the baking sheet 3 cups all-purpose flour 2/3 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 pounds peaches (about 6 peaches), cut into 1/2-inch wedges 1 1/2 cups firmly packed light brown sugar Juice of 1 lemon 3 tablespoons cornstarch 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup sliced skin-on almonds 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Adjust a rack to the bottom third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease the bottom and sides of a rimmed 10-by-15-inch baking sheet with butter. For the dough: Combine the butter, flour, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a food processor and process until the mixture comes together in a solid mass (this may take a few minutes). Drop pieces of the dough all over the prepared baking sheet. Use your fingers to press the dough evenly along the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan, filling any gaps. Set aside. For the filling: Toss together the peaches, brown sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a large bowl until the cornstarch dissolves. Transfer the filling onto the crust and spread in an even layer. Bake for 30 minutes. For the streusel: While the pie bakes, make the strussel topping by combining the flour, almonds, brown sugar, melted butter and salt in a small bowl until evenly moistened. Remove the pie from the oven and sprinkle the streusel evenly over the filling. Return the pie to the oven and bake until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes more. (If the crust browns too quickly during baking, cover the pie loosely with foil.) Let the pie cool. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 19770,&quot;Baby Bok Choy with Oyster Sauce 3 tablespoons oyster sauce 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce 2 teaspoons rice vinegar 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil Pinch of sugar 1 1/2 pounds baby bok choy (3- to 4-inch heads), bottoms trimmed 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh ginger Instructions: Stir the oyster sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil and sugar in a bowl until well combined; set aside. Wash the bok choy well to remove any grit and drain in a colander, leaving some water clinging to the leaves. Halve any large heads lengthwise. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add half each of the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until just softened, about 30 seconds. Add half of the bok choy and stir to coat. Cook until the bok choy is crisp-tender at the stem, 4 to 5 minutes; add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to keep a bit of moisture in the skillet and prevent the garlic from burning. Remove to a platter. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the skillet and repeat with the remaining garlic, ginger and bok choy. When tender, return the first batch of bok choy to the skillet and heat through. Transfer all the bok choy to the platter and drizzle with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19771,&quot;Kale Caesar Salad 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard<br> 1 teaspoon anchovy paste<br> 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground fresh black pepper<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 clove garlic, grated<br> 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 slices sourdough bread, diced into 1/4-inch pieces<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan One 5-ounce container baby kale<br> Instructions: For the dressing: Whisk together the mayonnaise, lemon juice, Parmesan, olive oil, mustard, anchovy paste, pepper, salt and garlic in a large bowl. Set aside to let the flavors marry. For the salad: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the oil and heat another 30 seconds, then add the bread cubes. Cook, tossing often, until the bread cubes are beginning to brown and get crispy, about 6 minutes. Season with the salt and 2 tablespoons Parmesan and cook until the cubes are evenly golden and crispy, another 3 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and reserve. Add the baby kale to the bowl with the dressing. Toss gently to coat. Add the toasted bread and the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan to the salad and toss once again. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19772,&quot;Warm Basil Gnocchi Salad with Carpaccio of Tomatoes 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Gray salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 1/2 pounds vine-ripened tomatoes, preferably a mixture of red, yellow, orange and variegated 10 handfuls salad greens 1/2 recipe Gnocchi, recipe follows About 3 1/2 ounces ricotta salata cheese or Parmesan Instructions: In a medium or large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Taste for balance and adjust with olive oil or lemon as necessary. Using a mandoline or sharp chef&#39;s knife, slice the tomatoes as thinly as possible and arrange on a large platter. Season with salt and pepper and spoon a little of the vinaigrette over the tomatoes. Toss the lettuce with a little more of the dressing and arrange on top of the tomatoes. When the gnocchi has drained, place in the bowl with the remaining vinaigrette. Toss gently, then scatter the gnocchi on the salad. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the cheese over the salad and serve immediately. 2 pounds russet potatoes Coarse salt 4 egg yolks 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/2 teaspoon salt Pinch freshly ground black pepper Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1 to 1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting or use store bought gnocchi (1 pound fresh or frozen) Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake potatoes until very soft on a bed of coarse salt in a baking dish, about 45 minutes. (The salt keeps the potatoes from touching the dish and developing a hard spot.) Cool potatoes until warm, then halve lengthwise and scoop out the flesh. Pass the flesh through a food mill or ricer, or push it through a coarse sieve. You should have about 4 cups. In a bowl, combine potato, egg yolks, Parmesan, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Work the mixture with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add 1 cup of the flour and knead very gently, patting and pressing the dough with your hands until all the flour is incorporated. Add some or all of the additional 1/4 cup flour if the dough feels too moist, it should be soft but shouldn&#39;t stick to your hands. Transfer dough to a work surface and roll into a log about 3 inches in diameter. Cut the log into 8 equal pieces. Give each piece a quarter-turn so that you are rolling the dough in a different direction, then roll into ropes, a generous 1/2-inch in diameter, as if making breadsticks. Flour the ropes generously, and then cut crosswise at 1/2-inch intervals. You can shape the gnocchi on a ridged butter paddle or on the back of a fork, or you can cook them as is. Let them dry at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before cooking Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Add the gnocchi and cook for about 90 seconds from the time they rise to the surface. Remove with a skimmer, drain well. Cook&#39;s Note: Although you need only a half batch of gnocchi for this recipe, take the time to make a whole batch, freeze half, and reap the rewards of your effort later. A carpaccio is paper thin slices of a food such as tomatoes that can turn a simple supper into an elegant meal. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 19773,&quot;Salt and Pepper-Fried Squid with Spicy Lemongrass Dipping Sauce 1 pound baby or medium squid (tentacles optional), skinned and cleaned Vegetable oil, for deep-frying 2 tablespoons coarse sea salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup cornstarch 1 or 2 limes, cut crosswise into 8 wedges Instructions: Slice clean, dry squid into 1/8-inch rings. If using medium-size squid, cut open squid and make a light crisscross pattern on the outside with a paring knife, then cut into approximately 1-inch pieces. Heat oil in wok over medium heat to about 375 degrees. Mix salt, pepper, and cornstarch in a plastic bag. Add the squid, seal the bag, and shake it to coat each piece evenly. Put a few squid pieces at a time the palm of your hand and shake off the excess cornstarch mix. Working in batches, deep-fry the squid until the rings turn golden and crisp, about 1 minute, or if using 1-inch square pieces, until they curl up and crisp, about 1 minute.

Dampen 2 layers of cheesecloth with water and line the sieve with the cheesecloth. Pour the milk and cream into a stainless-steel or enameled pot such as Le Creuset. Stir in the salt. Bring to a full boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar. Allow the mixture to stand for 1 minute until it curdles. It will separate into thick parts (the curds) and milky parts (the whey). Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined sieve and allow it to drain into the bowl at room temperature for 20 to 25 minutes, occasionally discarding the liquid that collects in the bowl. The longer you let the mixture drain, the thicker the ricotta. (I tend to like mine on the thicker side, but some prefer it moister.) Transfer the ricotta to a bowl, discarding the cheesecloth and any remaining whey. Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

When the oil begins to smoke slightly, place the short ribs in the pot and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast on all sides until well browned, about 15 minutes total. Remove from the pot and reduce the temperature to medium. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the same pot and add the celery, carrots and onion and cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the wine and raise the heat level to high, bring to a boil and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Tie the rosemary and thyme together with kitchen twine and add the bundle to the pot. Place the roasted ribs on top of the vegetables in the pot and add the beef stock. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Cover the pot and simmer until the meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Carefully remove the short ribs from the pot and set aside. Discard the herbs and skim the excess fat. Continue to cook the vegetables and sauce over medium heat for 20 minutes until reduced to the desired consistency. Put the ribs back in the pot and heat through. For the polenta: Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and very slowly whisk in the cornmeal polenta, whisking constantly to make sure there are no lumps. Switch to a wooden spoon and add the salt and pepper and simmer, stirring almost constantly, until the polenta thickens, about 30 minutes. When the polenta is thick and difficult to stir, quickly turn off the heat, add the grated cheeses and fold together. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan thoroughly while combining. For the mission fig glaze: Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepot over low heat and saute the shallots until just translucent, a few minutes. Add the vinegar and herbs and increase the heat to medium-high. Reduce by half, stirring constantly. Add the figs, sugar and wine and further reduce by a third, continuing to stir throughout. Remove from the heat when you have about 3/4 cup liquid remaining. Pour the glaze through a fine-mesh strainer into a small bowl, discarding the solids. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy pot or skillet over medium-high heat. Thoroughly wash the kale and remove the stems. Tear the leaves into large bite-size pieces and dry them, either in a salad spinner or on paper towels. Drop 5 to 7 pieces of kale in the hot oil and fry until crisp, 60 to 90 seconds. Drain on a wire rack set over paper towels and season with kosher salt while hot. Repeat with the remaining kale until all the pieces are crisp. To serve, spoon some polenta on each serving plate. Place a hot short rib from the cooking liquid on the polenta and spoon over some of the reduced liquid. Drizzle with the fig glaze. Top with some crispy kale. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Brunello di Montalcino, Nebbiolo]&quot; 19790,&quot;Grilled Peach Salad with Balsamic Bacon Vinaigrette Nonstick cooking spray 5 slices bacon, chopped 1 shallot, finely chopped 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 firm, ripe large peaches, pitted and quartered Extra-virgin olive oil 5 ounces baby spinach 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat and spray with nonstick spray.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the flour, cornmeal, Parmesan, tarragon, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse until incorporated. Add the heavy cream and process until the dough comes together. If the dough is too dry, add a little more cream, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Lightly flour a sheet of parchment paper and place the dough on top. Shape the dough into a rectangle with your hands, then lightly flour the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin until it is a little less than 1/4 inch thick (about a 15-by-12-inch rectangle). Poke all over with a fork. Cut the dough into squares or rectangles and carefully transfer them to the prepared baking sheet. Bake until light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool completely on a rack. For the mushrooms: Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil.

Cut all the vegetables into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Cut the onions through the base core to keep some of the layers in chunky pieces. Toss all the vegetables with garlic, olive oil and salt in large bowl. Season generously with pepper. Carefully remove the heated baking sheets from the oven, brush or drizzle with olive oil. Divide the vegetables evenly between the 2 pans, spreading them out to assure they don&#39;t steam while roasting.

On a floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a 12-inch square, about 1/8 inch thick. Invert a 10-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet over the pastry. Using the skillet as a guide, cut a 10-inch round of pastry. Transfer to a plate and chill in the refrigerator while you prepare the apples. Heat the same skillet over medium heat. Melt the butter and then sprinkle over the sugar and add the apples on top. Once the sugar begins to melt, adjust the heat so the juices bubble rapidly. Cook, stirring, until the apples are tender and juices are light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat. Using a fork, nudge the apples into 2 concentric circles (it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect) in the skillet. Top with the chilled pastry round and tuck the edges in. Gently prick the pastry in 4 or 5 places with a fork. Bake for 10 minutes at 425 degrees F, until the pastry is puffed and light golden. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake until the pastry is a deep golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let sit 10 minutes. To unmold, place a serving plate over the skillet and quickly but carefully flip the pan. The tart will unmold onto the plate, and if a few apple slices stick to the pan, return them to the tart. Let cool at least 20 minutes before serving to allow the syrup to sink into the tart.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the black sesame paste, butter, vanilla, cinnamon and salt and beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, add the powdered sugar, and turn the mixer back on to low speed to incorporate. Once you&#39;re reasonably confident that powdered sugar won&#39;t fly everywhere you can increase the speed to medium and continue mixing, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until everything is combined and you have a soft dough. Roll 1-inch balls of the dough until very smooth and place them on the parchment paper. Freeze for 20 minutes. In a small bowl or mug, combine the chocolate and coconut oil and microwave in 30-second increments, stirring after each, until smooth and melted. Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate in a mixing bowl set over a small pot of barely simmering water, stirring until just melted. Working one at a time, pick up the frozen balls by poking the tops with a toothpick or wooden skewer and then dip them into the chocolate about 3/4 of the way, leaving the top exposed. Scrape excess chocolate off the bottom, transfer back to the baking sheet, take the toothpick out and then smooth over the hole with a knife. Sprinkle with flaky salt and black and white sesame seeds, if desired. Allow the chocolate to set before serving.

Add the olive oil and cilantro and whisk well. Add the mango, red pepper, onion, jalapeno, and lime zest and toss to coat. Gently stir in the crabmeat to keep it from breaking up. Set aside while preparing the avocados. Cut the avocados in half and remove pit. Squeeze the remaining lime half over the avocado flesh, using the lime half to spread it evenly, in order to keep them from turning black. Toss the crab salad, check for seasoning, and mound into the avocado halves, dividing it evenly. (Use an ice cream scoop for neat, even rounds, if that&#39;s your thing.)

Cut a 3/4-inch wide strip off each side of the pastry and reserve. Roll out the pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface to a 10-inch square and transfer to a sheet pan or cookie sheet. Brush the edges of the square with the egg. Working with 1 strip at a time, stand the strips along the edges of the pastry square and crimp where they meet. You want to create a shallow box, where the pastry square is the base and the 4 strips are the walls. Overlap the strips at the corners, stretching them, if necessary, to complete the walls of the box. Brush the border with the egg. Pierce the center of the pastry all over with fork. Bake until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely. Using an electric mixer, beat the cream to soft peaks. With the mixer still running, gradually add the sugar and continue to beat to stiff peaks. Add the liqueur and beat until just well blended; be careful not to overmix or the whipped cream will turn into a buttery consistency and start to separate. Using a large spatula, fold in the nuts. Spoon the cream mixture into the prepared pastry crust. Arrange the berries over the cream. Sift the cocoa powder over and serve. Note: You can use any fruit that&#39;s in season (orange segments, berries, plums, bananas, grapes). Blueberries make a good substitute for the raspberries, and sliced peaches or nectarines are delicious as well. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 19806,&quot;Herbed Spicy Sausage and Fennel Baked Pasta Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced Pinch crushed red pepper flakes One 28-ounce can plum tomatoes, crushed by hand One 15-ounce can plum tomatoes, crushed by hand 4 large fresh basil sprigs plus 1 cup chopped fresh basil 1 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 pound dried rigatoni 3/4 pound spicy Italian sausage, casing removed 1 head fennel, quartered, cored, and thinly sliced 3 cups shredded Italian fontina cheese 1 cup grated Parmesan Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

In a saucepan, bring the cream to a simmer over medium-high heat. Quickly pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let sit for 1 minute; then whisk together until the chocolate is melted. Whisk in the mascarpone, then strain into a bowl big enough to whip the mixture in the next day. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight. Remove the chocolate mixture from the refrigerator and whip until fluffy and slightly stiffened, being careful not to overwhip (like heavy cream, the mixture can turn to butter if whipped too long). Refrigerate. Combine the espresso and coffee liqueur in a shallow dish. (I wear rubber gloves for the next step to keep my fingers from getting stained). Pick up 1 ladyfinger, then place it in the espresso for just as long as it takes you to pick up the next 1 and place it in the espresso (about 10 seconds). Fish the first 1 out and place it in the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch baking dish. Repeat with the remaining ladyfingers, arranging them in rows in the bottom of the dish and continuously adding and removing the ladyfingers from the espresso mixture. (This will allow them to soak for the perfect amount of time without getting soggy--they should be wet on the outside but still have an unsoaked core at the center.) When you have made a complete layer of ladyfingers, spread half of the chocolate mixture over the ladyfingers and cover lightly with some of the chocolate shavings. Repeat, making 1 more complete layer of ladyfingers, chocolate, and shavings. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve, at least 2 hours. Serve cold, dishing out spoonfuls with a large serving spoon. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 19816,&quot;Grilled Flat Iron Steak with Blue Cheese Butter and Grilled Grapes 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped 1 tablespoon fresh oregano, chopped 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 1/2 pounds flat iron or flank steak 1 small bunch (1/2 pound) champagne grapes, broken into clusters 3 tablespoons softened unsalted butter 1 heaping tablespoon crumbled blue cheese 1 tablespoon fresh chives, chopped 1/8 teaspoon cracked black pepper Pinch of salt Instructions: In a resealable plastic bag combine garlic, rosemary, oregano, kosher salt, black pepper and olive oil.

Line two 12-cup standard muffin tins with cupcake liners. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Set aside. Combine the butter, granulated sugar, sour cream, vanilla and eggs in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about three-quarters full. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 21 to 23 minutes, rotating the pans once about halfway through baking. Cool the cupcakes in the pans for 5 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. For the frosting: Beat the butter, peanut butter, vanilla and salt using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar and continue to beat until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes more. For the assembly and decorating: Put 1 cup of frosting in a piping bag fitted with a large round tip and set aside. Put the jimmies in a shallow bowl. Frost a cupcake, using about 2 tablespoons of the remaining frosting per cupcake, and then gently dipping the top into the jimmies, turning the cupcake until the top is coated. Repeat with the remaining cupcakes. Arrange the cupcakes in 4 rows on a large serving plate or cutting board. Fit a marshmallow between each cupcake, 5 marshmallows per row, to fill in the gaps between the cupcakes in the rows. Using the frosting in the piping bag, pipe thick cross shapes between where the cupcakes meet one another and over the marshmallows so there are no visible gaps between the cupcakes. Coat with sprinkles. To make goal posts for the cupcake \\field,\\ microwave the chocolate chips in a small microwave-safe bowl until just melted, 30 to 45 seconds. Keep 2 cookie sticks whole for the bases of the posts. Cut off and discard (or eat!) the bottom third of the remaining cookie sticks. Dip the top of one of the longest cookie sticks into the melted chocolate and adhere it to the middle of one of the cut cookie sticks so that they form a capital T shape. Next, dip the cut ends of two short sticks into chocolate and adhere them to either side of the cross on the T. Lay the goal post on a flat surface and repeat with the remaining 4 cookie sticks to make the second goal. Allow goals to fully harden, 15 to 20 minutes, or place in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. Using the decorators&#39; icing, pipe 10 lines across the cupcake field to represent yard lines. Pipe out the number 50 in the middle for the 50-yard line. Heat the Tootsie Rolls in the microwave on high in 5-second intervals until they are soft and pliable. Mash them together and form into a football. Use the icing to pipe the lacing on the football; use a toothpick if necessary to help define the lacing. Place the football on the field. Place the gummy candies on the field to represent players and then stick the goal posts into cupcakes at each end of the field. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19818,&quot;Jalapeno Lime Oyster Shooters 1/2 cup lime juice 1/2 cup water 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely diced 12 oysters, shucked 1/2 red pepper, finely diced, for garnish Instructions: Put the lime juice, water, sugar, salt, and diced jalapenos into an 8 by 8-inch metal cake pan and stir until the sugar and salt are dissolved.

Wrap in a clean kitchen towel and set aside. Cut the cucumber into narrow strips about 4 inches long. Mix the sushi rice with the sesame seeds. Just before rolling sushi, toast the nori by passing the shiny side over a high flame. The color of the nori will change from brownish black to dark green. (Without toasting, the nori will be gummy and hard to chew.) Cut toasted nori sheets in half crosswise. Lay a 1/2 a sheet of the nori, shiny side down, on a bamboo rolling mat. Combine the rice vinegar and water in a mixing bowl, and moisten your hands with this hand vinegar to keep the rice from sticking to your hands as you work. Spread about 1 cup of the sushi rice on 3/4 of the nori closest to you, in a layer about 1/4 inch thick, spreading it to the edges. Smear a thin line of the wasabi across the center of the rice, and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of chili oil. Lay 1/4 of the cucumber strips and 1/4 of the tuna slices evenly along the wasabi. To roll, hold the line of ingredients in place with fingertips, and use thumbs to push up and turn the end of the bamboo mat so that the edge of the nori is lifted up and meets the far edge of the sheet. Correct the shape by gently but firmly pressing the bamboo mat around the roll for about 30 seconds to shape it. Make 3 more rolls. Use a wet knife to cut each roll into 1-inch rounds. Arrange sushi on a platter or individual plates and garnish with the vinegared ginger. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 19822,&quot;Grilled Stuffed Jalapeno Chiles 8 whole fresh jalapenos 1 cup shredded mozzarella<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 8 slices center-cut smoked bacon<br> Instructions: Preheat a gas or charcoal grill or stovetop grill pan over high heat.

Add the leeks and saute just until they start to turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute about 1 minute more. Add the carrots and celery and continue sauteing until the vegetables deepen in color but have not yet begun to brown, 3 to 4 minutes more. Pour the stock into the pan, bring it to a boil, and reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Sprinkle in a generous pinch of salt. Tie the peppercorns, thyme, and parsley in a square of cheesecloth, securing it with kitchen string. Add this bouquet garni to the pan. Stir in the beans, zucchini, summer squash, and tomato. Continue simmering until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the Pistou: Put the garlic and tomatoes in a blender or food processor with about 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Begin processing. With the machine running, add the basil leaves, and then pour in enough extra-virgin olive oil to make a smooth, thick, but fluid paste. Transfer about 2/3 of the paste into a serving bowl to pass alongside the soup. Make the Goat Cheese Croutons: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush the bread slices with olive oil and arrange them on a baking sheet. Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove them from the oven and turn on the broiler. Spread 1 side of each crouton with goat cheese and put it back on the baking sheet. Broil until the cheese is warm and slightly bubbly, about 3 minutes. Set aside. When the soup is ready, stir the remaining pistou into the saucepan, ladling some of the hot broth into the blender or processor bowl to swirl and rinse any pesto clinging inside into the pan. Remove and discard the bouquet garni. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with a little more salt. Ladle the soup into individual heated serving bowls. Float a crouton in the center of each bowl. With a spoon, drizzle a little more pistou over the crouton and soup in each bowl. Serve immediately, passing more pistou alongside for each person to add, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 19902,&quot;Pork with Clams 4 cloves garlic 2 tablespoons salt 1 1/2 pound pork loin 2 tablespoons chili sauce 4 tablespoons lard 2 pounds clams Instructions: Mix the garlic and salt and crush into a paste.

Add the potatoes and blanch until al dente. Drain and set aside to cool. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the beef, pork, and the onions. Brown the meat, then discard the grease. Add the potatoes and moisten the mixture with the beef soup base, as needed. Use the instant potato to tighten the mixture, if needed. Season with cinnamon, nutmeg, garlic, black pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Pour the filling into the dough-lined pie plate. Level it off and cover with the remaining circle of dough. Pinch the edges of the bottom layer and top layer of dough together and create the knuckle-like pie edge ridges. Trim off any excess dough using a sharp knife. Brush the top of the pie with the egg wash. Make a few slits in the top crust to allow the steam to escape. Bake until cooked through and the top of the pie is golden brown, about 45 minutes.

Add the flour all at once and stir briskly with a wooden spoon until well mixed and no lumps of flour remain. Remove from the heat. Add 4 of the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well with a wooden spoon after each. The dough should look soft and glossy and keep a \\hook\\ shape when the spoon is pulled from the dough. If not, beat in the last egg. Scrape the dough into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Pour enough canola oil into a deep heavy skillet (cast iron is ideal) to fill 1-inch. Heat over medium heat until the tip of the handle of a wooden spoon gives off a slow steady stream of tiny bubbles. Carefully pipe the dough into the oil, forming 6-inch crullers. Pipe only as many crullers into the oil as fit comfortably. Overcrowding the pan will result in soggy crullers. Fry, turning once, until golden brown on each side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining dough. Put the sugar and the cinnamon in a paper bag. Crimp the top and shake well to mix. Drop a few crullers at a time into the bag and shake until coated.

Line an 18-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium saucepan, bring the butter, salt and 1 cup water to a boil over medium-high heat. Decrease the heat to low. Add the flour and stir constantly until a sticky ball of dough forms, about 4 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium-low speed until there is no longer any steam. Decrease the mixer speed to low and add 3 of the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition. The dough will be done once it clings to the paddle in \\spokes\\ as it spins in the bowl. You may need to add another egg to get this consistency. Add the Gruyere and mix to combine. Dab a small amount of the dough under the parchment paper at the four corners and in the center of the prepared baking sheet to keep the parchment paper in place. Using a 3-ounce ice cream scoop, scoop out the dough onto the parchment, 2 inches apart. You will end up with 12 scoops. In a small bowl, whisk the remaining egg with a splash of water and a pinch of salt. Brush each cream puff with the egg wash and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Bake for 20 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet 180 degrees. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake until deep golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer the cream puffs to a wire rack and allow to cool to room temperature. For the cheese mousse: Meanwhile, add the cream cheese to a bowl, and using a hand mixer, beat until soft, about 1 minute. Add the processed cheese, paprika, salt and white pepper and beat until fluffy and smooth. Mix in the heavy cream as needed until the mixture is velvety and smooth but not too loose. Transfer to a piping bag with a large star tip. Set aside. For the burger patties: Transfer the ground beef to a cutting board. Cut into 12 squares, then roll each square into a ball. Place onto a piece of wax paper. Fold the wax paper over, leaving room for the meat to spread out. Using a rolling pin, roll the patties until paper thin. Season with salt and black pepper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and, once melted, cook the patties for 4 minutes on the first side. Flip and continue to cook for another minute or two. Remove to a plate. Add the onions to the same skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and translucent, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Slowly add the flour, mixing quickly to avoid lumps. Knead until the ingredients are evenly combined. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then shape into small balls (about 3 ounces each). Using a hand tortilla press, place a piece of waxed paper on the bottom, center a dough ball on top and cover with another piece of waxed paper. Gently press down to flatten the ball into a thin circle (not too thin or it will crack). Alternatively, you can use a wooden board or large plate to press the dough.<br> Remove the top paper and add 1 tablespoon of the cheese to the middle of the pressed dough. Carefully fold one edge of the circle over the cheese to the other edge, and press the edges together to close the empanada. Using a small bowl, place it over the empanada close to the edge and press down slightly to cut the edge and evenly seal it. Repeat with the remaining dough and cheese. Set the empanadas on a large platter and refrigerate for 30 minutes. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, add enough vegetable oil to fill the pan about a third of the way. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Gently remove the wax paper from each empanada and fry two to four at a time (depending on the pan size) until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 19945,&quot;Hot Pot with Crab Wontons 2 Dungeness crabs, 1 1/2 pounds each 1 tablespoon peanut oil 2-inch piece ginger, peeled and whacked open with the flat side of a knife 2 shallots, halved 1 fresh red chili, split 2 tablespoons light miso 10 ounces shiitake mushrooms 1 handful fresh cilantro, hand-torn 1 lime, juiced 1 tablespoon peanut oil 2-inch piece fresh ginger, grated 2 shallots, finely chopped 1/2 carrot, finely chopped 1 pound Dungeness crabmeat, picked through for shells 1 green onion, finely chopped 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 (12-ounce) package square wonton wrappers 1 egg white, for brushing Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Cornstarch, for dusting Instructions: To make the soup: Remove the claws from the crabs and quarter the bodies. In a large stockpot, add the oil, ginger, shallots, and cl for 2 minutes until fragrant. Then add the crabs and miso. Cover with 1 gallon of cold water and place over medium heat; simmer for 30 minutes. In the meantime, you can focus on assembling the wontons. Heat a skillet over medium flame and coat with the peanut oil; add the ginger, shallot, and carrot, saute for 2 minutes to soften. Put the lump crabmeat in a mixing bowl and scrape in the ginger mixture. Fold in the green onion, cilantro, mayonnaise, and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Be careful not to mash the crabmeat, you want that texture when you bite into the wonton. Lay a wonton wrapper on a flat surface and brush with the beaten egg white. Drop 1 tablespoon of the crab filling onto the center of the wrapper. Fold the wonton in half, corner to corner, to form a triangle. Press around the filling to knock out any air bubbles, then press the seam together to seal so the filling doesn\\u2019t seep out. Brush the 2 side points with beaten egg white. Lay your index finger in the center so you have something to press up against, then fold the 2 sides into the center, slightly overlapping, and press the dough against your finger with your thumb to form a tight seal. Lightly dust the filled wontons with cornstarch to keep them from sticking together and place them on a cookie sheet. When these are folded they look like Pope hats. When the wontons are all filled and folded, strain the soup broth to remove the solids and pour it into the hot pot. Bring the soup to a simmer. Toss in the shiitake mushrooms and the wontons; simmer for 15 minutes until the wontons are cooked. Add the lime juice and cilantro; ladle into soup bowls and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 19946,&quot;Pad Thai 1-ounce tamarind paste 3/4 cup boiling water 2 tablespoons fish sauce 2 tablespoons palm sugar 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 4 ounces rice stick noodles 6 ounces Marinated Tofu, recipe follows 1 to 2 tablespoons peanut oil 1 cup chopped scallions, divided 2 teaspoons minced garlic 2 whole eggs, beaten 2 teaspoons salted cabbage 1 tablespoon dried shrimp 3 ounces bean sprouts, divided 1/2 cup roasted salted peanuts, chopped, divided Freshly ground dried red cl peppers, to taste 1 lime, cut into wedges 6 ounces extra-firm tofu, not silken 1 1/2 cups soy sauce 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder Instructions: Place the tamarind paste in the boiling water and set aside while preparing the other ingredients.<br> Combine the fish sauce, palm sugar, and rice wine vinegar in a small bowl and set aside.<br> Place the rice stick noodles in a mixing bowl and cover with hot water.

With a rolling pin, roll the pate sablee using quick, short strokes from the middle of the dough, until you&#39;ve formed a circle roughly 10-inches in diameter and about 1/4-inch thick. Every few strokes, lift and turn the dough a quarter-turn, dusting underneath with a small amount more of flour, if necessary, to prevent sticking. Place your rolling pin over the bottom quarter of the dough and lift the bottom edge of the dough up and over the pin. Roll the pin away from you slightly to help gather the dough circle onto the pin, then unroll the dough onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator to chill for 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the plum wedges in a bowl and toss with the sugar and juice of half a lemon. Remove the baking sheet from the freezer. Working from the center, arrange the plum wedges thickly over the dough, leaving about a 1 1/2-inch border all around the edges. Fold the exposed edges of dough up and over the plums so that the galette looks something like a pizza with a border of crust all around the outside. Brush the dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle with more sugar. Place on the bottom rack of the oven and bake until the crust is golden and the fruit is soft, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly on a baking rack. If using, sprinkle with the toasted almonds. When the galette is no longer hot to the touch, slide onto a cake plate or pedestal. Serve warm or at room temperature. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse to combine. Add the butter and pulse the food processor on and off until the mixture resembles coarse sand with pea-sized lumps of butter still showing. Add the egg yolk and the ice water and pulse on and off until the mixture comes together but does not form a single mass. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and gather it up into a loose ball. Working with a small bit of dough at a time, smoosh the dough across the counter away from you with the heel of your hand and then scrape it up with a pastry cutter and gather it back together, forming a second ball. Repeat with the remaining dough until all the smooshed dough is in a single ball. Flatten into a disk, wrap well in plastic wrap, and let rest in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.

Cover the pan with a lid, reduce the heat to a simmer, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the peaches are cooked through (they will be soft when pricked with a knife.) Remove the peaches, and set aside on a warm plate. Continue to boil the syrup until its volume has reduced to about 1 cup. Set aside to cool.<br> Brush the peaches with a little of the syrup. Stir half of the remaining syrup and the ground star anise into the Greek-style yogurt until well combined, adding more syrup as necessary, to taste.<br> To serve, cut each of the spiced poached peaches in half and place 2 of the peach halves onto each of the serving plates. Spoon a portion of the star anise yogurt alongside each peach. Drizzle a little syrup over each peach. Sprinkle over the toasted almonds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 19960,&quot;Hushpuppies 3 cups cornmeal 1 cup self-rising flour<br> 1/2 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons dried onions<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br> 3/4 to 1 cup hot water<br> Oil, for frying Instructions: Combine the cornmeal, flour, sugar, dried onions, baking powder, salt and pepper in a large bowl and mix. Next, add the hot water slowly until the mixture begins to thicken. The batter should be thick and start to rise quickly. Continue to mix and knead until the batter stops rising. Once the batter is thick enough, let it stand for 30 minutes before cooking. When ready to cook, add enough oil to a frying pan for the hushpuppies to be submerged. Heat over high heat to 350 degrees F. Use a spoon to carefully drop the batter into the oil. Make sure to spread them apart so they do not stick together. Fry until golden brown on all sides. (The hushpuppies will rise to the top of the oil, so make sure to turn them in the oil on all sides so they cook evenly.) Repeat with the remaining batter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 19961,&quot;Beef Bourguignon 1 tablespoon olive oil 8 slices smoked bacon, chopped<br> 2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 5 sprigs fresh thyme 4 medium carrots, chopped<br> 1 large yellow onion, halved and sliced<br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste<br> One 750-milliliter bottle good dry red wine, such as Cote du Rhone<br> 2 cups beef stock<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium- high heat, then add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the bacon to a large plate. Meanwhile, dry the beef cubes with paper towels and season them with salt and pepper. In batches in single layers, sear the beef in the hot bacon drippings, turning to brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per batch. Remove the seared cubes to the plate with the bacon and continue searing until all the beef is browned. Add the thyme, carrots, onion and tomato paste to the pot. Toss in the fat in the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Put the beef and bacon back in the pot with their juices. Add the wine plus enough beef stock to almost cover the meat. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Put the butter and flour in a small saucepan over medium heat and whisk together constantly until the raw flavor of the flour cooks out, 2 to 3 minutes. Put the beef Bourguignon over medium heat, stir in the butter mixture and cook until the stew thickens and the meat is very tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Remove the thyme stems and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 19962,&quot;Carrot Cake with Ginger Mascarpone Frosting 2 cups sugar 1 1/3 cups vegetable oil 3 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 pound carrots, grated (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 cup raisins 1 cup chopped walnuts Ginger Mascarpone Frosting, recipe follows Crystallized ginger (not in syrup), chopped, for garnish 12 ounces Italian mascarpone cheese, at room temperature 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 2 cups sifted confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/3 cup minced crystallized ginger (not in syrup) 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease two 9-by-2-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper, and grease and flour the pans. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the sugar, oil, and eggs on medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until light yellow and thickened. Stir in the vanilla. In another bowl, sift together the 2 cups of flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. With the mixer on low, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ones. In a medium bowl, toss the carrots, raisins, walnuts, and the 1 tablespoon of flour. Stir into the batter with a rubber spatula. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 10 minutes, lower the heat to 350 degrees F, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 15 minutes, turn out onto a baking rack, and cool completely. Place one cake on a flat serving plate, rounded-side down. Spread half the frosting on the top (not the sides). Place the second cake on top of the first cake, rounded-side up. Frost just the top of the second cake. Sprinkle with the ginger and serve at room temperature. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the mascarpone, cream cheese, confectioners? sugar, cream, and vanilla together for about 1 minute, until light and fluffy.

F. Line an 8-inch square baking dish with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides; lightly brush with melted butter. Toss the cookie crumbs, sugar and melted butter in a small bowl until well combined. Firmly press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the pan to make a thin layer. Bake until firm and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let cool at least 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325? F. Make the filling: Combine the cream cheese, cream of coconut, sugar and salt in a large bowl and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed, scraping down the bowl a few times, until smooth and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, sour cream and coconut extract until combined. Spread the filling over the crust.<br> Bake until the edges are set but the center is still a little jiggly, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool to room temperature, about 3 hours. Meanwhile, make the topping: Combine the dried and crushed pineapple, cream of coconut, lemon juice and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the dried pineapple is tender and the liquid has reduced to just a few spoonfuls of syrup, about 20 minutes. Let the topping cool, stirring occasionally, 30 to 45 minutes. Spoon the topping over the cheesecake layer and gently spread to cover. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Remove the bars from the pan, peel off the foil and cut into pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 19964,&quot;Pollo al Mattone</p>",126)]))}const g=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
