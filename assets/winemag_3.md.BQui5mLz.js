We celebrated the bicentenary of the Estates buildings dating from 1815, and the inauguration of the new facilities, designed or reorganised, by Norman Foster. It is easy to imagine how much we dreamed that 2015 would be a great vintage! Without doubt, some of the result is owed to decisions made at the time of blending; only 35% of the harvest went into the first wine, which was a record of severity for a vintage of this standard. As usual, it was the Cabernet Sauvignon in first place with 87% of the blend; in addition to its concentration and finesse, this year it has an unusual vigour and strength. The Merlot has nothing to be ashamed of, at least in the great plots; it makes up 8% of the first wine. Cabernet Franc (3%) and Petit Verdot (2%) also find their place in this elitist blend, which confirms that, enable all grape varieties to express their own propensity. How can we compare 2015 to its predecessors? It is a thankless task, and a little futile, particularly for the great vintages. There are, of course, similarities, affinities, and also some differences where we do not expect to find them But we can evoke a combination of the strength of 2005, the flesh of 2009, the subtlety of 2010, and the inimitable charm of Chateau Margaux.

It was a question of a few showers at the beginning of the harvest... From the beginning, the wines, whether Merlot or Cabernet, had astonishing concentration, recalling the 1995 and 1996 vintages. At first, they tended to be a little firm and austere, but with barrel ageing they gained a lot of roundness and harmony. Today, Chateau Margaux 1998 displays aromas of great freshness, in which fruit, particularly red berry fruit, is to the fore, and in which lingering hints of vanilla and roasted coffee beans mingle slowly into the wine. The impression on the palate is of great power with fresh, firm but fat tannins, which give this wine a very classic dimension. 1998 is undeniably a long-ageing wine, which will only come out completely in fifteen years' time. However, it can be drunk now, out of curiosity, since it has nothing aggressive about it.

The grapes had rarely, perhaps never, been as concentrated, particularly the Cabernets. In certain cases we surpassed the already historic levels of the 1986 and 1995 vintages, with an elegance and softness on the palate, reminiscent also of the 1990 and 1996 vintages. It seemed in fact that 2000 was setting a new benchmark in quality, never before attained, at least in terms of style. Throughout the barrel ageing time, these first impressions were gradually confirmed. The wine has now acquired a slightly tighter texture and at the same time keeps such a soft and especially long finish that it seems to go on forever The bottling took place in November 2002, after over 2 years of barrel ageing. Such a long ageing is unusual but not as rare as one might think: most of the greatest vintages are aged for that length of time.

We celebrated the bicentenary of the Estates buildings dating from 1815, and the inauguration of the new facilities, designed or reorganised, by Norman Foster. It is easy to imagine how much we dreamed that 2015 would be a great vintage! Without doubt, some of the result is owed to decisions made at the time of blending; only 35% of the harvest went into the first wine, which was a record of severity for a vintage of this standard. As usual, it was the Cabernet Sauvignon in first place with 87% of the blend; in addition to its concentration and finesse, this year it has an unusual vigour and strength. The Merlot has nothing to be ashamed of, at least in the great plots; it makes up 8% of the first wine. Cabernet Franc (3%) and Petit Verdot (2%) also find their place in this elitist blend, which confirms that, enable all grape varieties to express their own propensity. How can we compare 2015 to its predecessors? It is a thankless task, and a little futile, particularly for the great vintages. There are, of course, similarities, affinities, and also some differences where we do not expect to find them But we can evoke a combination of the strength of 2005, the flesh of 2009, the subtlety of 2010, and the inimitable charm of Chateau Margaux.

People thought his numerous assurances that 2000 was the greatest Pavie ever produced were premature as well as arrogant. However, after tasting this extraordinary blend of 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc, and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon (made from low yields of 28-30 hectoliters per hectare) six separate times in 2003, it is unquestionably one of the most monumental wines Bordeaux has ever produced. Bottled in March, 2003, about nine months later than other 2000s, the color is an opaque purple, and the bouquet offers up notes of liquid minerals, blackberries, cherries, and cassis intermixed with spice box, cedar, and white flowers. On the palate, it exhibits a massive display of richness and extract, yet with pinpoint delineation and vibrancy as well as a 60+ second finish, this is the kind of phenomenal wine that Perse's critics were afraid he might produce - a no-compromise, immortal wonder that represents the essence of one of Bordeaux's greatest terroirs.

It leaves a mouthwatering impression of freshness on the palate, a sure sign of very ripe grapes. This great wine will benefit greatly from gentle aeration (decanting and large glasses).

On the palate, this enormous effort is reminiscent of dry vintage port, with fabulous ripeness, a huge, unctuous texture, enormous body, and a colossal 65-second finish. I did not have the benefit of tasting it side by side with the equally perfect 1998, but it appears the 2000 is a more massive, macho/masculine wine, with more obvious tannin and structure than the seamless 1998.

Perfect food wine."},{"name":"Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris 2011","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"A very floral, fruity, and surprisingly rich Gris! This wine has flashy gardenia and jasmine flowers upfront, with pink grapefruit, lychee, pineapple, and fresh peach in its fruit-basket. The palate is pretty and mouth-filling, with layers of sweet fruit, slate, tangy acid and an amazing breadth and length that lingers after the wine is gone. A great pair for Thai food!"},{"name":"Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris 2013","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Beautiful fresh aromatic notes of hang-dried linens, white blossom, Asian pear, and lemon curd greet us on the entry, with lingering hints of candied ginger and butterscotch on the finish of the nose. The palate is especially balanced, showing warmth and spice from a warmer summer in the form of dried apricot, peach pit, and rose petal. The summer fruits are followed by pleasantly lithe acidity and the balancing fruit sweetness of salmon berries, tart cherry, and mandarin, all brought on by a cooler finish to the harvest season."},{"name":"Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris 2014","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Perfectly balanced between rich and refreshing, bright and subtle, and slightly sweet and slightly tart.  The nose shows characteristic fleshy white peach, fruit cocktail, sweet Rainier cherries, and a sprinkling of delicate pollen.  The mouth is where the follow-through completes, skating lines of balance from a touch of residual sugar and lemon-zest acidity; both brightness and weight from a bit of alcohol and some slight pear-skin-like phenolics on the mid-palate; and length of finish and supple softer fruit on the end. Ripe melon, honeysuckle, pineapple and nectarine all make an appearance."},{"name":"Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris 2015","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Showing brightness in an otherwise rich year, the Gris is complex, moderately weighted on the palate, with clean aromatics reminiscent of morning dew, stone fruit and honeysuckle, red apple and melon.

There are yellow to white blossoms, juicy Asian pear and lifted spicy notes of ginger and white pepper on the nose. The palate is crisp, showing stone fruit, lemongrass and talc. With great acid tension, fleshiness and a viscous yet supple texture, this wine is perhaps reminiscent of a warm summer day cooling down to a light breezy night."},{"name":"Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris 2017","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"A great example of why we make Pinot Gris!

Impressed by the quality and diversity of Washington wines, Antinori began discussing a partnership with Chateau Ste. Michelle that would challenge them both to step out of their own proven perspective to achieve something new. The idea took hold, and Col Solare was born with the 1995 vintage.  Grapes were gently crushed and pumped over twice daily during a ten-day fermentation. At dryness, a portion of the wine went through an extended maceration of about two weeks to increase extract. We moved the wine with gravity into new and one-year-old French oak barrels; each barrel was racked periodically throughout 22 months of barrel aging. Finally at blending, many individual lots of wine were tasted before winemakers Ron Bunnell and Renzo Cotarella settled on a wine with less Cabernet and more Merlot than previous vintages of Col Solare. The 1999 Merlot had tremendous structure and depth. Syrah added flesh to the vintage's full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon. A bit of Malbec enhanced the wine's elegance and added suppleness. Sensational chocolate and caramel aromas join with an earthy note and a hint of tobacco to introduce a wine with generous black currant and black cherry set off by a trace of allspice.

The clay iron, mineral notes mesh with the complexity of the crushed rock making the wine very distinctive. Add to that the cooling aromatics of the vintage, like fresh herb notes of rosemary and chocolate mint, and the wine becomes very vivid. With ten years of vine age here on the property, the flavors and texture to this wine are becoming more and more classic and true to what I consider an \\"old vine\\" nose. The layers of flavor continue with earthy notes of wet soil and graphite. Because of the superb balance and ripeness from 2010, the tannins coat the palate seamlessly. They are broad, suave and creamy. They also reflect the great structure which comes so easily in cooler styled vintages. Because of the freshness and harmony of the flavors and structure, I believe the 2010 IX Estate Red will age for nearly 30 years.

This vintage could be enjoyed near term for its approachability and suaveness, yet in my opinion it will have the same long aging curve of our other vintages from \\"IX Estate\\" as it matures in bottle. The natural acidity in 2011 will no doubt add longevity to the wine, preserving it for decades."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Red 2012","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2012 vintage of IX Estate portrays the same exuberance of the 2002, with added purity and definition."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Red 2013","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2013 \\"IX Estate\\" possesses all the aromas one can attain from this heralded vineyard, seemingly a hypothetical blend of our greatest vintages. This captivating wine seduces you with its concentration of flavors, but beneath the surface we find a wine brimming with nuance. With a nose of sweet floral blossoms and bouquet garni the wine envelops the senses. Vibrant notes of licorice, dark fruit and botanicals meld together with flavors of pure wet mineral and iron. I love the way this vintage weaves its classic Cabernet Sauvignon crme de cassis and dark cherry flavors together with its terroir, like the intoxicating notes of sage oil and juniper. The opulence on the nose carries through onto the palate where it builds smooth, supple layers of tannin. The succulent and savory texture builds to a long, rich finish. Though the 2013 vintage is compelling upon release, the power, breadth and depth will most certainly age for a generation- if you let it."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Red 2014","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2014 IX Estate exhibits a bouquet that marries richness with nuance. The vintage highlights the subtleties of each site. The classic black cherry and licorice at the foundation of this wine are threaded together beautifully with notes of Proven?al herbs, iron mineral, and scorched earth. Fresh botanical herbal notes and savory bay leaf show the classicism of Napa Valley and Cabernet Sauvignon itself. The complex flavors are pure and delineated; its immense subtleties are intoxicating. The seamless texture of the 2014 IX Estate is suave and smooth, such that its elegance belies its intensity."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Red 2015","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, IX Estate Red is distinguished by complex fruit interplays, a luscious nose of rustic herbs, iron, clay and black fruits, huge layers of flavor and supple, sweet tannins impeccably well-balanced. The number IX refers to the parcel number and is also significant as the date Ann and Joe were married: 9/9. The 2002 vintage was the first, of four vintages, from this property to achieve the highest accolade of a perfect wine.

Syrah generally invokes all sorts of complex secondary aromatics unlike any other grape varietal. The wine possesses the Colgin hallmark of saturated black color and fresh uplifting aromatics of tobacco leaf, white and black pepper. This Syrah expresses its characteristics in a multidimensional manner with primary fruit aromatics moving to terroir driven earth, rock and organic aromas. The overall tannin structure and mouth feel are plush and suave. As with all of the wines produced by Colgin Cellars, our most important goal is to accentuate the elusive terroir. This Syrah continually evolves in the glass and is beautiful near term, will gain complexity with time and has the balance and structure to age for two decades."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Syrah 2005","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2005 is the most aromatic Syrah produced from this estate yet. Our old world clones have taken root so well on this amazing site and are coming into their own, reflecting not only their origin in the Rhone, but also the organic nuances of the IX Estate soils. My first impression of this wine is the tobacco leaf, bacon fat and lilac of the old Hermitage clone that just leap out of the glass. Those elusive aromas are layered by the pervasive meatiness of the Cote Rotie clones, like succulent grilled duck, cured ham, blackberry cobbler, white peppercorns, road tar, and even a hint of orange zest. This wine is deliciously pliant and coating on the palate, and supported by fresh acidity, a telltale sign of the 2005 vintage. It amazes me the weight that this wine has taken on over the course of its life both in barrel and bottle. Though delicious enough to enjoy now, I anticipate this wine will continue to gain weight and length over the next 2-3 years, and will drink beautifully for 10-15 years. If you must enjoy it upon release, be sure to decant for 3 to 4 hours in advance to fully experience the aromatics."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Syrah 2007","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2007 IX Estate Syrah boasts the most complex and concentrated aromatics we've ever experienced in our syrah. This wine was so exciting in the making. As soon as the grapes were put into their open top tanks, the juice became instantly black. Once the fermentation began, the wines formed tantalizing aromas that have since carried through to bottle. Thanks to the cool weather that led up to the picking, the wine is very fresh and very expressive. As I taste it before release, a beautiful perfume of floral and spice leap from the glass. Darker notes of cured meats, cracked pepper, black olive, and jerky soon follow, along with the telltale notes of the IX Estate of wild sage, bay laurel and clay mineral. The unctuous tannins coat the palate while the savory flavors bring a succulent quality to the wine through to the finish. The 2007 Syrah has the freshness and approachability to drink near term, yet the dense flavors, rich structure and natural acidity will allow the wine to evolve beautifully for 15 years or more."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Syrah 2008","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"One word came to mind as Winemaker Allison Tauziet tasted the 2008 IX Estate Syrah before its release: perfume. This vintage of Syrah boasts some of the most feminine and exotic aromas we've ever had in this wine. Effusive notes of violets, talc and jasmine tea mingle in the glass, along with a very savory note of the classic bacon fat and cured meats. A beautiful aroma of tangerine rind lingers also on the nose. On the palate, the texture is both silky and unctuous. Despite its full bodied flavor, the wine possesses great elegance. With a long decantation, the wine can be enjoyed in the next few years, but will evolve and gain complexity for at least 10 years."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Syrah 2009","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The fragrance from the 2009 IX Estate Syrah upon release is remarkably expressive. This wine possesses a beautiful orange blossom lift that makes it incredibly inviting and seductive. The more I delve into the wine, the more savory it becomes. The salty Parma ham, grilled duck breast and dark chocolate that come through on the nose are so tempting. On the palate, that savory quality continues with mouthwatering tannins. They have a fine grained quality to their structure, buttressed by lovely acidity. The orange blossom from the nose, turns to a lingering marmalade aroma on the finish. Overall, this vintage of IX Estate Syrah is full of inviting qualities, making it seem almost precocious, but the unctuous and suave texture of the tannin confirm that this is a wine built to last."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Syrah 2010","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The cooler growing season helped to bring new dimensions of flavor to our 2010 IX Estate Syrah. In addition to the wonderful orange blossom and violet perfume that our syrah frequently exudes, in 2010 we have deliciously dense flavors of charred beef and grilled duck meat. A brooding mixture of these savory meats and feminine floral fruits continues into the palate, where suave, savory tannins take over. There is a wonderful salty flavor on the palate, very reminiscent of the northern Rhone. Because of the sheer density of this wine, I anticipate it will age for 15 years or longer. Upon release it is luscious and creamy, but the structure of the tannin should guarantee the wine will support a long aging provided good provenance."},{"name":"Colgin IX Estate Syrah 2011","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"From low yielding clonal selections originating in the Cote-Rotie and Hermitage regions of fr, the IX Estate Syrah is characterized by the Old World aromatics of the Northern Rhone and a remarkably nuanced bouquet of cured meat, pepper, blackberry, coffee and acacia, graced with a black floral uplift.

A captivating perfume of red raspberry, orange blossom and crushed rocks, this gorgeously vibrant and feminine nose is also nuanced with scents of peppered meats and barbecue spice rub. Scents of the \\"IX Estate\\" garrigue, like the native sage and fresh bay laurel leaves, bring even more complexity to this powerfully concentrated wine. The iron component of the weathered volcanic soils at the \\"IX Estate\\" weaves a strong note of pure minerality into the wine in 2013, giving it a telltale sense of place. The vivid red flavors burst in the mouth along with perfectly plush tannins that are salivating and succulent.

I know how much power is at the core of the wine, and so I find it fantastically seductive the way it pulls you in to explore its depths. At first it exhibits dark undertones of smoked cayenne, musk, and ripe plums, yet as it is exposed to air in the glass it slowly unfolds and expresses compelling organic aromas of peat, nutmeg, and savory grilled steak juices. The wine is incredibly soft and silky on the front of the palate, and gains an amazing amount of weight as it glides to the back. The texture is delicious and draws you back so easily with its elegant, lingering finish. Given the nature of the wines self expression at this time, I recommend 3 years of cellar age, and with that you will be handsomely rewarded. With the freshness of the acidity and the coating texture to the tannin, I anticipate a long lived bottle age of 20 or more year."},{"name":"Colgin Tychson Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2006","region":"St. Helena, Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2006 vintage Tychson Hill Vineyard Cabernet is a wonderfully aromatic wine. The wine is laced with a beautiful gravelly note, as well as an element of graphite. Feminine aromas of honeysuckle, perfume and talc leap from the glass, followed by darker notes of charcoal smoke, wet stone and barbecue spices. On the palate, the wine has a deliciously round and plush entry. There is great finesse to the tannin, which is quite silky."},{"name":"Colgin Tychson Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2007","region":"St. Helena, Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Colgin's 2007s, which include their final vintage of Cabernet Sauvignon from the Herb Lamb Vineyard, are all extraordinary, world-class wines. The change in winemakers from Mark Aubert to Allison Tauziet has gone very smoothly, and was made easier by the retention of the highly respected French wine consultant, Dr. Alain Raynaud, who told me that tasting Colgin's 2007s gave him his greatest emotional high since he tasted the Chateau Pavie 2000! The 2008s will not be available until 2011, but it appears to be a very successful vintage for Colgin. The crop was tiny, and there were no frost issues, but several heat spikes did occur. Both Allison Tauziet and Alain Raynaud thought that the small berries provided powerful fruit intensity."},{"name":"Colgin Tychson Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2008","region":"St. Helena, Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2008 IX Estate Red Wine is all about the aromas of the terroir. The 2008 vintage across the board has resulted in wines that first and foremost reflect their sense of place. The nose of the IX Estate is pure crushed rocks, clay and minerals at first, and with air the savory aromas of musk and bay leaf come through. Decadent notes of black licorice, black cherry and cassis bring succulence to the nose. The wine is silky soft up front on the palate, but then develops into deliciously layered tannins. The structure of the wine suggests that it will be long lived."},{"name":"Colgin Tychson Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2009","region":"St. Helena, Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2009 IX Estate Red Wine is incredibly inviting on the nose! A great marriage of aromas of the soil and the dark fruit flavors I associate with this vintage. My first observation is the dark black licorice aroma coming from the Cabernet Franc, but the more I examine the wine, the more number 9 estate notes come through. Gravel, soapstone, talc and especially graphite round out the nose, giving it its sense of place. The purity of aroma is striking and very tempting. I find a meaty side to the wine, of grilled steak and even savory jerky. More memorable than the nose, is the texture of the wine on the palate. Upon first sip, the tannins are both silky and full bodied. The fresh acidity brings a juicy quality to the wine. With tannins that are both round and plump, this wine is just delicious. The lingering structure from the tannin proves the pedigree of the wine."},{"name":"Colgin Tychson Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2010","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Winemaker Allison Tauziet says, \\"What I love about the IX Estate Red Wine from 2010 is the purity of flavors that come through from this special site. The clay iron, mineral notes mesh with the complexity of the crushed rock making the wine very distinctive. Add to that the cooling aromatics of the vintage, like fresh herb notes of rosemary and chocolate mint, and the wine becomes very vivid. With ten years of vine age here on the property, the flavors and texture to this wine are becoming more and more classic and true to what I consider an \\"old vine\\" nose. The layers of flavor continue with earthy notes of wet soil and graphite. Because of the superb balance and ripeness from 2010, the tannins coat the palate seamlessly. They are broad, suave and creamy. They also reflect the great structure which comes so easily in cooler styled vintages. Because of the freshness and harmony of the flavors and structure, I believe the 2010 IX Estate Red will age for nearly 30 years. I would suggest cellaring this wine for a minimum of 5-7 years before enjoying it, since it will likely age at a wonderfully slow pace.\\""},{"name":"Colgin Tychson Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2011","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The wine produced from \\"Tychson Hill\\" in 2011 perfectly exemplifies the hallmark of the vintage- vivid aromatics.

Subtle hints of Thai spices, vanillin and wet stones bring complexity and distinction to the nose. The texture is classic for \\"Tychson Hill,\\" with silky, suave tannins that elegantly coat the palate. The wines inner density and freshness linger into a deliciously long finish.

Even more, the silky and supple tannins coat the palate. This wine is like liquid terroir. From the first sip to the last, the wine evolves to levels we never even knew existed in barrel.

This cool climate vineyard allows near perfect conditions year after year to produce world class Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc and Merlot. Controlling all farming aspects within their own vineyard gives Cuvaison an advantage in producing the best quality fruit therefore minimizing over manipulation at the winery. Winemaker Steven Rogstad sums it up best, \\"My style and philosophy are based on expressing the unique character of our estate grapes and doing as little as possible to them.

Aged in both barrel (30% new) and foudre, it represents approximately one-fourth of the vintage's production, or roughly 2,000 cases. Yields averaged 17-25 hectoliters per hectare. The 2003 is an atypically powerful, concentrated effort that tips the scales at 15.7% alcohol. It boasts a dense purple color as well as copious quantities of black raspberries, cherries, cassis, licorice, smoke, scorched earth, and hints of Provencal herbs as well as subtle wood. This broad, substantial, powerful effort possesses fabulous concentration and awesome potential. It will not be one of the 2003 Chateauneuf du Papes to drink in its youth. Even though it has low acidity, there is tremendous tannin as well as extract.

This project would not be possible without the wealth of vineyards and range of altitudes the coop has planted. Contrary to popular opinion that Valencia is too warm for Tempranillo, the cooperative has planted the varietal at a range of altitudes from 300 to nearly 900 meters above sea level, at these high altitudes, the Tempranillo ripens slowly developing a tremendous aromatic potential. The lower altitude vines take advantage of cooling sea breezes and the higher altitude vines cooler night to maintain and develop those aromatic qualities.

Pressing was done as whole clusters, utilizing a membrane press to gently dejuice the grapes without breakage of skins, seeds, or stems.   The juice was settled for 24 hours and racked to barrel for 100% barrel fermentation.  Fermentation was conducted at approximately 55 F to promote a long, slow development of the fruit.  Three distinctive yeasts, two isolates from Burgundian cellars and another from Champagne, were used to add complexity.   Upon completion of primary fermentation, the barrels were stirred weekly to promote the breakdown of the yeasts adding additional layers of complexity as well as enhancing the creamy texture of the wine. Malolactic fermentation started at the completion of primary fermentation and continued through February. The wine was aged surlies for 16 months in barrel. This extra time allowed the slowly developing fruit to emerge and further enhance the richness and structure.

Sensible harvest timing along with judicious stem inclusion (25% on average) and less new oak assist in striking that balance of increasing supple qualities to support a vineyard that wants to produce broader textures with evoking the dark cherry fruit qualities the vineyard produces at its best. 2014 did this exceptionally well."},{"name":"Dierberg Santa Maria Valley Pinot Noir 2015","region":"Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The mouth feel suggests great complexity, tension, length, and has that initial breadth people have grown accustomed to from Dierberg Vineyard.

The growing season was like 2005 that gave us very ripe tannins and round and supple acidities. The flowering was perfect, which made for a large crop with uniform ripeness levels. And because the growing season didn't have much rot pressure, the fruit was super clean and our sorting losses were less than 5%. We began picking on the 8th of September and started with the whites before moving on to the reds. The fruit averaged 13% in terms of potential alcohol and there wasn't even one wine that I decided to chaptalize, which is extremely rare. The vinification was easy even though I did a relatively long cuvaison of 25 to 28 days at a maximum temperature of 30 C. As I did in 2008, I used varying percentages of whole clusters, which I think added elegance. The malos were irregular with some beginning early and finishing late and some started late but finished quickly. The post-malo pHs were in the 3.65 range, which is perfectly acceptable to us. Overall, we are extremely happy with the potential quality of our '09s and believe that our clients are going to love them.\\" As I have observed previously, Vincent is making real progress and these '09s are easily the best wines I have yet seen from him, which is a real compliment as the '08s were excellent. Moreover, several of the villages level wines offer truly outstanding quality and should be on your radar screens for obtaining great value."},{"name":"Domaine de la Vougeraie Vougeot Le Clos Blanc de Vougeot Monopole Premier Cru 2011","region":"Vougeot, Cote de Nuits, Cote d'Or, Burgundy, fr","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The Clos Blanc, a mythical, mystical vineyard, is adjacent to the Chateau du Clos de Vougeot.

Traditionally, Marcoux's white is an unusual blend (in the sense that it was heavily Roussanne dominant) of 60% Roussanne and 40% Bourboulenc hailing from two parcels. The Roussanne's 0.5-hectares of vines in Les Esqueirons where the cool limestone-based soils are perfect for white grapes (bringing freshness, texture and finesse) and the Bourboulenc, a 0.35-hectare plot in Les Bosquets (this variety bringing more citric freshness and drive). From 2015, due to demand for this cuve, Sophie Armenier has been vinifying and blending in Marcoux's white varieties that grow on their 'red' vineyards--Grenache Blanc and Clairette. Pre-2015 these grapes were co-fermented with the estate Chateauneuf-du-Pape rouge. Hence, the new blend looks something like this: Roussanne (55%; bringing the power), Bourboulenc (35%; freshness) and Grenache Blanc/Clairette (10%; flesh and finesse). The grapes are whole-berry pressed, naturally fermented and raised entirely in steel vat on fine lees. There is no batonnage and the malo is blocked to further underline the wine's structure and freshness. It's the kind of racy, juicy white that we wished the appellation made more of (and that we had more of!)."},{"name":"Domaine de Marcoux Chateauneuf-du-Pape 1999","region":"Chateauneuf-du-Pape, Rhone, fr","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The Chateauneuf-du-Pape Rouge, the bulk of the production at Domaine de Marcoux, is sourced from 13 sites spread over a wide range of terroirs.

The wine is already delicious, but one could quite comfortably put aside a couple bottles for three or four years."},{"name":"Domaine Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay Arthur 2005","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The 2005 Arthur has everything I loved about the 2004, but"},{"name":"Domaine Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay Arthur 2006","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"2006 provided an abundance of wonderfully ripe & healthy fruit displayed by the complexity in the Arthur. The nose first reveals aromas of carnation & magnolia followed by a hint of toast & lemon zest. After some time, the bouquet transitions to lemon verbena, cantaloupe & lychee. Wonderfully balanced, the Arthur is round & full on the palate leading into a clean, fresh, lingering finish. This incredible length suggests pairings of shellfish & ripe cheeses, or cellaring for 3-5 years."},{"name":"Domaine Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay Arthur 2007","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"I am very proud of our Chardonnay vines, which surprise and delight me each vintage. ?The 2007 Arthur has all of the delicate, floral aromatics we see from our estate C the carnation and magnolia scents, with touches of lemon peel and other citrus fruits C but there is an extra texture and dimension to the 2007 that takes the wine to a new level. ?Crisp on the palate, with a long finish, this wine is lovely now, and will develop nicely for at least the next 3-5 years."},{"name":"Domaine Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay Arthur 2008","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"As for the 2008 Chardonnay Arthur, all I can say is that it reminds me of 2005 because there isn't enough of it! The wine itself is beautiful, with a range of white flowers on the nose, a round mouthfeel, and clear lift from the acidity. Balance is always my main winemaking goal, and the 2008 Arthur clearly has it. I expect it will age nicely for 3-5 years at least."},{"name":"Domaine Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay Arthur 2009","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The 2009 Arthur has surprised me in so many ways. I expected it to be more like 2006 because of the similar heat accumulation through the year. But it seems that 2009 takes the best of 2006 (ripe, lush, round fruit) and the best of 2008 (bright acidity and sharp structure), and combines them in a most enjoyable way. The gently honeyed texture and trademark range of white flower aromatics is delicious."},{"name":"Domaine Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay Arthur 2010","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Ripe, healthy fruit was hand-picked into small totes, and then whole-cluster pressed. Half of the juice was fermented in French Oak barrels (20% new) to create a round, rich texture. The other half was fermented and aged in stainless steel to maintain the purest and most elegant expression of Chardonnay."},{"name":"Domaine Drouhin Oregon Chardonnay Arthur 2012","region":"Willamette Valley, Oregon","variety":"White Wine","notes":"2012 is an exceptional vintage given the overall quality of the fruit. The grapes came in bursting with flavor and that has given the wines a nice round texture and excellent flavors of fresh forward fruit. I can feel a little more body than either 2011 or 2010, but with no loss of floral aromatics or lightness on the palate. The finish is long. The 2012 Arthur is immediately enjoyable, though one could age it easily for 3-5 years."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:x}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function V(h,a,n,c,f,t){const y=g("PoemCard");return i(),r(d,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Wine Reviews🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(i(!0),r(d,null,p(t.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),b(y,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),t.hasMorePoems?(i(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...s)=>t.loadMore&&t.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=u(M,[["render",V]]),A=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"winemag/3.md","filePath":"winemag/3.md"}'),D={name:"winemag/3.md"},F=Object.assign(D,{setup(h){return(a,n)=>(i(),r("div",null,[w(P)]))}});export{A as __pageData,F as default};
