Tastes more like something you'd have for dessert.","designation":"Aurora Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"Despite the light color and delicate silky mouthfeel, this mountain Pinot Noir is potent in fruit.

The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits. The 30% new oak is not only lavish for a $20 wine, but it judiciously complements all of the good fruit.","designation":"Sundance"},{"country":"us","description":"Very light in color. Opens with blueberry, rhubarb, bacon and cedar aromas. From front to back it sits on a light frame, and on the palate it dances. Shows some buttered-toast and wood on the finely etched finish.

Stash until 2015.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"A dense, bombshell of a blend, this is comprised of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache. This tannic beast is somewhat reduced and chewy, committed entirely to meat, tobacco and leathery flavor.","designation":"Proprietor's Blend"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is Burgundian opulence, with generous, rounded black-fruit and -berry flavors.

The concentration of fruit and herb flavors is excellent, which makes it a fine steak wine and also a bottle to stow away for a few more years.","designation":"Conner Lee Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"The name refers to the rocks in this section of the estate vineyard, and they can be felt as well as tasted in the wine. The mouthfeel is slightly astringent, with hints of metal and stone, and the alcohol is muted, allowing the more subtle suggestions of citrus and beet and truffle and wild strawberry to emerge. All in all it's the most complex and intriguing of the winery's offerings, and merits your full attention.","designation":"Rocheux"},{"country":"us","description":"Very rich and classically structured, a wine that shows real Merlot personality. The red cherry, cola, red licorice, sandalwood and peppery spice flavors are almost Pinot Noir-like, except for the tannins, which have the weight of Bordeaux. Should develop through 2012.","designation":"Michael Black Vineyard"},{"country":"cl","description":"Aromas of earthy cherry and plum are herbal in that patented Chilean way. Raw, fresh and with a mouthfeel pushed by acidity, this tastes of salty roasted plum and gamy meat. Tangy acidity and hard residual tannins make this more ‚Äúcountry‚Äù than refined as a whole.","designation":"Tributo Single Vineyard"},{"country":"es","description":"A rusty color and stewy aromas of murky berry fruits and cardamom set this off on its own course. Choppy and chunky in feel, this Garnacha tastes stewed, savory and baked, with almost no fruit to speak of. On the finish, this seems roasted.","designation":"Gran Gregoriano"},{"country":"it","description":"There's a nutty, smoky quality to this Cartizze Prosecco that adds depth and dimension beyond the wine's more characteristic floral and fresh fruit notes. This is a well-balanced wine thanks to a playful harmony between delicate sweetness and spicy crispness on the finish.","designation":"Cartizze"},{"country":"us","description":"Earthy, like some Napa Chards, with a sage and thyme edge to the pear and peach fruit.

This single-vineyard offering is worth aging for 2‚Äì3 years.","designation":"Tinto"},{"country":"us","description":"White seems to be the new black when it comes to Oregon Pinot Noir, as more and more winemakers give it a spin. This is one of the better ones, at a very modest price, mixing sweet grass and fresh pear and stone fruits. It would be difficult to identify it as Pinot Noir in a blind tasting of mixed whites, but that's not the point, is it?","designation":"White Pinot Noir"},{"country":"ar","description":"Compact aromas of red berries get a boost from oak-based coconut, cedar and graphite notes.

It has subtle flavors of raspberries, strawberries, limes and brioche pastry, with a complex finish. Quite good.","designation":"Brut Champagne"},{"country":"pt","description":"Great depth of flavor with fruit and a layer of mature almond nuttiness. The wine shows some wood, but also dried figs, prunes and some mature acidity. Not quite dry, but edging in that direction.","designation":"White Reserva"},{"country":"fr","description":"There is something pleasantly bitter on the nose: Burnt sugar or bitter almond. The palate answers this with fluid, rippling sweetness expressed in ripe, juicy, refreshing pear fruit. The bitter notes remain and create an appetizing, tangy edge to this concentrated wine that is streamlined by balancing freshness despite the residual sugar.

It's also the fruitiest and most in need of time in the cellar. Right now, it's a candied blast of blackberries and cherries.

The score reflects its potential.","designation":"Tomahawk Vineyard"},{"country":"es","description":"Grassy raspberry and cherry aromas are a bit leathery.

Merval? Turns out it's the common name for the Argentine stock exchange (not a blend of Merlot and Valium).

The finish is reserved, maybe even a bit austere, with dry, semisweet chocolate notes on the tart plum fruit.","designation":"Reserva"},{"country":"us","description":"It's rare to find this variety in Pinot-heavy Russian River Valley, but this producer treats it with respect, crafting a minuscule amount of worthy flavor, the 100% Petite Sirah awash in velvety tannins that tease in coconut and vanilla. Soft oak is supported by smoky leather, chocolate and blackberry, a dustiness completing the picture.","designation":"Landy Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"Almost the color of water in the glass, this offers notes of lemonade, freshly-cut kiwi, honeydew, white peach, Japanese pear and white peach on the fruit-forward nose.

The winery suggests that it is their most ageworthy Pinot Noir, and the structure of this young wine would support that assertion. It's tight, hard, compact with black fruits, smoke and chewy tannins. It's a wine that needs time to stretch its considerable muscles. The roughly 50/50 mix of new and once-used barrels adds baking chocolate, licorice and charred toast to the finish; well-integrated and buttressed with crisp acids.

The robust palate delivers juicy black cherry layered with notes of spice, vanilla, tobacco and anisette alongside firm tannins that need time to unfold.","designation":"Froi"},{"country":"cl","description":"Cranberry and other red-fruit aromas are sort of raw, and the oak treatment on this wine is domineering and resiny.
