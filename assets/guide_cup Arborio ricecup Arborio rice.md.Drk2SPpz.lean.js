In a separate bowl spread out the rice coating. Take onion rings and coat with buttermilk, and then cover with coating, shaking off excess. Place coated rings on a tray. In a large deep saucepan, heat peanut oil to 375 degrees F. With a slotted wire spoon, carefully lower the coated rings into pan to fry. Do the rings in small batches to allow oil to remain a consistent temperature. Place fried rings on a paper towel on a tray to dry. Tomato Stack: Cut a small slice from the bottom of the tomatoes - enough so that they will stand. Slice the tomatoes into 1/2-inch thick slices (about 2 or 3), leaving the stem on top. Season the slices with salt and pepper to taste, drizzle with olive oil. Place the basil leaves in between the tomato slices, and re-stack tomato. Serve re-stacked tomatoes around a larger stack of onion rings in center of a large serving plate. Drizzle more olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Grate the frozen blue cheese over top. Grind the rice in a blender until very fine. Put it in a bowl and add the all-purpose flour, semolina, salt and pepper. Toss until well blended.

Add a pinch salt and mound the flour mixture in a large bowl or on a clean work surface. Hollow out the center, making a well in the middle of the flour with steep sides. Break the eggs into the well. Add the chocolate syrup and vanilla. Gently mix together with a fork. Gradually start incorporating the flour by pulling in the flour from the sides of the well. As you incorporate more of the flour, the dough will start to take shape. Once it gets thick, you can use a spatula to incorporate the rest of the flour. If the dough is too dry, add a little water. If the dough is too wet or sticky, add a little flour. Once the dough comes together, knead the dough on a clean work surface until it becomes smooth, about 8 minutes. Shape into a disc, cover with plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge, 20 to 30 minutes. Divide your rested dough into quarters and work with one piece at a time, covering your other pieces to keep them moist. Flour each piece lightly, shape it into a rectangular shape and put it through a pasta sheeter attachment, starting at the widest setting. Run the dough once through the largest setting, fold it into thirds and run it through one more time. Then run the pasta through the sheeting attachment once on every number, stopping at 5 or 6, depending on how thick you would like it. Lightly flour the rolled out pasta sheet and fold in half. Take your chef knife and cut ribbons about a 1/2-inch thick, then unravel the pasta ribbons and place on a floured baking sheet to keep from sticking. For the sauce: Bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and stir in the chocolate-hazelnut spread. Add a pinch salt and continue whisking until the sauce is creamy. Remove from the heat and reserve. Cook the chocolate pasta in a large pot of boiling water, 3 minutes. Immediately remove the pasta from the water and toss gently with the sauce and a little of the pasta cooking water to help with the consistency. Mound the pasta and sauce on dessert plates and garnish with the fresh berries, a dollop of creme fraiche, white chocolate shavings and skinless toasted chopped hazelnuts, to garnish. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 53083,&quot;Spiced Mixed Grill with Grilled Lime 1 tablespoon curry powder 1 teaspoon cumin seed 1 teaspoon fennel seed 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns 1 teaspoon cayenne 1 tablespoon sea salt 8 small whole calamari tubes, cleaned, tentacles removed 4 lobster tails, cracked in 1/2 8 prawns, heads and shells on, cut down the back Extra-virgin olive oil 2 bunches green onions 4 limes, halved Instructions: Put the curry, cumin, fennel, peppercorns, cayenne, and salt in a spice mill or clean coffee grinder. Grind to a fine powder and set aside. Rinse the calamari tubes under cool water and pat dry. Split the bodies from top to bottom so you have 2 triangular pieces from each. Put the calamari, lobster, and prawns on a platter and drizzle with a nice dose of olive oil so the seafood is well coated; season with a fair amount of salt and pepper. Place a large grill pan on 2 burners over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill and get it very hot. Take a few paper towels and fold them several times to make a thick square. Blot a small amount of oil on the paper towel then carefully and quickly wipe the ridges of the grill pan or the hot grates of the grill. Place the lobster on the grill, shell-side up, and cook for 5 minutes until the shell begins to turn reddish-orange. Turn the lobster tails over and lay the calamari, prawns, green onions, and limes (cut side-down) on the grill too until everything is slightly charred. Grill the calamari for 2 minutes per side, and no longer, otherwise they will get rubbery. Put the grilled mixed seafood and green onions on a large platter and sprinkle a little of the spice mix all over. Squeeze the grilled limes over the shellfish and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 53084,&quot;Pan Roasted Cowboy Ribeye with Creamed Swiss Chard 2 large (16 to 18-ounce) bone-in rib-eye steaks 1 sprigs fresh rosemary 4 sprigs fresh thyme Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon butter 2 to 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed 2 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves removed About 1 cup panko bread crumbs Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 large bunch Swiss chard, leafs removed from the stem and leaves chopped 2 cups heavy cream 2 fresh bay leaves 2 sprigs fresh rosemary 4 sprigs fresh thyme 2 to 3 cloves garlic, peeled Freshly grated Parmesan, to taste Salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1 lemon, juiced Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. (Water is not recommended for soaking the beans as it adds nothing to the flavor and does not soften the beans quite as well as stock does.) Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil to a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Then add the celery and bell peppers, and cook until softened, slightly brown and giving off a pleasant aroma, about 3 minutes. Then add the seasoning meats and chopped garlic, and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Divide in half and reserve. Remove the beans from the refrigerator (they will have expanded nicely and their skins should be bursting by now). Add the beans and soaking liquid to a large stockpot, and add additional stock to cover the beans by several inches. Set the stockpot on the stove, bring it to a slight boil and reduce to a heavy simmer. Stirring vigorously, add the liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, granulated garlic, granulated onion, black pepper, brown sugar if using, bay leaves and half of the seasoning meat mixture. Simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. (To get \\New Orleans cream-style\\ beans, which are preferable, you can continue to simmer until the beans break down, about 1 hour more.) Season with salt, remove from the heat and let cool in the stockpot to room temperature. Refrigerate overnight. (The beans can be eaten after seasoning with salt, but refrigerating them overnight improves the flavor of the dish.) Remove the stockpot from the refrigerator and gently reheat on the stove, stirring in 1/2 cup stock to loosen up the coagulated bean mixture. When the beans reach a boil, reduce to a heavy simmer, stirring frequently as to not let the beans at the bottom of the pot burn. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Add the andouille sausage and cook until brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a small stockpot. Add the rice, bring it back to a boil and cook for 3 minutes. Cover the stockpot, remove from the heat and let steam for 15 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer the rice to a small baking sheet to cool slightly. Reheat the remaining seasoning meat mixture. Divide the seasoning meat mixture, beans and andouille sausage among bowls, top with a scoop of rice, and sprinkle with the green onions and parsley. Serve with hot sauce and mustard. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel]&quot; 53091,&quot;Chinese Five-Spice Chicken with Red Cabbage and Potato Gratin 2 to 3 Idaho potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/16-inch thick on a mandoline 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Gruyere, plus 4 tablespoons for topping, divided 2 teaspoons dried thyme or 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 strips bacon, chopped 1 cup chopped Spanish onion, about 1 large onion 2 cups chopped red cabbage, about 1/2 head 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 1/2 cup red wine 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 2 (6-ounce) chicken breasts, boneless and skinless 2 tablespoons butter, unsalted Instructions: Gratin:<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Toss the first 6 ingredients together in a bowl, making sure the potato slices are evenly covered with the mixture. Spray 2 ramekins with cooking spray and gently press a handful of the potatoes into each one. Arrange the ramekins on a sheet pan and fill each cup 3/4 of the way with the cream mixture and cover the top with foil. Slide the pan into the oven and cook until the potatoes are cooked through, about 30 to 45 minutes.* Remove the foil, add 2 tablespoons of the remaining cheese to each ramekin and cook until cheese is bubbling, about 4 to 8 minutes. Remove the gratins from oven and set aside.<br> Cabbage: In a medium skillet, over medium heat, add the bacon and cook until crispy, about 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the bacon to a plate, leaving 3 to 4 tablespoons of the fat in the skillet. Add the onions and saute for 5 to 7 minutes over medium-high heat. Stir in the cabbage, sugar, salt and black pepper and continue cooking for an additional 6 to 8 minutes. Add the red wine, toss the ingredients and cook covered with a lid until the liquid has almost completely evaporated, about 8 to 12 minutes. Stir in the balsamic vinegar and cook until it has almost evaporated as well, about 1 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the reserved bacon.<br> Chicken: Combine the first 5 ingredients in a medium bowl. Add the chicken breasts, toss to coat with the marinade and allow them to sit for 10 to15 minutes. In a saute pan over medium heat, add the chicken breasts and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on the show side and 6 minutes the other side, or until cooked through. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and top each breast with 1 tablespoon of butter. Cover with foil, allow them to rest for 5 minutes, then slice lengthwise.<br> To serve: Put a portion of the cabbage in the center of each dish. Arrange the chicken, on top of the cabbage. Run a knife along the inside of each ramekin, to loosen, and invert them onto the plates before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 53092,&quot;Festive Strudel 12 sheets filo pastry (if frozen, thaw), approximately 9 ounces/ 250 g 4 1/2 ounces/ 125 g butter, melted 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3 1/2 ounces/ 100 g Demerara sugar (natural brown sugar or turbinado) 4 ginger nuts 14 ounces/ 400 g leftover Christmas pudding 3 apples or pears, or 2 quince, or a mixture of the three 50 g good-quality chocolate (70-percent cocoa solids), roughly chopped Icing sugar (confectioners&#39; sugar), for dusting Ready-made custard, to serve Instructions: Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C/ 350 degrees F/ Gas 4. Lay out 6 sheets of filo pastry on a clean tea towel, overlapping each by an inch or so, so they cover the tea towel. Cook&#39;s Note: The filo should cover the tea towel completely, with just a little overhang at one of the shorter ends. Work quickly so your pastry doesn&#39;t dry out and brush some melted butter all over it. Sprinkle over the cinnamon and 2 ounces/ 50 g of the sugar, then crumble over your ginger nuts to add a nice bit of crunch. Carefully layer the rest of the pastry sheets on top and brush again with butter. Use your hands to crumble the Christmas pudding into a bowl then grate in the fruit, cores and all. You want to have about the same amount of grated fruit as you&#39;ve got pudding. Add about 2 tablespoons of sugar, and mix it all together to break up the pudding a bit more. Sprinkle this all over the pastry so it&#39;s roughly covered, leaving the overhang clear. Place the chocolate in a row on top of the Christmas pudding, down the short side nearest the overhang. Fold the overhang over the chocolate and pinch it up, then lift up your tea towel, and use it to help you carefully roll up your strudel. Tuck the ends under to seal it and transfer to a large nonstick pan. Brush it all over with butter then sprinkle over a little more sugar. Bake in the hot oven for about 40 minutes until crisp, golden and gorgeous looking. It might split a bit and look slightly rustic, but I think that&#39;s quite nice. Cook&#39;s Note: You could wrap an extra layer of filo round it before cooking if you want it to look a bit neater. Once the strudel is cooked, leave to cool, then use a serrated knife to cut the strudel into 2-inch/ 5 cm slices. Dust these with icing sugar and serve with ready-made custard from the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 53093,&quot;Rustic Pesto Pizza 2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped Kosher salt 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 2 tablespoons Parmesan 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper 7 ounces prepared pizza dough All-purpose flour, for rolling Cornmeal, for dusting 1/4 small red onion, thinly sliced 1 red ripe tomato, thinly sliced 1/4 cup kalamata olives, pitted and chopped 4 slices fresh mozzarella Instructions: Make the pesto: place the toasted pine nuts in a bowl (or mortar) and crush with a wooden spoon (or pestle) to make a chunky paste. Add in the garlic and a pinch of salt and combine. Mix in the basil and Parmesan. Stir in the olive oil and season with pepper. Put a pizza stone onto the floor of the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put the dough onto a floured surface and knead and stretch the dough to about an 8-inch diameter. Dust a wooden pizza paddle with cornmeal and carefully transfer the dough. Spread the pesto over the dough, leaving 1-inch around the edge to form a crust. Top with the onion and tomato slices and season with salt and pepper. Scatter the olives all over the pizza and top with the fresh mozzarella. Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden, about 8 to 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 53094,&quot;Salted Caramel Banana Macarons 1 1/4 cup almond meal 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar 3 large older egg whites 3 tablespoons meringue powder Food coloring, if desired Fleur de sel, for sprinkling 1/2 cup granulated sugar 3/4 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature 3 teaspoons heavy cream 3/4 teaspoon fleur de sel 1 ripe banan Deep purple macaroons filled with store-bought black currant preserves Deep pink macaroons filled with store-bought or homemade raspberry preserves Brown macaroons filled with store-bought peanut butter and jelly Yellow macaroons filled with store-bought lemon curd Green macaroons filled with store-bought cream cheese frosting mixed with ground pistachios Instructions: Cook&#39;s Notes: You don&#39;t need to go out and purchase older egg whites, you can simply used the eggs that you&#39;ve had in the refrigerator for the last 4 or 5 days. After you separate the eggs, make sure you allow the egg whites to come to room temperature before whipping. Room temperature egg whites whip better and faster if at room temperature. For the meringue cookies: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Prep 2 half sheet pans with parchment or silicone baking mats. Sift together your almond meal and powdered sugar and set aside. In the bowl of a standing mixer, or with an electric hand mixer, beat the egg whites on low speed until foamy. Begin sprinkling in the meringue powder as you beat. Then increase the speed to medium and beat until soft peaks form. If adding food coloring at the point, you can divide the meringue, add to a separate bowl and dye as desired (see Cook&#39;s Note, below). Beat to combine. When you get to soft peaks (the peaks will curl when the whisk is lifted from the mixture), carefully proceed; you want firm glossy peaks in your meringue, you do not want to beat all the way to stiff peaks (peaks stand up straight when a whisk is lifted from the mixture). Add a third of the almond mixture, folding it in gently. Once combined, add the remaining almond flour in 2 batches. Be very, very gentle! Make sure to fully incorporate all your ingredients, but do not over-fold. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a plain 1/2-inch tip. (You can also use a ziptop bag with a corner cut off.) It&#39;s way easier to fill your bag if you stand it up in a tall glass and fold the top down before spooning in the batter. Pipe 1-inch mounds of batter onto the prepared sheet pans. Using a wet fingertip, tap the mounds to a smooth tip. Alternately, pick up the pan with both hands, and holding it level, tap it firmly onto the counter several times. Allow any residual water to dry out. Sprinkle each cookie with fleur de sel. Allow the cookies to rest 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the humidity. Bake the cookies for about 15 minutes, 1 sheet at a time. Let the cookies cool. For the filling: In a heavy bottomed saucepan set over medium-high heat, combine the sugar and 2 tablespoons water. Slowly let the sugar melt and turn into caramel (do not stir). Carefully add the butter and heavy cream and stand back as it will release a lot of steam. Stir until everything is fully incorporated. Add the fleur de sel. In a small bowl, mash the ripe banana with a fork. Once the caramel has cooled, add it to the mashed banana. Spread the mixture on the cookies, making sandwiches. Place in the refrigerator and allow to mature for at least 24 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 53095,&quot;Hot Cocoa Bar 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup cocoa powder 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 6 cups milk 1/2 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped 2 cups milk chocolate morsels (about 12 ounces) Instructions: Cocoa Bar Suggestions: Cinnamon sticks, candied orange zest, caramel, whipped cream, almond milk, marshmallows, mint chocolate bars, shaved chocolate, Nutella, peppermints, crystallized ginger and chipotle pepper powder Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan (one with a spout if you have one). Make sure to mix it really well. Whisk the milk in slowly, you don&#39;t want any lumps. Add the vanilla seeds and pod. Place over medium heat and bring to a slight simmer. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and stir in the milk chocolate morsels until melted. Keep warm until serving. Cocoa Bar Setup: Arrange or display all the various flavorings your guests will enjoy. If you know your guests will want to try multiple combinations, have espresso cups available, so the hot cocoa will last longer and guest won&#39;t feel so bad trying multiple cups. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 53096,&quot;Fresh Berries &amp; Sweet Ricotta Homemade Ricotta (recipe follows) 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons liquid honey 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and halved or sliced, depending on size (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 (6-ounce) packages fresh raspberries 2 (6-ounce) packages fresh blueberries Fresh Raspberry Sauce (recipe follows) Grated lemon zest, for serving 4 cups whole milk 2 cups heavy cream 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3 tablespoons good white wine vinegar 1 (6-ounce) package fresh raspberries 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup (12 ounces) seedless raspberry jam, such as Tiptree (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 tablespoon framboise liqueur Instructions: Place the Homemade Ricotta in a medium bowl and stir in the sugar, honey, and vanilla. Set aside at room temperature for up to 2 hours. In another bowl, combine the strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. When ready to serve, divide the berries among 6 bowls. With an ice cream scoop, place a large dollop of the ricotta in each bowl and drizzle with lots of the Fresh Raspberry Sauce. Sprinkle with the lemon zest and serve. Set a fine-mesh sieve over a deep bowl. Dampen 2 pieces of cheesecloth with water and line the sieve with a double layer of the cheesecloth. Pour the milk and cream into a medium stainless-steel or enameled pot, such as Le Creuset, and stir in the salt. Bring to a full rolling boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Turn off the heat and pour in the vinegar. Allow the mixture to stand for one minute, until it curdles. It will separate into thick parts (the curds) and milky parts (the whey). Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth-lined sieve and allow it to drain into the bowl at room temperature for 20 minutes (for soft ricotta) to 25 minutes (for firmer ricotta), occasionally discarding the liquid that collects in the bowl. Transfer the ricotta to a bowl, discarding the cheesecloth and any remaining liquid. Use immediately or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The ricotta will keep, refrigerated, for 4 to 5 days. Place the raspberries, sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 4 minutes. Pour the cooked raspberries, the jam, and the framboise into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and process until smooth. Pour into a container and chill. The sauce can be refrigerated for up to one week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 53097,&quot;Basic Pizza Dough 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110 degrees F) 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for rolling dough 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 1 scant tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus some additional for coating the bowl/greasing the trays Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the yeast and warm water. Stir to dissolve the yeast and allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes. Using a sieve or strainer, \\sift\\ about half of the flour over the yeast mixture and blend until smooth with your hands. Add the salt, pepper and honey and mix to blend. Sift in the remaining flour and mix to blend. Lightly flour a cutting board or flat surface. Turn the pizza dough onto the floured area and knead for 3 to 5 minutes. The flour should feel smooth and the ingredients fully integrated. Place the dough inside a lightly oiled large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in a warm place, about 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in volume. Press gently on the dough and turn it onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts, rolling each quarter into a loose ball. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow the dough to rest for an additional 15 minutes. Flatten each ball, 1at a time, and roll into a 6-inch round. Place each round in a single layer on a lightly greased baking sheet. Tip for topping the pizza: Brushing the dough with olive oil can create a barrier that will help to prevent the topping from making the crust soggy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 53098,&quot;L.O.V.E.

Beat 1 cup heavy cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use. Clean and dry the beaters. Put the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. Heat the remaining 1 cup heavy cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until hot but not boiling, then pour over the chocolate and stir until melted. Set aside. Bring 1 1/2 inches of water to a boil in a wide pot; reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Whisk the egg yolks, 1/2 cup orange liqueur and 1 tablespoon granulated sugar in a medium metal bowl. Set the bowl over the pot of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water). Continue whisking, frequently scraping down the sides of the bowl with the whisk, until the mixture is thick, has almost doubled in volume and leaves a trail when you lift the whisk, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot. (If the yolk mixture thickens too quickly or starts to scramble, remove the bowl from the pot and let cool slightly, whisking, then return to the pot.) Put the egg whites and the remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar in a large metal bowl and set it over the simmering water. Beat on medium speed with a hand mixer until fluffy and shiny, about 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot and continue beating until stiff peaks form, about 4 more minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold the egg yolk mixture into the melted chocolate mixture until combined, then fold in the beaten egg whites until combined with some white streaks. (Do not overmix.) Gently fold in the whipped cream until no streaks remain. Fold in the remaining 1 tablespoon orange liqueur. Scrape the mixture into the plastic wrap?lined bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze at least 6 hours and up to 2 days. Make the chocolate shell: Combine the chocolate and coconut oil in a medium microwave-safe bowl; microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Remove the mousse from the freezer and uncover. Invert onto a platter and gently remove the plastic wrap. Pour the chocolate shell over the mousse and spread with the back of a spoon or a pastry brush to make a thin layer. Return to the freezer until the chocolate hardens, at least 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, put the mint leaves, pistachios and garlic in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. While still pulsing, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Remove the lid and use your hands to break up the wedge of pecorino into small chunks and add them to the food processor along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Pulse until well combined but there are still small pieces of pecorino throughout the mixture. (You do not want to blend too much because it will cause the mint to brown.) Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Transfer the pesto to a large high-sided skillet. When the pasta is cooked to al dente, use a large slotted spoon to lift the pasta out of the pot and directly into the skillet. Stir to combine. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the excess water from the pasta has evaporated and some of the pecorino has started to melt, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and butter if using. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Transfer to a large platter and garnish with the grated pecorino and whole mint leaves.

Using your pastry cutter, cut the butter into the dry mixture in a downward twisting motion until you reach a sandy texture. At this point, your dry mix should feel like beach sand, but if there are some slightly larger pieces of butter remaining this is okay. Those pieces will create the flaky effect when the biscuits begin to cook. Now, create a well in the center of your bowl of dry ingredients. Pour the buttermilk into the center of the bowl. Using your hands (this will feel funny and get messy), incorporate all the ingredients until the dough begins to come together and become one. Now put a small amount of flour on a flat surface and continue to bring the dough together, making sure not to knead the dough or overwork it. Use some of that extra flour to bring it all together and get the dough off your fingers too. Now spread out and flatten the dough so it&#39;s about the height of your flattened hand. Using your biscuit cutter (dip it in some flour to keep any dough from sticking to it), cut out 24 biscuits, reworking the dough if need be. Place a piece of parchment paper on your cookie sheet and line up the cut biscuits, 4 by 6. Place the biscuits into the oven and cook until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove the biscuits and let cool for about 5 minutes before handling. These biscuits are great for breakfast with eggs and bacon, or alone as a snack.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 53134,&quot;Chicken Curry 5 cloves garlic One 3-inch chunk peeled, fresh ginger Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1/4 heaping teaspoon whole cloves<br> 10 green cardamom pods<br> 8 whole allspice 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half<br> 1 bay leaf 1 medium yellow onion 2 teaspoons Madras-style curry powder 1/2 jalapeno, or more to taste 3 pounds mixed skinless, bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks (separated) 1/2 cup whole, peeled, canned tomatoes (with puree), roughly chopped 2 cups cold water Serving suggestion: Basmati rice and chutney Instructions: In a small food processor (mini-chopper), combine the garlic and ginger and puree to a paste.<br> Heat the oil in a stew pot or Dutch Oven over medium-high heat.

Cream the butter, cream cheese and sugar until smooth using a handheld mixer in a medium bowl. Add the flour slowly, mixing on low, until incorporated. Scoop the dough into a ball using your hands and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until the dough has firmed slightly, about 30 minutes. On a floured surface, roll the dough about 1/8-inch thick. Cut out as many rounds as possible with a small cookie cutter and transfer to ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch between each cookie. Re-roll the dough scraps and repeat until all the dough is used. Use a smaller cutter, about 3/4-inch, or cut freehand with a small sharp knife to punch a small window out of half of the cookies. Place the cutouts on the baking sheets and sprinkle all the cookies and cutouts with the colored sugars. Bake until golden around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets and then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. For the filling: Place the sugar, butter, mint extract, food coloring and 1/2 teaspoon of water in a medium bowl and beat on medium speed until well combined and fluffy. Spread a thin layer of mint filling on the cookies without the windows and place the wafers with the windows on top. Sprinkle with the confectioners&#39; sugar, if using, and serve the sandwich cookies with the cutout cookies on the side. We truly appreciate fans&#39; bringing concerns to our attention and are sorry for any less-than-positive experience, this recipe did test successfully as written. Times vary greatly depending on the type of oven you have, placement in the oven, brand of oven, and whether the oven is gas, electric or convection. Piercing or pricking the cookies is important as the ones we did not prick puffed up.

Whisk in the canola oil and season with salt. Refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to serve. For the kale salad: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Spread the garbanzo beans on the prepared baking sheet, rolling them lightly over the paper towels to remove excess liquid. Remove the paper towels, add the olive oil, and toss the garbanzos to coat. Bake until the garbanzos are deep golden brown and crispy, 25 minutes. Season immediately with salt. Let cool completely. Combine the carrots, radishes, kale, cucumbers and peppers in a large bowl; season with salt. Dress the salad with about a third of the dressing; since the kale is such a sturdy green, it can be dressed an hour or two ahead. (Refrigerate the remaining dressing to use on other salads or as a marinade.) Just before serving, toss with the crispy garbanzo beans and roasted peanuts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 53142,&quot;Cheese Pizzettes 1/3 cup finely shredded mozzarella 1/3 cup grated Parmesan 8 ounces purchased pizza dough Extra virgin olive oil, for deep-frying Instructions: Mix the mozzarella cheese and Parmesan together in a medium bowl, then set aside. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to 1/4-inch thick. Using a 2 3/4-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out dough rounds. Add enough oil to a heavy large frying pan with 3-inch sides to come halfway up the sides of the pan. Heat the oil over medium heat until hot. Drop a scrap of dough into the oil to ensure the oil is hot enough. If the dough sizzles, then the oil is hot enough. Working in batches, add the dough rounds to the hot oil (being sure not to crowd them in the pan) and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the rounds to paper towels to drain the excess oil. Immediately sprinkle the cheese mixture over the hot pizzas.

Spread the walnuts on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly browned and fragrant, about 7 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Working from the stem end, use a melon baller to remove the core from each apple, scooping out the stem and seeds making a deep hole for filling: work to within about 1/2-inch of the bottom of the apple. (Alternatively, remove the core with an apple corer and widen the hole with a small spoon.) Peel the skin from the top half of each apple. In a small bowl, blend together the brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon. Mix in the walnuts. Spoon equal amounts of the filling into the centers of the apples. Set the filled apples in an 8-inch square baking pan or other baking pan just large enough to hold them snugly. In a small pan over medium heat, warm the honey with apple juice, stirring until the honey dissolves. Pour around the apples. Spoon some of the liquid over the sides of the apples to moisten them, but do not spoon over the tops. Bake, basting the sides once or twice with the pan juices, until the apples are tender when pierced, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool, and serve in bowls with the pan juices spooned over the tops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 53165,&quot;Savory Swiss Chard 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 large bunch red or green or rainbow chard, stemmed and coarsely chopped Freshly grated nutmeg, about 1/4 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika or ground cumin Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 cup chicken stock Instructions: In a large skillet heat extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat.

Place the turkey in the fryer with the legs pointed down and fill with water until the turkey is barely submerged. Mark where water line is at (on the outside of the vessel). Take out the turkey and proceed with the below. Put the salt, granulated garlic, black pepper and herbs in a food processor. Pulse until fine and uniform. Rub the inside and outside of the turkey with the spice mixture. Using your fingers, carefully separate the breast skin from the meat and rub the spice mix directly on the breast meat. Place on a wire-racked baking sheet and let it sit uncovered in the fridge for 24 hours. Heat the oil in a turkey fryer to 350 degrees F. Carefully submerge the turkey into the oil, legs down. Fry until the thickest part of the breast registers 145 degrees F-- this could take 20 to 25 minutes (the bird is so hot it will carry over and perfectly hit the recommended temp). Watch the temperature of the oil and attempt to keep it at 350 the entire time. Take the turkey out of the oil and let it rest for at least 20 minutes before carving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 53167,&quot;Espresso Martini 1 1/2 shots vodka 1 shot coffee liqueur 1 shot coffee, cooled to room temperature 1 teaspoon instant espresso coffee granules Ice cubes Instructions: In a martini shaker, combine vodka, coffee liqueur, coffee, and instant espresso.

Add the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the granulated sugar, stirring just enough to hydrate the yeast. Let bloom for 8 to 10 minutes. Sift the flour, salt and remaining granulated sugar into a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the yeast mixture, eggs and remaining 1 cup milk. Stir the batter to combine and continue to mix until the consistency of a sticky pancake batter, about 3 minutes. Add the currants and orange peel and stir until fully combined, about 1 minute more. Cover the bowl with a slightly damp kitchen towel and put a plate on top to seal in the humidity. Leave it in a warm spot to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. When the batter has risen, stir it a couple of times to deflate it a little before frying. Meanwhile, heat about 2 inches of oil in a deep Dutch oven to 360 degrees F; line a baking sheet with a rack. Gently drop 8 to 9 heaping tablespoons of batter (see Cook&#39;s Note) into the oil and cook, flipping halfway through, until a deep golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes; the oliebollen will be rounded with some wild edges. Place them on the cooling rack for a few minutes, then transfer them to a large bowl with about 2 tablespoons of the confectioners&#39; sugar and toss to coat in the sugar. Return them back to the cooling rack to finish cooling; the steam from the oliebollen will help create a nice glaze with the sugar. Repeat with the remaining batter and confectioners&#39; sugar, making sure to bring the oil back to 360 degrees F before frying each batch. Serve warm or let cool completely before storing in a paper bag to serve later. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53173,&quot;Crispy Potatoes with Roasted Pepper Sauce 2 pounds creamer or red bliss potatoes, halved, or quartered if large Kosher salt 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Roasted Pepper Sauce, recipe follows 1 red bell pepper, seeded and halved 1 orange bell pepper, seeded and halved 1/2 red onion, halved 3 cloves garlic 8 to 10 whole black peppercorns 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1 teaspoon hot chili sauce (recommended: Sriracha) Instructions: In a large pot over high heat, add the potatoes and cover with water by 1-inch. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then add a pinch of salt, reduce the heat and simmer until slightly tender, but not easily poked by a fork, about 10 minutes. Drain the potatoes and pour put them onto a baking sheet to cool completely. In a large pan add the olive oil and heat over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to swirl, add the potatoes, season with salt and leave alone to allow a crust to form, about 5 minutes. Once a crust forms on the bottom give the potatoes a toss or flip them with a spatula and allow them to crisp on the other side, about 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the potatoes to a serving bowl with a slotted spoon. Serve drizzled with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put the bell peppers, onion, garlic, and peppercorns on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with a healthy pinch of salt. Mix with your hands to fully coat the vegetables, and arrange the bell peppers, skin side up, so that the garlic and peppercorns can hide under the cavity of the bell pepper halves. Roast until the skin of the peppers begins to blacken and pucker, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately put all of the ingredients and residue from the baking sheet into a bowl, and quickly cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let the peppers steam for about 5 minutes. Remove the pepper halves and, using your fingers, remove their skin by gently ripping and pulling it off, and return the peeled peppers to the bowl. Add the mixture to a blender along with the chili sauce. Pulse lightly until almost smooth, but still having a slight texture.

In a heavy saucepan over medium heat combine the milk with the orange zest. Bring to a simmer and allow to sit for a few minutes to incorporate the flavors. In a large bowl mix together 2/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, cornstarch, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, 2 whole eggs and 1 yolk, (reserve the egg white for breading). Temper the egg mixture by slowly whisking in about 1 cup of the hot milk. While whisking slowly pour the egg mixture into the pan with the remaining milk. Put the saucepan over medium-low heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. When the custard is very thick, about 10 minutes, pour it into the prepared baking pan. Cool in refrigerator for about 3 hours until firm. Remove custard from pan by inverting the baking pan onto a cutting board. Cut the custard into 4 equal squares. Cut each square diagonally to make 4 triangles per square. Heat the canola oil in a high sided skillet over medium heat to 350 degrees F. Beat the egg white with 2 tablespoons water in a shallow pie plate. In another pie plate mix together the remaining 1/2 cup of flour, 1/4 cup cornmeal and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.

Line a cupcake or muffin pan with 24 regular-size cupcake liners. Place the oil, buttermilk, eggs, vinegar, vanilla, and sugar in the bowl of an electric stand mixer and beat with the paddle attachment until thoroughly mixed. Sift the flour, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder together and slowly add to the mixer on low speed. Scrape down the bowl thoroughly, as needed. Add the food colorings in a steady stream until desired shade is achieved; it should appear bluish-purple. Beat for another 3 minutes. Scrape the bowl one last time and mix for 30 seconds by hand. Fill the cupcake liners two-thirds full with batter and bake until they form a semi-hard crust on top, about 25 minutes. Immediately remove the cupcakes from their pan and place on a cooling rack. For the blackberry curd filling: Bring the blackberries and water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan. Turn down the heat to low and simmer until the blackberries are soft and separate easily, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a sieve and pass through using a spoon to help mash the blackberries. Discard the pulp and reserve the juice. Place the flour and sugar in a clean saucepan and slowly pour in the blackberry juice, reserving 2 tablespoons. Whisk constantly. When thoroughly combined, add the whole eggs and egg yolks, whisking and cooking until the mixture thickens. When the curd has formed, after about 7 minutes, remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Cover tightly and place in the refrigerator until fully chilled. For the cream cheese frosting: Beat the cream cheese and butter together in the bowl of an electric stand mixer until pale and creamy. Add the blackberry juice and lemon zest and continue to beat until the color is even. (The lemon zest has a tendency to adhere to the beater blade. When removing from the mixer bowl, be sure to scrape this off and blend back into the frosting by hand.) Reduce the speed to low and slowly begin adding the confectioners&#39; sugar. Keep adding until the frosting has a medium-stiff consistency. You may not require the full 5 cups sugar. Beat on high speed for a further 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl as needed. To assemble: Remove the center of each cupcake using an apple corer. Fill the cavity with the blackberry curd until it is level with the top of the cake. Pipe the frosting on top using a plain pastry tip. Crumble one of the cakes into small pieces and scatter a few crumbles on top of each cake so that it adheres to the frosting. Garnish with a whole fresh blackberry, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53187,&quot;Giant Super Fluffy Pancakes Nonstick cooking spray, for the skillets 3 cups cake flour (see Cook&#39;s Note)<br> 6 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 1/4 cups milk<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for serving<br> 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> 2 large eggs, separated, plus 4 whites<br> 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar<br> Maple syrup, for serving<br> Whipped cream, for serving<br> Assorted fresh berries, for serving<br> Instructions: Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.

Drain and set aside. For the chicken piccata: Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides, then dredge in the flour. Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the chicken breasts until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes on each side; fry them a little longer if the breasts are thicker, monitoring the oil/butter mixture to make sure it doesn&#39;t burn. Remove the chicken to a plate. Add the garlic to the skillet and saute. Pour in the chicken broth and wine, and squeeze in the juice of the lemon. Whisk the sauce, scraping the bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to cook and bubble and thicken until reduced by about half. Sprinkle in a little salt and pepper as it&#39;s cooking. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the cream. Add the capers, then cook for a couple of minutes until the sauce thickens. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Expect the sauce to have a real tang to it; counter it with a little more broth and cream if it&#39;s too strong! To finish the noodles, melt the butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Throw in the cooked pasta, along with the parsley. Cook it in the butter for a couple of minutes so that a few of the noodles get a little bit of a pan-fried texture to them. Grate in some lemon zest and squeeze in some lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Place a handful of arugula on each plate, some noodles and a chicken breast.

Add pork, close bag and coat with marinade. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before grilling. Prepare outdoor grill for direct cooking with medium-high heat (about 400 degrees F.). Brush grill grates clean. Remove pork from marinade, shaking off excess oil. Grill, with grill lid closed, turning once, until the internal temperature reads between 145 degrees F. (medium rare) to 160 degrees F. (medium) on a digital meat thermometer, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to carving board and let cool. Chop pork into a 1/2-inch dice and transfer to a bowl. To grill pizzas: Cut 5 squares of parchment paper about 9 inches square each. Punch down dough and cut into four equal pieces. Shape dough into balls, place on work surface, loosely cover with plastic wrap and let stand 10 minutes. On very lightly floured work surface, roll and stretch each dough portion into 7- to 8-inch rounds (makes 4 pizzas). Place each round on a parchment square. Stack rounds on paper on large baking sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap. Brush grill grate clean. In batches if necessary, transfer dough rounds from parchment onto grill, discarding parchment. Grill, with the lid closed, occasionally rotating rounds, until underside is seared with grill marks, 2 to 3 minutes. Adjust heat as needed - do not burn the dough! Flip dough rounds and top with one-quarter each of Brussels sprouts and pork, followed by the Fontina and Parmesan cheese. Cover and continue cooking with the lid closed, occasionally rotating dough rounds so they don&#39;t stick, until undersides are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove from grill.

Season chicken with rosemary, salt and pepper and let stand 10 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for ravioli. Salt water and drop ravioli in water. Cook 8 minutes or until raviolis expand, float to top of water, and are al dente. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken breasts and cracked garlic to the pan. Cook chicken 12 minutes, or until juices run clear, turning occasionally. The balsamic vinegar will produce a deep brown, sweet finish on the chicken as it cooks. When the chicken is 2 or 3 minutes away from done, heat a second skillet over medium low to medium heat. To the second skillet, add butter to the pan and let it begin to brown. Remove chicken from the first skillet and transfer to a warm platter. In a skillet over medium high heat and add the pancetta. Brown the pancetta bits, about 2 or 3 minutes, then transfer to paper towels to drain and return pan to heat, reducing heat to medium. Add oil and shallots to the pan and let the shallots saute 2 minutes. When the butter for the ravioli has browned, add cooked ravioli to the pan and turn in butter to heat through. Add balsamic vinegar to the ravioli and cook a minute or 2 longer to reduce the vinegar and glaze the ravioli. The vinegar will become thick and syrup like. Add cheese, parsley, salt and pepper to the pasta and remove the pan from the heat. To the sauteed shallots for the spinach salad, add sugar and cook sugar with shallots 1 minute. Add vinegar to the pan, scraping up pan drippings. Add spinach to the dressing and turn to wilt and coat it evenly in sweet vinaigrette. Add crisp pancetta to the salad.

Add the onion and turkey neck and giblets; cook, stirring, until the giblets are browned, about 15 minutes. Add the chicken broth, herb sprigs and bay leaf; cover and simmer while the turkey roasts, about 2 hours. Strain the broth and keep warm; reserve the neck and giblets, if desired. When your turkey is done, transfer it to a cutting board and pour all the pan drippings into a degreasing cup. Add 1/2 cup of the prepared broth to the roasting pan and scrape up the browned bits with a wooden spoon. (If the bits are stuck, put the pan over a low burner to loosen them.) Add the bits and liquid to the degreasing cup. Let the fat rise to the top of the degreasing cup, then spoon off 1/2 cup fat and transfer to a large saucepan over medium heat. Make a roux: Sprinkle the flour into the pan and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the flour browns slightly, about 4 minutes. Gradually add the hot broth to the roux, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low. Pour the dark roasting juices from the degreasing cup into the gravy, discarding any remaining fat. If desired, chop the giblets and shred the neck meat; add to the gravy. Simmer, whisking occasionally, until the gravy thickens, about 10 minutes. Add the Worcestershire sauce and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the flavored butter, if desired. Start with cold heavy cream and mix on high speed. After about 3 minutes, you&#39;ll have whipped cream; continue mixing. After about 6 more minutes, the butter will clump and separate from the liquid. Strain and wrap the butter in cheesecloth, then squeeze out the liquid.

Make a vertical cut down the middle of each piece, about 3/4 of the way through. Open the pieces like a book. Lay them cut-side down on a piece of plastic wrap, cover with another piece and use a meat mallet to lightly pound the pork to about 1/2 inch thick. Add the pork, 1/4 cup of the yellow mustard, olive oil, pickle brine and garlic to a quart- or gallon-size resealable bag. Close the bag, and rub the marinade into the pork. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a grill or large grill pan for medium-high heat. Once the pork has marinated for 30 minutes, transfer it to a plate, shaking off any excess marinade. Lightly oil the grill grates with vegetable oil. Sprinkle both sides of the pork liberally with salt and pepper, and grill until charred on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium doneness. Transfer the pork a cutting board, and let it rest for 5 minutes. Reduce the grill heat to medium. Slice the pork across the grain into 1/8-inch-thick slices, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Brush the outside of the Cuban loaf with the butter, and lay the loaf halves cut-side up on a very long piece of aluminum foil. Mix the remaining tablespoon yellow mustard with the mayonnaise, and slather the mixture onto both pieces of bread. Layer the ham, pickles, pork and Swiss cheese on one half of the bread. Top with the other half, and wrap the sandwich up in the foil. Put the sandwich on the grill, place a large baking sheet on top and weigh it down with a large cast-iron pan or 2 large cans of food. Grill for 5 minutes, remove the baking sheet and weight, flip the sandwich, weigh it down again and grill until the Swiss cheese has melted, about 5 minutes more. Unwrap the sandwich, cut into 4 pieces and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 53242,&quot;Homemade French Baguettes 2 envelopes dry active yeast (1 1/2 tablespoons) 2 tablespoons honey 3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 teaspoons salt Canola oil, for greasing bowl Cornmeal, for dusting pan 3 to 4 ice cubes Instructions: Combine the honey, yeast and 1/2 cup warm water. Stir to combine and let the mixture stand until the yeast is activated and begins to foam, 5 minutes. Mix the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl with a dough hook and slowly add in the yeast mixture. Gradually add 1 cup warm water and mix until the dough comes together into a ball that is not too wet (you may not need all of the water). If the dough is sticky, add a little bit more flour. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, 2 to 6 minutes. You can do the thumbprint test: press in the dough with your thumb and it should bounce back when it&#39;s ready. Form the dough into a ball, place it in a lightly-oiled bowl and cover with a dishcloth, so it doesn&#39;t dry out. Let rest in a warm environment until doubled in size, 25 to 30 minutes. Punch down the dough and divide it in half. Shape into 2 baguettes by making a flat rectangle out of your dough, then folding the top and bottom towards the middle, like an envelope, and sealing the seam with your fingers. Keep repeating the folding and sealing, stretching the rectangle lengthwise as you go, until it&#39;s about 12 to 14 inches long and 2 inches wide. Fold and seal either end to round. Flip seam-side down and place on a sheet pan or baguette pan that has been dusted with cornmeal. Score the tops of the loaves, making deep diagonal slits 1/2-inch deep, cover with a dishcloth and let rise in a warm environment until they have doubled in size, 25 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and position your oven racks with one on the bottom and the other in the middle. Place an oven-safe (non-glass) bowl or pan on the bottom rack. When your bread has doubled for the second time, remove the towel and quickly and simultaneously, slide the sheet tray with the baguettes onto the middle rack while carefully throwing the ice cubes into the bowl on the bottom rack. The ice will create a burst of steam that will give you a nice crispy crust. Quickly shut the oven door so no steam escapes. Bake the baguettes until golden brown, 15 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: If you have a glass window on your oven, place a towel over it when throwing the ice in, hot glass can shatter if ice touches it. Serving suggestions: ricotta cheese and acacia honey. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 53243,&quot;Vegetarian Gravy 1 medium onion, quartered 2 stalks celery, roughly chopped 1 medium carrot, roughly chopped 3 cloves garlic, crushed 1 teaspoon vegetable oil Kosher salt 1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms (about 1 heaping cup) 6 sprigs thyme 2 sun-dried tomatoes 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 1 dried bay leaf 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 fresh sage leaves 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Position an oven rack in the top position in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Toss the onions, celery, carrots and garlic with the oil and 1 teaspoon salt on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until the vegetables are charred in some places, 25 to 30 minutes. Bring the roasted vegetables, 1 cup water, mushrooms, thyme, sun-dried tomatoes, soy sauce, bay leaf and 1 teaspoon salt to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is gone, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 6 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and bring back to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and gently simmer until reduced by about one third, about 45 minutes. Strain the stock through a strainer into a large liquid measuring cup, use the back of a ladle to squeeze all the liquid out of the solids (there should be about 4 cups of stock). If not making gravy right away, let the stock cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 1 month. To make the gravy, warm the stock slightly in a medium saucepan if it has been refrigerated. Melt the butter in another medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sage leaves, and stir for 30 seconds; remove and set aside. Add the flour to the saucepan, and stir until smooth and lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Slowly pour in the warm stock while whisking constantly until smooth and thick, 8 to 10 minutes. Chop up the fried sage, stir it into the gravy along with the parsley and season to taste with pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 53244,&quot;Chinese Healthy Dumplings 1/2 pound spicy turkey sausage or turkey breakfast sausage 1 pound minced turkey 4 ounces shrimp (optional) 6 green onions (scallions) 1/4 medium size Chinese cabbage, or equivalent amount baby cleaned spinach, or Chinese bok choy) 2 teaspoons soy sauce 2 teaspoon sesame oil 1/2 teaspoon pepper 1/4 cup water with a teaspoon cornflour mixed (can use one egg, but will add cholesterol) 2 teaspoons white wine, or sherry 2 packets wonton wrappers, round if possible, or square, (about 50 per package) 1 bowl of water, half full Instructions: Remove turkey sausage from skins and combine with minced turkey in a food processor. Shell and de-vein shrimp and combine in food processor with turkey (if you do not have a food processor, you can chop shrimp into small pieces and hand mix with turkey). Mix in finely chopped scallions, finely chopped cabbage, soy sauce, sesame oil, pepper, cornflour mixture and white wine. Set on manual \\pulse\\ control or on lowest chop setting and process for just a few seconds until shrimp is chopped coarsely into the turkey. If the amount is too much for your food processor, mix in batches.<br> Set up dumpling wrapping area with a half full bowl of water, a clean surface to work on, a damp clean hand or kitchen towel, chopsticks, or small spoons and whoever is around to help you wrap the dumplings!<br> Set turkey mixture on wrapping area. On your clean working area, place a few wonton wrappers flat down on surface (keep other wonton wrappers in plastic and they can dry out). Using chopsticks or a teaspoon, place about a teaspoon of mixture onto the center of wrapper. Dip a finger into the bowl of water and moisten one side of the dumpling wrapper with turkey mixture on it. Pick up the parcel and with fingers, pinch the two opposite sides of the wonton wrapper together forming the parcel into the shape of a half-circle dumpling. If you are using square wrappers, you will have to pinch the square shape down into a half-circle shape. Keep dumplings covered with damp cloth to keep them from drying out (do not have cloth dripping, it should be just damp to the touch). Meanwhile, in a large deep pasta pot, fill a little above half with water. Bring to a boil. Lower temperature so that the water is at a low boil, too high a boil can break the dumplings. Place dumplings in carefully and close to the water to prevent them from breaking. Boil uncovered for about 10 to 12 minutes (checking to see if the inside is cooked). Gently take out immediately with a strainer spatula. They are ready to eat with a ginger scallion soy sauce!<br> The next day, you can make pot stickers by frying the left over dumplings. Use a sweeter dipping sauce such as a plum or duck sauce for pot stickers. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 53245,&quot;Peppermint-Vodka Hot Chocolate 2 candy canes, crushed 3 cups whole milk 8 ounces white chocolate, chopped 1/3 cup vodka 2 teaspoons peppermint extract Whipped cream, for topping Instructions: Put the crushed candy canes on a small plate.

Grease a fluted pan, pie tin, or shallow springform pan. Roll out the puff pastry to the width of the baking pan. Dust the rolling pin with flour and carefully roll the pastry back onto the rolling pin, then unroll it over the pan. Press the dough into place and crimp the edges. Brush the pastry with the softened butter. Place the bell peppers over an open flame or under the broiler and completely blacken them on all sides. Put the blackened peppers in a plastic bag, seal it, and allow them to steam for 20 minutes. Remove the peppers from the bag and peel away and discard all black skin. Cut the peppers in half and remove all seeds and veins. Cut into 1/2--inch thick strips. Cut the eggplant crosswise on the bias into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Brush the eggplant lightly with the clarified butter and season with salt and pepper. Roast the eggplant in the oven for 15 minutes, or until done but not mushy. Place the crumbled goat cheese on top of the pastry. Top the goat cheese with the eggplant and peppers in a spiral fashion, overlapping each. Sprinkle the Parmesan over the eggplant and peppers. Bake the tart for about 20 minutes, or until it is golden brown and the edges are puffy. Garnish with the fresh basil leaves. Whisk together the vinegar, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Slowly add the olive oil while whisking. Toss with the greens and any remaining eggplant or peppers and serve on top of the tart. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 53265,&quot;Banana Splitsville 2 cups sugar 1 cup water 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 batch caramel 2 cups heavy cream 4 bananas Sugar for coating Ice cream of your choice Instructions: Combine the sugar, water, and corn syrup in a small, heavy saucepan and place over high heat. As soon as the sugar has dissolved, heat your thermometer under warm tap water (to prevent thermal shock) and attach to side of pan, making sure that the bulb is completely submerged. Do not stir the mixture or agitate the pan at this stage.<br> When the mixture reaches 230 degrees, reduce the heat to medium and allow the sugar to color gradually. As the temperature approaches 300 degrees the color will start to turn to amber. At this point, it&#39;s safe to swirl the pan gently to help distribute the heat evenly. As the caramel heads towards 340 degrees, it will reach a deep amber color.<br> Remove the pan from the heat and slowly stir with a metal spoon, allowing it to cool until the caramel falls from the spoon in a solid stream, like a string. When it does, it&#39;s doodad time.<br> Form doodads by holding the spoon 12 to 16 inches over the caramel and drizzling the patterns on the parchment. (Hint: allow the spoon to unload into the pan for a few seconds before attempting doodad. This will allow a narrower stream.) Quick back and forth motions or side to side movements are best. It&#39;s all in the wrist. Allow doodads to cool for 15 minutes then peel the paper off (not the other way around). Stack in an airtight container with wax paper between each piece.<br> After making 15 to 20 doodads, you should have sufficient caramel remaining to move on to the sauce phase. So, return the remaining caramel to medium high heat and continue cooking until you see the first sign of smoke. Immediately remove from the heat, and add the cream, all at once, at arms length. (It will boil furiously.) Once the mixture calms down, return to medium heat and boil 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool to room temperature, move to squirt bottle and refrigerate for up to a week.<br> To make the bananas brulee, quarter the bananas (peel on) and rub into sugar to coat thoroughly. Remove peel and place on cooling rack over several layers of foil. (Don&#39;t try this on your dining room table.) Don your safety goggles and fire up your torch. Hold the torch so that the very tip of the flame barely touches the banana, and move quickly back and forth until the sugar melts, turns brown, and bubbles. As soon as it looks like caramel, move on. You know you&#39;ve got it down when a solid, glasslike sheet of gold (no graininess) has formed on the banana.<br> To do the split (so to speak), squirt a pattern of caramel sauce on a chilled plate, top with 4 banana pieces (Lincoln log style), top with the ice cream of your choice (we like our peachy vanilla from Churn Baby Churn), and finally, a doodad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53266,&quot;Butter Nut Sundaes 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, a couple of pinches 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice, a couple of pinches 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, eyeball it 2 pints butter pecan ice cream 1 jar caramel sauce topping for sundaes, any brand Whipped cream 1/2 cup honey roasted peanuts Instructions: Preheat oven or toaster oven to 325 degrees F.

Put the ham in a large roasting pan, fat side up. Using a sharp knife, score the ham with cuts across the skin, about 2-inches apart and 1/2-inch deep. Cut diagonally down the slashes to form a diamond pattern; season the meat generously with salt and pepper. Chop about 8 of the sage leaves and put in a bowl; mix with the oil to make a paste. Rub the sage-oil all over the ham, being sure to get the flavor into all the slits. Bake the ham for 2 hours. Now there is plenty of time to bang-out the orange glaze. For the glaze: Place a saucepan over medium heat. Add the chunks of butter, oranges, orange juice, brown sugar, water, and spices. Slowly cook the liquid down to a syrupy glaze; this should take about 30 to 40 minutes. After the ham has been going for a couple of hours, pour the orange glaze all over it, with the pieces of fruit and all. Scatter the remaining sage leaves on top and stick the ham back in the oven. Continue to cook for 1 1/2 hours, basting with the juices every 30 minutes. Scatter the carrots around the ham and coat in the orange glaze. Stick the ham once again back in the oven and cook for a final 30 minutes, until the carrots are tender, the ham is dark and crispy, and the whole thing is glistening with a sugary glaze. Set the ham on a cutting board to rest before carving. Serve the carrots and orange glaze on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53273,&quot;Shoestring Fries with Truffle Aioli Vegetable oil, for frying 2 large russet potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds), cleaned 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream 1 tablespoon white truffle oil 1 large clove garlic, grated Zest of 1 lemon Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon white truffle oil, for drizzling Instructions: Heat 2 to 3 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot to 350 degrees F. Carefully cut the potatoes into shoestrings (or matchsticks) using a mandolin fitted with the narrowest julienne blade (about 1/8-inch wide). Rinse the cut potatoes thoroughly in a bowl of cold water to remove the surface starch. Keep the potatoes in water until you&#39;re ready to fry. For the aioli: Whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, truffle oil, garlic, lemon zest and salt and pepper to taste in a bowl. Refrigerate or set aside until ready to use. Transfer the potatoes to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet and pat them dry, as dry as you can get them. I like to use a kitchen towel for this too; whatever gets them the driest. Fry the shoestrings in batches until the potatoes are crisp and turn a nice golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. As each batch of fries comes out, transfer to a large mixing bowl and toss with some of the chopped herbs, a drizzle of the truffle oil and salt to taste.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the chocolate with 1/2 cup boiling water in the top of a double boiler until the chocolate is melted. Cream together the sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed, 3 minutes. Fold in the melted chocolate. Add the egg yolks. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Add to the butter mixture and stir to combine, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Stir in the buttermilk. Beat the egg whites in a clean bowl with cleaned beaters until stiff peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the cake batter. Divide the batter among the prepared cake pans and bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Invert the pans onto racks and cool well. For the frosting: Combine the sugar, evaporated milk, butter, egg yolks and vanilla in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring continuously, being careful not to scorch the frosting. Lower the heat and cook, 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the coconut and pecans. Spread the frosting in a shallow pan, and place in the refrigerator to cool completely. To assemble the cake: Slice each cake layer in half horizontally, making a total of 6 thin layers. Place the first cake layer on a cake plate, then spread about 1/4 inch of the frosting over the top of the cake. Place the next cake layer over the frosting. Repeat the layers, alternating cake and frosting, until all the layers have been used.

Add the chicken and marinade to a resealable plastic bag and marinate in the fridge for 3 hours. Take the chicken out of the marinade and dry off. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Preheat a grill to high heat. Place a large cast-iron skillet on one side of the grill. Place a smoker box or foil pan with wood chips on the grill. Once the smoker has begun to produce smoke, liberally oil the grill grates and place the chicken on the grates. (We are just looking for a quick hard sear on both sides to get that char flavor. The goal is to finish cooking in the creamy, smoky corn.) Add the butter to the skillet along with the Fresnos, poblanos, onions and remaining 3 whole cloves garlic. Saute until the onions are translucent and chiles are tender, about 10 minutes. Deglaze with the sherry and add the fresh corn, squash, zucchini, cream, 1/2 cup Parmesan and half of the stock. Season to taste. Add the chicken to the skillet and lower the grill to medium. Close the lid and smoke the skillet over medium heat, playing with the position of the skillet to ensure you get the liquid to simmer ever so slightly, until the chicken hits 160 to 165 degrees F, 10 to 15 minutes. Take the skillet off the grill and pour in a little chicken stock if the sauce is very thick.

Divide the crust into 8 (6-ounce) custard cups. Put them into a 9 by 13-inch baking dish or roasting pan and blind bake in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool. In a medium sauce pot, over medium-high heat, add 2 cups of the cream, the spices, the vanilla seeds and the vanilla bean pod. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks with the sugar until the mixture is pale yellow and the sugar is dissolved. Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups of cream and the 1/2 cup of milk to the cream and spice mixture. Slowly incorporate the yolk and sugar mixture, then strain through a medium-size sieve. Whisk in the pumpkin puree. Divide the pumpkin mixture evenly into the custard cups lined with the crust.* Add the hot water into the baking dish or roasting pan to create a hot bath and put the pan into the oven. Bake until the custard is starting to set, yet still a little wiggly in the middle, about 35 to 45 minutes. Remove the brulee from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight or at least 6 hours. Lightly sprinkle each custard with the turbinado sugar. Heat the sugar with a butane torch until caramelized. To get a thick caramelized sugar crust, repeat this, with just a light sprinkling each time. Allow to cool and serve. *Guy&#39;s Tip: if you happen to have any leftover creme brulee mixture, pour it into a baking dish and put it into another roasting pan. Add hot water about halfway up the sides of the dish and bake until custard is starting to set, yet still a little wiggly in the middle, about 35 to 45 minutes. Remove and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight or at least 6 hours. Refer to recipe for caramelizing sugar on top after it has cooled completely.

Remove skins and force potatoes through the medium disk of a food mill into a bowl and beat in 3/4 to 1 cup of flour, 2 egg yolks and salt to taste. Transfer mixture to a lightly floured board and gently knead dough, adding additional flour, if necessary, to form a soft, smooth but slightly sticky dough. Do not overwork dough. Divide dough into three equal parts. Working with one piece of dough at a time roll it into a rope about 1 inch in diameter and cut it into 3/4-inch pieces. Gnocchi may be transferred to a lightly floured baking sheet and chilled for 30 minutes. The gnocchi can be cooked as is or they can be shaped. To shape gnocchi: Using a fork with rounded long, slim tines, and holding it parallel to counter, concave side facing you, press a piece of dough against the inside curve of the fork just below the prongs using your index finger. Flip dough away from tip of fork in the direction of the fork&#39;s handle In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Add salt to taste and enough gnocchi to cook without crowding the pan. Once gnocchi have floated to surface simmer for 10 to 15 seconds more, or until just firm. With a slotted spoon transfer gnocchi to a bowl. Cook remaining gnocchi in same manner. and keep warm. Divide gnocchi among serving plates and nap with tomato sauce. Serve with freshly grated cheese.

Set aside. Mix the mustard powder, salt and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Dust the counter with 1/4 cup cheese. Unfold 1 sheet of the puff pastry on the cheese. (If the pastry isn&#39;t quite thawed, don&#39;t force it. Let it sit until thawed.) Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons spice mix over the puff pastry, followed by 1/4 cup cheese. Using a rolling pin, roll the pastry out to 1/8 inch thick. This presses the cheese into the pastry and also smooths out any seams or wrinkles. Fold the sheet of pastry in half. Top with another 1 1/2 teaspoons of the spice mix and 1/4 cup cheese. Roll out again to 1/8 inch thick. Using a knife and cutting straight down (do not saw), cut the pastry into long strips, making half the strips 1/4 inch wide and half about 1/2 inch wide. Brush a hot dog piece with mustard and wrap with pastry strips, alternating between long and short strips of pastry for a mummy look. Place on a lined baking sheet. Continue with the hot dog pieces until the pastry strips are finished. Refrigerate at least 10 minutes and up to 1 hour. This helps firm up the mummies/straws and give them better puff in the oven. Meanwhile, prepare the rest of the mummies using the second sheet of puff pastry and the remaining cheese and hot dog pieces.

Measure out 3/4 cup of the ranch dressing and set the remainder aside for serving at the table. Fill a turkey injector with the 3/4 cup ranch dressing and inject 2 tablespoons of the dressing into each thigh of the turkey, 1 tablespoon into each drumstick and 3 tablespoons into each breast. Let the turkey stand at room temperature for 30 minute to let the dressing soak into the meat. Discard any of the unused ranch dressing in the injector (it has been in contact with the raw turkey). Mix together the olive oil and melted butter in a small bowl. Brush the turkey with the oil mixture and then sprinkle with salt. Preheat an oil-less fryer for cooking (alternatively, follow oven-roasting directions below). Place the turkey breast-side up in the fryer with the legs in the deepest part. Cook the turkey until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast reaches 160 degrees F, about 2 hours. (The breast cooks slower than the legs in the oil-less fryer; carryover cooking will cook it the rest of the way through.) Remove the basket insert with the turkey and let the bird rest at least 30 minutes over a roasting pan. Remove the turkey from the basket, carefully dislodging any parts of the turkey that are touching the basket so the skin does not tear. Carve the turkey and serve with the reserved ranch dressing or gravy. Alternatively, roast the turkey in the oven: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Inject the turkey with the dressing as directed above and set it in a roasting pan. Roast, basting every 30 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh reaches 160 degrees F, about 3 hours (the carryover cooking will cook it the rest of the way through).

If you&#39;re serious about your cocktails, make sure all of the ingredients (even the glasses) are chilled when making this drink. Put the orange slices into a durable bowl and add the lemon juice and the pinch of salt. Use a wooden spoon to \\bruise\\ the orange slices so that the oil in the peels emerges and the pulp from the orange mixes with the lemon juice. Add the vodka and continue to stir.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Vodka, Gin, Rum, Cava]&quot; 53314,&quot;Potato and Herb Stuffed Bread 4 medium sized potatoes 1/2 teaspoon red pepper 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 1/4 teaspoons Kosher salt 3 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves 2 cups chapati flour or whole wheat flour 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons Indian vegetable shortening or light vegetable oil 1 teaspoon Kosher salt 1 cup warm water, about 90 to 100 degrees 1/2 cup flour for dusting 1/2 cup melted Indian vegetable shortening or light vegetable oil for brushing Instructions: Stuffing: Boil the potatoes in their jackets until very soft. Peel and mash them thoroughly. Add the remaining stuffing ingredients. Mix well and set aside. This filling can be prepared ahead and refrigerated for a day. There is no need to warm the stuffing before filling the bread. To prepare the bread: Combine flours with salt in a bowl. Reserve about 1 teaspoon of shortening, and rub the remainder into the flour, with your finger tips until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add most of the water to form a mass. Slowly add more water tablespoons at a time until dough forms. Brush the work surface and your hands with the reserved teaspoon of fat. Place the dough on the greased surface, and knead for 10 to 15 minutes. This will be a very soft and pliable dough. Put back in bowl and cover with a moist towel or a sheet of plastic wrap and let it rest, preferably in a warm place, for at least 1/2 hour. Divide the bread dough and the filling into 12 equal portions. Take one piece dough and flatten it into a 4-inch round pillow with your hands. Depress the center slightly and place a portion of the filling into the depression. Bring the sides of the dough over the filling and enclose it completely. Press lightly but firmly to flatten it into a pillow, either between your hands or the work board. With your fingers, pinch the edges slightly, so that the filling is in the center and not near the edge where it could break through the dough. Cover with plastic wrap or a moist towel to prevent drying. Pick up each pattie and dust with flour. Firmly pat the pattie to make filling adhere to dough. Roll out to a 6-inch circle dusting with flour as you go, to prevent sticking. Cover with plastic wrap or moist towel. Heat the griddle or frying pan cook each bread for 2 minutes or until brown spots begin to appear. Flip the bread over and cook for 30 seconds. Brush lightly but thoroughly with melted shortening or oil and cook on original side for 30 seconds. Brush other side and flip again. Keep warm in a covered dish or tightly wrapped with foil. Note: They can also be made several hours ahead and reheated in a 300 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 53315,&quot;Creamy Polenta 4 cups water, plus more as needed 4 cups milk, plus more as needed 3 tablespoons butter 2 teaspoons salt 2 cups polenta 1/2 cup creme fraiche 1/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano Instructions: In a large saucepan, bring the water, milk and butter to a boil.

Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, 9 to 11 minutes; remove to paper towels. Finely chop and set aside. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons drippings from the skillet. Add 4 tablespoons butter and melt over low heat. Pour into a 9-inch-round cake pan, tilting the pan to coat the bottom. Sprinkle the brown sugar evenly over the butter mixture. Place a pineapple ring in the middle of the pan, then arrange the remaining rings around the outside, overlapping them slightly if necessary. Sprinkle about 3 tablespoons of the chopped bacon in the middle of the rings and between them. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the remaining 1 stick butter and the granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until the batter is smooth, about 15 more seconds. Fold in the remaining chopped bacon. Spread the batter over the pineapple in the pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Transfer to a rack and let cool 15 minutes, then run a knife around the edge and invert onto a platter.

Gradually whisk in the milk, then the egg and vanilla, and finally the sugar and melted butter. Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot over high heat to 350 degrees F. Pour as much batter as fits into a funnel, holding your finger at the base of the funnel to dam it. Bring the funnel over the top of the hot oil, release your finger to begin the stream of batter, and move the funnel in a circular motion to create a spiral shape. Use about 1/2 cup batter per funnel cake, or more or less to your liking. Fry 2 to 3 minutes until golden brown and slightly puffed, turning over when 1 side is golden. Remove from oil and place on a plate lined with 2 layers of paper towels. Immediately top with a good scattering of powdered sugar. Repeat until no batter remains. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53334,&quot;Homemade Steak Sauce 1 large shallot, coarsely chopped 1 red Holland or Fresno cl pepper 2 large cloves garlic 2 large fresh bay leaves 1 teaspoon mustard seed or dry mustard, 1/3 palmful 1/4 cup dry sherry 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 1 cup organic ketchup or low-sugar ketchup 2 tablespoons soy or tamari sauce 1 cup beef stock Instructions: In food processor bowl, combine the shallot, cl, garlic, bay leaves, mustard seed, sherry, Worcestershire sauce and peppercorns and process into a smooth paste.

Drain the cod, rinse, and put it in a large pot. Add the milk and enough water to cover by 1-inch; cooking the cod in milk keeps it really moist. Simmer gently over medium-low heat for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cod is tender and pliable. Drain and rinse well, then flake the cod into a bowl with your hands, removing any little bits of skin and bone. While the cod is cooking, pour 1-inch of water in a large pot fitted with a steamer insert. Add the potatoes and simmer on medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes until very tender. Drain the potatoes, peel off the skins, and mash them well with a potato masher or pass them through a ricer or sieve. Add the cod to the potatoes, along with the onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, and eggs. Beat the mixture firmly with a wooden spoon so that it well combined and firm ? a spoon should stand up in it. (If you find it too dry, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk.) Season with a pinch of pepper and taste for salt - you may not need to add any, as the cod itself retains enough saltiness, in spite of being soaked and boiled. With lightly moistened hands or using 2 tablespoons, shape the cod mixture into egg-shaped balls ? you should get about 25. (The cod balls can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day before cooking or frozen in a container.) Heat 3-inches of oil in a deep heavy skillet or pot to 370 degrees F. Add a few of the cod balls at a time to the hot oil, turning them 3 or 4 times to get nicely browned all over. Carefully lift the cod fritters out of the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a platter lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat. Serve hot or at room temperature with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 53336,&quot;Frisee with French Beans and Spicy Peanut Dressing 1 (16-ounce) bag frozen French-cut green beans, thawed 1 head frisee 1/2 cup roasted peanuts 1 jalapeno, seeded, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces 2 tablespoons jarred chopped garlic 1 tablespoon jarred sliced ginger 1/2 bunch scallions, sliced 1 tablespoon dark sesame oil 1/2 (4.25-ounce) can cream of coconut (recommended: Coco Lopez) 1 (18-ounce) jar creamy peanut butter 1/2 cup hot water 1/2 (8.5-ounce) jar hoisin sauce 4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: Thaw green beans in a colander and pat dry to remove excess water. Clean frisee and cut into bite sized pieces and set aside. In a food processor, add the jalapeno, garlic, ginger and scallions. Process and add the sesame oil to form a paste. Transfer paste to a large bowl and whisk in cream of coconut. Whisk in peanut butter; gradually whisk in water until consistency is a smooth, thick sauce. Whisk in hoisin, soy sauce and cilantro. This recipe will make more dressing than you need for the salad; reserve extra dressing in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for other uses.

Position a rack in the center of the oven. Spray a 9 x13 x 2-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. For the crust, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter in a medium bowl and mix until moistened. Press the mixture evenly in the prepared pan and 1/4 inch up the sides. Bake for 8 minutes and set aside to cool. For the filling, place the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the ricotta and beat for another minute, scraping down the bowl. With the mixer on low, add the limoncello, vanilla, and lemon zest and beat for one minute. With the mixer on medium-low, add the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated. Scrape down the bowl and mix until the batter is smooth. Pour over the crust. Place the baking pan in a roasting pan large enough to hold the baking pan completely flat. Place the pan in the oven and carefully pour enough of the hottest tap water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of the baking pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until almost set in the center. (It will still be a little jiggly when you shake the pan gently.) Turn off the heat and leave the cheesecake in the oven in the water bath for 15 minutes to prevent the cheesecake from cracking. Take the baking pan out of the water bath and place on a rack to cool completely. Wrap the entire pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. Sprinkle with extra grated lemon zest, cut in 12 pieces, and serve cold. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53339,&quot;Shepherd&#39;s Pie 1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes 1/4 cup half-and-half 2 ounces unsalted butter 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 egg yolk 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 cup chopped onion 2 carrots, peeled and diced small 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons tomato paste 1 cup chicken broth 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons freshly chopped rosemary leaves 1 teaspoon freshly chopped thyme leaves 1/2 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels 1/2 cup fresh or frozen English peas Instructions: Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Place the half-and-half and butter into a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until warmed through, about 35 seconds. Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the saucepan. Mash the potatoes and then add the half and half, butter, salt and pepper and continue to mash until smooth. Stir in the yolk until well combined. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling. Place the canola oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrots and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and stir to combine. Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly. Add the corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula. Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 53340,&quot;Top Shelf Margarita Grande Finely grated lime zest Coarse kosher salt Lime slice or wedge 2 ounces top-shelf tequila (recommended: Cuervo Gold or anejo tequila) 1-ounce orange-flavored liqueur (recommended: Grand Marnier or Cointreau) 1 1/2 ounces lime juice, or more, to taste 1 1/2 cups ice cubes Instructions: In a small shallow bowl or rimmed saucer combine the lime zest and salt and mix well.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium mixing bowl. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large mixing bowl using a hand mixer), add the granulated sugar, butter and brown sugar. Mix on medium speed until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the honey and continue mixing for 30 seconds more to combine. Turn the machine off and add the eggs individually, mixing on low after each addition. Add the ricotta, almond extract and lemon juice and mix on medium-low speed for about 2 minutes more. The dough should look slightly granular but free of lumps. Add half of the sifted dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the remainder of the dry ingredients. Mix one last time on low speed until all of the ingredients are combined and the dough is fluffy. Scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet by heaping tablespoons, making sure to leave space in between each cookie, as they will spread while baking. Sprinkle the chopped lemon peel and raw sugar over the cookies. Bake until light golden on the bottom edges, about 15 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet before moving to a cooling rack. Repeat this process until all of the dough is baked. Once completely cooled, store the cookies in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 53342,&quot;Mexican Wet Burrito 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 green bell pepper, chopped<br> 1 red bell pepper, chopped<br> 1/2 white onion, chopped One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes in sauce<br> One 28-ounce can tomato sauce 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground oregano<br> 1/2 teaspoon black pepper<br> 1 pound melting white American cheese, preferably Land o&#39; Lakes 1/4 cup pickled jalapenos 2 cups milk<br> 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 4 ounces sirloin or skirt steak, sliced into bite-size pieces<br> Kosher salt and black pepper 1 large flour tortilla<br> 1/2 cup canned refried beans, warm<br> 1/2 cup cooked Mexican or Spanish rice, warm<br> 2 tablespoons chopped white onion 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese<br> For serving, optional: Sour cream; guacamole; shredded lettuce Instructions: For the salsa: Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.

Put the tomatillos, poblanos, jalapeno and serrano pepper on the prepared baking sheet and toss with the olive oil. Place under the broiler and cook, carefully removing the baking sheet and flipping once halfway, until the peppers are blistered and charred all over, 5 to 6 minutes. Allow to cool while you prepare the pork. Season the pork with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Sprinkle over the flour and toss to coat. Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the pork and cook until browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes; remove to a plate. Repeat with the remaining pork. Lower the heat to medium and stir in the garlic, carrots, onions, oregano and cl powder. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, peel and seed the poblanos. Chop the poblanos, jalapeno, serrano and tomatillos. Stir into the pot with the vegetables. Add the stock and bay leaves and return the seared pork. Bring to a boil, then lower to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook until the pork is extremely tender, about 1 hour. Check the pot occasionally, making sure there is enough liquid. Add a little more stock or water as needed. Remove the bay leaves and stir in the cilantro and lime juice. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If serving immediately, spoon into bowls and top with the grated cheese, sour cream and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges and warmed tortillas To freeze, allow the stew to cool completely. Transfer to a deep 9-by-13-inch foil pan and wrap tightly with foil and plastic wrap. Put the grated cheese in a labeled quart-size resealable plastic bag. Put the stew, cheese and a pack of tortillas onto a baking sheet and freeze. To serve, remove the meal kit from the freezer. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the foil and plastic wrap from the stew, then return the foil. Bake until heated through, 50 to 55 minutes. Let the tortillas and cheese thaw while the stew reheats, then remove the tortillas from the pack, wrap in foil and warm in the oven for the last 10 minutes while the stew is cooking. Serve the stew in bowls with the fixins -- cheese, cilantro and tortillas alongside some sour cream and lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 53352,&quot;Popcorn with Rosemary Infused Oil 1 cup popcorn kernels 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons Rosemary Infused Oil, recipe follows Salt 1 cup olive oil 5 to 6 fresh rosemary sprigs (each 5 inches long) Instructions: Stir the popcorn kernels and 1/2 cup of the oil in a heavy large pot.

Slowly add the melted butter, a few tablespoons at a time, and whisk until thickened. Remove from the heat, whisk in the steak sauce and season with the salt and black pepper. Keep warm. For the Texas toast: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Combine the garlic, butter and some salt and black pepper in a small bowl. Butter both sides of the bread with some of the garlic butter, and grill until nicely charred on both sides. For the steak: Put each slice of steak in between pieces of plastic wrap and use a meat mallet to pound them into thin steaks. Sprinkle both sides with some of the steak rub and some salt and black pepper. Heat the oil in a cast-iron pan over high heat. Add the steaks and cook until a crust forms, about 1 minute. Flip and cook for another minute until the other side forms a crust as well. For the poached eggs: Bring 3 cups water and the vinegar to a gentle simmer in a large high-sided frying pan. Break each egg into a cup and gently add to the water. Poach until the yolks are nearly set, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the eggs from the pan with a slotted spoon to drain the liquid. Season the top with salt and black pepper. For assembly: Spoon some of the black bean relish on top of each piece of the Texas toast. Top each with 2 pieces of steak, a poached egg, then some of the hollandaise.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. On a lightly floured work surface, unfold the puff pastry and roll lightly to flatten. Using a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter, cut out pastry circles and place, evenly spaced, on the parchment. Using a fork, generously prick (dock) the pastry circles to the edges. Spread 1 teaspoon of the pesto on each circle, almost to the edge. Place a slice of tomato on top, and drizzle a tiny drop of olive oil over. Bake until puffed and golden, 15 to 20 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53359,&quot;Emmer Flatbread 200 grams whole-wheat flour, plus more for the work surface 200 grams emmer wheat flour (if unavailable, use whole wheat) 265 grams water 2 tablespoons vegetable or olive oil, plus more for the bowl 7 grams salt Instructions: Morning: Combine the flours, water, oil, and salt in a bowl until they come together into a mass. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes while the flour absorbs the water.<br> Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 5 minutes by pushing down on and spreading the dough and then folding it over on itself. It should be smooth and elastic. Form it into a ball and place it in a clean, oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 4 to 8 hours.<br> Afternoon or Evening:<br> About 45 minutes before you want to bake, spread out the dough on a lightly floured counter, cut the dough in half with a dough scraper, and roll it into 2 logs. Cut each log into 6 pieces. You should have 12 pieces of dough that weigh about 55 grams each; evenly distribute any leftover dough.<br> Shape each piece into a ball. Let the balls rest for 30 minutes at room temperature under plastic wrap.<br> Place a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and let it heat up for several minutes.<br> Meanwhile, liberally flour a work surface. Flatten a dough ball and dust it lightly with flour, then use a floured rolling pin to roll it out as thin as possible (7 to 9 inches in diameter), rotating the disk to keep it even. If it resists, let it rest for a few minutes and continue rolling again. Cover the disk with a towel. Repeat with the remaining dough.<br> When the skillet starts smoking, gently lift a disk of dough. Place it in the skillet, cook it for about 30 seconds, and then turn it over with your fingers or a spatula for another 30 seconds. Remove the skillet from the flame and, holding the flatbread by its edge, put it directly on the fire. Keep moving it in a circle so that it doesn&#39;t burn, then turn over and repeat. The bread should be blistered and dark in spots.<br> Remove the flatbread and cover it with a towel or aluminum foil to keep it from forming a crust. (Dot it with butter and fold it in half if you like.) Repeat with the remaining disks of dough.<br> Serve warm. These can be made in advance and stored in a resealable plastic container on the counter for a couple of days.

In a large bowl, cream the butter, almond paste and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the softened yeast, lemon peel, vanilla, salt, eggs, egg yolk, milk, and 3 cups flour to the creamed mixture. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Put the dough into an oiled bowl. Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise about 1 1/2 hours. Due to the almond paste, this recipe doesn&#39;t double in size. Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half. Shape each half into a smooth ball. Cover and let rest 5 minutes. Shape one ball of dough into a half oval 12 inches wide and four inches high at the center. Place in the center of a parchment-lined baking sheet. Flatten the center slightly so that when the next piece of dough is laid across it, it won&#39;t be so thick. Shape the other ball of dough into an 8 by 16 by 16-inch triangle Keep the points of the triangle rounded rather than pointed. Lay the triangle, centered, on the flattened part of the half oval. Fold the narrow end over to make the head. Pinch with your fingers to form a beak into the top side of the dough. Fold the other end in the opposite direction to form the tail. Cut 2-inch slits along the bottom edge of the tail and wing tips. Fan them out as for feathers. Cover with a towel and let rise 45 minutes. Again, due to the almond paste, the dough won&#39;t rise as high as other types of yeast dough; however, it does rise high during baking. 1. About 10 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 2. Just before baking, beat the egg white until frothy. Lightly brush the dove with the beaten egg white and place thinly sliced almonds, overlapping slightly, on the tail and wings to simulate feathers. Use a small bit of an almond to make the dove&#39;s eye (diagram 7). Carefully brush the almond \\feathers\\ with the remaining beaten egg white then sprinkle the dove with granulated sugar. 3. Bake for 20 minutes. Cover the bread loosely with foil with the shiny side up. Continue to bake for 10 more minutes, or until the internal temperature of the loaf reaches 190 degrees. 4. Immediately remove dove from baking sheet and cool on a rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 53369,&quot;Crawfish Etouffee 4 cups vegetable oil 4 pounds chopped crawfish tail meat plus 2 pounds whole crawfish tails<br> 8 ounces (2 sticks) salted butter<br> 2 ounces paprika<br> 10 quarts seafood stock<br> 4 ounces Creole seasoning<br> 4 cups all-purpose flour<br> 2 brown onions, minced 2 green bell peppers, minced<br> 1 red bell pepper, minced 1/2 bunch celery, minced 6 ounces Louisiana hot sauce<br> 4 ounces Worcestershire sauce<br> 2 ounces black pepper<br> 2 ounces dried parsley flakes<br> 2 ounces granulated garlic<br> 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper<br> 1 tablespoon dried basil 1 teaspoon ground bay leaves<br> One 50-ounce can tomato soup<br> 1 1/2 cans cream of mushroom soup<br> Instructions: In a large oval roasting pan or large pot, heat the vegetable oil on medium-high heat for 5 minutes.

Add 2 tablespoons of room temperature butter and beat with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until combined and the butter is no longer visible. Add the milk. Mix on low speed until the dough comes together, then switch to the dough hook. Knead on medium-high until the dough comes together into a smooth but still slightly loose ball, about 5 minutes. Remove from the mixer, then pat into a rectangle and wrap in plastic wrap. Let rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour. When the dough is almost done resting, make a rectangle of butter! Smush the remaining 2 1/2 sticks butter together into a rustic rectangle and dust all over with flour. Place it between two pieces of parchment paper (or butter wrappers) and press or roll it into a 6-by-8-inch rectangle. Roll the dough on a floured work surface to about 10 by 20 inches. Lay the butter rectangle in the center and fold one end over the butter. Fold the second end over the top, like folding a letter. This is the first turn. Wrap in plastic and chill 30 minutes. For the chocolate croissants: Unwrap the dough and set one straight edge closest to you. Roll to about 10 by 20 inches and fold the short ends in to meet in the center, then fold closed, like a book. (This is the second turn.) Wrap and chill 30 minutes, then complete another book turn. Wrap and chill for 30 minutes after the third turn. Complete one more book turn. Wrap and chill at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Beat the egg. Unwrap the dough and cut in half. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with half of the dough at a time, roll into a 10-by-14-inch rectangle and trim the edges with a pizza wheel to even it out. Cut into 6 rectangles by cutting it in half vertically, and then in thirds horizontally. Brush the rectangles with the egg wash. Lay a 1/2-ounce chocolate bar in the center of each rectangle, arranging it parallel to the short ends of the rectangle. Fold one end over the chocolate, and then the other end over that, again like a letter. Place seam-side down on one of the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with the remaining dough and chocolate. Spray a piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray and cover the croissants loosely. Let rise at room temperature until light, puffy and increased in size by about half, about 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush the croissants generously with the egg wash. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom halfway through, until puffed and deep golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool slightly on a rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53385,&quot;Bourbon Peppercorn Glaze 1/4 cup water 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 teaspoons orange juice 1/2 teaspoon Sriracha hot chili sauce 1/8 teaspoon fish sauce (optional) 1/2 cup brown sugar, firmly packed 2-3 large cloves garlic, crushed 3 tablespoons bourbon 1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper 1 tablespoon cornstarch Instructions: Combine the first 10 ingredients in a small sauce pan.

Add the onions and 1 tablespoon butter, and cook over medium heat until the onions are tender. Add the red wine and chicken liver and cook over medium-low heat until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and set aside. In a blender or food processor, mix the liver mixture with the shredded chicken, remaining 1 tablespoons butter, Parmesan, chicken stock and marsala until creamy. Season with salt and pepper. Place 1 teaspoon of the filling into each wonton skin, and seal by brushing a little water along the wonton edges and folding diagonally (into a triangle) and gently pinching the wonton skin closed. Work quickly and keep the wontons covered with a damp paper towel to keep from drying out. Place in the freezer until ready to cook so the raviolis will firm up. For the marsala reduction: Heat the marsala, red wine and brown sugar over medium-high heat and let the sauce reduce until it becomes syrupy. Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil.

Coat an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet or jelly roll pan with cooking spray; line the bottom with parchment paper and spray the parchment. Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with a mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, 3 minutes. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup granulated sugar. Increase the speed to medium high; beat until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar, the oil, milk, vanilla and espresso powder in a large bowl. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl; whisk into the yolk mixture until smooth. Stir one-third of the egg whites into the batter with a rubber spatula, then gently fold in the remaining whites in two batches. Spread the batter in the prepared pan; bake until the cake springs back when gently pressed, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Generously sift cocoa powder over the top of the warm cake and loosen the edges with a knife; lay a clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) over the cake. Place another baking sheet over the towel and flip the cake with the baking sheets to invert it onto the towel. Remove the top baking sheet and parchment, then dust the cake with cocoa powder. Starting at a short end, roll up the cake and the towel together into a spiral. Transfer seam-side down to a rack and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the filling: Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until creamy, 2 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups marshmallow cream and the vanilla; increase the speed to medium high and beat until fluffy, 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low. Beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar, then the milk, then increase the speed to medium and beat until thick and spreadable. Gently unroll the cake. Spread the filling over the cake about 1/4 inch from the edges; reroll (without the towel). Trim the ends with a serrated knife, then transfer to a rack set on a baking sheet. Make the glaze: Microwave the chocolate with the heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring every 30 seconds, until smooth. Pour over the cake; spread to coat. Transfer to a platter and refrigerate 15 minutes. Microwave the remaining 1/4 cup marshmallow cream in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring every 5 seconds, until loose.

Line a cupcake pan with paper liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. In a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape in the seeds of the vanilla bean and mix to combine. Add the eggs one a time, beating well in between each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl. Turn the speed to medium and add half of the flour mixture, the milk and then the remainder of the flour mixture, beating in between additions. Do not overmix. Scoop the batter into the lined cupcake pan, using an ice-cream scoop and filling each cup about two-thirds of the way. Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until the cupcakes are golden and a tester inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove the pan to a rack, cool 5 minutes, and then remove the cupcakes to the rack to cool completely. For the buttercream frosting: Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into a medium bowl. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until smooth and light, about 1 minute. Add 5 1/2 cups of the confectioners&#39; sugar and mix on low to combine. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. (Add up to 1/2 cup more confectioners&#39; sugar, depending on how stiff you want the frosting.) For the decoration: Use a cupcake corer to hollow out the center of each cupcake saving the tops, then fill with a candy ball. Slice the top off of the plug you removed from the cupcake and place back in the hole to seal in the candy ball. Use a couple of drops of purple food coloring to dye three-quarters of your frosting. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip with the frosting. Dye the remaining frosting with green food coloring and add to a small pastry bag or resealable plastic bag with just a tiny bit of the tip snipped off.

Add about a third of the chilled butter cubes and process until the butter is absorbed. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the butter is the size of peas. Pulse in the vinegar. Then add the ice water, pulsing quickly a few times to combine. Squeeze some dough between your fingers--it should just hold its shape without feeling wet. If it is crumbly, add more ice water a tablespoon at a time. (Pulse quickly, do not overwork or the dough will be tough.0 Wrap the dough loosely in a large piece of plastic wrap, then firmly press and flatten the dough into a thin round. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Lightly flour a work surface, then roll the dough into an 11- to 12-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Center the dough in a 9-inch pie plate, with an even overhang all around. Fold the edges and flute or crimp. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Press a piece of foil over the chilled crust, then fill with pie weights, raw beans or rice. Bake to set the crust, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and bake until the crust is light brown, 5 to 10 minutes more. Let cool slightly before adding the filling. Sprinkle the shallots evenly into the crust. Combine the artichoke hearts with the feta and sprinkle it in an even layer over the shallots. Whisk together the half-and-half, parsley, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Pour the custard over the filling. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until set, 35 to 50 minutes.

Let sit until it foams. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the yeast mixture with the flour and salt. Mix until a smooth dough forms. The dough should be soft, not sticky (if it&#39;s sticky add more flour). Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, lay it on a flat surface and cover with a damp towel. Let the dough rest like this for at least 1 hour. After 1 hour, divide the dough into 2 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a flat surface. Cover each ball with a small amount of olive oil, cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for another 30 minutes. Transfer the dough to a flat surface covered with flour. Stretch each of the dough balls into a 12-inch round pizza crust. For the sauce: In a large saucepan, combine the olive oil and garlic. Heat on medium heat until the garlic is fragrant. Add the crushed tomatoes, basil, crushed red pepper and salt. Stir together and let simmer for at least 30 minutes. Take the sauce off the stove and let cool completely. Once the sauce is cool, add all the dried ground peppers. (Yes, that is a lot of heat!!) For the topping: Preheat a pizza stone in the oven to 450 degrees F. Cover each pizza crust with 1/2 cup of sauce. Top each pizza with 4 ounces mozzarella. Cover the cheese with fresh sliced habanero and jalapeno peppers to taste. For more intense heat, pile them on!

Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for 1 hour. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours. Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour 1 ounce of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and remove to the cutting board. Lay them out flat so they can cool. Continue until all batter is gone. After they have cooled you can stack them and store in sealable plastic bags in the refrigerator for several days or in the freezer for up to two months. When using frozen crepes, thaw on a rack before gently peeling apart. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53448,&quot;The Proper Scrambled Eggs 3 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes and frozen<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 1 tablespoon sour cream<br> 1 tablespoon chopped chives, optional<br> Instructions: Beat the eggs with the egg yolk in a bowl until smooth and evenly yellow. Put the beaten eggs in a small saucepot with the butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring the entire time with a spatula. The eggs should begin to thicken; transferring them on and off the heat will allow you to control the temperature, creating soft creamy eggs. When the eggs start to become thick and soupy, season with salt and pepper. Return to the heat and cook until desired doneness is achieved; if you&#39;d like them cooked more, simply apply more heat. Mix in the sour cream and garnish with chives if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53449,&quot;Roasted Vegetable Chili with Cornbread Biscuits 1 head cauliflower, cut into small florets 1 poblano cl pepper, seeded and diced 4 scallions, roughly chopped, plus more for topping 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon chili powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin Kosher salt 3/4 cup cornmeal 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed 2/3 cup cold buttermilk 2/3 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese 1 15-ounce can black beans, undrained 1 8-ounce can tomato sauce 1 1/4 cups frozen fire-roasted corn, thawed 1 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth Instructions: Preheat the broiler.

Dig in! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53507,&quot;Norwegian Meatballs (Viking Soul Food Style) 2 medium yellow onions 1/2 stick butter 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 ounce rye bread (if you can get Scandinavian rye, even better!)<br> 1 tablespoon heavy cream<br> 1 tablespoon whole milk<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons allspice berries<br> 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns<br> 4 eggs, preferably organic 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 pound ground beef<br> 1 pound ground pork<br> 1 medium head purple cabbage 1/2 cup kosher salt<br> 1/2 cup white cane sugar<br> 1 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 1 cup red wine vinegar<br> 1 tablespoon ground caraway seed<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 4 ounces all-purpose flour<br> 1 quart whole milk<br> 3/4 cup Madeira wine<br> 1/2 cup white wine<br> 2 tablespoons salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 13 ounces Gjetost cheese (pronounced \\yet-ohst; it&#39;s a Norwegian caramelized goat cheese)<br> 6 lefse (we make ours in-house but for convenience they can be store-bought, or you can use tortillas) 3 cups shredded green cabbage Instructions: For the Norwegian meatballs: Small dice the yellow onions, or grate on a cheese grater on the largest holes. Warning: The cheese grater method is effective, but you&#39;ll likely have a tearful experience! Combine butter, 1 teaspoon salt and the grated onions in a small pot. Cook on medium-low until onions are browned and smelling sweet, about 1 hour. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Chop up rye bread by hand or in a food processor until crumbly, but don&#39;t obliterate it. Add heavy cream, whole milk, and rye breadcrumbs to a pot. Heat gently on low until breadcrumbs have absorbed dairy and are softened and aromatic, then remove from the heat. Grind allspice berries and black peppercorns together in a spice grinder until fine. Combine rye breadcrumbs, eggs, flour, caramelized onions, remaining teaspoon salt and the spices in a large mixing bowl. Mix together until a smooth paste forms, then incorporate the beef and pork, squeezing with your fingers to make sure the starchy ingredients break up into the meat. At the same time, make sure not to overwork the mixture, as that would yield tough meatballs. Let stand at least 2 to 3 hours in the fridge, then roll into balls. We roll our meatballs to 1 1/2-ounces each, but all you need to do is make sure your meatballs are consistently-sized, so they cook at the same rate when they hit the oven. Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F, preferably on convection. Roast meatballs until well-browned on the outside, about 10 minutes in a convection oven or 12 minutes in a conventional oven. For the surkal: Thinly slice cabbage (1/4-inch thick) with a knife or mandoline. Avoid cutting into the core; you just want the purple leaves. Toss cabbage and salt together in a large bowl and allow to sit. Combine white sugar, cider vinegar, red wine vinegar, ground caraway seed, bay leaf and 3 cups water in a large pot, then bring to a boil. Pour over cabbage and cover, then refrigerate for about 1 day. This will help lessen the harshness of the vinegars and soften the cabbage. After 24 to 36 hours, remove bay leaf and stir cabbage mixture to make sure caraway is well-distributed. Refrigerate until ready to eat. For the Gjetost cheese sauce: Melt the butter in a pot on medium heat and brown slightly. Add the flour and whisk well. Allow the roux to brown on medium-low heat until it reaches a rich golden brown color; it should smell nutty. This takes 20 to 30 minutes. Add the milk gradually in increments, whisking vigorously as you go. If you happen to have an immersion blender, run it through and get rid of any lumps. Reduce heat to low and watch carefully, whisking often and making sure the bottom doesn&#39;t burn. You want to see bubbles popping up to the surface every few seconds. Add the Madeira, white wine, salt and nutmeg. Cook until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 40 minutes, then grate the Gjetost cheese into the pot. Allow the sauce to cook gently and continue to thicken for about 1 1/2 hours. Be sure to whisk the bottom occasionally to get up any browned bits. If you have one, get your immersion blender in there and run it through until smooth and velvety. When finished, sauce should be the consistency of thick gravy and taste of toasty bread and goat cheese. Allow to cool for a half hour or so, then place in the fridge if you aren&#39;t going to use it right away. For the meatball lefse wrap: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Halve 2 of the meatballs and roast until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Toast a piece of lefse in a nonstick pan or better yet, on a lefse griddle, on both sides. Remove toasted lefse to a cutting board. Begin layering: 1/2 cup shredded green cabbage, 1/2 cup surkal/pickled cabbage, the heated meatballs and finally about 1/3 cup warm Gjetost cheese sauce. Roll it tightly like a burrito. Cut in half if you&#39;re sharing, but you probably won&#39;t want to. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo]&quot; 53508,&quot;Braised Chestnuts 2 tablespoons oil 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup onion, finely chopped 1 cup Port wine Thyme leaves, chopped 2 pounds chestnuts 3 cups chicken stock Salt and pepper Instructions: Heat a large heavy saucepan.

Add dried mushrooms and let soak for 20 minutes, then drain, reserving the liquid. Pour liquid through a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth or paper towels to catch any grit. Add mushroom liquid back to warm stock. Keep stock heated over medium heat. Pat soaked mushrooms dry and saute in a large skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Heat remaining olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until softened. Add rice and cook, stirring, until the rice becomes translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add vermouth and stir until absorbed by rice. Add warm mushroom stock to rice, 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly. All stock must be fully absorbed before the next cup of stock is added. After about 20 minutes, the rice should be tender but not mushy, it should have a creamy texture. Add more stock if needed. Fold in Sauteed mushrooms, Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper. Let stand for a minute before serving. Sprinkle with Parmesan, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 53510,&quot;Duck Liver \\Truffles<br> 12 ounces good quality purchased duck liver mousse or fine textured pate 1 tablespoon Ruby port 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 cups miniature croutons, recipe follows 3 cups bread (1 day old, preferably thin sliced white bread, with the crust removed) 3 tablespoons butter, melted 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves 1/2 teaspoon salt Instructions: Place mousse in a bowl and drizzle port over the mousse.

Cook the onion, garlic, and jalapeno for 3 minutes, or until the onions have become translucent. Add the huitlacoche, and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the chopped epazote, and season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the crepes and other ingredients in assembly-line fashion: crepes, filling, cheese, and crema. Spread 1 tablespoon of sour cream on an open crepe, sprinkle a heaping tablespoon of the huitlacoche filling, cover with a sprinkle of cheese, and roll the crepe into a tube. Repeat process with the remaining ingredients. Spread a thin layer of sour cream on the bottom of an oblong 8 by 12-inch glass baking dish. Place the rolled crepes, seam side down, close, but not over lapping, in the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and crema. Bake in the oven until the cheese is melted and crepes are heated through, about 30 minutes. Drizzle with a little truffle oil. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the milk, eggs, and melted butter. Increase speed and whip for 1 minute. In another bowl, sift the dry ingredients together, and slowly begin to add the dry ingredients to milk mixture. When well mixed, strain the batter into a spouted measuring cup. In a non-stick pan, spray a little non-stick spray or coat lightly with butter and pour in about 1/4 cup of batter. Immediately start tilting pan, covering the bottom of the pan with batter. Cook until the crepe turns pale brown, then flip with a spatula, cook for 20 seconds more, and remove from the pan onto a paper towel to cool. Repeat the process with the remaining batter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 53515,&quot;Chocolate Cheesecake-Stuffed French Toast 1 Pullman loaf, crust removed 1/2 cup cream cheese, at room temperature<br> 1/4 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread<br> 3 eggs, beaten<br> 1 cup whole milk<br> 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 6 ounces raspberries, fresh or frozen 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br> 1/4 cup orange juice (1 orange)<br> Powdered sugar, for dusting<br> Instructions: For the French toast: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Make an incision in the center of the Pullman loaf, as if you were slicing the loaf in half but taking care not to cut through the ends or the back side of the loaf. Stick your hand inside the incision and press lightly on the bread to make a pocket for stuffing. In a small bowl, mix together the cream cheese and chocolate-hazelnut spread with a rubber spatula until smooth. Spoon the mixture into a resealable plastic bag; snip off a corner from the bag. Pipe the mixture into the pocket and close the seam slightly around it. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla and salt. Soak the stuffed loaf in the egg mixture, rotating it, until all the custard is absorbed, about 12 minutes. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large oven-safe nonstick skillet. Gently remove the French toast from the custard pan and place in the hot skillet; cook until golden brown on all sides except the side with the pocket, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the skillet to oven and bake until firm and an inserted metal skewer comes out dry, about 15 minutes. For the raspberry compote: Meanwhile, place the raspberries, granulated sugar and orange juice in a small bowl. Partially mash the fruit with the back of a fork. Set aside to macerate. Remove the French toast from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before cutting into slices.

Crush the berries and set the bowl over a pot of simmering water, double-boiler-fashion. Cook very gently until the raspberries begin to dissolve, about 15 minutes. Pour the mixture into a jelly bag (or a large sieve lined with two layers of cheesecloth) set over a deep bowl. Let the mixture drip, gently stirring the pulp now and then but not pressing on it, until it seems that all of the liquid has been expelled, 1 to 2 hours. Measure the juice, pour it into a wide-bottomed saucepan and then measure out an equal volume of sugar (for example, for 1 1/2 cups of juice, you&#39;d need 1 /?2 cups of sugar). Add the sugar to the juice and set the pan over medium-high heat. Bring the syrup to a rolling boil (watch to make sure it doesn&#39;t boil over), boil for 30 seconds and then remove from the heat. Let it settle for a minute, and then carefully skim off the foam. Bring to a rolling boil again and then immediately remove from the heat. Let it settle, and skim it again. Measure out 1/2 cup of the syrup for use in the baked rhubarb and set aside; refrigerate the rest of the syrup for another use. For the baked rhubarb: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Trim and discard the ends of the rhubarb; cut the stalks into 3/4-inch-thick slices on a deep diagonal, keeping them neatly stacked together. Transfer the slices to a 9-by-13-inch baking pan, making rows of cut rhubarb, until you have filled the pan. Warm the reserved raspberry syrup in a microwave oven (or a small saucepan) until hot. Add the sugar to the warm syrup and stir to dissolve. If using the vanilla bean, slice it lengthwise, scrape out the pulp and throw the pulp into the syrup and the pods in with the rhubarb. If using vanilla extract, add it to the syrup. Pour the raspberry syrup evenly over the rhubarb and bake, uncovered, until the rhubarb is soft but not mushy, 15 to 18 minutes. Halfway through baking, remove the pan from the oven, and gently tilt the pan and spoon the syrup over the rhubarb to glaze it. Allow the baked rhubarb to cool in the pan, glazing it once more with the syrup as it cools. Refrigerate the rhubarb in the pan. (The rhubarb will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, and gets firmer and brighter as it sits.) Serve over vanilla ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53520,&quot;Thai Chicken with Carrot-Ginger Salad 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 3 garlic cloves; 2 chopped, 1 crushed 4 teaspoons Thai green curry paste (available in the international aisle) 4 teaspoons finely chopped peeled ginger Grated zest and juice of 3 limes<br> 4 skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts (2 to 2 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 pound carrots 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Remove the bread from the pans and cool on a wire rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 53528,&quot;Pressed Picnic Sandwich with Roasted Red Pepper and Pepperoncini Spread 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/3 cup roasted red peppers, finely chopped 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 to 3 pepperoncini, finely chopped 1 clove garlic, grated Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 1(12 to 14-inch) loaf ciabatta bread, sliced in half lengthwise 5 ounces herbed goat cheese 1/4 pound prosciutto, thinly sliced 1/4 pound salami, thinly sliced 1 cup marinated artichoke hearts, drained and sliced 2 cup loosely packed arugula Balsamic vinegar, as needed Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Instructions: For the spread: Combine the mayonnaise, roasted red peppers, lemon juice, pepperoncini and garlic in a small mixing bowl and whisk until combined. Season the spread with salt and pepper and set aside. For the sandwich: Scoop out the center of each bread half, creating a hollow space for all the ingredients. Spread the herbed goat cheese on both sides of the bread and then add the roasted red pepper and pepperoncini spread. On the bottom half of the bread, lay the slices of prosciutto, salami and top with the artichokes. Top with the arugula, drizzle with balsamic vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Place the top half of the bread on top and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Place the sandwich on a baking sheet and top with another baking sheet. Place a heavy pan (like cast iron) on the top baking sheet and store in the refrigerator, for at least 4 hours and up to overnight to allow the flavors to marry together. (If you can&#39;t fit 2 sheet trays in your refrigerator, just use the heaviest pan you have.)

Add the water, honey and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil to a 2-cup measuring cup. Whisk to combine. Add the water mixture to the mixer bowl and use a rubber spatula to incorporate the ingredients slightly. Attach the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix on low speed until the mixture forms into a ball and no loose flour is left at the base of the bowl, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the mixer up to medium speed and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the remaining olive oil into a 18-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Turn the dough out onto the baking sheet. Turn it once to coat all the sides of the dough in the olive oil. Cover the pan with an inverted baking sheet of the same size and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. After 2 hours, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Remove the top baking sheet and, using the tips of your fingers, delicately stretch the dough until it almost reaches the edges of the pan. Cover again with the rimmed baking sheet and let the dough rest while you make the Sauce (see recipe below). Uncover the dough and delicately stretch the dough to reach all the edges of the pan again. If the dough springs back too much, let the dough sit for another 5 to 10 minutes before trying to stretch it further. Once the dough is stretched to fit the pan, top it with the sauce. Cover the sauce completely with the pepperoni, then top the pepperoni with the sliced cheese. Transfer the pizza to the oven and bake until the cheese is lightly browned in spots and the crust is golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven and use a large spatula to transfer it to a cutting board. Top with dried oregano, red pepper flakes and Parmesan. Cut into 16 squares and serve immediately. Add the tomatoes, olive oil, salt, sugar and garlic to a mixing bowl. Whisk to combine and set aside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 53534,&quot;Chuck&#39;s Ricotta Cheese Risotto 4 cups chicken stock 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 shallots, finely chopped 1 leek, finely chopped 2 cups Arborio rice 1/4 cup butter 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 4 cups spinach 2 cups green peas Sea salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 cups shiitake mushrooms 3 cups rock shrimp or any other shrimp you prefer 2 tablespoons butter Sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped 1 handful chive, finely chopped 1 cup ricotta cheese Instructions: For the risotto: In a saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer over medium-low heat. In a large saucepan, cook the shallots and leek in 1 tablespoon oil over medium-low heat, stirring, until softened, for about 5 minutes. Add the rice, stirring until each grain is coated with oil. Add about 3/4 cup of the simmering stock and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the stock is absorbed. Continue adding the stock, 3/4 cup at a time, still stirring constantly and letting each batch be absorbed before adding the next. Reduce the heat to moderate if necessary to keep the risotto at a simmer. Continue adding the stock in the same manner until the rice is tender and creamy looking but still al dente, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, spinach, and green peas. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well. Remove from heat and keep warm. For the sauteed rock shrimp and mushrooms: In a heavy-bottom frying pan, heat the oil and saute the mushrooms for 3 minutes. Add the shrimp and continue sauteing for 3 to 4 minutes. Melt in the butter, season with salt and pepper and set aside. Serve the risotto with the sauteed rock shrimp and mushrooms. Garnish with parsley, chive and a few dollops of ricotta cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 53535,&quot;Apple Cider Brined Chicken 3 tablespoons kosher salt, divided 3 tablespoons pepper, divided 2 cups apple cider vinegar 1 cup apple juice 2 medium-size whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces 4 cups all-purpose flour 4 cups vegetable oil Instructions: Mix 2 tablespoons salt, 2 tablespoons pepper, 4 cups water, vinegar, and apple juice in a 2 gallon container.

Slice the shallots thinly, and separate into rings. Dust with rice flour, and then drop into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove to a paper towel to drain. Season with salt and pepper. For the bearnaise sauce: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine half of the tarragon with the shallots, vinegar and wine. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. Blend the egg yolks and 1/4 cup of the bearnaise reduction together in a blender. With the blender running, add one-third of the melted butter in a slow, steady stream. Once the butter emulsifies, turn the blender speed up to high and add the remaining butter. Add the remaining half of the tarragon, season with salt and pepper, and give the sauce one more buzz. Set aside in a warm spot to hold. For the deviled eggs: To make perfect hard-boiled eggs, place the eggs in a saucepan of cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Once the water boils, immediately turn off the heat and let sit for exactly 14 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of cold water, let cool, and then peel. Slice the eggs in half, and then slice a sliver off the bottom so they will stand erect on the plate. Remove the yolks to a food processor. Season a bowl of cold water very generously with salt, and stir until dissolved. Rinse the egg whites in the salt water to remove any remaining yolk--this way, you season the eggs at the same time. To the yolks in the food processor, add 1/4 cup of the bearnaise sauce and the creme fraiche, mayonnaise, mustard and lemon juice. Process until completely smooth--you may have to add a few drops of water to loosen. Season with salt. Transfer the egg yolk mixture to a piping bag fitted with a large circle tip, and pipe the filling into the egg whites. Top with caviar, fried shallots and tarragon tips. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Cava]</p><p>&quot; 53546,&quot;Edible Chocolate Bowl 1 cup chopped white chocolate or melting candy wafers Instructions: Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, stirring occasionally. Continue heating the chocolate for 10 seconds at a time until completely melted; be careful not to burn the chocolate. Stir until smooth. Let it cool slightly; the heat can pop the balloons. Blow up 2 latex balloons to 4 to 6 inches in diameter and tie. Carefully dip each balloon in the chocolate. Rotate and slightly tilt each balloon, allowing the chocolate to go up the sides. Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread the chocolate up the sides. Cool the balloons in the refrigerator tie-side down in a glass bowl or muffin tin for 5 minutes to set. Carefully snip the ties off with scissors to remove the balloons. The balloons should separate from the chocolate. If the balloons are still stuck to the chocolate, carefully peel off. If you&#39;d like the bowls to sit flat for serving, add a dollop of melted chocolate, about 1/2 tablespoon, to the center of the bottom of the bowls and place on a piece of parchment paper.

Bring to a boil and cook until a knife slips in easily, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes. Place on a cookie sheet and refrigerate until cool. When they are cool enough to handle, hold 1 between your hands as if you were clapping and press gently with the heel of 1 hand. You want to smash the potato to about a 1/2-inch thickness while keeping it in 1 piece. The skin will split, but the potato should not fall apart. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. You can prepare the potatoes to this point several hours ahead. Pour 1/2-inch of peanut oil in the large skillet and heat over moderately high heat. Combine the parsley, garlic, and lemon zest in a serving bowl and set aside. When the oil begins to smoke, carefully put the smashed potatoes in the oil and cook on both sides until crisp and well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over moderately high heat. Add the garlic and saute until lightly browned. With a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to the bowl with the parsley-lemon mixture. When the potatoes are ready, add them to the garlic mixture and toss gently. Serve immediately.

Prepare 2 (9 by 12-inch) rectangular baking dishes by spraying with nonstick oil spray. In a mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix together starter, granulated sugar, vegetable oil, salt, water, yeast and flour. After mixing the dough for about 2 minutes, remove the dough to a bowl sprayed with nonstick oil. Cook&#39;s Note: If the dough mix is too loose, add more flour. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in size. The rising process will take 1 to 4 hours, depending on the altitude and weather at the time and place you are making the buns. When doubled, dump the whole pile of dough onto a well-floured surface and with a rolling pin manipulate the dough to make a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Filling: Melt 2 sticks of butter to where it is creamy and spreadable. Spread the butter onto the dough triangle making sure you spread thoroughly to all corners. Sprinkle brown sugar and then cinnamon over the butter making sure that the whole triangle is covered, corner to corner. Top with chopped pecans and raisins. Roll the dough into a tight roll. Cut with a serrated knife into 2-inch long rolls and place into the baking dishes. Cook&#39;s Note: If using the rectangle baking dish, snuggle the buns together as if they were trying to keep each other very warm. You might want to manipulate the size of the pan to make sure that the buns are very snug in the pan. You do not have to cover the rolls, but you need to let them rise in an oven set at 170 degrees F to proof until you see that they are almost but not quite doubled in size, about 40 to 50 minutes. When you see that they are at that point, turn the oven up to 350 degrees F. Bake for 25 minutes until you see that they are truly golden on the top. Cook&#39;s Note: A good test is when you take them out of the oven and push on the very center of a bun; if it sinks inward easily and feels doughy, they will need 5 to 10 minutes more cooking time. Glaze/Icing: In a mixer beat powdered sugar and half-and-half until smooth and without lumps. Take the buns out of the oven and put them on a wire rack. Immediately glaze them with a pastry brush. After glazing all of the buns, go back over and glaze once again. Cook&#39;s Note: If you desire, you can melt more butter on the top before serving. If warming buns after they are cool, 20 seconds in the microwave revives that incredible hot-out-of-the-oven taste. However, even cold, they are awesome.

Beat the eggs until well combined and light in color, about 5 minutes. Mix the sugar and flour together and gradually add to the eggs using low speed. Add the corn syrup, vanilla and salt and blend well, again using low speed. Fold the nuts in by hand and pour the mixture into the prepared pie crusts. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes and then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for 1 hour longer. The pie will rise up and form cracks on the top, and the filling will be set when baking is complete. Remove pie and let it cool before cutting. Combine the butter, shortening, 2 cups of the cake flour, and 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. Blend together. Stop mixer, scrape the sides and add remaining 2 cups of cake flour and remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour. Blend to combine completely. Mix sugar and salt into 1/4 cup of the water and add it to the flour mixture. Blend briefly and add the remaining water if needed. The dough should not be overworked and should make a solid piece when held in your hand. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured smooth surface and knead it several times. Divide the dough into portions and flatten it. Wrap unused dough in plastic. Roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Re-roll any scraps for a second pie crust. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Prick bottom and sides of pastry with fork. Bake 12 minutes or until light brown.

Add the brown and wild rice and bring to boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until the rice is just tender, 50 to 55 minutes. Drain if necessary. Discard the ginger slices. Set the rice aside. Meanwhile, position the oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a 13- by 9- by 2-inch glass or ceramic baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil; set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the green onions, carrots, onions, garlic, ginger, curry powder, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the golden raisins, tofu and cooked rice mixture. Add the coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1 minute until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Remove from the heat and let cool while preparing the chard leaves. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Using a sharp knife, cut away the thick stems from the center of each leaf; discard the stems. Cut each leaf in half lengthwise. Trim the wide ends from the leaves to make each leaf half about 10 inches long. Using tongs and working with 1 leaf half at a time, dip the leaf half into the pot of boiling salted water for 10 seconds. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Place about 1/3 cup of the rice filling onto the end of one Swiss chard leaf half. Roll up the leaf, enclosing the filling completely. Repeat with the remaining leaf halves and rice filling for a total of 12 rolls. Spread 1 cup of the sauce onto the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place the filled rolls, seam-side down, in a single layer atop the sauce in the dish. Spoon the remaining tomato sauce over the rolls.

Add the shrimp, and pulse until a thick paste forms. Transfer to a medium bowl, and fold in 2/3 of the scallions, the celery, water chestnuts and sesame seeds. (The shrimp paste can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.) Trim the crusts from the bread, and evenly divide the shrimp paste among the slices (about 2 heaping tablespoons each). Spread out into an even layer that completely covers the bread. Make the dipping sauce: Whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sesame oil and 1 teaspoon brown sugar, the lemon juice and a large pinch of salt in a small bowl. Fry the toasts: Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Fill a large, wide skillet with straight sides, with about 1 inch of vegetable oil. Attach a deep-fry thermometer to the skillet, and bring the oil to 375 degrees F over medium heat. Being careful of the hot oil splashing, put 5 to 6 shrimp toasts in the oil shrimp-side down and fry until the shrimp and the edges of the bread are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pieces, and continue to fry until the bottoms are golden brown, about 1 minute more. (Adjust the heat as needed to maintain the temperature.) Transfer the shrimp toasts to the prepared baking sheet, and dab the tops with a paper towel to absorb some of the excess oil. Sprinkle the toasts all over with the remaining scallions and some sesame seeds and salt. Cut each toast into 4 triangles, and serve hot with the dipping sauce on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 53556,&quot;Pork Roast 7 rib, center-cut pork roast 8 cups water 1/4 cup coarse salt 3 tablespoons sugar 3 bay leaves 2 whole cloves 1 cinnamon stick 2 teaspoons black peppercorns 1 clove garlic, smashed Salt and pepper 6 ounces thick sliced bacon 3 tablespoons flour 2 cups pork stock or beef stock Instructions: In a large pot bring water, salt and sugar to a boil.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, then add the sugar and salt, mix with a spatula. Create a well in the center and pour in the oil and the bloomed yeast. Fold together all ingredients until combined. Rub hands with a little vegetable oil and knead the dough thoroughly for about 10 minutes the dough should be smooth and thick. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough proof for 2 1/2 hours. Once risen, punch it down, divide the dough into 13 egg-sized balls, and roll each by hand. Roll each ball with a rolling pin into 7 or 8-inch diameter cakes, about 1/8 of an inch thick. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. For the meat topping: combine meat, tomato paste, salt, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, mint, and allspice in a bowl. In a food processor, pulse onion and fresh garlic until it has a thick-chunky texture, then add to meat mixture. Next add the bell pepper, jalapeno, and parsley to the food processor and pulse just until fine, then add to meat and onion mixture. Lastly, add the tomatoes to the food processor, puree, and then add to meat mixture. Mix well by hand or spatula. Let mixture marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 2 hours. Spread a thin layer of the meat mixture, about 2 ounces, on to each cake and place on a lightly oiled sheet pan. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until meat is cooked through and edges of dough start to brown. To serve, stack the cakes on top of each other in a tower. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice on top, followed by a dollop of plain yogurt, roll up like a wrap and eat. Repeat with remaining cakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 53573,&quot;Whole Roast Chicken with Lemon and Herbs One 4- to 5-pound chicken, giblets and neck removed Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 fresh thyme sprigs 2 cloves garlic 1 large lemon, halved 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 onion, chopped 1 carrot, coarsely chopped 1 stalk celery, coarsely chopped 1 bay leaf, preferably fresh Instructions: Set a rack on the lower middle level of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with the thyme sprigs, garlic, and one lemon half, squeezing the lemon as you insert it to release the juice into the cavity. Rub the butter all over the chicken skin, including undersides, then season once again with salt and pepper.<br> Tie the ends of the drumsticks together with twine. Arrange the chicken breast-up on the rack in a roasting pan. Squeeze the juice of the remaining lemon half over the top of the chicken. (You can toss the lemon half into the roasting pan or discard it.)<br> Place the roasting pan in the oven. After 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F. When the chicken is beginning to brown rapidly, baste with accumulated pan juices.<br> Add the onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf to the roasting pan after 30 minutes. Continue roasting, basting several times, until the juices run clear when pierced at the thickest part of the thigh with a knife or if you tilt the chicken forward the juices that run out of the cavity are clear, an additional 45 to 60 minutes (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours total roasting time). Transfer the chicken to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest in a warm place to allow the juices to redistribute, about 15 minutes. To serve, remove the herbs and the lemon half from the cavity and discard. Reserve the garlic cloves and carve the chicken. Serve the chicken with the vegetables and reserved garlic cloves. (The bay leaf may be left for decoration or discarded.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 53574,&quot;Baklava 1 pound butter, melted, plus more for greasing 8 ounces pistachios, ground 8 ounces walnuts, ground 1 cup graham crackers, ground 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 pound fresh thin phyllo dough 3 cups sugar One 6 to 8-ounce jar honey 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch pan. Mix together the ground nuts, graham crackers and cinnamon in a bowl. Spread a phyllo sheet in the buttered pan and brush on some more butter with a pastry brush. Put down another sheet and repeat this process with 10 sheets, buttering each sheet. Sprinkle 1/4 of the nut mixture on top of the 10th sheet. Layer on 4 more phyllo sheets, buttering each sheet, and top the last sheet with another 1/4 of the nut mixture. Repeat with 2 more layers of 4 phyllo sheets and 1/4 nut mixture, buttering each sheet. Top with 10 more sheets of buttered phyllo, adding lots of butter to the top of last sheet. Before baking, cut into diamond shapes with a sawing action using a sharp knife as phyllo is fragile and will tear easily. Bake on the lower rack of the oven until golden brown, 1 hour. For the syrup: While the baklava is baking, combine the sugar, honey and 1 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and let cook for 10 to 15 minutes, and then add the lemon juice and boil for a few minutes longer. Remove the syrup from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly. Let the baklava cool slightly. Pour the honey mixture on top -- both syrup and baklava should be warm while doing this. Let the baklava and syrup cool thoroughly, uncovered. Let the syrup soak into the baklava for at least 6 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 53575,&quot;Citrus-Savory Caramel Sauce 1 3/4 cups light or dark chicken stock 2/3 cup fresh grapefruit juice 1/2 cup sugar 2 cups heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce Instructions: Combine the stock, grapefruit juice, and sugar in a shallow heavy-bottomed saucepan.

In a large ovenproof skillet heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Season the pork loin all over generously with salt and pepper. Lay the loin, fat side down in the skillet, and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Use tongs to turn the meat, and continue to brown it on all sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a plate and set it aside. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, and herb sprigs to the skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the wine. Return the skillet to a high heat and scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon to loosen up any browned bits. Boil the wine until it is reduced by about half. Add the broth and bring to a boil. Return the loin and any collected juices to the skillet. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the loin until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers between 145 to 150 degrees F., about 40 minutes. (See Cooks Note.) Transfer the pork to a plate, and cover it loosely with foil. Set it aside in a warm spot while you make a sauce. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine mesh strainer into a small saucepan; press down on the vegetables with a wooden spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids. Boil the liquid over high heat until reduced by about a third. Reduce the heat to medium-low, whisk in the mustard, and then the bits of butter to enrich the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm but do not boil. Remove the strings from the roast and then slice the loin. Add any collected juices to the sauce. Arrange the meat on a warm platter and season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over the meat. Serve with the applesauce on the side. Remove the apple&#39;s stems. Coarsely chop the apples with their skin and seeds. Combine the apples, sugar, and lemon juice with 3 tablespoons of water in a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Cover, and lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the apples are completely soft, about 20 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to cook (stir frequently to prevent scorching) until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes more. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Pass the apple mixture through a food mill; discard the peels and seeds. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Put the unsweetened chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted; set aside and let cool. Sift the flour and baking soda into a large bowl; stir in the salt. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a separate large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the cocoa mixture and the melted chocolate; mix until combined. Beat in the flour mixture in two batches, alternating with the milk in two batches, until combined. Beat in the liqueur. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling them three-quarters of the way. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pan, then remove the cupcakes to a rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the ganache: Combine the semisweet chocolate, 1 cup heavy cream and the salt in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water; stir until melted and smooth, about 8 minutes. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and set aside until the ganache is cool and thick (but not hard), about 1 hour. Beat the remaining 1/3 cup heavy cream and the confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with a mixer until soft peaks form. Fold in 1/4 cup of the cooled ganache until smooth. Cut a small hole (about 1/2 inch deep) into the center of each cupcake with a paring knife; remove the cake. Use a small measuring spoon to fill the hole with the chocolate whipped cream. Beat the remaining ganache with a mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. (Be careful not to overbeat or the ganache will become grainy.) Transfer the whipped ganache to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and pipe onto the cupcakes. Top with shaved white chocolate. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 53619,&quot;Warm White Bean and Steak Salad 2 (8 to 9-ounce) New York strip steaks 2 tablespoons olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 cups canned Great Northern or pinto beans, rinsed and drained 1/3 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 garlic cloves, minced 2 tablespoons chopped scallions, white and pale green parts only 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 teaspoon dried oregano Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Steaks: Brush the steaks with olive oil; sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper, to taste.

Add the ground beef and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring with a spoon to keep the beef from clumping. Then add the oregano, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste and cook for another 3 minutes. Transfer the filling to a colander and drain the excess oil, then transfer it to a bowl and stir in the ricotta. Refrigerate until ready to use. For the breading: In a food processor, pulse the panko breadcrumbs to half of their original size; this will allow them to bread the ravioli evenly. Transfer the crumbs to a bowl and mix them well with the Parmesan, parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. For the dough: Slowly sift the all-purpose flour, semolina and 1 teaspoon of the salt into a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil and 1 to 2 tablespoons of water. Form the sifted flour into a mound on a counter and pour half the egg mixture into the center of the mound. Start forming a dough with two fingers while supporting the mound of flour with the other hand, then add the remainder of the egg mixture once the original amount is absorbed. Continue kneading the dough by hand until all the liquid has been absorbed, 5 to 6 minutes, dusting the work surface with flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking. Once the dough is mixed well, roll it into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour. To assemble and fry: Split the rested dough into 2 balls and roll out each ball on a floured work surface to the thickness of a dime (or run them through a pasta machine three times on thickness settings of 8, 5 and finally 2). Score one of the sheets of rolled dough with a ravioli pin and fill each scored pocket with 1 teaspoon of the filling. Brush the edges of the dough with egg wash, lay the second sheet of rolled pasta on top and then press and seal the individual ravioli with your fingers, ensuring that no air is trapped inside. Cut and portion out the individual pieces. In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees F. Dredge the ravioli in the flour, followed by the egg wash, and finally the breading. Working in batches, fry the ravioli for 3 minutes, flipping them once during the process. Drain on paper towels, then serve with marinara sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 53646,&quot;Pecan Dusted Puff Pastry Caramelized Pear Napoleons 1/2 cup pecans 1 tablespoon melted butter 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 sheet store bought puff pastry, thawed (recommended: Pillsbury) 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 1 1/2 pounds Bosc pears, cut into 1/2-inch slices (about 6 large or 8 small) 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat 400 degrees F.

Combine the purple gelatin and 2 cups boiling water in a medium bowl; stir until dissolved. Pour into one of the prepared pans. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Repeat to make pans of red and pink gelatin. (You can make these in batches if you don?t have three pans.) When all three colors are set, make the white gelatin: Sprinkle the unflavored gelatin over the cold water in a large bowl; let stand 1 minute. Add the boiling water and condensed milk and stir until dissolved. Let cool to room temperature, at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the crust: Coat an 8-inch round cake pan with cooking spray, then line with plastic wrap, leaving an overhang; coat with more cooking spray. Pulse the chocolate cookies in a food processor until finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse until combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan and freeze until firm, about 10 minutes. Generously coat two more 8-inch round cake pans with cooking spray; set aside. Loosen the edges of the purple gelatin with a knife and turn out onto a cutting board. Cut into 1/2- to 3/4-inch cubes and layer over the chocolate cookie crust. Cut the red and pink gelatin into cubes and layer each one in the remaining two pans. Divide the cooled white gelatin mixture among the three pans, pouring it over the cubes (about 2 cups per pan). Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours. Make the whipped cream: Beat the heavy cream and confectioners&#39; sugar in a large bowl with a mixer until soft peaks form; set aside. Using the plastic wrap to help you, lift the purple gelatin cake out of the pan. Discard the plastic wrap and transfer the cake to a platter. Spread with a thin layer of whipped cream. Loosen the edges of the red gelatin cake with a knife and turn out of the pan; place on top of the purple cake and spread with more whipped cream. Remove the pink gelatin cake from the pan and place on top of the red cake.

You can candy your own or buy it in the store. If the one you buy is hard, rehydrate it in some sugar syrup. Place the almond paste, candied orange, apricot puree, honey and Grand Marnier to the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with a paddle and mix until combined (you can also knead together by hand). You may need to adjust the amount of Grand Marnier depending on the texture of the paste. Roll out the almond paste mixture to 3/8-inch thick layer. I used some 3/8-inch thick rulers as guides so my almond paste would be rolled perfectly flat. You could use 2 wooden spoons. Let this sit overnight uncovered Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/16-inch thick layer of Royal Icing on top of the rolled almond paste. Place this in the freezer until the Royal Icing sets, about 30 minutes, uncovered. Use a sharp chef&#39;s knife coated with vegetable cooking spray to cut the Caillison d&#39;Aix into diamond shapes. These are most often served after dessert. To make royal icing: Combine the egg white and powdered sugar in a medium-size mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium speed until opaque and shiny, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and continue whipping until completely incorporated, about 3 minutes. The lemon juice whitens the royal icing. The royal icing should be light, fluffy, and slightly stiff. You may need to adjust the consistency by adding more egg whites if the icing is too dry or more powdered sugar if it is too wet. Place the royal icing in a small piping bag or paper cornet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 53653,&quot;Black Pepper Crusted Filet Mignon with Goat Cheese and Roasted Red Pepper-Ancho Salsa 2 ancho chiles 3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons pine nuts 2 teaspoons honey 2 grilled red bell peppers, cut into 1/4-inch thick strips 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 4 (8-ounce) filet mignon 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 teaspoon kosher salt 4 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper 8 ounces fresh goat cheese, cut into 4 slices Cilantro leaves, for garnish Roasted Red Pepper and Ancho Salsa: Instructions: Place the ancho chiles in a medium bowl, cover with boiling water and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Remove the chiles from the soaking liquid, stem and coarsely chop, and combine in a blender with the garlic, pine nuts, honey and 1/4 cup of the soaking liquid. Blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and stir in the bell pepper strips, vinegar, cilantro, salt and pepper. Cover and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours before serving. Black Pepper Crusted Filet Mignon with Goat Cheese: Heat your grill to high. Brush the filets with the oil and season both sides of each filet with the salt and 1 side of each filet with the black pepper. Place the steaks on the grill, pepper side down and grill until lightly charred and crusty, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the steaks over, and grill for 2 to 3 minutes longer for medium-rare. Turn the steaks, once more so that the pepper side is facing up and top each filet with a slice of the cheese. Close the cover and grill until the cheese begins to melt slightly, about 1 minute.

Score the skin of the tomatoes and boil them until the tomato skin can be easily removed and the tomatoes are tender, about 30 seconds. Peel and chop the tomatoes and set aside. In a large pot, slowly saute minced garlic and olive oil over low heat. Add the onion and the stewed tomatoes. Add the carrots, fennel, and chicken stock to the pot and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cook until the carrots and fennel are tender, about 10 minutes. In a large pan, heat a little olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the monkfish and sea scallops with salt and pepper and sear the fish in the pan, about 30 seconds per side. Once the fish has been seared, add it to the stew. Season the catfish fillets with salt and pepper, and then lightly dredge them in flour. Pan-sear the catfish in olive oil until both sides of the fish have browned. Using the wine, deglaze the pan and heat until a sauce forms. Add the sauce to the stew. In another medium sized pot, heat the mussels over low heat until they open, in order to extract some of the water. Discard any unopened mussels. To serve, begin with 2 slices of garlic bread on the plate, and top with 1 of the pan-seared catfish fillets. Ladle some of the seafood stew on top of the catfish and the bread and garnish the plate with the mussels and freshly chopped parsley. Slice the bread into 1/2-inch pieces.

Fill a large bowl with warm water and dip 1 whole sheet of rice paper in the water until it softens then lay flat on a plate. Dip a half sheet of rice paper in the water and lay it vertically in the middle of the round sheet. This will strengthen the roll, preventing the filling from breaking through. In the middle of the rice paper, place 3 pieces of prawn in a horizontal line approximately 1 1/2-inches from the top. Below the prawns add some perilla leaves, pork, lettuce, mint, and vermicelli. To form the roll, first fold the sides into the center over the filling, then fold the bottom of the rice paper up and over. Roll from bottom to top to form a tight roll, and just before you complete the roll add 2 pieces of garlic chives so that they stick out at one end. Serve 2 rolls per person with dipping fish sauce. To make the dipping fish sauce: Combine the fish sauce, vinegar, sugar, and water in a saucepan and place on medium heat.

Strain through a fine strainer into a bowl or glass jar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 53661,&quot;Endless Summer Stromboli 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 (1/4-ounce) packet fresh fast-acting yeast 1 1/2 cups warm water, between 100 and 115 degrees F, as measured with a candy thermometer (any hotter will kill the yeast - an organic leavener, too cool and the yeast won&#39;t be activated) 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus some extra for dough board 1/4 cup cornmeal, for pizza stones 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 cloves garlic, chopped 2 medium onions, chopped 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1 cup (16-ounce can) tomato chunks or chunky tomato sauce 1/2 cup packed fresh basil leaves, chopped 1/2 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced Instructions: Dissolve salt, sugar, and yeast in the warm water and allow the yeast to proof. (\\Proofing\\ the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn&#39;t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes. Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to an hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time. While the dough is rising, prepare the pizza topping. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium high heat in a large sauce pan and saute garlic and onions. Add parsley, salt, tomatoes, and basil. Cook for about 20 minutes to allow flavors to integrate. Mix with an immersion blender, then set aside briefly. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Divide the dough in half and stretch out 2 (14-inch) circles. Transfer them to pizza stones sprinkled with cornmeal. Top with the tomato sauce as you would a pizza topping. Lay an even amount of mozzarella cheese slices on each. Roll up and seal ends. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the dough is nicely browned. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 53662,&quot;Stuffed Chayote Squash 2 Chayote squashes 4 ounces chopped grilled vegetables with tofu 2 ounces each red, green, and yellow pepper, chopped 3 ounces onion, chopped 1 ounce olive oil 4 ounces grated cheese Instructions: Slice chayotes in half.

Marinate in the refrigerator for 5 days. Remove the beef from the marinade. Melt the butter in a large casserole pot and brown the beef on all sides. Pour in the marinade, including the solid ingredients; cover and simmer over low heat, about 2 hours. Remove the beef from the pot and pour the sauce through a fine strainer. Return the beef and liquid to a casserole dish. Melt the lard in a small saucepan; add the flour and cook until brown. Stir in 2 cups of beef cooking liquid to make a smooth sauce. Add the sauce to the beef, mixing it with any remaining cooking liquid in the casserole. Cook over low heat, about 15 minutes. Cut the beef into slices and serve with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 53664,&quot;Creamy Tangerine Dressed Grilled Asparagus 2 pounds medium to small size asparagus, tough ends trimmed Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tangerines, zested and juiced A few small dashes hot sauce 1/4 cup heavy cream 1/2 red onion, sliced 1/2 bunch chopped basil leaves Instructions: Preheat indoor or outdoor grill to medium-high. Pile asparagus onto a baking sheet and drizzle with some extra-virgin olive oil and season with some salt and pepper. Transfer to the grill and cook turning every now and then until the asparagus is well marked and is tender, about 5 minutes, depending on the size of your asparagus. While the asparagus is grilling in a bowl combine the tangerine zest and juice with a little salt, pepper and a small dash of hot sauce. Add the heavy cream and whisk to aerate the cream. Remove the asparagus from the grill, top with sliced onion and basil and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature with the sauce poured over it. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 53665,&quot;Pizza with Caramelized Onions and Crispy Bacon 1 teaspoon olive oil 3 slices bacon (about 2 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch pieces 1 small onion, peeled, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons mascarpone cheese 1/4 cup farmer&#39;s cheese Freshly grated nutmeg Freshly ground black pepper 6 ounces Pizza Dough, recipe follows 1/2 cup grated mozzarella 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves 1 package active dry or fresh yeast 1 teaspoon honey 1 cup warm water, 105 to 115 degrees F 3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing Instructions: Place a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. In a medium size saute pan, add olive oil and heat over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the bacon and cook until the bacon is very crispy and all of the fat is rendered. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the pan and discard. Place the pan over high heat. Add the onions to the hot bacon fat and cook until the onions are well browned, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. In a small bowl, combine the mascarpone and farmer&#39;s cheeses. Season with nutmeg and black pepper. Reserve. On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll the dough as thinly as possible, about 14 to 15-inch circle. Evenly spread the mascarpone mixture over the dough. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, bacon, thyme, and sauteed onion. Bake until the pizza crust is nicely browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove pizza from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, cut into slices and serve immediately. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4 cup warm water. In a food processor, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and process until the mixture forms a ball. (The pizza dough can also be made in a mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed until the mixture comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and starts to climb up the dough hook). Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a cool spot for about 2 hours. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Divide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 1 hour. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 53666,&quot;Mint Puree a la \\Pesto<br> 2 green onions, chopped 2 cups, packed mint leaves Coarse salt 1/4 cup almonds Zest of 1 lemon, grated 1/3 cup vegetable oil 1/3 cup olive oil Salt and pepper Instructions: In a food processor or blender combine all of the ingredients and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Grease an 8-inch square-baking pan. To make the bread pudding, combine the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Beat in the eggs until smooth, then work in the heavy cream. Add the vanilla, then the bread cubes. Allow the bread to soak up the custard. Scatter the raisins in the greased pan, and top with the egg mixture, which will prevent the raisins from burning. Bake for approximately 25 to 30 minutes or until the pudding has a golden brown color and is firm to the touch. If a toothpick inserted in the pudding comes out clean, it is done. It should be moist, not runny or dry. Let cool to room temperature. To make the sauce, bring the cream to a boil, combine the cornstarch and water, and add the mixture to the boiling cream, stirring constantly. Return to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, being careful not to burn the mixture. Add the sugar and bourbon, and stir. Let cool to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F, and butter 6 (6-ounce) ceramic ramekins. To make the meringue, be certain that you use a bowl and whisk that are clean and that the egg whites are completely free of yolk. This dish needs a good, stiff meringue, and the eggs whites will whip better if the chill is off them. In a large bowl or mixer, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add the sugar, and continue whipping until shiny and thick. Test with a clean spoon. If the whites stand up stiff, like shaving cream, when you pull out the spoon, the meringue is ready. Do not overwhip, or the whites will break down and the souffle will not work. In a large bowl, break half the bread pudding into pieces using your hands or a spoon. Gently fold in a quarter of the meringue, being careful not to lose the air in the whites. Place a portion of this mixture in each of the ramekins. Place the remaining bread pudding in a bowl, break into pieces, and carefully fold in the rest of the meringue. Top off the souffles with this lighter mixture, to about 1 1/2 inches over the top edge of the ramekin. With a spoon, smooth and shape the tops into a dome over the ramekin rim. Bake immediately for approximately 20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve immediately. Using a spoon at the table, poke a hole in the top of each souffle and spoon the room-temperature whiskey sauce into the souffle. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 53693,&quot;Mushroom-Stuffed Pork Roulade 7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound wild mushrooms (such as oyster and/or hen of the woods), trimmed and sliced 1 small head garlic, minced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme, plus 2 sprigs 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary, plus 1 sprig 1 center-cut boneless pork loin roast (3 1/2 to 4 pounds) 1/4 cup dry sherry 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.
