This suggests it is likely to be ready to drink soon. In the meantime, the acidity is supremely fresh, with grapefruit edges and green apple flavors. And then there is minerality and a tight, structured aftertaste as a reminder that this great Champagne is always going to be more than its fruit.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"This bright, aromatic, vivid wine opens with a bowlful of berries and cherries. There is plenty of acid under the ripe fruit, which takes center stage at the moment. The significant addition of Carmenre (from the Seven Hills vineyard) adds black pepper to the engaging mix of flavors. Despite its youth, the flavors persist for a remarkably long finish.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"The Cabernet is sharply defined, with interesting citrus flavors defining the borders of the fruit. Lemon peel, candied pineapple and even grapefruit add lovely grace notes indicative of rich, clean, natural acids and a wine with plenty of glycerin. The stunning red fruits are polished and backed with details such as dried herb, and a tiny hint of mint. This may well be the most ageworthy Leonetti Cabernet ever made.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Etude's Heirloom bottling is vintage-driven, and the 2005 is a great wine. It's a powerhouse that in its youth is full-bodied and almost heavy. It shows massive flavors of red currants, cherry pie filling, cola, figs and spices that taste like they were baked into a dessert pastry, except that the finish is thoroughly dry. What's hard to communicate is the wine's dazzling structure. Not meant to be opened now, it's a Pinot Noir to store through 2010, as it husbands its strength and gains bottle complexity.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"With its aromas of very pure, crisp fruits, this ripe wine from the great 2002 vintage is so complete.

It has a straight line of mineral, flint and grapefruit running through it. Around this, there are layers of fresh apples, lime zest and a tight, taut structure.

It's also the most ageworthy. Fifty percent stem inclusion in the fermentation has given the wine a tannic, gritty earthiness and spiciness that throw a cloak over the underlying wine.

It's the structure, and not just the ripe flavors, that's so impeccable, giving the wine its backbone and strength. But speaking of flavors, the wine is gigantic in black currants and blackberries.

The '04 is nearly all Cabernet Sauvignon, and stuns with its power. With a smooth, complex tannin structure, it's rich in currants, blackberries and cedar, but is too young to open now.

It shows a pale color and a very delicate, silky mouthfeel, but the impact on the palate can only be described as explosive, and the aftertaste is very rich.

Best now and through 2010.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"A very Burgundian Pinot Noir in the mushroom, pine needle and herb scents that accompany the deeper fruit flavors of black cherries and red currants, accented with savory clove spice.

Really a treat to drink, and should evolve for many years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Whether by virtue of vintage or bottle variation, Boudreaux wines seem to gyrate a bit wildly when first released. This new 2005 is no exception. At first sniff it explodes into life, the aromas a mix of herb, spice, tar, smoke, earth and fruit.

Some tasters may find it leaning toward the medicinal, but for those who love Rob Newsom's full-speed-ahead style, this is a gorgeous bottle.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Delicate powerany oxymoronwould be a fitting way to describe this single-vineyard beauty, grown in the northern part of the appellation. There's a lightness to the mouthfeel, like cotton candy, but then the power kicks in, reminiscent of cherry reduction, anise, orange zest, herb tea, black pepper and clove-dominated Asian spices. There's even a hint of smoky chocolate. Best now through 2012.","province":"California"},{"country":"it","description":"Here's a beautifully aged Amarone from an excellent vintage. Masi's Mazzano is a benchmark wine for Valpolicella thanks to its intriguing complexity of aromas: black cherry, dried fruit, porcini mushroom, dark chocolate, vanilla bean and dark resin like the kind you'd smell in an antique furniture shop. The wine has a slightly brownish hue and remarkable penetration.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"fr","description":"A wine that shows an airy character.

Southing always is. It could almost morph into a Cabernet Sauvignon. But who cares? It's compellingly delicious, and isn't that what wine is all about?

The tannins will help carry it across the finish line by 2012 or so.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"N.P.U. standing for Nec Plus Ultra (translation nothing further beyond), this is a ultra-dry Champagne. It needs time to mature, so Bruno Paillard is to be congratulated for only now releasing the 1995 vintage. It has richness and freshness, the white fruits still scintillating in the glass.

The '06 is fresh and vibrant, and needs a little time to develop.

As delicious as it is now, it's nervous and tentative. Give it a few years to come around.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Has this vineyard ever produced anything less than a spectacular Pinot Noir? Hitching Post's '06 showcases its exotic spiciness and the way its power is modulated with an elegant structure.

In a year that is good, but not at the top, Mouton has made a great wine.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"fr","description":"Strength and elegance go together in this wine. It has a pure line of clear berry fruits that float above the tannic core. It is not so much rich as dense, the tannins a vivid counterpoint to the fruit.

Age for 10 years at least.","province":"Bordeaux"},{"country":"fr","description":"After the fabulous 2005, Ptrus again has produced a magnificent wine in 2006, even if it doesn't hit quite the same heights.

It shows the kind of elegance and grace one finds in Bordeaux, without intrusive barrel influences, and it's the kind of nose you want to bury your nose in. It wraps around you seductively, with an appealing shyness. The fruit and wood and earth flavors are seamless and interesting, as the wine leads you gently through a very long finish.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release. The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors.

Should evolve well beyond 2012.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Where Rusack's regular '06 Syrah is a delicious wine to drink now, this reserve-style bottling is considerably more tannic, as well as deeper-flavored.

The tannins are polished and firm and there's enough natural sweetness to make this a chewy and succulent wine, sip after sip.","province":"Veneto"},{"country":"US","description":"This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around. Give it three or four years for the black currants to marry with the cedar and become smoky-sweet.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"This new vintage of Novelty Hill's estate Chardonnay shows more acid and spice than the slightly richer, creamier 2005, but offers the same superb winemaking.

It does not require food to fill in what's missingnothing is missing!","province":"Washington"},{"country":"US","description":"Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging.

It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years.

Bollinger sees the unique heat of 2003 as a reason to make a special vintage for release early.

Drink now.","province":"Champagne"},{"country":"US","description":"Frazier breaks the triple-digit price barrier with this Cabernet. Like their regular '05, it's a very tannic wine, not suitable for drinking now or possibly anytime soon. But it's clearly powerful and concentrated in flavor, with a dense layering of cassis and freshly-crushed blackberries. Totally dry, but a little high in alcohol, it should reward cellaring over the next eight years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Perhaps because the winery's co-owner, Frank Ostini, is a restaurateur, he makes his wines in a forward, approachable style that doesn't require aging, although they're balanced enough for the cellar. The '06 Rio Vista is a fresh, silky wine whose smoky cherry and pepperspice flavors will soar with a grilled steak. Should hold nicely for six years.","province":"California"},{"country":"fr","description":"If this seems soft at first, that's the year. Soon enough, the hallmark Gosset acidity and minerality show through, with the addition of spicy pear and some toast.

However, there's a wealth of well-ripened cassis, bitter chocolate, cedar and anise flavors that are so powerful, the wine should easily ride out midterm aging.

The tannins are polished, the fruit is ripe and complex, the oak is elaborate, and there's a nice bite of acidity in the background.

The score reflects potential.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Longplay's 2008 reserve is quite different from its non-?reserve stablemate. The aromas include more earthy barnyard scents, the color has a hint of maturity, and no new oak was used.

Scents of stone fruit, pepper and red currants mark the nose, while the flavors take on a darker cast, heading toward black cherries and black olives. The tannins are supremely silky, but this graceful, feminine beauty should drink well through at least 2020.","province":"South au"},{"country":"US","description":"Ripe and delicious right out of the bottle, although it will age well. Made from a vineyard on the true Sonoma Coast, in the remote Fort Ross area, it's fabulously rich in cherry, framboise and red currant flavors, with intriguing waves of anise, bacon and sweet, vanilla-scented smoky sandalwood. There's a foresty taste, too, suggesting dried pine needles. The tannins and acids are near perfect. Stunning now, and should hold for at least six years.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Always one of Williams Selyem's top Pinot Noirs, the 2007 is a spectacular wine.

Shows great fruity ripeness in the cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, licorice and bacon flavors, and also a wild, forest quality of grilled mushrooms, thyme and fennel. Absolutely dry, with a firm spine of tannins, the structure is near perfect. A divine expression of Hirsch, and a good candidate for six years in the cellar.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The vineyard is about 1,000 feet above Boonville.

Everything is in good proportion, although the acids are a bit chalky and the high alcohol (just under 15%) takes it away from classic Bordeaux flavors.

It just has been ripened to the point where the alcohol takes over.","province":"Washington"},{"country":"ar","description":"Graffigna has shown improvement with its current set of releases.

Not an offensive or crazy wine, but too sour, lean and green to rate higher.","province":"Maule Valley"},{"country":"cl","description":"For Odfjell, which normally puts out ripe, quality wines, this green, herbal Syrah is both surprising and disappointing. Our first sample was brutally corked and the second was green on the nose and then short, chocolaty and limited on the palate.","province":"Maipo Valley"},{"country":"US","description":"The official alcohol is under 14%, but the wine smells and tastes like Port. It has a burnt, caramelized taste of baked fruit, and is tannicly astringent.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"Vegetal and dry, this Rh?ne-style blend of Syrah and Mourvdre doesn't have much going for it.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"The age of this wine, nearly 5 years, makes you wonder why Hawley held it back so long. Maybe to let the harshness resolve. If so, it didn't work. It remains a bitter wine, with overripe, Porty flavors.","province":"California"},{"country":"US","description":"It's been an uphill battle for Pietra Santa with this variety, and the '05 doesn't help matters. The wine is harsh in acids, with modest cherry and herb flavors and an annoyingly astringent finish.","province":"California"},{"country":"cl","description":"Heavy as dead weight, with a raisiny nose. Only dried out, semisalty plum flavors work the palate.","province":"Colchagua Valley"},{"country":"fr","description":"This is a powerhouse of a wine. It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"fr","description":"A complete wine. As it starts in the mouth, there is a feeling of everything in its place. The tannins are initially soft, dusty rather than dry; then the dark plums, red berries and so-sweet strawberries come into play. And finally, they all come together in a climax of richness and freshness.","province":"Burgundy"},{"country":"fr","description":"A beautiful wine, smooth, polished, with rounded corners. Its intense fruit is balanced and harmonizes well with the sweet tannins, the layers of wood and the red berry flavors. Certainly powerful, it impresses equally with the pleasure it will give in 7C10 years.","province":"Burgundy"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},M={class:"card-container"};function j(o,i,t,d,u,a){const p=y("PoemCard");return n(),r(c,null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâWine Reviewsü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",M,[(n(!0),r(c,null,m(a.visiblePoems,(s,f)=>(n(),w(p,{key:f,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(n(),r("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):g("",!0)])],64)}const D=h(P,[["render",j]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"wine/8.md","filePath":"wine/8.md"}'),V={name:"wine/8.md"},W=Object.assign(V,{setup(o){return(i,t)=>(n(),r("div",null,[b(D)]))}});export{N as __pageData,W as default};
