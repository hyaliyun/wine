For the pork dumplings: Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, ginger, sesame oil and scallions and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes (you just want to take the bite off of the raw ingredients, not saute them). Remove from the heat and allow to cool 1 minute. Combine the cooked garlic, ginger and scallions with the pork, hoisin, soy sauce, five-spice powder and egg in a large mixing bowl. Working with the dumpling wrappers, start with the floured surface facing down. Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling in the center of a wrapper. Wet the edge of the dumpling with water, using your finger, and fold the circle in half without sealing, like a taco. Pinch one end closed. Create pleats on one side using your thumb and forefinger, pressing against the other flat edge to seal as you go. Flatten the bottoms so they can get a nice pan fry on them. Repeat until all the dumplings are filled. Keep the dumplings on a lightly-floured sheet tray to keep them from sticking, and cover with a slightly damp towel to keep from drying out. Heat the veggie oil over high heat in the same skillet. Working in batches, pan-fry the dumplings by placing them bottom-side down and frying until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Once the dumplings are golden brown, working carefully (it will splatter), pour 1/2 cup water into the skillet to cover the dumplings halfway. Immediately cover with a lid, leaving a small crack for steam to escape. Cook until the water has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the dumplings to a paper towel-lined plate to soak up excess oil and repeat the process with the remaining dumplings. Cook&#39;s Note: This recipe makes a lot of dumplings; just keep extra in your freezer for a late night snack! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, GSM (Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre)]&quot; 34359,&quot;Stovetop Smoked Brisket on Garlic Buns 1 4-5 pound boneless whole beef brisket 6 cloves garlic finely minced 1 bunch parsley, chopped 1 tablespoon cumin 1/4 cup olive oil salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> salt and freshly ground black pepper 8-12 packaged Kaiser rolls or other crusty sandwich 3 tablespoons butter 1 large clove garlic, chopped or sprinkled garlic powder can be substituted. finishing salt (optional) Instructions: BRISKET: Mix garlic, parsley, 1 tablespoon cumin, 1/4 cup olive oil together in a small bowl.

Using a dough hook attachment, add the flour and sugar to the water and mix on low speed until a dough starts to form. Drizzle the oil and salt into the dough and beat on medium speed for 8 to 10 minutes, or until a smooth, firm, elastic dough is formed. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and spray the dough with a thin coating of cooking spray. Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside to proof in a warm, draft-free place for 11/2 hours or until doubled in size. Remove the plastic wrap, punch down and flatten the rounded dough with the heel of your hand. Roll the dough up tightly, sealing the seam well after each roll. The dough should be elongated and oval-shaped, with tapered and rounded (not pointed) ends. Preheat the oven lined with a pizza stone to 425 degrees F. Alternately, an inverted baking sheet may be used in place of a pizza stone. Place the dough on a baker&#39;s peel heavily dusted with semolina flour, or cornmeal, or alternately on an inverted baking sheet. Allow the dough to proof, loosely covered with a damp towel, for 30 minutes, or until doubled in size. Brush the dough with the egg white and sprinkle the sesame seeds over the top. Using a razor blade or sharp knife, score 3 (1/4-inch deep) slashes across the top of the dough at a 45 degree angle. Spray the dough generously with water from a water bottle and place in the oven on the baking stone. Immediately close the oven and bake for 3 minutes. Open the oven door and spray the dough again with the water bottle. Close the oven door and bake for an additional 3 minutes before spraying the dough for a third time (the spraying of the dough will ensure a crisp golden brown crust). Bake the dough for 45 minutes, or until a hollow thud is heard when the bread is whacked with the bowl of a wooden spoon. Allow the bread to cool slightly before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 34361,&quot;Marylou&#39;s Stuffed Peppers 2 ounces fresh basil leaves, finely chopped 12 medium organic green bell peppers 1 large Spanish onion, minced 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic One 28-ounce can San Marzano tomatoes, pureed 3 pounds ground turkey (thighs and legs) 1 cup basmati rice<br> 1/4 cup ketchup 1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage 1 1/2 tablespoons sea salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 3 large eggs, slightly beaten 1 bunch curly parsley, washed and finely chopped Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Mix the salt, brown sugar, cinnamon, cumin and paprika in a small mixing bowl. Pat the duck legs with paper towels and sprinkle all sides generously with the spice mix. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Remove and place the legs skin-side up in the duck fat, making sure they&#39;re completely submerged. Add the peppercorns and coriander seeds. Using an instant-read thermometer, bring the duck fat to a lazy simmer, 165 to 175 degrees F. Gently confit the legs in the simmering fat until the duck is fork tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove and cool. Meanwhile, add the reserved duck trimmings to a pan and cook to render the fat over low heat. Place onto a paper-towel-lined plate and reserve until serving. Using a sharp knife, remove the skin from the legs. Using two forks, shred the confit following the grain of the protein. Mix with 1/4 cup of the confit fat. Set a flat top griddle over high heat. Sear the skin on both sides to make a crunchy, cracklin&#39;-style texture, about 7 minutes total. Finely julienne and set aside. Add the confit to the griddle in batches and crisp until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. To assemble, spread Cranberry Jam onto the tops and bottoms of each bun. Build sliders with 2 ounces (about 1/4 cup) of confit, then a layer of crispy skin. Top with 2 tablespoons Fennel and Celery Root Slaw. Replace the top bun. Serve immediately with Butternut Squash Chips. In a medium saucepot, bring the oil to medium heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the onions, season with some salt and pepper and brown for 5 to 7 minutes. Deglaze with the cranberry juice and stir to scrape up any browned bits. Add the cranberries and red wine vinegar. Simmer to completely soften the cranberries and until the jam is thickened and glossy, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in lemon juice to taste. Season again with salt and pepper as desired. Transfer to a serving dish and serve warm. Can be made ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to a week. In a large mixing bowl, briskly whisk the mayonnaise, sour cream, vinegar, dugar, mustard and salt and pepper to taste until smooth. Toss the celery root, carrots, apples, fennel and 2 tablespoons of the reserved fennel fronds into the dressing to coat evenly. Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to fully integrate. Remove and toss again. Serve garnished with a few more fennel fronds. In a small mixing bowl, thoroughly combine the salt, garlic powder, paprika, brown sugar, black pepper and cayenne. Set aside. Using a sharp knife, cut the tubular top portion away from the globe-shaped bottoms of both squash. Using the knife or a mandoline, shave the tops into chips. Submerge the chips in a deep container with ice water for 10 minutes (this removes any extra starch and makes the chips crispy). Strain the chips and pat dry. Meanwhile, using an instant-read thermometer, bring 3 inches of duck fat to 325 degrees F in a heavy gauge Dutch oven over medium heat. Working in batches, fry the chips until they are golden and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer with a fine mesh strainer to a paper-towel-lined dish. Season immediately with a sprinkle of spice mix. Repeat until all chips are fried. Transfer to a large bowl and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 34364,&quot;Spiced Lamb Chops with Cauliflower 12 lamb rib chops (about 3/4 inch thick; 2 1/2 pounds total) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons garam masala 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 red onion, thinly sliced 5 cups cauliflower florets (from 1 medium head cauliflower) 1/2 cup frozen peas 1/4 cup fresh mint, roughly chopped Cilantro chutney, for serving Instructions: Generously season the lamb chops on both sides with salt and pepper.

Rinse with cool water and dry thoroughly with paper towels. In a 12-inch skillet, heat the oil over high heat for 2 minutes to 325 degrees. (You can also test for readiness by dipping the tip of a wooden spoon into the oil; if bubbles form around it, the oil is ready for frying.) Deep-fry the shrimp until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a tray lined with paper towels. Cover lightly with more paper towels and set aside. In a 12-inch skillet, mix the 2 cups coconut cream with the cl paste and set over high heat. Cook, stirring to prevent the paste from burning, until the mixture begins to bubble, about 2 minutes. Lower the heat to medium-high and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and the oil separates, releasing tiny bubbles the color of the cl paste, about 7 minutes.

Yield: about 3/4 cup Fresh Unsweetened Coconut Cream and Milk: Fresh unsweetened coconut cream and milk are called for in many of these recipes. After peeling the dark skins off the chunks of white meat, cut the meat into 1 to 2-inch chunks and place them in a heavy-duty food processor fitted with the steel blade. (If the coconut meat has been frozen, thaw it completely before slicing and grinding.) Grind for 30 to 60 seconds. Pause to scrape down the sides of the processor bowl; then pulse and blend until the meat turn to pulp. Add 1 cup warm water and process for 30 seconds. Transfer the coconut meat and liquid to a large mixing bowl, preferably one with a spout for pouring. \\Milk\\ the coconut - that is, massage and squeeze the meat at least 89 times. This is a Thai ritual believed to produce a rich and creamy coconut milk. It works! Place a fine-mesh strainer, potato ricer, or bouillon strainer over another large mixing bowl. Pour the coconut cream and meat into the strainer, then press firmly to extract the liquid from the pulp. Refrigerate the liquid for at least 1 hour. The thick cream will coagulate on top, leaving the whey, or milk, in the bottom of the bowl. Skim off the thick cream into a resealable plastic bag or plastic container and refrigerate or freeze. Meanwhile, put the coconut pulp back into the first mixing bowl. Pour 3 cups of warm water over the pulp, and massage and squeeze the coconut meat another 89 times. Strain the liquid into another bowl, as before, and refrigerate the liquid for at least 1 hour, giving the thick cream time to rise to the top. Skim off the cream and combine with the thick cream extracted from the first milking. Pour the thin whey into a separate glass or plastic container and refrigerate until ready to use. Cooks Note: More cream that can be used as cooking oil can be extracted from the thin whey after the second milking. Boil the milk gently in a large saucepan for 5 to 7 minutes. When the cream rises to the surface, skim it off and use as cooking oil to stir-fry cl or spice pastes. Then thin milk can be used for a broth to cook and tenderize meat. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti, Grenache]&quot; 34391,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Tex-Mex Spoonbread 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 7 ounces Mexican chorizo, removed from casing and crumbled<br> 1/2 cup chopped Vidalia or sweet onion<br> 1 clove garlic, grated on a rasp or finely minced<br> 2 cups milk 1 cup buttermilk<br> 3/4 cup cornmeal, such as Indian Head 3 large eggs, beaten<br> 1 cup shredded Cheddar 1 cup shredded mozzarella 3/4 cup corn kernels (fresh, canned or frozen)<br> 1/2 cup canned chopped tomatoes and green chiles, such as Ro*Tel<br> 2 scallions, finely chopped (white and green parts)<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs while very slowly adding a bit of the cornmeal mixture. Whisk vigorously to combine and then feel the outside of the bowl. If it&#39;s not warm, add a bit more of the cornmeal mixture while continuously whisking; keep adding the cornmeal mixture until the eggs are just as warm as the cornmeal mixture. Then, reversing the order, slowly pour the egg mixture into the cornmeal mixture, whisking vigorously. Add the Cheddar, mozzarella, corn, chopped tomatoes and chiles and scallions to the skillet and stir to combine. Bake until the edges are golden brown and the center is set, 35 to 40 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 34392,&quot;Blueberry Cornbread Panzanella 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted 3 cups cornbread cubes (1-inch cubes), store-bought or homemade, recipe follows Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup fresh blueberries 1/2 cup champagne vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> Zest of 1 lemon plus juice of 1/2 lemon<br> 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 6 ounces arugula 1 cup mixed cherry tomatoes, halved<br> 1/4 cup fresh blueberries<br> 2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled<br> 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, torn<br> 1 cup yellow cornmeal 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 cup buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 whole egg<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening<br> Instructions: For the cornbread croutons: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet with 2 tablespoons of the butter. Gently arrange the cornbread cubes on the baking sheet and drizzle with the remaining butter. Season with salt and pepper. Don&#39;t toss the cornbread or it will crumble. Toast, gently turning halfway through, until golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Allow it to cool 5 to 7 minutes before moving to a serving platter. For the vinaigrette: Put the blueberries, champagne vinegar, honey and lemon zest and juice in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a low simmer and cook until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. Transfer the blueberry mixture to a blender and puree at low speed.

Remove the core from each quarter, and set aside. Don&#39;t worry if they go brown, and don&#39;t cover in water or they will be too wet.<br> Place the sugar and water in an ovenproof saucepan set over a low-medium heat, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat, and boil the syrup until it starts to caramelize around the edges, about 5 minutes. Do not stir once it has come to the boil, otherwise the syrup will crystallize. Once the syrup starts to turn golden, you may need to swirl the pan slightly to even out the caramelization.<br> Once the syrup is golden caramel in color, add the butter, and swirl the pan again to distribute it throughout the caramel.<br> Remove the pan from the heat, and arrange the apple quarters in a concentric circle around the outside of the pan, and any remaining pieces in the center, keeping in mind that the tart will be flipped over when serving. The apples must completely cover the base of the pan; you may need an extra apple!<br> Place the pan back over a medium heat, and cook for 10 minutes, to slightly caramelize the apples, while you roll out the pastry.<br> On a lightly floured work surface, roll the pastry out to a round about 3/4-inch wider in diameter than the pan. Remove the pan from the heat, and place the pastry on top of the almost cooked apples. Using the base of a spoon or a fork, tuck the pastry in around the edges of the apples. Brush the pastry with the beaten egg, and then using a skewer or fork, prick a few holes in the pastry.<br> Bake in the oven for 25 minutes or until the pastry is golden and the apples feel cooked when you insert a skewer through the center.<br> Remove from the oven and allow to stand for just a few minutes before placing a plate on top of the pan and carefully (it is hot!) but quickly flipping it out.

Spray a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan with cooking spray. Use a measuring cup to gently press the graham cracker crumbs into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spray the crust with cooking spray. The crust will not be very thick. In a blender, combine the cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, flour, and vanilla and blend until smooth. Pour into the crust and bake for 40 minutes. Let cool completely. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or up to overnight. Toss the berries with a pinch of sugar. Serve the cheesecake cold, topping each slice with some of the berries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 34412,&quot;Japanese Cheesecake Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying the pan 10 ounces cream cheese, cut into cubes 1/2 cup whole milk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 7 large eggs, separated Juice of 1/2 lemon 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup cornstarch 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Kosher salt 1 cup granulated sugar Confectioners&#39; sugar, for decorating Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment. Place a 3 1/2-inch-wide strip of parchment around the inside of the pan so that it comes up about 1 inch higher than the edge; set aside. Heat the cream cheese, milk and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the vanilla, egg yolks and lemon juice in a large bowl until smooth. Pour the cooled milk mixture into the yolk mixture and whisk until smooth and combined. Whisk in the flour and cornstarch until combined; set aside. Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Slowly add the granulated sugar and continue beating on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes longer. Gently fold the egg white mixture into the yolk mixture in 3 batches, making sure not to overmix (you want the whites to stay as fluffy as possible). As soon as the white streaks disappear from the batter, pour it into the prepared pan. Place the cake pan inside of a larger pan and pour enough hot water into the larger pan so that it comes 1 inch up the sides of the cake pan. Bake for 30 minutes, then reduce the oven to 250 degrees F and continue baking until the cake is doubled in size, golden brown on top and around the edges and jiggly in the center but set, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let the cake cool for 10 minutes. Carefully invert the cake onto your dominant hand (right onto your palm--this is the most gentle way to handle it), then invert it back onto a cake stand or plate so that the top is facing up. Sprinkle the entire top with confectioners&#39; sugar and serve while still warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 34413,&quot;Green Tomato and Vidalia Onion Gratin 1/4 pound bacon 1 cup fresh bread crumbs 2 large Vidalia onions, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds 4 large green tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 6 ounces sharp white Cheddar, grated, about 1 1/2 cups Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Render bacon in a large skillet over medium heat. Transfer the cooked bacon to a paper towel lined plate. Add the bread crumbs to a small bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the skillet and stir into the bread crumbs. Add the onion rounds to the skillet in batches and cook, without breaking the round slices apart, until there is some golden color, about 5 to 6 minutes per side. To assemble the gratin, overlap the green tomato slices in 1 row in a large baking dish, about 9 by 11 inches. Next, make a row slightly overlapping of the partially cooked onion rounds, being careful to keep the slices intact. Repeat steps until all tomatoes and onions are used. Season tomatoes and onions lightly with salt and heavily with pepper. Crumble the bacon over the vegetables; sprinkle the grated Cheddar over the top followed by the bread crumbs. Bake until the cheese is bubbly, about 30 to 45 minutes. If the top is getting too brown, loosely cover with foil. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 34414,&quot;Berry Coulis 12 ounces fresh raspberries, blackberries, blueberries or strawberries, or a mix (if using strawberries, hull and quarter them) 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Pinch kosher salt Instructions: Combine the berries, sugar, lemon juice, salt and 1 tablespoon water in a medium saucepan.

Reserve breast for roasting. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Debone turkey legs. Remove silver skin and all tendons. With skin side down, cover with plastic wrap and pound out evenly. Season inside with salt and pepper. Add 8 ounces of mushroom stuffing evenly across middle section. Roll into a tight cylinder. Tie with butcher&#39;s string and close ends with skewers. Season outside with salt and pepper. Heat a roasting pan and add olive oil. Sear meat until golden brown. Remove legs from roasting pan. Add carrots, celery, onion and rosemary and cook until brown. Deglaze with chicken stock. Bring to a boil and add turkey legs. Slowly braise the legs in the oven for about 2 hours until internal temperature is 130 degrees F. Remove foil and finish roasting to get color on the meat, until internal temperature is 140 degrees F. Remove legs and set aside on a platter. Cover with foil until ready to slice. Add 2 cups of pomegranate juice to the braising liquid. Simmer for 10 minutes then puree the sauce through a food mill. Carrots, onions and celery will thicken the sauce. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Let sit for about 30 minutes and with a small ladle, remove excess fat. Remove string and skewers. Slice into half-inch portions and serve with sauce. Render foie gras or chicken liver in saute pan. Remove and pour rendered fat over bread. Dice and reserve. (If you use chicken liver instead or foie gras, add 4 tablespoons of butter). Rinse dried porcini and soak in warm water. Drain and chop mushrooms, reserving liquid. Heat olive oil in saute pan over medium heat and add onions, celery and pancetta. Cook until vegetables become translucent. Combine dried mushrooms and fresh mushrooms and add reserved mushroom liquid and stock. Cook over medium heat and reduce until almost dry. Set aside. Place foie gras or chicken liver and dried bread crumbs in a large bowl. Add herbs, beaten eggs and mushroom mixture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated. Fill legs of turkey according to recipe (or place stuffing in a buttered gratin dish and bake in preheated 350 degree F. oven for 30 minutes). Mix butter, rosemary, salt and pepper, to taste until nice and smooth. With your hands, carefully separate turkey skin from the breast meat. Spread rosemary butter evenly between skin and meat. Season turkey breast with salt and pepper and rub with olive oil. Place in roasting pan with a rack. If your oven is large enough, you can roast the turkey breast in the same oven while you braise the stuffed legs, which I prefer, because the steam from the braising liquid keeps the stuffing moist. Roast until internal temperature is 165 degrees F. Baste every 15 minutes with the pan drippings. When breast is done, cover with foil and let rest in a warm place until you are ready to carve.

Heat until buns are just light golden brown and have a nice crispy edge, 4 to 6 minutes. (A well-buttered and griddled bun gives you great flavor and a crispy crunch, and also acts as a seal to keep the burger juices and other sauces from making the bun soggy.) Preheat a broiler. Form beef into four 8-ounce 3/4-inch-thick patties. Sprinkle beef patties with Burger Shake (1/2 ounce each) and place in broiler to cook, about 4 minutes. Flip the patties over and sprinkle with more Burger Shake (another 1/2 ounce each, or to taste). Place the roasted garlic cloves on top of the patties along with the bacon strips and top with 2 slices of Gouda per patty. Cook until Gouda is fully melted and enrobes the garlic and bacon and patties are pink inside, another 4 minutes. Smear both halves of buns with Caesar Dressing. Place finished patties on bottom buns and top with onions and tomatoes. Add three pickle chips to each patty and drizzle barbecue sauce over the entire burger.

Add the shallots and saute for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly browned. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add the chicken stock, frozen peas, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender until coarsely pureed. (I like it to have some texture.) Alternatively, use a blender to puree the soup 1 cup at a time. Pour the soup back into the pot and season to taste. Depending on the saltiness of the stock, I may add up to another teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to give the soup a very bright flavor. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the ham in a single layer on a sheet pan and roast for 5 to 8 minutes, until crisp. Reheat the soup and serve in shallow bowls with a slice of crispy ham on top.

Set aside until syrupy, about 30 minutes. Trim off the tops of the whole strawberries. Cut the cake into 1/2-inch-thick slices, then use a 1 1/2-inch-round cookie cutter to cut out 24 rounds. Beat the egg white, marshmallow cream, lemon juice, salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar with a mixer on medium speed until stiff peaks form (the mixture may separate before coming together), about 5 minutes. Dip one side of each cake round about halfway into the strawberry syrup and transfer to a baking sheet, syrup-side up. Spoon some of the chopped berries in the center. Top with a dollop of marshmallow cream. Swirl the tip of each whole strawberry in the meringue. Press a strawberry, cut-side down, into the marshmallow cream on top of each cake.

Combine the garlic, thyme, rosemary, parsley, and Parmesan and set aside. Carefully crack 3 eggs into each of 2 small bowls or teacups (you won&#39;t be baking them in these) without breaking the yolks. (It&#39;s very important to have all the eggs ready to go before you start cooking.) Place 2 individual gratin dishes on a baking sheet. Place 1 tablespoon of cream and 1/2 tablespoon of butter in each dish and place under the broiler for about 3 minutes, until hot and bubbly. Quickly, but carefully, pour 3 eggs into each gratin dish and sprinkle evenly with the herb mixture, then sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Place back under the broiler for 5 to 6 minutes, until the whites of the eggs are almost cooked. (Rotate the baking sheet once if they aren&#39;t cooking evenly.) The eggs will continue to cook after you take them out of the oven. Allow to set for 60 seconds and serve hot with toasted bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 34462,&quot;Beer Bread Nonstick spray 8 ounces all-purpose flour 4 ounces whole-wheat flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill 4 1/2 ounces sharp Cheddar, grated 12 ounces cold beer, ale or stout 1 to 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds, optional Instructions: Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat the inside of a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan with the nonstick spray and set aside. Whisk together the all-purpose flour, wheat flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and dill in a large mixing bowl. Add in the cheese and stir in the beer just to combine. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Sprinkle with the sunflower seeds, if using. Bake on the middle rack of the oven until the bread reaches an internal temperature of 210 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 45 to 55 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Transfer the loaf to a cooling rack for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[IPA, Brown Ale, Stout, Hefeweizen]&quot; 34463,&quot;Fondant Glazed Petit Fours 4 egg whites 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract 2 cups sifted cake flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 2/3 cup milk, at room temperature 2/3 cup corn syrup 2/3 cup hot water 7 cups powdered sugar 6 drops lemon extract Food coloring 2 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted Silver dragee Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment whip the egg whites until stiff but not dry. In a mixer fitted with a whip attachment cream the butter until smooth. With the mixer running, slowly add the sugar and mix. Add the vanilla and almond extract and mix well. Sift the flour 3 times with the baking powder (this is to lighten the cakes). Add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix. Add 1/2 of the milk to the butter mixture and mix. Add another 1/3 of the flour mixture and mix. Add the remaining milk and mix. Add the remaining flour and mix until smooth. Fold in the egg whites. Pour the batter into a parchment lined jellyroll pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake until firm to the touch 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool in the pan then chill. To make the fondant: Whisk the corn syrup into the hot water until dissolved, then whisk in the powdered sugar until smooth. Stir in lemon extract. Divide into smaller bowls and color with food coloring, adding color until you achieve desired shade. To make the petit fours, cut the cold cake into small squares, rectangles, and circles using small cookie cutters. Place the cakes on a wire rack over a pan to catch the drippings, inverting them in order to have the golden layer on the bottom. If the fondant has become stiff, just whisk until smooth again. If the fondant is has not become to stiff, proceed to the next step. Either dip the cakes into the fondant and place on the rack to drain or ladle the fondant over the cakes, making sure all sides are coated. Once they are set, they should be coated again. Let dry, then with melted chocolate or colored fondant, pipe thin decorative lines or use silver dragees. Notes about the recipe: There are many options for these darling little cakes. You can split the cake in half horizontally and spread it with jam, you can spread jam on the top and stick down a thin layer of rolled marzipan or do the simplest plain version like I did here. You can also tint the fondant different pastel colors. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</li></ol><p>&quot; 34464,&quot;Chopped Nicoise Salad 4 small red potatoes (about 1/2 pound) 1/3 pound fresh green beans, trimmed 12-ounce can light tuna packed in water, drained 1/2 cup chopped pitted Greek or Spanish olives 1/4 cup diced red onion 2 large tomatoes, seeded and diced (about 2 cups) 5 cups chopped romaine lettuce 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard Salt and pepper Instructions: Boil water in a large pot with a fitted steamer basket.

Heat until hot but not boiling, then remove the pan from the stove and allow it to cool until the mixture is warm to the touch but not too hot. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the liquid and allow it to sit for 5 minutes. Stir in the pumpkin puree until combined. Combine 4 cups of the flour with the cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Sprinkle it into the saucepan and stir until it just comes together. Cover the saucepan with a dish towel and set in a warm, draft-free place for 1 hour. After 1 hour, the mixture should be very puffy and at least doubled in size. Stir in the baking powder, baking soda, salt and remaining 1/2 cup flour until totally combined. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Drizzle butter into 3 pie pans (or a larger baking dish) and smear it all over the bottom of the pans. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and press it into a rectangular shape. If it is overly sticky, sprinkle generously with flour until easier to handle. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough into a large rectangle about 18 inches by 24 inches. For the filling: Drizzle the melted butter over the dough and smear it all over the surface with your fingers. Mix together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Sprinkle this mixture all over the surface of the dough, covering all the melted butter. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup chopped pecans. Starting at the top, roll the dough toward you into a large log, moving back and forth down the line of dough (in a \\typewriter\\ motion) and always rolling toward you. Roll it tightly as you go so the rolls with be nice and neat. When it&#39;s all rolled, pinch the seam closed and turn the roll over so that the seam is facing down. Slice into 1/2- to 3/4-inch slices and place the slices in the buttered pan(s). Allow to rise for 20 minutes. Bake until the rolls are nice and golden brown around the edges, 15 to 18 minutes. For the frosting: While the rolls are baking, make the frosting by combining the cream cheese, powdered sugar, milk, butter and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until fluffy, adding more milk if you&#39;d like a thinner frosting. Frost the rolls the second they come out of the oven. Sprinkle the extra pecans over the frosting, then allow them to sit for 15 minutes before serving.

Add the garlic and onion and cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the oyster and shiitake mushrooms and chopped thyme and saute until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Remove the mushrooms to a plate. In the same saucepan, add the sausage and cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sausage to the plate, leaving the drippings behind for gravy (refrigerate the drippings until ready to make the gravy). In a large bowl, whisk together the milk, cream and eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Add the cheese and reserved mushrooms and sausage to the mixture. Mix in the bread cubes. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grease a bundt pan with oil. Add a little flour to the pan so the strata doesn&#39;t stick. Add the strata mixture to the pan and bake until deep golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a plate. For the gravy: While the strata is baking, heat the reserved sausage drippings in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the butter and cook until melted. Add the flour and continue to cook until the mixture starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk in the chicken broth while cooking. Add a pinch of salt and some pepper. Serve the strata with the warm gravy and garnish with fresh thyme sprigs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 34468,&quot;Dried Fig-Smoked Almond Bark 1 pound semisweet chocolate 1/2 cup chopped smoked almonds 1/2 cup sliced dried figs Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling Instructions: Line a baking sheet with foil, shiny-side up; smooth out the creases. Make sure all your tools are dry. Chop the chocolate into 1/2-inch pieces with a large knife. Place all but 1 cup of the chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave 30 seconds, then stir with a rubber spatula. Continue microwaving and stirring at 30-second intervals until melted, 3 to 5 minutes total. Immediately add the reserved chopped chocolate to the bowl; stir vigorously until melted and shiny. Don&#39;t worry if there are a few small unmelted pieces. Pour the chocolate onto the prepared baking sheet; use the rubber spatula to spread it into a 10-to-12-inch circle, about 1/4 inch thick. Press the almonds and figs into the chocolate, arranging them so each bite has a mix of flavors and textures. Sprinkle with sea salt. Let the bark harden completely at room temperature, about 1 hour. (If the room is warm, you may need to freeze the bark for a few minutes.) Break into pieces and store in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Tempranillo, Syrah, Malbec]&quot; 34469,&quot;Almond Twists 2 large egg yolks 1 large egg 1/4 cup whole milk Store-bought puff pastry, rolled into 1 (10 by 12-inch) rectangle, about 1/8-inch thick 1/2 cup ground blanched almonds Pinch salt Pinch freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Prepare the egg wash: Combine the yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small mixing bowl and whip with a hand whisk until well combined. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Flour the dough and table as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the table or the rolling pin. Place the dough on your work surface with a long side facing you. Use a pastry brush to coat the surface of the rectangle with some egg wash. Liberally sprinkle the ground almonds over the rectangle, followed by the salt and pepper. Use a sharp paring knife to cut the rectangle into ten 1-inch wide strips. Next, cut each of these strips into three 4-inch-long pieces. Flip each strip so that the almonds are on the bottom. Twist each strip by rolling each end in opposite directions. Always remember to twist so that the topping faces out --that way you can see how they are flavored. Place the strips on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet and bake until well risen and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before serving.

Grease two 8-inch cake pans with butter. Dissolve the espresso powder in 1/4 cup hot water, then stir into the orange juice. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, sift the cake flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Mix on a low speed. In a second bowl, lightly whisk together the oil, buttermilk and eggs; slowly add to the flour mixture. Increase the mixer speed and whisk until fully incorporated. Fold in the orange juice-coffee mixture. Pour the batter into prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. For the cookies-and-cream filling: Combine the heavy cream and white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 1 minute, then stir until smooth. Set aside to cool. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the cream cheese, butter and vanilla until light and fluffy. Add the white chocolate mixture and whip for another minute. Lower the mixer speed, gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar and whip for another minute at high speed. Fold in the cookies. (Makes 2 cups.) For the buttercream: Place the egg whites, sugar and salt in a stand mixer bowl and set the bowl over a pan of simmering water. Whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and all the sugar has dissolved. Attach the bowl to the mixer and whisk until soft peaks form, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the butter, a few tablespoons at a time, then whisk in the vanilla. Switch to the paddle attachment and continue mixing at low speed until the buttercream becomes smooth, another minute or two. (Makes 5 cups.) To assemble the cake: Place one cake layer on a cake board and pipe a border of buttercream along the circumference (to act as a pool for the filling).

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Sear the beef on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to a baking sheet and cool completely, about 20 minutes. Add half of the mushrooms to a food processor and pulse until they are very finely chopped. Remove the finely chopped mushrooms to a bowl and continue with the other half of the mushrooms. Reserve. Heat the butter and remaining tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Once melted and foaming, add the shallots and sweat until fully softened, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms to the pan and saute until they release all their moisture and then dry, about 10 minutes. Add the heavy cream and simmer until thick, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the breadcrumbs and parsley. Remove the mushrooms to a small bowl, cool completely and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. The mushrooms should now look like a paste. Combine the Dijon and horseradish in a small bowl. Once the meat is cool to the touch, snip off the butcher&#39;s twine and discard, and then spread the mustard and horseradish mixture all over the beef. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour. Adjust a rack to the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Crack the egg into a small bowl and beat until smooth. Dust the work area lightly with flour. Roll out the puff pastry with a rolling pin so it&#39;s 4 inches longer than the tenderloin and 6 to 7 inches wider. Brush a 3-inch edge of the pastry with the beaten egg. Spread and pat the mushroom mixture all over the top and sides of the beef. Lay the beef mushroom-side down in the center of the pastry and pat the remaining mushrooms onto the exposed side. Tuck the 2 ends of the pastry into the beef and then fold up the other sides. Place the beef seam-side down on the baking sheet. Brush all over with the egg wash. Cut 3 slits on the top of the roast and sprinkle lightly with flaky sea salt. Roast until a thermometer inserted into the beef reads 120 degrees F, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and rest for 20 minutes before slicing into 1-inch-thick pieces. The temperature will rise to 125 degrees F, leaving you with a nice ruby red medium rare. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Merlot]&quot; 34481,&quot;Cucumber, Grape Tomato and Dill Salad 1 large shallot, finely minced 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 3/4 cup olive oil 1 seedless, skinless, cucumber, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/4-inch half moons 1 bunch fresh dill, trimmed and minced Lightly toasted fennel seeds 1 serrano cl, seeded and chopped 1 pint grape tomatoes Instructions: Put shallot, mustard, and vinegar in a blender, and blend.

With your hands, squeeze out the excess milk. Discard the milk and add the soaked bread to a large mixing bowl with the meat, parsley, sage, garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix well, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Bring a pot of water to a boil and prepare a large bowl full of ice water. Add the cabbage leaves to the pot and blanch them in the boiling water just until they are slightly wilted, about 1 minute; drain them and immediately transfer the leaves to the ice water. When the leaves are cold, remove them from the water and pat them dry. With a small, sharp knife, cut the thick part of the stem from each cabbage leaf. Place a heaping 1/2 cup of the filling in the center of each cabbage leaf. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, overlapping them slightly, and then, starting at the stem end, roll up the leaf into a compact bundle. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat a large heatproof saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, onion, and garlic and saute until the vegetables are translucent. Add the tomato paste and paprika and saute briefly. Then, stir in the chicken stock, tomato sauce, balsamic vinegar, sugar, and sage. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes. Arrange the stuffed cabbage leaves neatly in a single layer in the saucepan. Bring the sauce back to a boil. Transfer the pan to the preheated oven and bake until the bundles are cooked through and firm to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes. To serve, use a large spoon to transfer the rolls to a platter or individual heated plates. Spoon the sauce over and around them. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 34500,&quot;Limoncello 12 organic lemons 1 liter 100 proof-vodka 3 cups sugar 4 cups water Instructions: Wash the lemons thoroughly. Using a peeler, take off the skins being careful not to get any of the white lemon \\pith\\ onto your peelings or it will add bitterness to your limoncello. Place peels into a large wide-mouth jar with all the vodka. Seal tightly. Place the jar in a cool, dry place for 2 to 3 weeks. Shake the jar to remix everything everyday or so. You will notice the color of the liquid changing to yellow as the peels lose their color. After 1 week, dissolve the sugar completely with the water by heating it on the stove in a large saucepan. Let simple syrup cool to room temperature. Strain the lemon peels from the alcohol and discard. Mix the alcohol with the simple syrup. At this point you can serve it right away or pour the alcohol into a bottle with the simple syrup and place in the freezer to chill. Once chilled it becomes thick and syrupy. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 34501,&quot;El Cholo&#39;s Green Corn Tamales 24 ears yellow corn 1/2 pound cornmeal 1/4 pound shortening 1/4 pound butter 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup half-and-half or cream 1 teaspoon salt 12 (1-ounce) strips Cheddar 24-ounce can chiles (recommended: Ortega) Instructions: Cut both ends of corn, remove husks and save for wrapping.

Arrange the arugula around the edge of the platter and drizzle the fillets with olive oil and season with pepper. Sprinkle fleur de sel over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 34519,&quot;Fried Avocado Bites Three 8-ounce avocados, halved and pitted Fine salt 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 2 tablespoons sugar 1/2 teaspoon Asian chili garlic paste Vegetable or canola oil, for frying (about 8 cups) 1 cup seltzer 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 large egg 1/4 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish 1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce Instructions: Special equipment: a deep-fry thermometer Line a small rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Score the flesh of each avocado half to the skin with 2 lengthwise and 3 crosswise cuts, to make 12 chunks per half. Ease the chunks out of the skins with a large spoon, and spread them in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt, and freeze for 1 hour. Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: Whisk together the lime juice, sugar, fish sauce and chili garlic paste in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved; set aside. Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a Dutch oven with about 1 1/2 inches of oil. Attach a deep-fry thermometer, and bring to 360 degrees F over medium heat. Whisk together the seltzer, flour, egg and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Submerge half the avocado chunks in the batter. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon, letting excess batter drip back into the bowl, and add them to the hot oil, being careful not to splash. Fry the avocado chunks, turning frequently, until deeply golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle right away with some salt. Bring the oil temperature back up to 360 degrees F. Repeat with the remaining avocado chunks. Transfer all the chunks to a serving plate, and garnish with cilantro leaves. Serve immediately with the dipping sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 34520,&quot;Roasted Rosemary Turkey Breast 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage 2 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard 1 teaspoon fresh orange zest Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 (6-pound) fresh turkey breast, on the bone, rinsed and patted dry 2 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch pieces 2 small carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces 2 small onions, peeled and quartered Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Tam Triple Cream One 12-ounce Cypress Grove Chevre Truffle Tremor One 8-ounce wedge aged Monterey Jack cheese Instructions: For the vegetables: Heat a cast iron grill pan over high heat until smoking, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the vegetables to a large bowl, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Grill the vegetables on the hot grill pan for 2 to 3 minutes per side, without moving so they get nice grill marks. Remove to a large platter and drizzle with aged balsamic vinegar. For the sourdough: Heat a cast iron grill pan over high heat until smoking, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drizzle the bread slices with olive oil and arrange on the hot grill pan for 2 to 3 minutes per side, without moving so they get nice grill marks and toast evenly. For the ricotta spread: Begin by toasting the pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat. Toss over low heat until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add the honey. Mix well so the nuts get coated evenly and honey melts. Allow to cool slightly, then add to a large bowl. Add the ricotta, olive oil, mint and salt and pepper, to taste. Refrigerate until the ricotta firms up a little before serving with grilled sourdough and antipasto items. For the platter: Arrange the grilled vegetables, grilled sourdough, ricotta, olives, prosciutto and cheese on a large platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 34526,&quot;Prosciutto-Wrapped Chicken Involtini with Peas and Ricotta 1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed 1/4 cup ricotta<br> 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1 teaspoon lemon zest<br> 1/4 teaspoon cl flakes<br> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/4 teaspoon onion powder<br> 4 chicken cutlets<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 12 thin slices prosciutto<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Add the peas to a bowl and begin to mash them with the back of a fork until they are mostly broken down. Add the ricotta and use the fork to blend and mash them together. Add the Parmesan, lemon zest, cl flakes, garlic powder and onion powder and stir to combine. Set the mixture aside while you prepare the chicken. Place the chicken cutlets between 2 pieces of parchment paper and pound them with a meat mallet or rolling pin until they are 1/4-inch thick. Remove the top layer of parchment paper and sprinkle the chicken with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Divide the pea and ricotta mixture evenly among the chicken cutlets, smoothing it out to cover the surface area. Working one at a time, starting with the large end of the cutlet, roll the chicken up in a continuous spiral. Place the chicken on a plate seam-side down and continue the process with the remaining chicken. Shingle 3 slices of prosciutto so they slightly overlap. Place one piece of chicken about a third of the way up from the bottom of the prosciutto. Similarly to wrapping a burrito, bring the base of the prosciutto up over the chicken, roll the chicken once, then fold in the ends of the prosciutto, so that the ends of the chicken are covered, and continue to roll until the chicken is completely wrapped in the prosciutto. Set aside and continue the process with the remaining chicken. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and swirl to coat the skillet. Add the prosciutto-wrapped chicken to the skillet and sear it on all sides. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the prosciutto is golden and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 34527,&quot;Peanut Butter Chili 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes 1/2 cup water 3 cloves garlic, minced 2 bay leaves 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained 1 (15- ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup shredded Cheddar, optional 2 cups tortilla chips, optional Instructions: Place the diced tomatoes, water, garlic, and bay leaves into a large saucepan, and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and season with the cayenne pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Cover, and simmer 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, pour in the black beans and kidney beans; return to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the peanut butter until dissolved, then remove and discard the bay leaves, and season the chili with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove to a serving bowl and serve sprinkled with Cheddar, if desired, and tortilla chips alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Zinfandel, Syrah, Tempranillo, Malbec]&quot; 34528,&quot;Orange-Vanilla Frozen Custard 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 1/2 cups whole milk 3 large eggs 1 cup sugar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2/3 cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed 4 teaspoons grated orange zest Instructions: Whisk the cornstarch and 1/2 cup milk in a small bowl until smooth. Whisk the eggs, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan; whisk in the cornstarch mixture and the remaining 1 cup milk until smooth. Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring, until thick enough to coat a spoon, 7 to 8 minutes (do not boil). Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then set the bowl in a larger bowl of ice water. Add the cream and stir until cool. Remove from the ice bath; stir in the vanilla, orange juice concentrate and orange zest. Cover and chill until cold. Freeze the custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions.

When the oil is hot, render the sausage for about 3 minutes. Add the onions, celery, and bell peppers and saute for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are wilted. Add the corn bread and chicken stock and mix well. Season the dressing with salt and cayenne. Cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Season the entire turkey with Essence. Stuff the duck into the turkey. Stuff the remaining space with the dressing.

Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes. While the water comes to a boil and the pasta cooks, cut the zucchini with the fine French-fry cutter on a mandoline. If you do not have one, cut by hand into the longest, finest julienne you can manage. Season with salt and pepper. If your zucchini is very finely cut, it does not need to be cooked. Otherwise, place in a colander, suspend over the pasta pot, cover the pot, and steam the zucchini until still slightly crunchy, about 2 minutes. Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add the garlic and saute briefly until light brown. Turn on the exhaust fan and add the red pepper flakes. Quickly mix in the basil and parsley and remove from the heat. When the pasta is al dente, drain through a colander, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Pour the pasta into a warm serving bowl; add the zucchini, basil oil, the garlic mixture, and 1/2 cup of the cheese. Toss well, adding cooking water as needed to make a smooth sauce. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper, as needed. Grate about 2 tablespoons Parmesan over the top and serve at once. Cook&#39;s Note: The reason to save the basil oil to toss with the pasta at the end is so the oil will have a fresh, uncooked taste. Basil Oil (and other herb flavored oils):<br> For soft herbs, such as basil, parsley, cilantro or tarragon: Use 4 cups packed leaves to 2 cups pure olive oil. For woody herbs, such as rosemary, sage, thyme, oregano or lemon verbena: Use 1 cup packed leaves to 2 cups pure olive oil. In a blender, puree the herbs and oil until completely smooth. Put the mixture in a saucepan and bring it to a simmer over moderate heat. Simmer for 45 seconds, then pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Don&#39;t press on the mixture, but you can tap the strainer against your hand to get the oil to drip through faster. Immediately strain the oil again through a flat-bottomed paper filter. If the filter clogs, you may need to change the filter partway through. It&#39;s okay to pick the filter up and squeeze it gently to get the oil out faster, but be careful not to break the filter. (Sometimes a little dark liquid comes through the filter first. Don&#39;t worry; that&#39;s water. It will settle to the bottom because it is heavier than the oil.) Let the filtered oil settle for a few hours, then pour it off the dark liquid. Store in an airtight jar in a cool, dark place. Cook&#39;s Notes: The oil passes through the filter faster if it&#39;s filtered while still hot, so set up your filter before you start the recipe. You&#39;ll need a flat-bottomed paper filter, like those used for some drip coffee machines. Cone-shaped filters tend to get clogged.

Add the sugar, egg, brandy, and vanilla and beat until all of the ingredients are integrated. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add sifted flour to the butter mixture. Using a rubber spatula, remove the dough and transfer it onto a piece of waxed paper or parchment. Refrigerate for about 45 minutes before rolling. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. After the dough has cooled, pinch off small pieces and roll them into about 1-inch balls. Place them in a single layer with space in between each, on a greased baking sheet. Repeat the process until all of the cookie dough has been rolled. Place a clove in the center of each cookie. Alternatively, shape the ball into half moons with a clove in the center of each. Place the sheets in the oven and bake until the cookies are just slightly brown, about 15 minutes. Allow them to cool thoroughly, and then roll them in powdered sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34534,&quot;Quick Plantain and Mango Salsa Plate 1 mango, small diced 1 jalapeno, diced 3 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves 1 red pepper, diced 1/2 red onion, diced 3 cups vegetable oil 3 ripe plantains, peeled and sliced Salt Instructions: In a bowl, add mango, jalapeno, cilantro, red pepper and red onion.

Whisk in the flour to make a smooth paste. Cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon and lowering the heat as needed to prevent burning, until the roux is several shades darker than peanut butter, 18 to 20 minutes. Stir in the carrots, celery and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, then whisk in the white wine and cook until the mixture thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Don\\u2019t worry if the vegetables get stuck in the whisk; as you add more liquid, they will release and combine with the sauce. Whisk in the stock, 1 cup at a time, and lower the heat to a simmer. To make a bouquet garni, place the peppercorns, parsley, thyme and bay leaves and in a square of cheesecloth and tie it into a bundle with kitchen twine. Submerge the bouquet garni in the sauce. Simmer the sauce, using a spoon to skim off any fat or scum that rises to the surface, until it reduces by half and has the consistency of gravy, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the bouquet garni, then strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth.

Form into mini meatballs, slightly smaller than a golf ball; it should make 28 to 30 meatballs. Warm the butter and oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Transfer the meatballs to the pan and do not disturb for 3 minutes to brown well. Turn, cooking another 3 minutes without disturbing. Keep cooking until browned and cooked on all sides, but still juicy and plump with a spring to the touch. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Serve atop Collard Green Pesto Linguine, if desired. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Blanch collards until bright green, about 1 minute. Transfer immediately to an ice bath to shock, saving the boiling water for cooking the pasta. Remove the collards from the ice water and pat dry with paper towels before transferring them to a food processor. Add the linguine to the pot of salted boiling water and cook according to package instructions. Meanwhile, in a dry skillet, over low heat, toast the pecans until fragrant.

Add the garlic and heat it for a couple of minutes (don&#39;t brown it). Add the pumpkin, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the chili powder. Cook this filling for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, to warm it and cook off some of the excess liquid. Remove from the heat and let it cool slightly while you get the other components ready. Toast the pine nuts in a small skillet over medium-low heat, tossing and stirring occasionally, until golden. Remove them to a plate and set aside. Next, make browned butter: In the same small skillet, melt the remaining 6 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat; let it cook and bubble up for an additional minute or so, until the foam is golden brown. Watch it carefully and take the pan off the heat as soon as it&#39;s ready. Finally, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon cold water. Now you&#39;re ready for Operation Ravioli. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Lay out a few wonton wrappers at a time and spoon about 2 teaspoons of the pumpkin mixture in the middle of each one. Then, one at a time, dab your finger into the egg wash mixture and \\paint\\ around the pumpkin on the wrapper. Lay a second wonton wrapper on top of each one, match up the edges and press the two wrappers together, gently pressing out any air bubbles as you go. To seal the ravioli, use a knife or square cutter to neatly trim the edges. Set them aside while you work on the rest. Drop a few ravioli at a time into the boiling water. Boil them for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon and place on a platter or serving plates.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add to the dry ingredients. Starting at low speed, beat the butter and dry ingredients. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the butter breaks into small pieces. Then stir in the milk, lemon zest and juice, and vanilla until moistened. Place the dough on a floured surface and fold in the blueberries, being careful not to break them. Form the dough into a long rectangle, about 1 inch thick. Cut the dough into 2 squares. Cut each square in half diagonally, and then cut those pieces in half again. You should have 8 triangles total.<br> Transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart. Bake until golden brown, 17 to 21 minutes. Let cool. Serve with Honey Butter and Blackberry Jam.<br> In a medium bowl, combine the butter and honey and blend thoroughly.

Place the blended butter on a piece of plastic wrap, shaping it into a rectangle. Wrap the butter tightly in the plastic wrap, folding the sides in first and then the top and bottom. Roll into a log and refrigerate until firm. To serve, cut 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices and arrange them in a butter dish. Place the berries in a large stainless steel or enamel saucepan. Bring to a full boil over high heat, mashing the berries with a potato masher as they cook. Add the lemon juice and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring and mashing constantly. Add the sugar and return the mixture to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, until it begins to look syrupy and thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and test for doneness: a candy thermometer should register 220 degrees F and the mixture should coat the back of a spoon. Run a finger--or a clean object about the width of a finger--through the coat of jam. If the jam does not run and fill the gap, it is done. Otherwise, return the pan to the heat for another 1 to 2 minutes and test again. Be careful not to let the mixture get too thick--it will thicken as it cools. (See Cook&#39;s Note) When the jam is done, transfer it to a heatproof jar and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate. The jam will keep for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 34547,&quot;Horseradish Mashed Potatoes 2 pounds red potatoes, skin on, cut into small chunks 2 clove garlic 1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br> 3 sticks butter<br> Salt and fresh ground pepper<br> 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish<br> Instructions: Fill a large pot or pasta pot with about 2 inches of water.

Their color should be light brown, and spices should smell like toast, popcorn, smoky, etc. Pour them straight into a coffee grinder and blend the seeds to a fine powder. Add the lamb to a medium bowl and stir in all of the spices, the garlic and salt. Combine well. Form the lamb mixture into 6 even patties. Open the dried peppers and shake out the seeds (a few seeds left in is ok). Add the peppers to a saucepan with the water, and boil over medium heat until only 1/4 cup of liquid remains at the bottom. Add the peppers (with cooking liquid), sour cream, oil, garlic and lime to a blender, and blend it until very smooth. Add the salt and blend again. Pour in enough cream to thin the mixture to a saucy consistency. Pulse a few times to incorporate and get squirtable consistency. Grill the lamb patties and the ciabatta until nice, dark grill marks are everywhere (lamb is at its juiciest around medium-rare). Put about 1 teaspoon of the sauce on each side of the bun. Slice the patties in half to lay lengthwise on the bread. Crumble the Cotija cheese over the top. Dress Add the onion, tomato slices and lettuce. Cut sandwich lengthwise (along the seam of the lamb patty) and plate with the cross-section facing outward.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]</li></ol><p>&quot; 34562,&quot;Flounder Fish Salad 1/2 cup leftover poaching oil from Oil Poached Flounder, recipe follows 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice 8 to 10 drops hot sauce 2 tablespoons chopped scallions 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 2 lemon slices from Oil Poached Flounder, recipe follows, finely minced 16 ounces leftover Oil Poached Flounder, recipe follows, flaked 3 cups olive oil 1 1/2 to 2 pounds flounder fillets Kosher salt<br> Freshly ground black pepper 2 lemons, thinly sliced 1 small bunch fresh parsley, thoroughly dried Instructions: Whisk together the oil and vinegar in a medium-mixing bowl.

Let stand for at least 30 minutes and up to an hour. Drain the potatoes well. In batches, dry the potatoes on kitchen towels and let them sit for 30 minutes more to absorb any remaining moisture. Fill a fryer or a large, heavy saucepan with 5 inches of oil. Place over high heat and bring the oil up to 315 degrees F. Set a wire rack on a sheet pan and place near the fryer or stove. In batches to avoid crowding, add the potato wedges and fry, shaking them in the basket to separate them, or if in a large pot, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Cook until the potato wedges are pale gold and slightly floppy, about 4 minutes. They should not be browned at this point. Remove from the oil with a wire skimmer and transfer to the wire rack to drain. Bring the oil back up to 315 degrees F and repeat with the remaining potato wedges. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside?do not throw out the oil. Let the potato wedges stand until completely cooled, at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours. Meanwhile, prepare the gravy. In a high-sided skillet or medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and melt. Sprinkle the flour in the pan and cook, whisking until light brown, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the chicken stock and Worcestershire sauce. Continue whisking until there are no lumps. Let the gravy come to a bubble and cook until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Lower the heat and hold there, whisking regularly to keep it from sticking. Now it&#39;s time to finish the French fries. Reheat the fry oil over high heat to 350 degrees F.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 onion and 1 clove garlic, cook, stirring, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the fresh mushrooms, herbs and butter. Saute for 3 to 5 minutes until lightly browned, season with salt and pepper. Drizzle in truffle oil then add the dried porcini mushrooms which were reconstituted in1 cup of warm chicken broth. Season again with salt and fresh cracked pepper. Saute 1 minute then remove from heat and set aside. Coat a saucepan with remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Saute the remaining 1/2 onion and garlic clove. Add the rice and stir quickly until it is well-coated and opaque, 1 minute. This step cooks the starchy coating and prevents the grains from sticking. Stir in wine and cook until it is nearly all evaporated. Now, with a ladle, add 1 cup of the warm broth and cook, stirring, until the rice has absorbed the liquid. Add the remaining broth, 1 cup at a time. Continue to cook and stir, allowing the rice to absorb each addition of broth before adding more. The risotto should be slightly firm and creamy, not mushy. Transfer the mushrooms to the rice mixture. Stir in Parmesan cheese, cook briefly until melted. Top with a drizzle of truffle oil and chopped parsley before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barolo]</p><p>&quot; 34583,&quot;Rotisserie Chicken Fattoush Salad with Sumac Vinaigrette 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 2 tablespoons (30 grams) white wine vinegar Juice of 1 lemon 3/4 teaspoon ground sumac 1/2 cup (100 grams) extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 large pitas, torn into bite-size pieces 2 tablespoons (25 grams) extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 head of butter/Bibb lettuce, leaves separated, or 6 to 8 ounces (170 to 226 grams) chopped romaine 2 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced 4 radishes, thinly sliced 2 scallions, cut into 1-inch pieces 2 avocados, pitted, peeled, and thickly sliced 1/2 cup pickled sliced onions or 1/4 medium red onion, thinly sliced Meat from half a rotisserie chicken, coarsely chopped 1 handful each of coarsely chopped dill, flat-leaf parsley, and mint leaves Flaky salt, optional Instructions: Arrange an oven rack in the middle position.

Heat oven to 500 degrees. With the point of a paring knife, make 1/2-inch slits toward the center all around the roast. Insert the garlic in the slits, accompanied by a needle of rosemary, if using. Rub roast generously with salt and pepper. Place roast and bones, if available, in a roasting pan just large enough to hold them. Roast for 45 to 50 minutes, or until meat reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees. The meat might still be slightly pink, but this is fine. Don&#39;t overcook the roast, or it will be dry and unappealing. Remove roast and bones to a platter. Let meat rest before slicing across. Snip off strings. Juices will collect better in a platter than on a cutting board. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34589,&quot;Roasted Cornish Game Hens Marinated in Honey and Mustard 1/4 cup honey 1/3 cup grainy mustard 2 cloves garlic, chopped 5 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon dried thyme or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 Cornish game hens Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 lemon Instructions: Mix the honey, mustard, garlic, 3 tablespoons oil, thyme and cinnamon together in a bowl and set aside.

Toss the potatoes with the canola oil, 2 tablespoons chopped dill, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Transfer to a grill basket and grill, tossing occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Combine the mayonnaise, cider vinegar, horseradish, mustard, honey, and salt and pepper to taste, and whisk to combine. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Drizzle some of the dressing over the bottom of a large serving platter or shallow bowl. Pour the warm potatoes on top. Scatter the Smoked Trout over the potatoes, then the watercress and dill fronds. Dust with more smoked paprika and drizzle a generous amount of dressing over all. Combine the salt, sugar and 4 cups water in a 4-quart container and stir until the salt has dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the trout, making sure they are submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours. Remove the trout from the brine, rinse thoroughly with cold water and pat dry. Place the trout skin-side down onto a rack set in a half sheet pan. Dry in the refrigerator until the skin becomes shiny and somewhat tacky to the touch, 21 to 24 hours. Prepare the smoker using the alder or applewood chips so that it maintains a temperature of 150 to 160 degrees F. Place the trout onto the smoking racks, skin-side down, separating them by at least 1/4-inch and place into the smoker. Adjust the heat as needed and cook until the fish has cooked through, darkened in color around the edges and has the desired level of smoke flavor, about 20 minutes. Remove from the smoker and cool. Remove the flesh from the skin and gently break into big chunks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 34592,&quot;Flaming Yule Log Cake Nonstick cooking spray, for the jelly roll pans 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 12 large eggs 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons cocoa powder 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 12 ounces bittersweet chocolate 1 1/2 cups heavy cream Two 1/4-ounce packages unflavored gelatin 1 cup granulated sugar 2/3 cup light corn syrup Pinch kosher salt 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 4 ounces chocolate graham crackers, crushed into crumbs Confectioners&#39; sugar, for dusting Candy coal, for decorating Red, yellow and orange gummy bears, snipped into shards, for decorating 1/4 cup brandy Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray two 11-by-10-by-1-inch jelly roll pans with nonstick spray. Line each with parchment, then spray the parchment. In a large heatproof glass bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, vanilla, salt and eggs. Place the bowl over a saucepan with 1 inch of simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is warmed through, about 2 minutes. Pour the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand mixer) and beat until tripled in volume, about 12 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, add the chocolate and butter to a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring in between each, until melted. Set aside to cool slightly.<br> Add the flour and 1/2 cup of the cocoa powder to a sifter or fine-mesh sieve and sift into the egg mixture, then fold to combine. Pour the chocolate mixture into the batter and fold until it is completely combined, being careful not to overmix.<br> Divide the batter between the prepared pans (about 5 1/2 cups per pan). Use an offset or rubber spatula to smooth the tops. Bake until the cakes are set and a tester comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes.<br> While the cakes are baking, sift the confectioners&#39; sugar and remaining 2 tablespoons cocoa powder onto 2 clean kitchen towels that are as least as large as the cake pans.<br> For the filling: To make the ganache, add the chocolate to a medium heatproof bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it comes to a simmer. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir together until completely smooth.<br> Transfer the ganache to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whip attachment. Whip on medium-high until lighter in color and slightly aerated, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer 2 tablespoons to a small bowl and reserve.<br> When the cakes are done, immediately run a butter knife around the edges to loosen them from the pans. Invert each cake onto a prepared towel. Remove the pans and peel off the parchment. Roll up each cake starting with one long side and using the towel as an aid. Transfer the cakes in the towels to a wire rack until mostly cool, 20 to 30 minutes.<br> When cool, unroll one of the cakes. Spread half of the ganache over the cake. Reroll the cake, using the towel to help. Remove the towel, place the cake on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze. Repeat with the remaining cake and ganache, adding it to the same baking sheet in the freezer. Freeze for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.<br> For the topping: Stir together the gelatin and 1/3 cup cold water in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup, salt and 2/3 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved. (If any granules of sugar stick to the side of the pan, brush them back into the sugar-water mixture with a wet pastry brush.) Attach a candy thermometer to the pan and increase the heat to medium high. Cook until the mixture reaches 240 degrees F, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low, slowly pour the sugar syrup into the softened gelatin. Once all the syrup is added, increase the speed to high and whisk until the mixture is very thick and holds stiff peaks, about 20 minutes. Stir in the vanilla.<br> Remove the cakes from the freezer. Cut a 2- to 3-inch diagonal piece from the top end of one of the logs and place it on top of the log at an angle, using the reserved ganache to attach it; this will be a branch.<br> Transfer the topping to a piping bag with a long flat tip and pipe the topping onto each cake in lengthwise lines, covering the entire cake. Smooth out the lines with a small offset spatula. (You can also spread the icing straight on the cake instead of piping.) Use the back side of a fork to make small patches of lines and swirls across the length of each log, mimicking the pattern of bark. Return to the freezer for at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours.<br> For the decorations: Meanwhile, prepare your fireplace. Place a roasting rack on a cast-iron griddle or large metal serving platter. Sprinkle the chocolate graham cracker crumbs underneath the rack and add a little confectioners&#39; sugar to make the crumbs look like ash. Arrange the candy coal in the ash and add the gummies to resemble hot coals.<br> When ready to serve: Remove the logs from the freezer and trim the ends to reveal the swirls. Place one frozen log in the roasting rack with the un-frosted bottom hidden. Use a kitchen blowtorch to char the marshmallow topping until it is deep brown. Place the second log on top of the first at an angle to look like logs in a fireplace and char with the kitchen blowtorch. Heat the brandy in a small saucepan over high heat until warm, about 30 seconds. Carefully carry the saucepan over to the Yule logs and light the brandy on fire using a long stick lighter. Pour the flaming brandy over the Yule logs and watch them burn. Slice and serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34593,&quot;Philly Cheese Steak Stromboli 1 pound beef rib steak, sliced thin Salt and freshly ground black pepper All-purpose flour, for rolling dough One 16-ounce ball pizza dough 2 cups shredded mild cheese blend, such as provolone, mozzarella and Parmesan 1 cup tomato sauce (gravy) 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley 2 eggs, beaten, for egg wash Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> For the beef filling, sprinkle the slices with salt and pepper. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the beef and cook until cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes. During this time, stir and shred the beef with tongs or a spatula. The beef should be a shredded cheese steak consistency. Once cooked, remove from the heat and allow to cool until building the stromboli.<br> On a clean, dry work surface sprinkled with flour, roll the pizza dough into a 10 by 14-inch rectangle, making sure not to flip the dough over, just rotating by 90 degrees as needed. Once the dough is rolled out, sprinkle half the cheese in the center, leaving a 2-inch border on all sides. Top with the beef, followed by the tomato sauce, in a stacked fashion. Top with the herbs and the remaining cheese. Brush the edges with some of the egg wash. Fold the bottom and top edges over the filling, and then fold the sides over twice, 1-inch at a time, resulting in a 6 by 14-inch tube. Brush the outside of the stromboli with the remaining egg wash, place on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and bake until firm and golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes.

Let sit for 20 minutes then drain in a strainer, pressing to extract the excess liquid. In a large bowl, blend the beef, onions, cumin, salt, and pepper to a paste. Add the strained bulgur wheat and mix well. Process again, in batches, in a food processor until smooth and pliable enough to work like a dough, adding a little ice water if needed. To make the stuffing, in a large skillet, cook the meat, stirring, over medium-high heat until browned, about 4 minutes. Add the onions, salt, allspice, pepper, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring, until tender, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the pine nuts. Let sit until cool enough to handle. To make the final dish, with wet hands, shape the raw meat-bulgur mixture into egg-sized balls. Make a hole down the center of each ball with an index finger to make a deep cup with a pointed bottom. Stuff each ball with about 1 tablespoon of the stuffing. Press down on the sides and top to enclose the filling and reshape into a smooth egg with a pointed top. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, wetting your hands frequently. Preheat the oil to 360 degrees F. In batches, add the kibbeh balls to the hot oil and cook until golden brown and the meat is cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

To make the pesto: In a blender, combine the arugula, spinach, Parmesan, garlic, and sliced almonds. Blend on low and slowly drizzle in the olive oil and the lemon juice. Blend for about 45 seconds, or until the mixture completely emulsifies. Remove from the blender and season with salt and pepper. To make the galettes: Cut the puff pastry sheets into 6 (6-inch) round circles. Place each circle on a parchment-lined pan. Spread about 3 tablespoons of arugula pesto over the top of each puff pastry circle. Sprinkle the roasted peppers evenly on top. Divide the feta cheese evenly over the top. Bake in the oven for approximately 30 to 35 minutes until the puff pastry is golden brown and the cheese is melted. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 34598,&quot;Individual Peach Tarte Tatin 8 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup sugar 1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise 1 cinnamon stick, 2 to 3 inches 1 tablespoon vanilla brandy or plain brandy 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated orange zest 6 peaches, halved and pitted 2 sheets puff pastry Instructions: Melt the butter in a saucepan until it bubbles. Add the sugar and stir with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add the vanilla bean and cinnamon stick and stir to combine, pressing on the vanilla bean to bring out the vanilla seeds inside. Continue simmering until caramel in color, about 5 minutes. The mixture might not look smooth and blended at this point. Stir in the brandy, lemon juice and orange zest and continue cooking until smooth, about 5 minutes more. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F and arrange the ramekins on a cookie sheet. Pour 2 tablespoons of caramel into the bottom of each ramekin. Arrange 1 peach half in each ramekin. Pour a little more caramel over the peaches and bake until the caramel is bubbling and the peaches are almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. (The recipe can be made up to this point, cooled to room temperature, and refrigerated overnight. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.) Meanwhile, use a cutter or sharp knife, cut the puff pastry into 12 rounds, slightly larger than the diameter of your ramekins (they will shrink during the baking). Remove the ramekins from the oven and turn it up to 425 degrees F. Top each ramekin with a round of puff pastry and bake until the pastry is golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Let cool at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours. When ready to serve, re-warm the tarts slightly to loosen the caramel by placing them in a shallow pan of very hot water, or on a flame tamer on your stovetop, set over medium heat. Unmold upside down onto small plates and serve, with the peaches up and the pastry on the bottom. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 34599,&quot;White Cake 14 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans 2 1/2 cups cake flour, plus more for the pans 1 tablespoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/3 cups sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups whole milk, at room temperature 4 large egg whites, at room temperature Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of two 9-by-2-inch round cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper and butter the parchment. Flour the pans and tap out the excess. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter, 1 cup sugar and the vanilla in a large bowl with a mixer on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until pale and fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the speed to low; beat in the flour mixture in two batches, alternating with the milk. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until smooth and glossy, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Beat the egg whites in a clean bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until foamy. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/3 cup sugar until stiff glossy peaks form, about 5 minutes. Fold half the egg whites into the batter, then fold in the rest. Divide the batter between the pans. Bake the cakes until lightly browned, beginning to pull from the sides and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 15 minutes in the pans.

Add the butter and mix just until it&#39;s a crumbly, sandy mixture. The pieces of butter should still be visable. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. Again, the bits of butter should be visable. Turn the dough out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape it into 2 round, flat disks. Wrap them separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don&#39;t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough a quarter turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don&#39;t do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than the pan. Set a 10-inch metal pie pan nearby. Transfer the crust to the pan by folding it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan. Don&#39;t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don&#39;t be concerned; it&#39;s easily repaired. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. Leave the edges of the bottom crust hanging over the rim. Roll out the second piece of dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Line a sheet pan with parchment or waxed paper. Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, then unroll it onto the sheet pan. Chill the finished crust or crusts for 20 to 30 minutes before filling the pie. To make the filling: Add sugar to a saucepan over medium high heat. Bring sugar to a boil and cook until caramelized, sugar will be a light amber color. Carefully add the butter, spices and apples. Cook for about 5 minutes, until almost tender. Off the heat add the Southern Comfort and flambe the mixture, cooking for an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Drain the mixture. Reserve the juice (it can be frozen) for a sauce for the pie. Toss the apples with the cornstarch and spread them out on a sheet pan to cool. Fill the pie with the cooled apples then rest the top crust on top, trim the top and bottom flush to the pan. Pinch the edges together, turning them under all the way around. Then press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \\V\\ with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Snip a \\X\\ shape vent in the top center of the pie using scissors or a sharp paring knife. Wrap the pie in plastic wrap and freeze until ready to bake and serve. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Before baking the frozen pie, brush the surface of the piecrust with cream and sprinkle with sugar. Bake for 10 minutes then turn the oven down to 375 degrees F and bake until light golden brown, about 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Merlot]&quot; 34601,&quot;Sausage Pizza with Arugula and Grapes 4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound refrigerated pizza dough, at room temperature 1/2 cup ricotta cheese Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 2 ounces Cambozola cheese, rind removed, cut into 1/4-inch pieces 2/3 cup red seedless grapes, halved 2 links hot Italian sausage (about 6 ounces), casings removed, broken into marble-size pieces 1/2 small shallot, thinly sliced and separated into rings 1 tablespoon honey 1 cup baby arugula Instructions: Put a pizza stone or an inverted baking sheet on the lowest rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.

Add approximately 2 cups of the flour along with the yeast and salt; whisk until moistened and combined. Remove the whisk attachment and replace with a dough hook. Add all but 3/4 cup of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. Check the consistency of the dough and add more flour if necessary; the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. Knead on low speed 5 minutes more or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead by hand about 30 seconds. Lightly oil a large bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl, lightly oil the top of the dough, cover and let double in volume, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. For the filling, combine the 8 ounces of sugar, lemon zest, fresh ginger, the 2 tablespoons candied ginger and the 5 ounces flour in a medium bowl. Mix until well combined. Set aside until ready to use. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 12 by 24-inch rectangle. Brush the 1-ounce of melted butter onto the dough and sprinkle the filling over the dough; press the filling lightly so it sticks to the dough. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Brush the beaten egg along the edge for a secure seal. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll cylinder seam side down. Brush the 2 ends with a little of the beaten egg and bring together to shape into a ring and firmly press together. Place on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 16 hours. Remove the ring from the refrigerator, remove the plastic wrap and snip the top with scissors every 2 inches. Place in an oven that is turned off. Fill a shallow pan 2/3 full of boiling water and set on the rack below the ring. Close the oven door and let the dough rise until the ring looks slightly puffy, approximately 30 minutes. Remove the ring and the shallow pan of water from the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When the oven is ready, place the ring on the middle rack and bake until golden brown, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, approximately 30 minutes. While the ring is baking, make the glaze by combining the jam, 1-ounce candied ginger, and the water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer. Stir and cook until the jam is melted and well mixed with the water, about 3 to 5 minutes. Continue to simmer until reduced and thickened slightly, about 3 to 5 minutes. Brush over the warm ring.

Enjoy! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 34644,&quot;The Standard Grill Million Dollar Chicken 3 1/2 pound whole chicken, preferably organic Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 3 to 4 garlic cloves, lightly smashed 1 lemon 1 bay leaf 5 sprigs fresh thyme Olive oil 1 slice sourdough, cut 3/4-inch thick (day old bread is perfect!) Maldon salt 1 cup creme fraiche 1 lemon, zested and juiced 1 tablespoon shallots, grated on a fine zester 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper Instructions: The day before you plan to cook the chicken, season it well inside and out with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity of the chicken with the garlic, 1 of the lemons, the bay leaf and thyme. Refrigerate. (The bird can be trussed with butcher twine if you are so inclined, but it is not necessary.) On the day/night you plan to cook the bird, take the chicken out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before you plan to roast it. Preheat the oven to 425 to 450 degrees.<br> In a pan large enough to accommodate the chicken, oil the pan lightly with olive oil, place the piece of sourdough in the center of the pan and then put the chicken on top of the bread. Drizzle the bird with olive oil or brush with butter (we use olive oil at the Grill). Place the pan in the oven and roast for 40 to 50 minutes, basting it every 12 to 15 minutes with the fat and drippings that render from the bird. White the chicken roasts, assemble the glaze by combining all of the ingredients and whisking them together. When the chicken is almost done (the juices are running pink and/or the legs are beginning to wiggle a bit when you give them a shake), take a pastry brush and slather on a bit of the creme fraiche glaze. The glaze will begin to caramelize. Brush on another layer and let this last glazing caramelize. At this point the chicken should be cooked through and nicely golden brown. The sourdough underneath the chicken will be nicely browned and crisped on the side in contact with the pan, and moist and juicy on the side in contact with the chicken. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before cutting it into serving pieces. Cut the sourdough into 2 to 4 pieces and serve with the chicken. Garnish with lemon wedges and sprinkle it with Maldon salt. (Alternatively, you can roast the chicken almost entirely through. Let it rest, split it in half and then glaze it with the creme fraiche under the broiler, brushing with the creme fraiche until you achieve golden brown, crackling skin. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 34645,&quot;Asian Poultry Burger 8 ounces ground chicken or turkey 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh garlic 1 tablespoon Oriental sesame oil 2 to 4 tablespoons bread crumbs 1 medium carrot, peeled 1 kirby cucumber, peeled Vegetable oil for frying 2 sesame seed hamburger buns, halved and toasted Instructions: In a mixing bowl combine the ground chicken, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and sesame oil.

Cook the bacon in a saute pan over medium-high heat, turning once, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon to paper towels to drain. Reserve the bacon fat in the pan. Form the ground beef into 4 patties, each about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Season the patties with salt and cracked black pepper, to taste. Put the burgers on the grill or in the grill pan and cook for 3 minutes. Flip and top each burger with a slice of cheese. Grill for 3 minutes for medium- rare. Remove them to a plate. Add the English muffins to the grill or grill pan and toast for 1 minute. Cook the eggs sunny side up in the bacon fat while the burgers rest. Build the burgers by sandwiching them between the muffin halves along with pickle slices, red onion, bacon, an egg, and some spicy ketchup. Pack the onions in 2 (1-quart) jars and cover with enough water to come within 1/2-inch of the rim. Pour the water out into a measuring cup. Note the volume, pour off half the water, and replace it with vinegar. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and 2 tablespoons salt for every 3 cups of liquid. Pour the vinegar mixture into a nonreactive saucepan, add the mustard seeds, red pepper flakes, coriander seeds, black peppercorns, garlic, and bay leaves, and bring to a boil over high heat. Allow the liquid to boil for 2 minutes, and then remove it from the heat. Pour the hot liquid into the jars to cover the onions and screw on the lids. Refrigerate for up to 1 month. In a nonreactive 2-quart saucepan over medium heat add the olive oil. Add the onion, garlic, and a large pinch of salt. Saute until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the Fresno chiles, ancho cl, and red pepper flakes. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the brown sugar, cumin, cinnamon, tomato paste, and vinegar and simmer for 10 minutes.

Pierce potatoes with a fork and cook on high in microwave 5 minutes. Remove potatoes from microwave oven and cool for 5 minutes. While potatoes are working, add chopped bacon to a large skillet over medium high heat and brown until crisp. Remove to paper towels to drain, wipe pan and return to heat. Preheat your broiler to high. Preheat a nonstick griddle pan for frying eggs over medium heat. Chop or wedge potatoes. Add oil to the skillet which you returned to the heat, then potatoes. Begin to brown and crisp potatoes, 2 minutes on each side. Use this time to chop your salsa ingredients. Combine salsa in a small bowl and season with salt. Back to the hash: add the mushrooms to potatoes. Brown mushrooms a minute or 2, then add peppers and onions and season mixture with grill seasoning blend or salt and pepper, then hot sauce. Cook 3 to 5 minutes longer until veggies are just tender and potatoes are cooked through. Turn off heat and add bacon back to the pan. Combine bacon with the veggies then add cheese to the pan to evenly cover the mixture. Tent the skillet with foil to gently melt cheese over vegetables and potatoes and to retain heat.

Mix in the water until combined. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 1/2 hours or up to overnight. Position a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 475 degrees F. Cut out 2 big sheets of parchment paper, and dust liberally with flour. Divide the dough into two pieces, and place each on a piece of parchment. The dough will be very sticky, so don&#39;t be shy in dusting it with enough flour as needed to handle it. Roll out on the parchment until the dough is very thin and about 12 inches in diameter, dusting with flour as needed. For the toppings: Brush each round with 1 tablespoon olive oil and top them with the garlic, shallot, mozzarella, spinach and ham. Toss the potatoes with the remaining tablespoon olive oil in a medium bowl and distribute the potatoes over the pizzas in a single layer, not allowing the potatoes to overlap. Sprinkle everything with a good pinch of salt and a few turns of pepper. Using a pizza peel or baking sheet, slide one of the pizzas on its parchment onto the pizza stone and bake until the cheese is splotchy with brown marks and the potatoes are browned, about 12 minutes.

Half-fill the sink with cold water. This is just a precaution in case the custard looks as if it&#39;s about to split, in which case you should plunge the pan into the water and whisk the custard. I&#39;m not saying it will - with so many egg yolks in the rich cream, it thickens quickly and easily enough - but I always feel better if I&#39;ve done this.<br> Put the cream and vanilla bean into a saucepan and bring to the boiling point, but do not let boil. Beat the eggs and sugar together in a bowl, and, still beating, pour the flavored cream over it, bean and all. Rinse and dry the pan and pour the custard mix back in. Cook over medium heat (or low, if you&#39;re scared) until the custard thickens, whisking almost constantly: about 10 to 12 minutes should do it. You do not want this to be a good, voluptuous creme, so don&#39;t err on the side of runny caution. Remember, you&#39;ve got your sinkful of cold water to plunge the pan into should it really look as if it&#39;s about to split.<br> When the cream&#39;s thick enough, take out the vanilla bean, retrieve the pie dish and pour the creme into the severely chilled container. Leave to cool, then put in the refrigerator until truly cold. Sprinkle with Demerara sugar, spoonful by spoonful, and burn with a blowtorch until you have a blistered tortoiseshell covering on top.<br> dPut back in the refrigerator if you want, but remember to take it out a good 20 minutes before serving. At which stage, put the bowl on the table and, with a large spoon and unchecked greed, crack through the sugary carapace and delve into the satin-velvet, vanilla-speckled cream beneath.

Batter: In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, cornstarch, milk and salt. Put the mahi mahi strips into the batter, toss gently to coat and let it marinate for at least 1 hour. Stir occasionally, so the cornstarch doesn&#39;t settle to the bottom of the bowl. While the fish marinates make the aioli: In a food processor or blender, add the egg yolks, orange zest, orange juice, garlic, salt and cinnamon. Pulse the ingredients until they are well blended and then, with the processor running, very slowly begin to add the canola oil. The texture you are looking for is that of mayonnaise. Slaw: In a large bowl combine the cabbages, jalapenos, lime zest, lime juice, honey, salt and cilantro. Heat a small nonstick saute pan over medium-low heat. Stir in all of the spice mix ingredients and cook until toasted, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Fill a large, deep saute pan with straight sides, half way up with canola oil and put it over medium heat. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Put the mahi mahi pieces in the oil and cook for about 2 minutes a side. When they are done, remove to a paper towel to drain and immediately sprinkle with the toasted spice mix. You can go as heavy or light with the spice as you like. Repeat this process until all the fish is cooked. Lay 1 to 2 pieces of fish in each taco shell or heated tortilla.

Put 3 tablespoons of the butter in a microwave-safe small bowl or liquid measure; microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute to melt the butter. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, 3 tablespoons of the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, 2 eggs and the melted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Melt a little of the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. Working in batches, pour the batter by 1/4 cupfuls into the skillet and cook until the bottoms are golden brown and small bubbles appear on the tops, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other sides, about 2 minutes. If the pancakes brown too quickly, reduce the heat to medium-low. Transfer the pancakes to a plate as finished. Repeat until all the batter is used, adding more butter to the skillet as necessary. (You should have at least 12 pancakes.) Whisk together the half-and-half, the remaining 5 eggs, the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, the pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Shingle half of the pancakes in the prepared baking dish. Scatter with half of the sausage, sprinkle with half of the cheese and scallions. Pour half the egg mixture evenly over the pancakes. Repeat with the remaining pancakes, sausage, cheese, scallions and egg mixture. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to overnight to allow the pancakes to soak in the custard. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap, cover the casserole loosely with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until golden brown, the custard is set and the center feels firm but springy, about 30 minutes more. Let cool 15 minutes before serving.

Line one or two baking sheets with an absorbent kitchen towel and set aside. Use a mandoline slicer (with the safety guard) to cut the potatoes into chips 1/8- to 1/10-inch thick. Drop them into the cold water as sliced to rinse some of the starch off. Add a generous amount of salt and the vinegar to the boiling water. Drop half of the potato slices into the water. Simmer for about 3 minutes to soften slightly. Use a slotted spoon or spider to transfer the potatoes to the prepared baking sheet to dry, spreading the potatoes in a single layer. Repeat with the remaining potatoes. Get ready to fry: Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or other wide, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until it registers 325 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Line another baking sheet fitted with a dry kitchen towel and set aside. Drop 1 tester chip in the oil. It should start to bubble and slowly rise to the surface. If not, heat the oil a touch higher and try again. Fry: Drop the chips, one by one, like you\\u2019re dealing cards in a poker game, into the oil, and gently swirl the oil as they fry. The swirling will assure that they fry more evenly on all sides. Fry about a quarter of the chips at a time. When they are crispy and lightly golden, about 10 minutes, use a slotted spoon or spider to transfer them to the lined baking sheet to cool, again arranging them in a single layer. Immediately sprinkle with salt, malt vinegar powder, if using, and the garlic powder. Allow the oil to return to 325 degrees F between batches.

Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender or 2 knives used like a scissor, or mix with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the ice water over the flour mixture, tossing with a fork; adjust enough of the remaining water, by the tablespoon, tossing, so that the dough holds together. Flatten into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into an 11-inch circle. Fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the edge under to make a stand-up edge; crimp. Prick the bottom all over with a fork. Bake until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove the pie plate to a wire rack to cool. Make the filling: In a heatproof bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks to break up, and then set aside. In a small, heavy saucepan, stir together the sugar, flour and salt. Gradually stir in the scalded milk. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking, until thickened and bubbly, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir a little of the hot mixture into the yolks. Stir the yolk mixture back into the saucepan. Heat over very low heat, stirring, for 2 minutes, and do not let boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Whisk in the chocolate, butter, and vanilla until melted and smooth. Scrape into a clean bowl. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the filling and let cool for 10 minutes. Remove the plastic wrap and scrape the filling into the piecrust. Cool on a wire rack. Make the meringue: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small saucepan, stir together the cornstarch, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and the water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture comes to a simmer and thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat. In a large bowl, add the salt to the egg whites. With an electric mixer at medium speed, beat just until soft peaks form. Add the cornstarch mixture and beat until creamy. Gradually beat in the remaining sugar and continue to beat until soft peaks form, 6 to 8 minutes. Spread the meringue mixture over the cooled chocolate filling, make sure the meringue touches the piecrust edge all the way around. Bake until the meringue is golden and its internal temperature registers 150 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve soon after.

Preheat the broiler. Pull out the cores of the red peppers; then halve them lengthwise and remove the ribs and seeds. Toss the peppers with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Place them on a cookie sheet, skin side up, and broil for 10 minutes, until really charred and blistered. Put the peppers into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and steam for about 10 minutes to loosen the skins. Peel the peppers and roughly chop into chunks; set aside. Season the flour with the garlic powder, dried oregano, and a fair amount of salt and pepper. Whisk the egg and milk together in a shallow bowl. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour and tap off the excess. Dip each piece in the egg wash to coat and then dredge with the flour again. Place a Dutch oven over medium heat and pour in about 1/4-inch of oil. Pan-fry the chicken in batches, skin side down, until crisp, about 8 minutes. Turn the chicken over and brown the other side about 10 minutes longer. Remove the chicken to a side plate, pour out the oil, and clean out the pot. Put the pot back on the stove and coat with 1/4 cup of oil. Add the garlic, onion, tomatoes, lemon slices, anchovies, capers, red pepper flakes, half the roasted red peppers, and half the basil.

Tuck the chicken into the stewed peppers and pour in the wine. Turn the heat down to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 34722,&quot;Sticky Monkey Bread 1 cup chopped pecans 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter 1 cup packed light brown sugar 3/4 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons dark rum 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 batch Basic Sweet-Roll Dough, recipe follows, without nutmeg 1/2 cup whole milk 1 1/4 -ounce packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 1/4 cup sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled, plus more for brushing 1 large egg yolk 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Pour the water around the edge of the pan carefully to avoid any splashing up of the water or sugar crystals onto the walls of the pan. Draw your finger through it in an \\X\\ to let the water infiltrate the sugar completely. Bring the sugar water to a boil and, without stirring, continue to cook until amber colored.<br> Meanwhile, oil the sharpening steel very lightly with vegetable oil.<br> Test the color of the caramel periodically by placing a drop of it on a white plate. When it?s slightly lighter than you want it to be, stop the cooking by placing the bottom of the pot in a bowl of ice water. Swirl it a bit to distribute the cooling. When the caramel has cooled enough to slowly fall from a spoon, gather up a glob (about 1 tablespoon) on the dessert spoon and hold it over the saucepan. Let it drop and, once you have a strand falling from the spoon, hold the sharpening steel over the sauce pan and wind the strand around it. Work your way up the steel, forming a spring, and when you reach the end of the steel, pinch the end of the caramel to cut it off.<br> Let cool slightly, about 30 seconds, then slide it off the steel. Place in an airtight container with folded parchment paper in between each boing. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vin Santo, Tawny Port]&quot; 34729,&quot;Cinnamon Raisin Bread Big Beautiful White Pan Loaf dough, 1 batch 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon 3 tablespoons sugar 1 1/2 cups, (7.5 ounces) dark raisins, 2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour Instructions: Mix one batch of the White Pan Loaf dough according to instructions given in recipe. Place the just mixed dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75 degrees to 77 degrees) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not spring back.) While the dough is rising, place the raisins in a bowl or a plastic container and fill with warm water to come just below the top of the raisins. (If you use too much water, you will rinse away the natural sweetness of the raisins.) Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface. Gently deflate the dough and pat it into a rectangle that is about 3/4 of an inch thick, and about 6 inches by 12 inches in size. The short sides should be the top and bottom edges. Mix the cinnamon and sugar together, and sprinkle it evenly over the dough. Drain the raisins and toss them with the remaining 2 tablespoons flour. Spread the raisins evenly over the dough and gently press them into it. Starting at a short side, roll the dough into a log. Roll the dough tightly, keeping the skin of the dough slightly taut, and tucking in any raisins that fall out, but don&#39;t stretch the dough so tight that the skin tears. Seal the seam of the log gently but tightly using the heel of your hand against the surface of the table, or pinch it shut with your fingers. Place the loaf in an oiled or buttered 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, and cover with oiled plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the loaf has risen almost 1 inch above the sides of the pans. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place the loaf pan on the center oven rack. Using a plant sprayer, mist the loaf 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut the oven door. Spray the bread again after 2 minutes. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is deep brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. The crust may color quickly because of the cinnamon and raisins in the dough; watch carefully and cover the top of the loaf loosely with foil if it is browning too fast. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove the bread from the pan and place the loaf on a rack to cool. Let cool completely before slicing, or the bread will fall apart. This bread keeps well for at least 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]&quot; 34730,&quot;Chocolate Fudge Cake with Vanilla Buttercream Frosting and Chocolate Ganache Glaze 3 cups packed brown sugar 3/4 cup canola oil 3 eggs 2 2/3 cups flour 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder 2 1/4 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups milk 1 1/2 cups water 1 1/8 cups cocoa powder 1 1/2 pounds sweet butter, soft 3 cups sifted powdered sugar 2 tablespoons vanilla extract 1 pinch salt 1 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips 3/4 tablespoon light corn syrup 3/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Oil 3 (10-inch) cake pans and line the bottom with parchment paper. Alternately, oil the pans and then flour them. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the brown sugar and oil. Turn on the mixer to a low speed and mix in the eggs. Let the sugar, oil, and eggs mix while sifting together the flour, baking powder, soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Set this mixture aside. In another small bowl, mix the vanilla into the milk and set this aside as well. Bring the water to a boil and pour over the cocoa and whisk it until it is smooth. To the egg mixture, alternately add the flour mixture and the milk mixture beginning and ending with flour. With the mixer off, scrape down the sides of the bowl after each addition. With the mixture at a low speed add the cocoa. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and pour this mixture into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cake for approximately 15 minutes or until tester comes out clean. When cake layers have cooled, remove from pans and refrigerate until cold. To make the frosting: In an electric mixing bowl place the soft butter and beat it on a low speed while adding powdered sugar. When all the sugar is mixed in, turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add in the vanilla and salt and let the mixer beat for 5 to 7 minutes on a medium speed. Fill and frost the cake and refrigerate it for 10 to 20 minutes to set up the frosting. To make the ganache: In a heatproof bowl, place the chocolate chips and the corn syrup. Bring the heavy cream to a full boil. Pour the cream over the chocolate and whisk it until smooth then set it aside.Pour ganache over the top of the cake and, with a cake spatula, smooth the top of the cake and allow ganache to spill over the sides. Refrigerate for 20 minutes or longer. Serve the cake cold or allow it to come to room temperature before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Zinfandel]&quot; 34731,&quot;Roasted Butternut Squash Pastina Served in a Pumpkin 1 large pumpkin, about 6 pounds Extra-virgin olive oil, for oiling pumpkin, plus 2 tablespoons Salt and freshly ground pepper About 4 cups chicken stock or canned low-salt chicken broth 1 cup finely chopped onion 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 1/2 pounds dried pastina or other small pasta, such as riso<br> 2 cups roasted butternut squash (see recipe below) 1/2 turkey breast, pre-cooked, chopped small 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus a small piece for garnishing Balsamic vinegar dressing, optional About 3 pounds butternut squash, 1 large squash Salt and freshly ground pepper 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage leaves 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 dark unsulphured molasses<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Cut the lid off the pumpkin and scoop out the seeds and fibers. Scrape away some of the flesh, especially around the top, to form a large, smooth inner cavity. Make sure to leave the shell at least 1-inch thick all around. Oil the pumpkin inside and out and season inside with salt and pepper. Replace the lid. Place on a baking sheet and bake until about 2/3 cooked but still firm enough to stand and act as the soup container, about 40 minutes. Do not over-bake. If a good deal of liquid gathers in the bottom, spoon out and discard. Set aside; it will stay warm on its own for a good while.<br> Bring the stock to a low simmer in a saucepan. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the onion and cook until soft but not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the thyme, stir, and add the pastina. Stir and add 2 cups of heated stock. Bring the mixture up to a simmer.<br> Simmer, adding the stock 1/2 cup at a time as the previous addition is absorbed and stirring occasionally to prevent the pastina from sticking to the bottom of the pan, until the pasta is al dente, about 15 minutes. Add the roasted squash and turkey to reheat. Stir well. The consistency should be quite loose, like a thick soup. Add more stock, if necessary. Add the 1/2 cup cheese and let melt for a moment before stirring in. Taste for seasoning.<br> Fill the reserved pumpkin shell with the pastina. Grate Parmesan on top and replace the lid and take to the table immediately.<br> You could also serve this in individual tureens using smaller pumpkins or acorn squash. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Halve lengthwise, discard the seeds, then cut into 1-inch dice. Place in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter ceases to foam and has turned a light brown immediately add the sage, vinegar, sugar (stand back so as not to get splattered), and molasses. Mix well and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors.<br> Pour the vinegar mixture over the squash and toss well. Season with salt and pepper then transfer to a heavy rimmed baking sheet or baking dish large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. Place in the preheated oven and roast, tossing at least once, until very tender and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm, so the liquids are runny.<br> Working in batches, if necessary, transfer the warm squash and all the cooking liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Use immediately, refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 34732,&quot;Molasses-Mustard Glazed Pork Skewers 1/4 cup molasses 1/2 cup Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon honey Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 (1-pound) pork tenderloins, cut into medallions and pounded thin Olive oil 16 (6-inch) wooden skewers, soaked in cold water for 30 minutes Instructions: Heat grill to high. Whisk together the molasses, mustard, and honey in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Skewer 1 piece of pork onto 2 skewers so that the meat lies flat. Brush the meat with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until cooked through, brushing with the glaze every minute.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, GSM Blends]&quot; 34733,&quot;Honey Bourbon Caramel Milkshakes 2 cups honey bourbon 4 cups sugar<br> 3 cups heavy cream<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter<br> 4 teaspoons flaky sea salt, plus extra for topping<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1 quart vanilla ice cream<br> 2 cups whole milk<br> 1 quart whipped cream<br> Instructions: Pour 1 1/3 cups water and the bourbon into a medium saucepan and set over high heat. Carefully pour the sugar directly into the center so none of it splashes up the sides of the pan. Bring to a boil and cook until the sugar starts to turn brown. Do not stir the pan. If necessary, gently swirl the pan to help melt all the sugar. Once the sugar turns a deep, rich brown, remove the pan from the heat and pour in the heavy cream slowly and carefully. It will splatter a little and the caramel will seize up if the cream is added too quickly. Add the butter, salt and vanilla. Swirl the pan until the butter dissolves completely and evenly into the caramel sauce. The butter makes it shiny and rich. Drizzle a little caramel sauce into each of the tall milkshake glasses. Combine the ice cream, milk and the remaining caramel sauce in the blender, reserving a little caramel on the side to garnish the tops of the milkshakes at the end. Blend until smooth and pour into the glasses. Top each with a little whipped cream, a pinch of sea salt and a drizzle of the reserved caramel sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Bourbon, Maple Syrup, Chardonnay, Brandy]&quot; 34734,&quot;Dad&#39;s Meatloaf with Tomato Relish Extra-virgin olive oil 1 onion, finely diced 2 garlic cloves, minced 2 bay leaves 2 red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and finely diced 2 tomatoes, halved, seeded, and finely diced 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 (12-ounce) bottle ketchup 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 slices white bread, crusts removed, torn into chunks by hand 1/4 cup whole milk 1 1/2 pounds ground beef 1 pound ground pork 2 eggs Leaves from 2 fresh thyme sprigs Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 to 4 bacon slices Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a skillet with a 2-count of oil and place over medium heat. Saute the onion, garlic, and bay leaves for a few minutes to create a base flavor. Throw in the red peppers and cook them for a couple of minutes to soften. Now add the tomatoes; adding them at this point lets them hold their shape and prevents them from disintegrating. Stir in the parsley, ketchup, and Worcestershire; season with salt and pepper. Simmer the relish for 5 minutes to pull all the flavors together. Remove it from the heat; you should have about 4 cups of relish. Place the torn white bread in a bowl and add the milk to just barely cover, swish the bread around in the milk and let it sit while you get the rest of the ingredients for the meat loaf together. This is where you get your hands dirty! In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef and pork with 1 1/2 cups of the tomato relish, the eggs, and thyme; season with salt and pepper. Squeeze the excess milk from the bread and add the soaked bread to the meat mixture. To test, fry a small \\hamburger\\ patty of the meatloaf until cooked; the patty should hold together but still have a soft consistency. Taste the patty for seasoning. Lightly oil a cookie sheet. Transfer the meat mixture to the center of the cookie sheet and form into a log about 9 inches long and about 4 inches wide. Coat the top of the meatloaf with another 1/2 cup of the tomato relish. Lay the bacon across the top lengthwise. Bake the meatloaf for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until the bacon is crisp and the meatloaf is firm. Rotate the meat loaf while it&#39;s baking every now and then to insure that the bacon browns evenly. Remove the meatloaf from the oven and let it cool a bit before slicing. Serve with the remaining tomato relish on the side.

Cut off the top third of the head of garlic, exposing the tops of the garlic cloves. Put the garlic on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and add the thyme sprigs. Wrap tightly with foil and roast until the cloves are golden brown and very soft, about 45 minutes. Unwrap the garlic and let stand until cool enough to handle. Pour any garlic-flavored oil from the foil pouch into a small bowl; squeeze the roasted cloves into the same bowl, discarding the papery shells. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, the chopped thyme and an additional 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and mash with a fork until smooth. Lay the bottom half of the bread on a piece of aluminum foil that is long enough to wrap the bread. Spread on half of the roasted garlic mixture and top with half of the Parmesan. Repeat with the remaining bread, garlic mixture and Parmesan. Press the halves together so the fillings are on the inside and wrap with the foil. Bake until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.

Arrange the puff pastry on a baking sheet and dust with some confectioners&#39; sugar. Bake until golden and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Remove from the baking sheet, cut out 8 circles, and set aside. Leave the oven on. For the pate a choux: Heat the butter and 1 liter water in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to boil, then remove from the heat and add the flour and salt, stirring until combined. Return to the heat for 1 minute, stirring. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer and let cool for 5 minutes. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, one at a time, mixing until well combined. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe cream puffs onto two buttered baking sheets. Bake, switching and rotating the baking sheets halfway through, until cooked through, about 25 minutes. Set aside to cool. For the sugar decoration: Add the isomalt crystals to a large Pyrex measuring cup; microwave in 30 second increments to melt. Set aside to cool slightly, then dip a whisk in the melted isomalt and fling slightly to make long strings of pulled sugar. Set aside. For the custard: Wrap a rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap and set aside. In a large pot, combine the milk, cream, vanilla bean and 250 grams of the sugar. Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining 40 grams sugar until light and fluffy. Once the milk mixture boils, add the flour to the egg yolk mixture and then add a spoonful of the boiling milk. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the boiling milk, whisking constantly; continue whisking until it returns to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat and pour onto the prepared baking sheet; fish out and discard the vanilla bean. Place in the freezer until fully cooled. For the chantilly cream: Add the cream to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add some of the vanilla bean seeds, scraped from the pod, along with a spoonful of the confectioners&#39; sugar. (Reserve the remainder of the vanilla bean for another use.) Beat to soft peaks. Transfer a tenth of the whipped cream to a pastry bag fitted with a medium round tip. Poke the tip into the bottom of the cream puffs to fill them with cream. Fold the custard into the remaining whipped cream to make diplomat cream. To serve: Set a circle of puff pastry down on 4 plates, then add some diplomat cream to the center. Top with berries and then another circle of puff pastry. Arrange a cream puff next to the pastry. Pipe some chantilly cream on top of each pastry, add more berries to the plates, and top with the isomalt pulled sugar.

Drizzle the mushrooms with olive oil, and then sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside. Try not to eat them before the macaroni&#39;s done. Turn down the heat to 350 degrees F. Next, fry the thick slices of bacon until chewy, but not yet crisp. Chop up the bacon into bite-size bits. Set aside. Try not to eat them before the macaroni&#39;s done. In a large skillet over medium-low heat, saute the onions in 1 tablespoon of the butter, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set aside. Try not to... oh, never mind. Cook the macaroni until just undercooked. Set aside. To make the sauce, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour, whisking to combine. Let the roux cook for a minute or so, whisking constantly. Then pour in the milk, whisking constantly. Cook the white sauce until thick and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Next, add the half-and-half, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Spoon some of the hot white sauce into the beaten eggs to temper them, stirring with a fork to incorporate the mixture without cooking the eggs. Pour the tempered eggs into the white sauce, stirring constantly as you add them. Add the fontina, gruyere, Parmesan and goat cheeses. Stir until the cheese all melts. Add the cooked macaroni and stir to coat. Splash in a little milk or hot water if needed for thinning. Butter a 9- by 13-inch baking pan. Lay on half the onions, half the macaroni, half the mushrooms, half the gorgonzola and half the bacon. Repeat the layers, ending with the bacon. Bake until bubbly and hot, 20 to 25 minutes.

Grease a 2-quart glass rectangular baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter. In a large saute pan, over medium-high heat, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add the onions, bell peppers, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. Season generously with black pepper and saute until the onions are soft and start to brown, about 6 minutes. Add the sausage and continue to cook for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and corn and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and cool. In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs for 30 seconds. Add the heavy cream, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, hot pepper sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Whisk the mixture until fully incorporated. Stir in the sauteed sausage mixture. Add the bread cubes and mix well. Pour the filling into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the grated cheese. Bake until golden brown and set, about 55 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the Essence and 1/2 cup of the oil. Mix well. Smear the mixture evenly over each chicken half. Heat 2 large oven-safe saute pans over medium high-heat. When the pans are hot, add enough oil to coat the bottom of each pan. Place 2 chicken halves in each pan, skin side down, and sear until deep golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Turn the chickens over and place in the oven. Roast until juices run clear, about 25 to 30 more minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving. To serve, spoon the pudding in the center of 4 plates. Place the greens next to the pudding. Lay a chicken half directly on top of the pudding. Combine all ingredients thoroughly. In a large, deep pot over medium-high heat, saute the bacon until slightly crisp. Add the onions and season with salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper, to taste. Cook 6 to 7 minutes, until the onions are wilted and golden. Add the brown sugar and stir to dissolve. Add the shallots and garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add the water and vinegar and mix well. Begin adding the greens, 1/3 at a time, pressing them down as they begin to wilt. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, until the greens are tender and soft, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Serve hot.

Turn the chopped beans and pods into a medium saucepan and add 1/2 cup of the sugar. Put the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the sugar starts to melt. Once the sugar has melted, continue to cook, still stirring without stop, until the sugar caramelizes -- you want the color of the caramel to be deep amber, almost mahogany. Now, standing away from the stove so you don&#39;t get splattered, slowly pour in 1 cup of the cream and the milk. Don&#39;t panic -- the caramel will immediately seize and harden, but it will all smooth out as the liquids warm and the sugar melts again. Bring the mixture to a boil and, when the sugar has melted and everything is smooth again, pull the pan from the heat. Cover the pan (we do this with plastic wrap at the cafe to get a good seal) and allow the mixture to infuse for 20 minutes. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Working in a bowl that&#39;s large enough to hold all the ingredients, whisk the yolks and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar together until the mixture is pale and thick. Strain the coffee-cardamom liquid into a measuring cup (discard the beans and pods) and add enough heavy cream to bring the liquid up to 2 cups. Very gradually and very gently -- you don&#39;t want to create air bubbles -- whisk the liquid into the egg mixture; skim off the top foam, if there is any. Arrange six 4-ounce espresso or custard cups in a small roasting pan, leaving an even amount of space between them, and fill each cup nearly to the top with the custard mixture. Carefully slide the pan into the oven; then, using a pitcher, fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the espresso cups. Cover the pan with plastic wrap (don&#39;t worry -- it can stand the heat) and poke two holes in two opposite corners. Bake the custards for about 40 minutes, or until the edges darken ever so slightly and the custards are set but still jiggle a little in the center when you shake them gently. Remove the pan from the oven and let the custards sit in the water bath for 10 minutes. Peel off the plastic wrap, lift the cups out of the water, and cool the custards in the refrigerator. (The pots de creme can be prepared a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator; when they are cool, cover them with plastic wrap.) To serve: The pots de creme are at their best at room temperature, so remove them from the refrigerator and keep them on the counter for about 20 minutes before serving.

Line cupcake pans with cupcake liners (for a total of 28 cupcakes). For the artichoke cake batter: In a food processor, puree the artichokes. Measure out the artichoke puree--you should have about 1 1/3 cups; if not, process more artichokes until you have 1 1/3 cups total. Put the artichokes back in the food processor, add the eggs and process until smooth. Add the artichoke mixture, sugar, olive oil, lemon zest and lemon emulsion to a large bowl and mix for 1 minute until well blended. Mix in the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda until well blended and smooth. Fill the cupcake liners about two-thirds full with the batter. Bake until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 16 to 19 minutes. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting. For the kiwi filling: Put the kiwis in a food processor and pulse until there are still small chunks and the mixture is not completely smooth. Transfer to a bowl, mix in the sugar and instant pectin with a whisk and continue mixing for 3 minutes. Refrigerate until thickened, about 30 minutes. For the frosting: Whisk the sugar and egg whites in a double boiler until the mixture is slippery. In an electric mixer, beat the sugar mixture on high until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Mix in the butter one tablespoon at a time until fully incorporated. Mix in the vanilla bean paste. Use a cupcake corer to remove the centers of the cupcakes. Using a spoon or piping bag, fill the center of each cupcake with some kiwi filling. Using a piping bag, pipe some frosting onto each cupcake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 34766,&quot;Grilled Chicken Breasts with Spicy Peach Glaze 2 cups peach preserves or jam 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for brushing 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic 1 small jalapeno, finely chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 8 frenched chicken breasts 4 ripe peaches, cut in half and pitted Instructions: Combine the peach preserves, olive oil, soy sauce, mustard, garlic and jalapeno in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper.

Use a pastry brush dipped in cold water to wash down any sugar granules from the pot&#39;s sides. Cook over a moderate heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until the color is dark brown and the mixture has the distinctive fragrance of caramel, about 10 to 15 minutes. Pour caramel into a 9-inch round cake pan, coating the bottom and the sides, some caramel will be left over. Swirl to coat evenly. Slowly and carefully add the remaining 3/4 cup of water to the caramel left in the saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook over moderate heat until the caramel dissolves, about 5 minutes. Occasionally stir and brush down the sides with the pastry brush dipped in cold water to prevent crystallization. Set this caramel sauce aside to chill until serving time. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Vin Santo]&quot; 34768,&quot;Chilaquiles with Chorizo 6 ounces Mexican-style pork chorizo (recommended: Reynaldo&#39;s) 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 3 cups Stovetop Salsa, recipe follows Tortilla Chips, recipe follows 4 ounces Cheddar, grated 4 ounces Monterey Jack, grated 1/2 cup sour cream 1 small red onion, finely diced 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves 6 Roma tomatoes 1 large yellow onion, root removed, peeled, and halved 1 jalapeno, stemmed 2 cloves garlic, peeled 1 teaspoon salt<br> 1 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves and stems 1 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 cups canola oil 36 corn tortillas, cut into 8 wedges Salt Sweet paprika<br> Instructions: Remove the chorizo from its casing by splitting 1 end and squeezing out the meat. In a large heavy-bottomed high-sided saute pan, fry the chorizo in the oil until it is grainy but still soft, about 4 minutes, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon to break up the meat and prevent a crust from forming on the bottom of the pan. Set aside and keep hot. In a large stockpot over medium-high heat, stir the salsa with a wooden spoon until hot and sputtering. Add half the tortilla chips and stir to coat with the salsa, then cook until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the rest of the tortilla chips, stir to coat with the salsa, and cook until beginning to soften, about 3 to 5 additional minutes. There should be a nice mix of very soft and still slightly crunchy chips when the chiliqueles are finished. Remove from the heat and use a slotted spoon or tongs to heap generous portions into each of 4 bowls. While still piping hot, top with the grated Cheddar and Montery Jack cheeses, chorizo, a dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkling of red onion and cilantro. Serve hot with Guacamole on the side. In a medium stock pot, place the tomatoes, onion, jalapeno, and garlic and cover with 2 quarts water. Bring to a boil over high heat and let cook 5 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables are very soft. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a blender and puree until smooth with the cilantro and salt. If the salsa is too thick (it should have the consistency of a very thick soup), add a little of the cooking liquid. Check seasoning and add additional salt, if necessary, and pepper, to taste. In a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat, bring the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry the chips in small batches until crisp and lightly golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. (They will continue to darken while resting.) With tongs or a metal frying ladle, transfer the chips to a large bowl lined with paper towels. Season with the salt and paprika while still warm. Repeat with the remaining chips. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 34769,&quot;The Best Crab Cakes 2 pounds fresh jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over for shells and cartilage 1 1/2 cups panko 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup chopped chives 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Juice and zest of 1 lemon, plus more lemon wedges for serving 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup mayonnaise 1/2 cup chopped dill pickles (about 2 whole pickles) 1 tablespoon capers, chopped 1 tablespoon minced chives Juice and zest of 1 lemon Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the crab cakes: Gently fold together the crabmeat, breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, chives, Dijon mustard, seafood seasoning, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper and the juice and zest of one lemon in a large bowl. Refrigerate the crab mixture for 15 minutes to firm up; this allows the breadcrumbs to absorb some of the liquid, helping the crab cakes bind together. Meanwhile, make the tartar sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, dill pickles, capers, chives, zest and juice of 1 lemon in a medium bowl and mix until combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Scoop heaping half cups of the crab mixture and pat into 2 1/2-inch wide patties. Lightly press them together so they do not fall apart while cooking. You should have 8 patties. Heat 3 tablespoons unsalted butter and 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the crab cakes to the pan and cook until golden, about 2 minutes, then flip using a flat metal spatula. Continue to cook until lightly golden, about 1 1/2 minutes then transfer the pan to the oven. Cook until the crab cakes are completely heated through, about 10 minutes. Serve the crab cakes with the tartar sauce and lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 34770,&quot;Spaghetti Squash and Potato Gratin Cooking spray 1 large spaghetti squash (about 3 pounds) 2 cups heavy cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped 1 cup grated Parmesan Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 pounds baking potatoes, such as russets (about 2 large potatoes) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Poke the squash all around with a fork, then microwave it in 5-minute increments, rotating in between, until the outside is soft and yields a little when pressed with your fingers, about 15 minutes total. Be careful when rotating and removing the squash, as it will become very hot. Meanwhile, combine the cream, butter, garlic, thyme, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large saucepan. Peel the potatoes, then slice them paper thin on a mandoline, placing them in the cream mixture as you slice. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, then remove from the heat. When the squash is cool enough to handle, slice it in half, scoop out the seeds, then scrape out the flesh with a fork into a medium bowl. Discard the skin and seeds. Layer the bottom of the prepared baking dish with 1/2 the potatoes. Top with 1/2 the squash, then the remaining potatoes, then the remaining squash. Pour all the liquid from the potato mixture into the baking dish, and press the vegetables down to submerge. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan on top. Put the baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until golden brown and a knife slides easily into the potatoes, about 1 hour.

Take the yolk mixture off the heat. Scatter the nut mixture over the yolk mixture, along with the chocolate, if using, then drizzle over the butter and espresso. Fold very gently to blend. Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks. Stir a spoonful of whites into the batter to loosen it, and then gently fold in the remainder. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before flipping the cake out onto a serving plate.

Bon appetit! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 34812,&quot;Steamed Baby Spinach 10 ounces baby spinach 1 tablespoon water Instructions: Place spinach and water in a microwaveable bowl. Cover tightly and microwave until starting to wilt, about 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on your microwave. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34813,&quot;Sweet Potato Layer Cake with Spiced Pecan Buttercream 2 1/2 cups pecan halves 1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 tablespoons dark rum 2 pounds sweet potatoes 4 large eggs 2 cups sugar 1 cup canola oil 2 cups cake flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon ground ginger 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons rum 1 1/4 cups chopped Spiced Pecans 6 large egg yolks 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1 pound unsalted butter, room temperature 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup Spiced Pecans 1/2 cup chopped Spiced Pecans Instructions: Make Spiced Pecans: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the pecans in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast them for 10 minutes, until fragrant. Meanwhile, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl, using your fingers to mix everything thoroughly. Stir in the melted butter to make a paste. Add the toasted pecans to the mixture and stir to coat, then spread them evenly on the baking sheet and return to the oven for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven, drizzle over the rum, and bake for 8 more minutes, stirring once. Remove from the oven, cool completely and leave the oven on. When cool, chop the pecans into medium-fine pieces, some larger than others, and set aside. Meanwhile, pierce the sweet potatoes with a fork. Microwave on high until very tender, about 8 minutes per side. Cool, peel, and mash the sweet potatoes with a potato masher or fork. Lower oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Spray 2 (8-inch) round cake pans with nonstick baking spray and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the eggs and sugar together on medium speed until light and fluffy, 4 minutes. Add the canola oil; beat on medium until combined. Add the mashed sweet potatoes and mix until combined. Sift together cake flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger and then mix the dry ingredients into the sweet potato mixture. Mix in vanilla and rum. Fold in 1 1/4 cups of the chopped Spiced Pecans by hand. Evenly distribute cake batter into the prepared pans, and transfer to the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let pans cool on a wire rack 10 minutes. Invert cakes onto rack; cool completely. Make the buttercream while the cake is baking: Beat the egg yolks in the clean bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high until very thick, about 5 minutes. Combine the sugar with the syrup in a small saucepan, and set over medium-high heat, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a full boil. Immediately scrape the mixture into a heatproof 1-cup glass measure. With the mixer on high speed, pour a few tablespoons of the sugar mixture into the yolks and beat for a few seconds. Repeat until all of the syrup has been added. Beat until the bowl has cooled to room temperature. On medium speed, add the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating well after each addition. The frosting will begin to come together after all of the butter has been incorporated (it will look curdled first, but be patient and it will come together beautifully!). Scrape the bowl and beat in the vanilla and salt. Mix in 3/4 cup chopped Spiced Pecans. Cut each cooled cake layer in half horizontally, creating 4 layers. Set 1 layer, cut side up, on a cake round or cake plate and spread a thin layer of frosting on the surface. Stack next layer on top, and frost. Repeat frosting-and-stacking process until each layer is frosted. Spread remaining frosting on sides and top of cake. Arrange remaining Spiced Pecans decoratively on top of cake.

Place the remaining 11 ounces of flour, remaining yeast, and all the salt into the bowl of a stand mixer, and add the pre-ferment from the refrigerator. Using the dough hook attachment, knead the mixture on low for 2 to 3 minutes just until it comes together. Cover the dough in the bowl with a kitchen towel and allow to rest for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, knead the dough on medium speed for 5 to 10 minutes or until you are able to gently pull the dough into a thin sheet that light will pass through. The dough will be sticky, but not so sticky that you can&#39;t handle it. While the dough is kneading, pour half of the hot water into a shallow pan and place on the bottom rack of your oven. Grease the inside of a large straight-sided container with the vegetable oil. Place the dough ball into the container and set on the rack above the pan of water. Allow to rise until doubled in size, approximately 1 to 2 hours. Once the dough has doubled in size, turn it onto a counter top, lightly dust your hands with flour, and press the dough out with your knuckles; then fold 1 side in towards the middle of the mass and then the other, as if you were making a tri-fold wallet. Repeat the folding a second time. Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and allow to rest for another 10 minutes. Flatten dough again with your knuckles and then fold the dough in onto itself, like you are shaping something that looks like a jellyfish. Turn the dough over and squeeze the bottom together so that the top surface of the dough is smooth. Place the dough back onto the counter and begin to roll gently between your hands. Do not grab the dough but allow it to move gently back and forth between your hands, moving in a circular motion. Move the dough ball to a pizza peel or the bottom of a sheet pan that has been sprinkled with the cornmeal. Cover with the kitchen towel and allow to bench proof for 1 hour, or until you poke the dough and it quickly fills back in where you poked it. Place an unglazed terra cotta dish upside down into the oven and heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Combine the 1/3 cup of water and the cornstarch in a small bowl. Uncover the dough and brush the surface with this mixture. Gently slash the top surface of the dough ball in several places, approximately 1/3 to 1/2-inch deep. Add more of the hot water to the shallow pan if it has evaporated. Slide the bread onto the terra cotta dish in the oven and bake for 50 to 60 minutes. Once the bread has reached an internal temperature of 205 to 210 degrees F, remove to a cooling rack and allow to sit for 30 minutes before slicing. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 34815,&quot;Plum Sauce 1/2 cup canned crushed pineapple, drained 1/4 cup pineapple juice 1/3 cup mashed, seeded Chinese salted plums 1/4 cup brown sugar, lightly packed 3 tablespoons cider vinegar 3 tablespoons apricot preserves 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic 1 teaspoon crushed red cl peppers Instructions: In a blender or food processor, combine pineapple, juice, salted plums, brown sugar, vinegar, preserves, and garlic and process until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan, and add the crushed red cl peppers. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and use as a dipping sauce for Egg Rolls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Garnacha]&quot; 34816,&quot;Three-Cheese Calzones 4 1/2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/2 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 teaspoons dry yeast or 5 teaspoons fresh yeast 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing 2 cups whole-milk ricotta cheese 1 cup fresh mozzarella, torn into small pieces 1/2 cup freshly grated pecorino 2 tablespoons finely sliced fresh basil 2 tablespoons finely sliced fresh chives 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Halved cherry tomatoes, smashed green olives or any other fillings you&#39;d like to add Instructions: Prepare a grill for diffused indirect heat by building the hot coals evenly around the perimeter of the grill. Remove the center ring from the grill grate and insert a medium cast-iron skillet. Invert another larger cast-iron skillet over the top. This acts as a pizza oven for your outdoor grill. (If using a gas grill, heat to medium-high heat.) For the calzone dough: Add the flour, honey, salt and yeast to a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Then add 1 3/4 cups room temperature water and the olive oil and pulse again until the dough comes together into a rough ball and rides around the bowl. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead a few times until a smooth elastic ball forms. Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces and place each in a quart-sized deli container or gallon-sized resealable plastic bag with a drizzle of olive oil. Allow to sit at room temperature for 1 hour, then refrigerate overnight and up to 5 days. This makes enough for 3 calzones. Save the extra dough in the freezer for another time. It will last up to 2 months. When ready to use, remove the dough from the refrigerator and take it out of its storage vessel while still cold. Allow the dough to rest at room temperature for 1 hour before grilling. For the cheese mixture: In the meantime, combine the ricotta, mozzarella, pecorino and herbs in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. To make the calzones: On a lightly floured surface, roll out 2 balls of dough into 6-inch rounds. Spoon half of the cheese mixture onto each round, spreading it evenly but leaving a 1-inch border, then fold each round over in half. Crimp the edges with a fork or your fingers to seal it and place them onto the inverted cast-iron. Cover the grill and bake for 15 minutes. Use a pastry brush to brush the tops of the calzones with extra-virgin olive oil, cover the grill and bake until golden brown and the dough is cooked through, another 5 minutes. Remove from the grill and let sit for a few minutes before digging in! (Alternatively, you can place the calzones on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake in a 375 degrees F oven until golden brown and the dough is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for a few minutes before eating.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 34817,&quot;Coconut-Chia Pudding-in-a-Jar One 13.5-ounce can light coconut milk 3 tablespoons chia seeds 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup 1/2 cup fresh pineapple chunks 2 medium kiwis, peeled and sliced 1/4 cup raspberries 2 tablespoons roasted almonds, chopped Instructions: Special equipment: four 8-ounce glass jars with lids Stir together the coconut milk, chia seeds and maple syrup in a medium bowl. Divide the mixture evenly among four 8-ounce glass jars. Screw on the lids, and refrigerate overnight, covered, to allow the seeds to plump and the mixture to thicken into a loose pudding. Arrange the pineapples, kiwis, raspberries and almonds in separate layers on top of the pudding. Cover with the lid, and keep refrigerated for up to 1 day. &quot;,&quot;[Viognier, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 34818,&quot;Pea and Pesto Soup 3 cups water 3 cups frozen peas 2 scallions 1 teaspoon Maldon salt or kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon lime juice 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) fresh pesto (not jarred) Instructions: The quickest way to proceed is to fill a kettle first and put it on to boil. When it&#39;s boiled, measure the amount you need into a pan and put on the stove to come back to a boil. Add the frozen peas, scallions, salt and lime juice and let everything bubble together for 7 minutes. Discard the scallions and blitz the peas and their liquid with the pesto in a blender.* Pour into a thermos flask that you&#39;ve left filled with hot water and then emptied and make sure you screw the top on securely. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 34819,&quot;Espresso Chocolate Chip Biscotti 2 cups all-purpose flour 2/3 cup granulated sugar 1/4 cup turbinado sugar, plus extra for sprinkling 1 1/2 tablespoons espresso powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon anise seed, lightly crushed 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup mini dark chocolate chunks (4 1/2 ounces) 3 large eggs, lightly beaten Instructions: Position a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix together the flour, sugars, espresso powder, baking soda, anise seed, salt and chocolate chunks in a large bowl. Add the beaten eggs and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough starts to come together (it will be fairly dry before you knead it). Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough, squeezing it and pressing it against the surface, until you can form it into a ball, 15 to 20 times. Shape the dough into a flat log about 16 inches long and 2 inches wide. Cut the log in half crosswise. Brush the tops with a little bit of water and sprinkle the top and sides with some turbinado sugar. Place the logs side by side on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Transfer the logs to a cutting board and cut diagonally with a serrated knife into 1/2-inch slices. Place the cookies cut-side up on a baking sheet and bake until golden, about 10 minutes. Turn the cookies over and bake until golden on the other side, 8 to 10 more minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. The centers will be slightly soft at first, but will crisp up as they cool. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 34820,&quot;Quick Apple Crisp 6 McIntosh apples, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground or freshly grated nutmeg 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/2 cup flour or fine graham cracker crumbs 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 stick butter 1 pint vanilla ice cream Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a 9 by 12 baking dish, combine apples, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. In a small bowl, mix flour or graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar and butter together using the tines of a fork and your fingers, working until even, small crumbles form. Sprinkle topping evenly over apples and bake 15 to 20 minutes until apples are just tender and topping is golden brown. Top dishes of apple crisp with small scoops of vanilla ice cream.

Add the onions and sage and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove to a small bowl to cool. Wipe the skillet clean with a paper towel, no need to wash. While the onions cool, add the bread cubes to a large bowl. Drizzle the milk over and toss to saturate it. Let sit until the bread is softened, about 5 minutes. Squeeze the bread through your fingers to make a paste. Add the beef, pork, parsley, salt, allspice, ginger, nutmeg, egg, and cooled onions. Mix well with your hands. Roll into meatballs about 1 1/2 inches in diameter (or use a small ice cream scoop - about 2 tablespoons in volume) and rest on a baking sheet or large plate. You should get about 20 to 22 meatballs. For the sauce: Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in the over medium heat. When the butter is melted, brown the meatballs all over, in batches, removing them to the plate or baking sheet as they brown, about 4 minutes per batch. (Don\\u2019t worry if they aren\\u2019t cooked through at this point, they\\u2019ll cook more in the sauce.)

Place the hens on a rack set on a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, at least 2 hours or overnight. Meanwhile, soak the grape leaves in water 1 hour. Bring the chicken broth and 2 cups water to a boil in a saucepan; add the rice blend and cook as the label directs. Drain and rinse under cold water. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, garlic, ginger and cumin and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat; add the cooked rice, pomegranate seeds, and chopped parsley and cilantro; toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Add the egg yolks and stir to combine. Make the glaze: Bring the orange juice and pomegranate molasses to a boil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Fill the cavity of each hen with about 1/2 cup of the rice mixture (reserve the rest); tie the legs together with twine. Roast 20 minutes, then brush with the pomegranate glaze. Continue roasting, glazing every 10 minutes, until a thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165 degrees F to 170 degrees F, 1 hour to 1 hour, 10 minutes. (Rotate the hens halfway through cooking; if the skin gets too dark, cover loosely with foil.) Meanwhile, drain the grape leaves and pat dry. Use some of the leaves to line a 9-inch pie dish. Fill with the reserved rice mixture and drizzle with 2 tablespoons water. Cover with the remaining grape leaves, shiny side up, then cover with foil. (If you aren&#39;t using grape leaves, spoon the rice into a pie dish, sprinkle with water and cover with foil.) After the hens have roasted about 20 minutes, transfer the rice to the oven and cook until heated through, about 45 minutes. Transfer the hens to a platter and add some parsley and cilantro sprigs and pomegranate seeds. Peel the grape leaves off the top of the rice and serve alongside the hens. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34860,&quot;Peanut Butter Old Fashioned 2 ounces Peanut Butter Infused Rye, recipe follows .5 ounce Salted Honey Syrup, recipe follows 2 dashes Angostura bitters<br> 2 cups brand name natural peanut butter 1 liter Old Overholt Rye<br> 2 cups honey 2 cups hot water<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> Instructions: Measure the Peanut Butter Infused Rye, Salted Honey Syrup and bitters into a mixing glass, add ice and stir. Strain over fresh ice in a rocks glass. Combine the peanut butter with the rye and freeze overnight. Strain the mixture through a coffee filter-lined chinois 2 to 3 times to remove the oil.

In the bowl of a large mixer cream the butter until fluffy, then add vanilla and the espresso. In a large bowl sift the confectioners&#39; sugar then add to it the butter mixture in the mixer and mix well. In the same bowl used to sift the sugar, add flour and salt and sift. Add them to the mixer that contains the cream, butter mixture. Turn the mixture out on a floured board and sprinkle the pine nuts on the mixture and mix nuts in well with your hands (if dough gets too sticky add a bit more flour to the board and to your hands). When nuts are mixed in, place mixture in a large glass bowl and put in refrigerator for 1/2 hour to make it easier to roll. Take bowl out of the refrigerator and with your hands pick up walnut sized balls of dough, roll them in your hands and place them in an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 20 minutes or until cookies turn a light golden brown. When all of the cookies have been baked place them on a cooling rack overnight. If you are pressed for time 5 hours will do. In a large resealable plastic bag place the pound of confectioners&#39; sugar (this is a bit of overkill but I wanted to have enough powdered sugar for the cookies). Add 6 to 12 cookies at a time and gently toss them in the powdered sugar and then place them on a cooling rack trying not to disturb the sugar coating. Continue until all cookies are coated. Let cookies rest so that the coating really adheres. Now - when you eat one - you will want another and another and another! My Dad used to also coat these cookies with raw sugar (that he had family ship from Italy), and I have made them that way also. However, people seem to like the powdered sugar more. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 34862,&quot;Chocolate Almond Flower 5 dark chocolate-covered almonds 1 frosted cupcake (about 2 tablespoons frosting works best) 1 gumball or other round hard candy 1 green jelly candy or jelly spaghetti 1 green chewy fish-shaped candy Instructions: Put the almonds in a petal pattern slightly off center on the cupcake.

Swirl the pot gently until the sugar dissolves, but do not let the syrup boil UNTIL you see that the sugar has dissolved, that is, when the syrup is clear and you don&#39;t see any cloudiness or sugar crystals. You may have to remove the pot from the heat periodically to keep it from boiling before the sugar dissolves. When the sugar is entirely dissolved, cover the pot, increase the heat to high and boil for 2 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until you see that the syrup is beginning to darken. Avoid stirring as this will leave crystallized streaks in the syrup. When it is a deep amber remove the pot to the bowl of ice water you have standing by. Working quickly, immediately spoon a teaspoon of the caramel into each custard cup and swirl to coat the interior with a thin layer of caramel. Place each in the tray of ice water. Pour the coconut milk, evaporated milk, and milk into a saucepan and add the vanilla. Over medium low heat slowly bring to a boil, then remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and gradually add 1/2 cup of the sugar whipping until you see a change in color. Slowly incorporate the cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture a little at a time, whisking constantly as you go. Pour the custard into the caramel coated custard cups and place them in a roasting pan. Prepare a bain marie by adding hot water to the pan so that the water level is halfway up the side of the ramekins. Be careful to avoid splashing any water into the ramekins. Bake in the oven until a butter knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 to 45 minutes, allow to cool and then refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. Just before serving remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm up a little. Then invert each custard from the mold onto a chilled dessert dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 34880,&quot;Roast Loin of Pork with Baked Apples and Cider Gravy 1 (5 pound) pork loin roast, with rib bones attached, back bone removed Extra-virgin olive oil 1 handful fresh sage leaves, chopped 1 handful fresh thyme leaves, chopped Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 (12-ounce) bottle hard cider 1 cup chicken broth 8 gala apples 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 large corn muffin, crumbled (about 1/2 cup) 1/2 cup golden raisins 6 fresh sage leaves, coarsely chopped 2 garlic cloves, chopped 1/4 cup dark brown sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup hard cider Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the pork roast in a roasting pan with the ribs facing up. In a small bowl, mix the olive oil with the sage and thyme to flavor the oil. Brush the whole pork roast with the \\herb bath\\ and season with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Roast the pork loin for 2 1/2 hours, until the meat is crackled. (Put the apples in the oven along with the pork roast in the last half hour of cooking.) Remove the pork roast to a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving. Pour out some of the excess fat from the roasting pan and put it on the stove over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the flour into the hot pan juices, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or whisk to prevent lumps. Cook and stir the roux until its light brown. Add the cider and continue to stir to incorporate. Pour in the chicken broth; boil and stir for 5 minutes until the sauce is thick; taste and check for salt and pepper. Serve the cider gravy with the pork roast and baked apples. To make the baked apples: Core the apples with an apple corer, making a good size cavity to hold the stuffing. In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, muffin crumbs, raisins, sage, garlic, 3 tablespoons of the brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Spoon the sweet and savory stuffing into the cavities of the cored apples; stand them up, side by side, in a baking dish and sprinkle the tops with the remaining 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. Pour the cider around the apples and bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 375 degrees F, until soft when pierced with a knife. Place the warm apples in the center of a round serving dish. Spoon the cider sauce around the apples and serve with the pork loin. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 34881,&quot;Nutmeg Cheesecake 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 2 pounds fresh cream cheese, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1 3/4 cups sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 4 eggs 1/3 cup graham cracker crumbs (pulse whole graham crackers in a food processor) Instructions: Thickly brush a 9-inch springform pan with 1/2 of the melted butter and place in the freezer to harden, about 10 minutes. When hard, repeat to make a thick coating of butter. Adjust your oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), beat the cream cheese until fluffy and very smooth. Beat in the extracts, nutmeg, sugar, and salt. One at a time, add the eggs, scraping down the bowl after each addition. Pour into the prepared pan and place the pan on a double-layer sheet of aluminum foil, with at least 3 inches of foil all around the pan. Fold the aluminum foil up around the sides of the pan. Fill a roasting pan large enough to hold the cake pan with hot water to a depth of about 1-inch, then lift the foil-wrapped cake into the roasting pan, keeping the foil turned up so that it prevents water from overflowing or seeping into the cake. The foil should not be closed over the top of the cake. Be careful not to tear any holes in the foil! Bake until the top of the cake is golden brown and dry to the touch, though still a bit soft in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. It should \\shimmy\\ a bit when you shake the pan; it will firm up more as it cools. Remove the pan from the water bath, remove the foil, and let cool at room temperature 15 minutes. Refrigerate, uncovered, 2 hours before removing the cake from the pan. To remove the cake from the pan, first remove the sides. Cover the surface with plastic wrap. Place a large plate over the cake, then flip the cake over and onto the plate, tapping if necessary to help the cake come away from the pan bottom. If tapping doesn&#39;t do the trick, try a blow torch or stove burner to warm the bottom of the pan to loosen it. Remove the pan bottom and evenly sprinkle the exposed surface with graham cracker crumbs. Place a serving plate over the crumbs and flip the cake again so that the crumbs form the bottom crust and the top is covered with plastic. Refrigerate, lightly covered, at least 3 hours or overnight before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 34882,&quot;Herbed Goat Cheese Dip 8 ounces soft fresh goat cheese 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 tablespoons plain yogurt 3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro 1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary Toasted baguette slices Assorted raw vegetables: carrots, red bell peppers, cauliflower, English cucumber, zucchini etc. Instructions: Blend goat cheese, oil and yogurt in processor until smooth.

Add the butter and vegetable shortening and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal, 8 to 10 seconds. With the processor on pulse, add enough of the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough holds together without being sticky or crumbly. Shape the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill until firm and the moisture has distributed evenly, about 30 minutes.<br> Flour a clean work surface and a rolling pin. Place the dough disk in the center of the floured surface. Starting in the center of the dough, roll to, but not over, the upper edge of the dough. Return to the center, and roll down to, but not over, the lower edge. Lift the dough, give it a quarter turn and lay it on the work surface. Continue rolling, repeating the quarter turns, until you have a disk about 1/8 inch thick.<br> Ease the pastry into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim 1 inch larger than the diameter of the pie plate; fold the overhanging pastry under itself along the rim of the plate. For a simple decorative edge, press the tines of a fork around the folded pastry. To make a fluted edge, using both your finger and thumb, pinch and crimp the folded dough. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes.<br> To blind-bake the crust, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.<br> Crumple a piece of parchment paper, and then lay it out flat over the bottom of the pastry. Weight the paper with pie weights, dried beans or uncooked rice; this will keep the unfilled pie crust from puffing up in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the paper and weights. (You can reuse the rice or beans for blind-baking a number of times.) Return to the oven and bake the empty shell until a deep golden brown, about 10 more minutes (for 30 minutes total).<br> For the filling and meringue: While the pie crust is warm, brush the bottom with the melted chocolate and set aside.<br> In a saucepan, combine 1 cup of the milk and the granulated sugar. In a bowl, combine the remaining 1 cup of milk, the cocoa powder and flour and whisk thoroughly to combine. Heat the saucepan with the milk-sugar mixture over medium-high heat until simmering. Slowly add the milk-flour mixture and stir to combine. Bring to a boil. Add the egg yolks, whisking constantly, and heat until it returns to a boil. Once the mixture comes to a boil, immediately add the vanilla and remove it from the heat. Pour the mixture into the baked pie crust. Set aside to cool completely and set, about 2 hours at room temperature or 1 hour refrigerated.<br> Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.<br> To make the meringue topping, place the egg whites in a nonreactive bowl with a pinch of salt.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself. You will need to repeat the following steps for each color. Try to do this somewhat simultaneously to keep the sugar from melting under the lamp. Pull the sugar to incorporate air. Cut pieces of sugar and form into shapes. Make 2 arms. Use a sugar pump to blow sugar inside. Put sugar around the pump. Anchor by heating the metal and wrapping the sugar around the hot tube. Fold the sugar onto itself to be sure it is the same temperature and same consistency everywhere. Add the larger sugar to the pump. Carefully fill with air while shaping. You need to work slowly and consistently, always holding the sugar piece in your hand to continually give it shape. Use a blow torch to melt the edges slightly and stick them together. You?ve made the shoes, pants, body, arms, head. If necessary, make a belt to hide the seam where the shirt and pants meet. Position the arms in different ways to give him some action. Make a base. Stick the shoes to the base. Stick the pants into the shoes. Adhere the body to the pants. Add the arms. Make his head. You can paint his facial features or make them from sugar. Add a hat.

Grease a large sheet pan. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar together. Transfer 1/2 cup of the mixture to a food processor. Add the toasted almonds and grind until fine and powdery, about 45 seconds. Add to the dry ingredients. Add the chopped chocolate and whole hazelnuts and mix. Whisk the eggs, extracts, and almond liqueur together. Add to the dry ingredients and mix. The dough may seem dry, but it will come together as you work it. If the dough doesn&#39;t come together, add water. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 2 equal pieces. Wet your hands and roll each piece of dough into a flattened log about 10 inches long, 3 inches wide, and 1-inch high. Transfer the logs to the pan, leaving at least 3 inches between the logs (they will spread during baking). Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the pan after 15 minutes to ensure even baking. Let cool 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Carefully transfer the logs to a cutting board. Wipe off the sheet pan and grease it again. Using a serrated knife, cut the logs on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick slices, discarding the ends. Arrange the slices cut side up on the sheet pan. Bake until toasted, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn the oven off, prop the oven door open, and let cool completely in the oven to set the chocolate.

Transfer them to a large mixing bowl, add the fenugreek seeds and 2 cups water and let soak at room temperature for a minimum of 4 hours and up to 8 hours. Drain the mixture and add to a blender with 3/4 cup fresh water. Blend until creamy with an ever-so-slight grittiness. Pour this mixture back into the large mixing bowl and add the rice flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and enough water so it is the consistency of pancake batter. Mix well until evenly mixed and no lumps are remaining. Cover and let ferment until the batter has tiny bubbles, is frothy and has increased in volume, 12 to 36 hours (depending on the weather; see Cook\\u2019s Note).<br> Add another 1/2 teaspoon salt to the batter and mix well. The final batter should not be too thin or thick; if it&#39;s too thick, add a little water, just enough to make the batter spreadable. A very runny batter will not result in crisp dosas, but a very thick batter will not be easy to spread. If the batter is very thin, you can add 1 to 2 tablespoons of rice flour to thicken. Transfer to an airtight quart container. This mixture will keep for up to a week in the refrigerator.<br> To make dosas: Heat a nonstick pan or well-seasoned cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. (If your pan is not nonstick, rub a little oil into it. A nice traditional way of doing this is by using the flat side of half an onion.) Pour about 1/4 cup batter in the center of the pan and with the back of the ladle or the back of a small heatproof bowl or katori, spread it from the center outwards in concentric circles by applying a gentle pressure. Don\\u2019t worry if the batter does not spread very evenly. I prefer a little unevenness as that way parts of the dosa are crisp and parts are soft. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon of ghee or oil around the rim of the dosa and let the dosa cook until it becomes crisp on the thin parts and you can see it turning light brown, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> Add the filling of your choice (if filling) to half of the dosa. With a metal or non-stick turner, flip the other half over and transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter. Dosas are best eaten right away. Serve with Easy Tomato Chutney, if desired.<br> Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Once hot and shimmering, add the mustard seeds. They should pop immediately.
