Turn off the heat and let the cream sit for about an hour. Remove from the heat and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator overnight or up to 4 days. For the fortune cookie: In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and egg whites until combined. Whisk in the melted butter, then the flour and then the ginger (or extract or spice of your choice). Place the batter in an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. (The batter will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week in an airtight container.) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a very flat, level baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper, and liberally spray with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon about a tablespoon of batter onto the baking sheet and, using the back of the spoon or an offset spatula, carefully spread the batter into a circle 6 to 7 inches in diameter. Your first few times you should probably stick to making these one at a time but once you get the hang of it, try making 2 to 3 at a time. Bake until the tuile is completely golden brown all over, 12 to 14 minutes. As soon as the tuile is done, remove it from the oven and immediately start to slide a spatula underneath the tuile to loosen it from the sheet. The tuile will go through several stages before it gets to its final cooled and crispy state. Directly out of the oven it is too hot and delicate to handle. After about 10 seconds it firms up enough to hold its shape so you can handle it and shape it. It stays pliable for 10 to 15 more seconds; this is your window of opportunity to work with the cookie. Once you&#39;ve worked the spatula under the whole cookie, pick it up and shape into a fortune cookie. If you wait too long the cookie starts to harden and cool and then your attempt to shape it will result in a shattered mess. You can place the cookie back into the oven for a few seconds to re-warm it into a pliable state. However, with each reheating, the cookie cools down even faster so I recommend only 2 re-heatings. Use a new cool baking sheet for each batch or cool your baking sheet under cool water before reusing. If you try to spoon the batter onto a hot sheet it will immediately start to melt and become un-spreadable. Continue with all of the batter until you have 8 to 10 cookies. Let cool for 30 minutes. Cookies hold for about a day in an airtight container. To assemble: When you are ready to serve the mousse, strain the ginger-flavored heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Whip the cream until it holds a peak. Fold in the Lemon Curd. Divide into serving bowls and top with candied ginger and a fortune cookie. In a medium, nonreactive saucepan, combine the lemon juice and butter, place over medium-high heat and heat to just under a boil. In a medium, heatproof bowl, whisk the eggs and egg yolks until blended, then slowly whisk in the sugar until combined. Remove the lemon juice mixture from the heat and gradually whisk a little of it into the sugar/egg mixture. Continue whisking the hot liquid into the sugar/egg mixture, a little at a time, until all of it has been incorporated. When all of the hot liquid has been incorporated, return the contents of the bowl to the saucepan and return the saucepan to medium heat. Cook, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon and making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan frequently to prevent the eggs from scrambling, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon thickly. To test, draw your finger along the back of the spoon; the curd should hold the trail for a second or two before it fills. Remove the curd from the heat and strain it through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Whisk in the vanilla and salt. You should have about 3 cups. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, or until cold. (The curd can be made up to 5 days in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 45607,&quot;Rosemary and Cheddar Soda Breads Neutral oil, for oiling the baking sheet, optional 1 1/4 cups whole-wheat flour 1 1/4 cups self-rising flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 packed cup grated Cheddar (grated on the large holes of a box grater) 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 1 1/4 cups buttermilk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or line with parchment paper. Sift the flours, baking soda and salt together in a bowl. Stir in the Cheddar and chopped rosemary. Make a well in the middle. Add the buttermilk and, using a fork, mix until just combined. This will give you a soft, sticky dough, which makes a nice moist loaf. With floured hands, divide the dough into 4, scrape each one onto the prepared baking sheet and pat into a light round. Using a chef&#39;s knife, deeply score each soda bread with a cross on top (this will allow the heat to penetrate the center of the dough). Bake until the breads are dark golden all over and sound hollow when you tap the bottoms, about 30 minutes.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chenin Blanc]&quot; 45608,&quot;Steak Soup 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 pound London broil steak 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 small onion, chopped 1/2 pound white mushrooms, sliced 1 clove garlic, minced 4 cups beef broth 1/4 cup jarred sliced pickled jalapenos 1 cup crushed canned tomatoes 1 (11-ounce bag) bag baby spinach 1/2 cup sour cream 3 cups tortilla chips, crumbled Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium-high. In a small bowl, combine cumin, garlic powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Rub the spice blend over all of the steak pieces along with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Let rest at room temperature, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large pot, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and heat over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and garlic and saute until mushrooms are tender, adding extra oil if needed. Pour in the broth, jalapenos and crushed tomatoes. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer while beef cooks. On a hot grill sear steak until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from grill to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Cut beef into strips and stir into soup, along with spinach. Season soup, to taste. Transfer to serving bowls and top with a dollop of sour cream and tortilla chips. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 45609,&quot;Black-and-White Mocha Cake 2/3 cup heavy cream 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped 2 teaspoons instant espresso powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon coffee liqueur (optional) 8 ounces milk chocolate, finely chopped 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature Pinch of salt 1 1/2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Basic Chocolate Cake, recipe follows, baked and cooled Basic Vanilla Cake, recipe follows, baked and cooled Cooking spray 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch process) 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 3 large eggs, at room temperature 3/4 cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup sour cream 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 cups sugar 4 large eggs, at room temperature 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: Make the ganache: Heat the heavy cream, semisweet chocolate and espresso powder in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bowl touch the water), stirring, until the chocolate is melted and the ganache is smooth. Stir in the vanilla and coffee liqueur.

Let set at room temperature before slicing, about 30 minutes.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two 9-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Whisk the cocoa powder and 1 1/2 cups boiling water in a medium bowl until smooth; set aside. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl until combined. Add the eggs, vegetable oil, sour cream and vanilla and beat with a mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the cocoa mixture in a steady stream until just combined, then finish mixing with a rubber spatula. (The batter will be thin.) Divide the batter between the prepared pans and tap the pans against the counter to help the batter settle. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Mix 1/2 cup water with the cream in a liquid measuring cup or bowl. Beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the cream mixture, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and the centers spring back when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment.

This is a simple wet masala (spice mix). Set aside. In a large pot, warm the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the serrano pepper, wait 30 seconds, and then add the cumin seeds and wait until they&#39;re done spluttering. Add the wet masala (careful, it will also splutter). Cook until the paste thickens, deepens in color slightly, and oil oozes out of the perimeter of the masala, about 2 minutes. Add the cauliflower and potatoes, stirring to coat the vegetables with the masala. Season with salt and add 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook over medium heat 10 to 15 minutes. Then, remove the lid, stir, and cook until the cauliflower and potatoes are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and serve. Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste. There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste. Save what you don&#39;t use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks.

Glazed Bacon 1/4 cup apple jelly 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme<br> 1 tablespoon cinnamon sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon applewood liquid smoke<br> 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and chopped into tiny cubes<br> Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper<br> 12 to 16 strips bacon<br> Instructions: In a large bowl, mix the jelly, thyme, cinnamon sugar, liquid smoke, apples, a tiny pinch of salt and several grinds of coarse black pepper. Set aside. Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil and lay the bacon strips on top. Set the oven to 400 degrees F and place the bacon in the oven as it preheats. Bake until most of the fat is rendered, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and use paper towels to blot as much excess fat as possible. Place a wire rack on the baking sheet and lay the bacon back on top. Brush or scoop the glaze over the bacon. Bake until the apple bits are golden and the bacon is crisp, an additional 20 to 30 minutes.

Reserve the citrus for the marinade. Add the zest to a mixing bowl with the butter, Fresno cl, minced shallot, chives, 1 teaspoon salt and a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper. Mix together well and set aside. Marinate the chicken: Slice the citrus into 1/4-inch rounds and add to a large baking dish with the garlic, orange juice, olive oil, Dijon, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Mix well to combine. Add the chicken breasts and toss well to coat, using your hands or tongs to squash the citrus and massage it into the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 45 minutes. Heat a grill to medium-high. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the chicken from the fridge and allow to come to room temperature. Remove from the marinade and discard. Season the breasts on both sides with salt and 4 to 5 turns of freshly ground black pepper. Place the chicken skin-side down on the grill, and cook for about 2 minutes. Rotate 90 degrees and cook for another 2 minutes; this creates nice cross-hatch sear marks on the chicken. Turn the chicken breasts over and repeat the same cooking process on the second side. Once the chicken is marked off, place it on a baking sheet skin-side up. Brush the top of the chicken liberally with the citrus compound butter. Finish cooking in the oven until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to rest for 4 to 5 minutes. Slice the breasts by removing the meat from the bone and cutting into thick slices (or serve whole individual portions). Top with a small spoonful of remaining compound butter so it melts into chicken as it is served. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 45624,&quot;Herb-Steamed Chilean Sea Bass 3/4 pound Chilean Sea Bass fillet Salt and ground black pepper 3 tablespoons each of chopped tarragon, dill and flat-leaf parsley Sprigs of tarragon, dill and flat-leaf parsley for garnish Instructions: Cut the sea bass in half horizontally.

Add 7 quarts of water and bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Remove 2 of the chickens and allow to cool slightly. Remove the breast meat from both chickens and set aside. Return the remaining chicken and carcasses to the pot and continue simmering, uncovered, for 3 more hours. Strain the entire contents of the pot through a colander and chill. Remove the surface fat, then reheat the stock as follows, or pack in containers and freeze. To serve the soup, return the stock to the pot and reheat, adding the diced carrots, celery, dill and parsley. Shred the reserved chicken breast meat into large pieces and add to the stock. Simmer over low heat for 5 minutes to cook the vegetables and reheat the chicken. Season to taste and serve as is, or ladle each serving over 1 or 2 warm matzo balls. Whisk together the egg yolks, 1/2 cup chicken stock, chicken fat, parsley and salt. Stir in the matzo meal. In the bowl of an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are stiff. Whisk them into the matzo mixture until it is smooth. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, or until the mixture is thick. Bring a pot of chicken stock to a simmer (about 3 quarts). Form matzo balls the size of golf balls by shaping them with 2 spoons, rolling them with your hands or scooping them with a small ice cream scoop. Drop them into the simmering stock and cook for 30 minutes, or until fully cooked and puffed, turning once.

Line baking sheets with parchment. Pipe out 1/2-inch balls for profiteroles or cocktail puffs, 1-inch balls for cream puffs, or 1/2 by 4-inch strips for eclairs. Be sure to leave enough room in between for them to triple in size. Brush with egg glaze and bake for 15 minutes. Lower heat to 400 and open oven door briefly to let steam out. Close the door and continue to bake another 1030 minutes according to their size. They must be well dried out or they may fall. Take one out of the oven and check it by breaking open and checking the interior walls: they should be dry, not wet and eggy. Return to the oven as necessary. Remove when done and cool on a wire rack. Baked puffs and eclairs freeze well for up to a month. Filling Puffs: Either slice open horizontally, spoon filling onto bottom, and replace the hat; or pierce a small hole with a paring knife in side or bottom of the puff and pipe in a soft filling using a pastry bag with a small plain tip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45627,&quot;Mocha Egg Cream 3 tablespoons Fox&#39;s U-Bet Chocolate Flavor Syrup 1/4 cup cold milk or half-and-half<br> Ice cold club soda or seltzer<br> 1 scoop coffee ice cream, such as Haagen-Dazs<br> Instructions: Pour the chocolate syrup and milk into a 16-ounce glass.

Pulse into a coarse paste. Remove to a large bowl and add the spinach, eggs, breadcrumbs, cheese, herbs, and crushed red pepper. Season with salt and stir to combine. The mixture should be a little chunky but moist and holding together. Test the seasoning of the mix by making a mini patty, cooking it in a small pan, and eating it. It should taste really good! If it doesn&#39;t, it is probably missing salt. Add more salt, as needed. Divide the stuffing among the remaining 8 calamari bodies and secure closed with toothpicks. For the sauce: Coat a large, wide skillet or saucepan with olive oil and add the onions and crushed red pepper. Season with salt and put the skillet over medium heat. Saute the onions until they are soft and aromatic, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, another 2 minutes. Stir in the wine and cook until the wine has reduced by half. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill or puree them in a food processor and add them with 1 cup of water to the skillet. Season with salt, to taste, and simmer the sauce for 15 minutes. Add the calamari to the skillet and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, turning them over halfway through the cooking time. Remove the calamari from the skillet and remove the toothpicks. Reduce the sauce to thicken, if needed.

Cut a lengthwise slit in each plantain and set it on a baking sheet. Bake until the flesh is thoroughly soft and oozing through the slit, 40 to 50 minutes, Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, make the stuffing: Finely dice the poblano cl. Combine with beans, scallions,, cheeses, and pepper in a mixing bowl and stir to combine. The stuffing can be made up to a day in advance and reserved in the refrigerator. Make the sough in a food processor or in a mixer with a paddle attachment: Peel, trim and discard any tough ends from the plantains. Combine the plantains, banana and salt and pulse until a smooth puree is formed, or mix until just blended. Be careful not to overwork the dough, or it will become too starchy. Wrap in plastic and chill about 2 hours. To assemble the empanadas, roll 2 tablespoons of the dough lightly between your palms to form a ball. Line the bottom of a tortilla press with a small plastic bag and place the ball of dough in the center. Place another small bag over the dough and press to form a 3 1/2-inch circle. (If you do not have a tortilla press, the dough can be flattened with the palm of your hand on a counter, with a sheet of plastic above and below to prevent sticking). Place about 1 teaspoon of the bean stuffing on half of the dough circle and fold over to enclose, pressing the edges to seal. Place the stuffed empanadas on a platter and chill at least 30 minutes or as long as a day. (Stuffed empanadas can also be frozen). To cook the empanadas, heat the peanut oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Fry 4 to 6 empanadas, at a time, shaking the pan constantly, about 1 minute per side or until dark brown all over. (If they darken too quickly, as they may if very ripe plantains were used, lower the flame slightly). Drain on paper towels. Serve hot with Crema, Creme Fraiche or sour cream for dipping. In large pot place beans and water and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer and cook for 1 hour, or until tender and creamy in center. Crush the beans in their liquid with the potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon. In a large saucepan heat lard or oil over medium heat.

Line two baking trays with parchment paper. In saucepan melt the butter over medium heat; add the brown sugar, pineapple and vanilla bean, with the seeds. Cook until the pineapple is tender and the juices have thickened to a syrup. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly while you make the cheese filling. To make cheese filling: In a bowl mix together the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Cut the puff pastry into 4- to 5-inch squares, depending on the size of the puff pastry sheet you have. Spread the cheese filling in the middle of each piece of pastry. Place the pineapples over the cheese filling. Brush the points of the pastry with the egg wash. Fold one side over the filling, and then tuck the other point under the pastry, to create a roll. Tuck the points under the filled pastry, which will puff up high and keep the filling in the center. Brush with more egg wash and sprinkle generously with sugar. Bake for about 25 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. You may have to rotate the two trays, top to bottom and back to front, to make sure they are baking evenly. They will be light and puffy when they are done. Allow them to cool. Dust with confectioners&#39; sugar.

Add the cooled mushrooms and toss lightly to combine. Set aside. To flatten the steaks, coat 4 (15 by 12-inch) sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper with 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil each. Sandwich each tenderloin, with the grain running vertically, between 2 sheets (with the oiled side facing the meat). Flatten each steak with the flat side of a heavy cleaver or mallet, using steady, even sweeping strokes from the center out as you would roll pie dough, until the steak is a thin oval of about 14 by 10 inches. It should be thin like a blanket, hence the name sabana. This process takes about 5 minutes per steak. Preheat a lightly oiled very large nonstick skillet or cast-iron pan over high heat. Peel the paper off the steaks and brush both sides with the Chimichurri Dressing. Sear steaks, 1 at a time, in the hot pan, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. The cooking time will not be long because the steaks have been pounded so thin. Melt the butter in a small hot skillet. Crack the eggs into the pan and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook eggs sunny side up. To serve, place 1 steak on a large serving plate. Toss the salad with the remaining Chimichurri dressing to coat; serve the salad over the steak.

Continue cooking until the second side is golden. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and fillings. Cut each quesadilla into wedges and serve with Pico de Gallo. Dice up equal quantities of tomatoes and onions. Roughly chop the cilantro. Now, slice 1 or 2 jalapenos in half. With a spoon, scrape out the seeds. (If you like things spicy, leave in some of the white membranes.) Dice the jalapenos very finely; you want a hint of heat and jalapeno flavor, but you don&#39;t want to cause any fires. Now dump the four ingredients into a bowl. Slice the lime in half and squeeze the juice from half the lime into the bowl. Sprinkle with salt, and stir together until combined.

Drizzle the remaining butter over. If you wait too long, the butter will harden and the mixture won&#39;t stick. Refrigerate, covered, until needed. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Prepare the sauce: In a small saute pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter until foamy. Over medium heat, saute the shallots and garlic until the shallots are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato and cook 1 or 2 minutes longer. Pour in the wine and vinegar, turn up the heat a little, and reduce until 1/2 cup remains. Pour in the water and reduce by half. Strain into a clean pan. Finish the sauce by whisking in the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Brush some olive oil over a baking tray large enough to hold the salmon slices in 1 layer and arrange the salmon on the pan. Roast until medium, about 10 minutes. The salmon should be cooked on the outside, but still moist and slightly underdone on the inside. Presentation: Divide the sauce amoung 4 warm dinner plates. Spoon equal amounts of celery root puree in the center of each plate and place 1 piece of salmon on the top. 1 celery root (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled, trimmed, and cut into 1-inch cubes 1 or 2 small baking potatoes (about 4 ounces), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons (1-ounce) unsalted butter Freshly ground white pepper Place the celery root and potato in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Season with salt and cook until soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the water and return the celery and potato to the pan.

Tip them into a 9-inch springform pan. Press the crumbs into the bottom of the pan to make an even base and put into the freezer while you make the filling.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put a kettle on to boil. Melt the chocolate either in a microwave or double boiler, and set aside to cool slightly.<br> To make the filling, beat the cream cheese to soften it, and then add the sugar and custard powder, beating again to combine. Beat in the whole eggs and then the yolks and the sour cream. Finally, add the cocoa dissolved in hot water and the melted chocolate and mix to make a smooth batter.<br> Take the springform pan out of the freezer and line the outside of the pan with a good layer of plastic wrap, and then another layer of strong foil over that. This will protect it from the water bath. Sit the springform pan in a roasting pan and pour the cheesecake filling into the springform pan. Fill the roasting pan with the just-boiled water from the kettle to come about halfway up the cake pan, and bake in the oven 50 minutes to 1 hour.

Next, in a saute pan on medium heat, cook the ground beef and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper. While the beef is cooking, place 4 cups water in a stock pot with the potatoes and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes until fork tender; do not cook until the potatoes mash. When all the rawness is cooked out of the beef, turn off the heat. Slowly add the flour while mixing into the beef in order to make a roux. Mix the flour into the beef completely until no dry flour remains. (Depending on the fat ratio of the beef, you may need to add more or less flour. This all depends on how thick you want your stew in texture.) Once your roux is complete, add to the stockpot with the cooked potatoes. The meat may be in large pieces, so with a large spoon, break up into desired size. Once the meat is fully broken down, add the green chiles, corn, green chili powder, 2 teaspoons salt and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Fully mix all the ingredients and place the stockpot back on the stove top. Bring up to temperature on medium heat. Once the soup is at proper serving temperature, serve in medium bowls and enjoy.

Cream the butter and sugar in a bowl with a mixer on medium speed. Add the whole egg, then the vanilla. Whisk the all-purpose flour, almond flour, lemon zest, cinnamon and cloves in a bowl. With the mixer on medium speed, gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture. Reduce the mixer speed to low and mix in up to 1 tablespoon water until the dough just comes together. Wrap two-thirds of the dough in plastic wrap, then wrap the remaining one-third in plastic wrap. Refrigerate both for 30 minutes. Put the larger piece of dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper and roll it out into an 11-inch round. Remove the top sheet of parchment paper and invert the dough into the prepared tart pan; peel off the other sheet of parchment paper and trim the excess dough. Spread the jam evenly on the crust. Roll out the remaining dough to about 1/4 inch thick and cut it into 1/2- to 1-inch-wide strips (10 to 14 strips). Arrange the strips in a lattice pattern on top of the filling. Beat the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water and brush on the lattice and edge of the crust. Bake until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let cool completely.

Add the salt and bay leaf and bring the mixture to a simmer, whisking occasionally. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, for 20 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf. For the lasagna: Meanwhile, add the oil and bacon to a large skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until the bacon is crispy and golden brown and the fat is rendered, about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate. Drain off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat from the skillet. Add the mushrooms and 1 teaspoon salt to the skillet and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the mushrooms have released their liquid and are beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme and remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and cook until fragrant, the vegetables are soft and the mushrooms have browned, about 5 minutes longer. Deglaze with the white wine. Simmer until the liquid is almost entirely evaporated, about 4 minutes. Stir in the reserved bacon. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.

Add the asparagus tips and cook briefly, just until they lose their raw taste. Lift them out with a sieve or skimmer and let cool. Add the remaining portion of the asparagus spears and cook until tender enough to puree, then drain well. Put the asparagus spears basil, 6 tablespoons of the olive oil, and salt and pepper, to taste, in a blender or food processor. Puree until smooth. In a large bowl, combine the croutons, asparagus tips, peas, and green or spring onion. Add some of the asparagus puree and toss to coat well. Add more puree as needed to coat lightly and evenly. Add 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice and toss again. Taste and adjust the seasoning, then make an even layer of the mixture on a platter. In another bowl, combine the radicchio and spinach or arugula. Dress with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, the remaining 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss well, then mound on top of the dressed croutons. With a cheese plane or vegetable peeler, shave some ricotta salata over the top. Serve immediately. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large skillet over moderate heat and cook until it foams. Add the bread cubes and toss to coat with the butter. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle with the cheese and toss again while warm to melt the cheese. Bake, stirring once or twice, until the croutons are crisp and lightly colored on the outside but still soft within, about 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool. Store in an airtight container. Michael&#39;s Notes: I use a serrated knife to remove the crust from day-old bread, and then switch to a chef&#39;s knife to cut the cubes because it doesn&#39;t tear the bread. Also note that I recommend grating the Parmesan finely so that it will stick to the bread better. Yield: 4 to 4 1/2 cups Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the butter in a large skillet over moderate heat and cook until it foams. Add the bread cubes and toss to coat with the butter. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle with the cheese and toss again while warm to melt the cheese.

Butter and flour 1 large souffle dish or 4 to 6 individual ones with an 8 to 12 ounce capacity. Heat the milk in a saucepan over low heat. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, then add the flour, whisking until smooth and creamy. Cook about 3 minutes, until the mixture turns straw colored. Whisking, pour in the hot milk, and whisk constantly over medium heat until the mixture thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheeses, 4 egg yolks, corn, and mustard. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside to cool 5 minutes. Whip the egg whites until soft peaks form, and then fold into the souffle mixture in thirds with a rubber spatula. Pour the mixture into the souffle dish or dishes, and then place them in a roasting pan. Pour hot water into the pan until it comes halfway up the sides of the dish. Bake 25 to 35 minutes for individual souffles, 35 to 45 minutes for large ones, until risen and slightly firmed. Serve immediately or let the souffles cool in the dish, then turn out, cover, and refrigerate. (The dish can be made up to this point up to 24 hours in advance.) If made ahead of time: to serve, arrange the turned out souffles in a baking dish, poke a hole in the top and pour a little heavy cream inside, then drizzle a little heavy cream over the top of each souffle, and bake at 400 degrees until hot and bubbly, about 10 minutes. Notes about the recipe: When I agreed to go to England to revitalize the flagging cuisine at Stapleford Park, a hotel owned by our friend Bob Payton, I had no idea what to expect. But having heard all the jokes about English cooking, I did wonder if they would like my food. As soon as I arrived in Melton Mowbray, a town dedicated to making strong, creamy Stilton cheese, we knew everything would be fine. The entire town of Melton Mowbray smells of Stilton, especially the fine cheeses of the firm of Tuxford &amp; Tebbutt that may be what inspired me to cook with it so often, creating new lunch and supper dishes like this one. The richness of the local agricultural traditions quickly impressed me: the milk, butter, eggs, lamb, and vegetables were just as perfect and flavorful as the Stilton cheese. According to legend, Stilton was invented by a Mrs. Paulet in the 1700s. The cheese must be cylindrical, must ripen without ever being pressed, and must form its own coat or crust. Red Leicester, a vibrant orange, crumbly aged cheddar-style cheese, furthered our education in the best products of English kitchens. More words and warnings have been devoted to the making of souffles than any other cooking subject, but this one doesn&#39;t rise perilously high. An airy egg batter, fresh milk, and butter, savory cheese and, in this case, sweet corn kernels and a dash of mustard produce irresistible results. If you want to make your souffles even more luxurious, follow the reheating instructions by pouring a dollop of heavy cream inside each one for the last 10 minutes of cooking. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 45776,&quot;Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened 1 3/4 cups packed dark brown sugar 1/4 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips Instructions: Sift the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda together into a large bowl. Beat the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar in a bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes (use the paddle attachment for a stand mixer). Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the flour mixture and beat until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the dough and refrigerate at least 1 hour or preferably overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake until the cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the middle, about 12 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and let cool 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to racks to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Zinfandel]&quot; 45777,&quot;Cracked Black Pepper Garnish 2 tablespoons cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/2 cup olive oil 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: In a small bowl stir all the ingredients together.

Lightly season each bird with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and seasoning salt. Cover and efrigerate for at least 2 hours. Pour flour into a gallon plastic bag. Taking 2 quail at a time, put them in the flour and shake off excess. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Next, fry the quail in a pan or Dutch oven. You&#39;ll want to fill your cooking pan 1/2 way full with oil and heat to 350 degrees F. Fry until lightly brown, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Place the birds in a baking dish as they are removed from the oil. Pour the chicken broth around quail, but do not pour it directly on top of the birds. Broth should come 1/3 up the side of the bird. You may need more than 16 ounces of broth depending on the size of your quail. Pour wine around the birds. Cover the dish with foil and bake for about 35 minutes. Remove foil and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 45779,&quot;Death By Chocolate: Mocha Mousse 14 ounces semisweet chocolate, broken into 1/2-ounce pieces 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, broken into 1/2-ounce pieces 1/2 cup water 4 tablespoons instant coffee 2 tablespoons cocoa, sifted 5 egg whites 2 tablespoons sugar 3/4 cup heavy cream Instructions: Prepare the Mocha Mousse.

Brown the franks in a small skillet over medium heat. Lightly toast the buns under the broiler. Put the franks on the buns and spoon on a bunch of chili. Add the cheese all over the top, then heat in the microwave to melt the cheese, 25 to 35 seconds. (Or if you&#39;re using an ovensafe plate, place it under a low broiler until the cheese melts, about 1 minute.) Sprinkle with the onion and dive in. In a large, heavy pot, brown the ground beef with the garlic over medium heat until the beef is totally cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain off most of the excess fat, leaving a little behind for moisture and flavor. Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt and cayenne. Stir together well, cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally; if the liquid level seems low, add up to 1 cup water to keep it from burning. After an hour, stir in the kidney and pinto beans. In a small bowl, combine the masa harina with 1/2 cup water and stir together with a fork until it&#39;s smooth. Pour the masa mixture into the chili. Stir together well, then taste the chili and adjust the seasonings. Simmer the chili for another 10 minutes to thicken, then turn off the heat and let it cool. Fill freezer bags with 2-cup portions and freeze them flat for easy stacking (or freeze in other freezer-safe containers). &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 45781,&quot;Conch Spring Rolls 2 pounds fresh conch 1 large red pepper, finely diced 1 large yellow pepper, finely diced 1 large white onion, finely diced 4 ounces capers, chopped 1 bunch cilantro, leaves chopped 2 limes, juiced Salt and pepper Salt and pepper<br> Spring roll wrappers 1 egg, beaten Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 1 1/2 cups fresh orange juice 4 tablespoons rice vinegar 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup Sofrito, recipe follows: 4 tablespoons cornstarch 4 tablespoons water 1 medium onion 2 green Cubanella peppers 3 cloves garlic 1/4 cup cilantro leaves 1/4 cup olive oil<br> Instructions: In a large pot of boiling water, cook conch for 1 hour. Using a meat grinder, grind finely. In a large bowl, combine conch, peppers, onions, capers, chopped cilantro and lime juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Wrap small amounts of the conch mixture in the spring roll skins, roll, and brush on the beaten egg with a pastry brush to seal the rolls. Add oil to a depth of 3 inches in a large pot and heat to 375 degrees F.

Add the sour cream and mix until smooth. Put the lime gelatin in a medium heatsafe bowl, pour in 1 cup boiling water and gently stir until completely dissolved. Add the gelatin mixture to the cream cheese mixture and stir until combined. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a mixing bowl to remove any lumps. Spray a 10-cup fluted bundt pan with cooking spray. Pour the lime gelatin mixture into the prepared pan. Use a spoon to push the pineapple and cherries into the mixture and distribute them throughout. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. After about 1 1/2 hours, put 2 cups cold water in a medium heatsafe bowl. Add the strawberry gelatin and let bloom for 5 minutes. Add 2 cups boiling water and stir until completely dissolved. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Dampen a baking sheet with a little water and set aside. Fill a bowl larger than the bundt pan with warm water (make sure it&#39;s not too hot). Dip the bundt pan into the water in 5-second intervals (don&#39;t hold it in there too long) to loosen the lime gelatin from the pan. This may need to be repeated a few times until you see it start to loosen from the sides and center. Once loosened, place the baking sheet on top of the bundt pan and flip to invert the lime gelatin onto the baking sheet. Lift the bundt pan off the gelatin and rotate it slightly, then place it back over the gelatin so the fluted ridges of the bundt pan and the molded gelatin do NOT line up (the strawberry gelatin layer will fill the spaces). Flip the bundt pan and baking sheet back right-side up so the lime gelatin is back in the pan but slightly off center. Pour in the cooled strawberry gelatin mixture; the lime gelatin should float in the strawberry liquid. Using your fingers, realign the lime gelatin with the proper grooves of the pan. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Dip the bundt pan into a bowl of warm water (following the method above), being careful not to hold it in there too long. Place a serving dish on top of the bundt pan and flip to invert the gelatin ring onto the dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 45783,&quot;Capoducken with Chorizo and Oyster-Chestnut Stuffing 1 capon 1 duck<br> 1 guinea fowl<br> 1 pound loose chorizo, casings removed<br> 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) butter, at room temperature, plus additional for buttering casserole dish Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br> Oyster and Chestnut Stuffing, recipe follows 2 ounces olive oil 2 onions, peeled and sliced<br> 4 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed<br> 1 cup diced celery<br> 1 cup freshly roasted chestnuts<br> 1 cup turkey stock<br> 1 cup diced levain bread that has been toasted, then rubbed with olive oil and garlic 2 cups shucked Kusshi oysters<br> 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) butter, plus additional for buttering casserole dish<br> 5 fresh sage leaves, minced<br> Sea salt Instructions: Preheat a wood oven or kamado-style charcoal barbecue for cooking at about 350 degrees F.

Brush the pastry with the beaten egg and top with the remaining teaspoon of sugar. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and crisp. For the raspberry coulis, place 1/2 cup of raspberries in a small saute pan with 1/4 cup of sugar over medium heat. Cook for 10 minutes, or until berries release all their juices. Continue to cook until the mixture reaches a syrup consistency. Pass through a fine sieve or strainer while applying pressure with a ladle or the back of a spoon to remove all juices. Taste, for flavor then put aside to cool. Serve the warm crostada on top of Vanilla Anglaise; drizzle with the raspberry coulis. Before you begin, prepare an ice bath with an empty bowl and strainer. In a small bowl, using a wire whisk, mix egg yolks and 1/2 of the sugar. Place the heavy cream and the remaining sugar in a small pot. Slice the vanilla bean in 1/2, lengthwise. Using the back of a pairing knife, scrape the inside of the bean, removing all of the seeds. Place both the scrapings and the bean in the pot with the heavy cream. Bring the mixture to a boil. While continuously whisking, slowly add cream and vanilla bean mixture to the egg yolks. Return liquid to pot and place over low heat while whisking. Do not stop whisking!! The mixture will begin to thicken. Once it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, pass the mixture through the strainer and into the empty bowl over the ice bath. Continue mixing until cool. Serve underneath a raspberry crostada. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 45794,&quot;Bay Scallop Gratin 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 6 large garlic cloves, minced 2 medium shallots, minced 2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto di Parma, minced 4 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus extra for garnish 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 tablespoons Pernod 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 6 tablespoons good olive oil 1/2 cup panko 6 tablespoons dry white wine 2 pound fresh bay scallops Lemon, for garnish Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place 6 (6-inch round) gratin dishes on a sheet pan. To make the topping, place the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (you can also use a hand mixer). With the mixer on low speed, add the garlic, shallot, prosciutto, parsley, lemon juice, Pernod, salt, and pepper and mix until combined. With the mixer still on low, add the olive oil slowly as though making mayonnaise, until combined. Fold the panko in with a rubber spatula and set aside. Preheat the broiler, if it&#39;s separate from your oven. Place 1 tablespoon of the wine in the bottom of each gratin dish. With a small sharp knife, remove the white muscle and membrane from the side of each scallop and discard. Pat the scallops dry with paper towels and distribute them among the 3 dishes. Spoon the garlic butter evenly over the top of the scallops. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the topping is golden and sizzling and the scallops are barely done. If you want the top crustier, place the dishes under the broiler for 2 minutes, until browned.

Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a saucepan, add the onions and saute until soft and just golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Drain the beans and add them to the saucepan. Cook over low heat until beans are very soft, adding more water if needed, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (There should hardly be any liquid left when the beans are ready.) Meanwhile, roast bell peppers over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler. Keep turning so the skin is evenly charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. To peel peppers, pull off the charred skin by hand and then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits. (Do not peel the peppers under running water since that would wash away the flavorful juices.) Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins, and slice peppers into strips. Heat a grill. In a small bowl, combine the oregano, olive oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper. Cut six 12-inch squares of aluminum foil. Divide pepper strips among center of foil squares. Arrange one feta square atop peppers, along with tomato slices, and drizzle reserved olive oil mixture over the top. Wrap foil packets securely and place on grill or under the broiler. Grill until packets are heated through, about 5 minutes. When beans are ready, mash them with the back of a spoon to form a paste, or place in a blender and process until smooth. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season with the lemon juice, sugar, and salt and pepper. Spoon bean puree onto individual plates, and use a spatula to slip roasted peppers, feta and tomatoes off of foil and onto puree. Drizzle with olive oil, garnish with Kalamata olives, and serve with Retsina. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45813,&quot;Quick Ranch Potatoes 2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 stick (8 tablespoons) salted butter, softened 4 ounces cream cheese, softened<br> 2 tablespoons whole milk, plus more if needed<br> 1 teaspoon powdered ranch dressing mix, plus more if needed 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives<br> Instructions: Peel and cut the potatoes into 2-inch chunks.

When crabs are done, use tongs to remove them and hold them while cutting up with scissors. Return to pan. Drain pasta when it is barely tender, a little short of how you&#39;d want to eat it, reserving some cooking water. Add pasta to crabs and toss together over medium heat with pan juices and black pepper, adding some cooking water and a little more oil if necessary. (The amount of each will depend on how much more cooking the pasta needs, and how much liquid the crabs exuded.) Add parsley, taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. When pasta is perfectly cooked, serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45816,&quot;Golden Flannel Hash 2 tablespoons each butter and olive oil 1 red onion, chopped, 1 red bell pepper, chopped 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 pound cooked corned beef, cut into small cubes 3/4 pound small red potatoes, cooked and cubed (do not peel) 3/4 pound yellow beets (tops removed), cooked, peeled, and cubed Salt and pepper Eggs, for poaching Chopped parsley, optional Green cl Hollandaise, recipe follows 3 egg yolks 3 tablespoons lemon juice 8 ounces butter, very soft or melted 3 tablespoons minced roasted green cl 1 scallion, minced Pinch cayenne Salt Instructions: Heat butter and oil in a large iron skillet; add onion and pepper and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add thyme, corned beef, potatoes, beets, and salt and pepper, to taste. Spread in a layer and cook over medium-high heat until potatoes begin to crisp on bottom, about 10 minutes (lift with a spatula to check). If desired, place a lid or metal plate that is slightly smaller in diameter than the skillet over the hash to tamp it down and make it extra-crisp. Meanwhile, poach 1 or 2 eggs per serving until done to your liking. Spoon hash onto plates and top each portion with eggs, sprinkle with parsley, and serve with hollandaise, if desired. In a bowl fitted into a saucepan with barely simmering water, whisk the yolks with the lemon juice until light and frothy. Whisk in the butter in 2-tablespoon increments. The sauce will seem thin at first, but continue to whisk until the sauce thickens. Be careful not to overcook because the eggs will scramble. When sauce is thick, remove from heat and stir in remaining ingredients. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 45817,&quot;Beans and Greens Salad 1 teaspoon zest, plus 1 lemon, juiced 1 small clove garlic, minced or grated 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1 large or 2 small heads escarole, cleaned and dried, roughly chopped 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained Instructions: Combine lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, mustard, olive oil, salt, pepper and a pinch of nutmeg.

Meanwhile, in another large (12-inch), heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter and olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the garlic. Saute for 1 minute. Be careful, the garlic burns easily! Add the shrimp, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and the pepper and saute until the shrimp have just turned pink, about 5 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat, add the parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, lemon slices, and red pepper flakes. Toss to combine. When the pasta is done, drain the cooked linguine and then put it back in the pot. Immediately add the shrimp and sauce, toss well, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45820,&quot;Bubble and Squeak with Sausages and Onion Gravy 1 1/2 pounds all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks 1 1/4 pounds mixed winter vegetables such as carrots, Brussels sprouts, rutabagas, turnips, onions, leeks or savoy cabbage, peeled or trimmed and chopped into equal-sized chunks Olive oil 2 knobs butter, divided 1 (7-ounce) package vacuum packed chestnuts 6 good quality pork sausages, linked together 6 good quality venison or beef sausages, linked together Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Small bunch fresh rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped Nutmeg, for grating 3 red onions, peeled and finely sliced Few bay leaves 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon good-quality vegetable or chicken stock Instructions: Cook the potatoes and mixed vegetables in a pan of boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes. When they&#39;re cooked right through, drain and put aside. Heat a glug of olive oil and half the butter in a large frying pan and add the chestnuts. When they start to sizzle, add the potatoes and vegetables. Mash the vegetables up in the pan, then pat the mixture into a thick pancake shape. Fry on a medium heat for about 1/2 an hour, checking it every 5 minutes. When the bottom turns golden, flip it over bit by bit and mash it back into itself. Pat it out flat again and continue cooking until really crisp all over. Preheat the oven and a roasting pan to 425 degrees F. Unravel the pork sausage links and squeeze the filling between them until all 6 sausages are joined together. Do the same to your venison or beef sausages. Pat them to flatten them a bit. Drizzle with olive oil and massage this into your 2 long sausages. Sprinkle over a pinch of pepper, the rosemary and some nutmeg. Put 1sausage on top of the other and roll them up like a licorice wheel! Poke 2 skewers through, in a cross shape, to hold the sausages together. Take the preheated roasting pan from the oven. Drizzle in some olive oil and add the onions. Season, add the remaining butter and stir. Place the sausage wheel on the onions and stick the bay leaves between the sausages. Drizzle with some more oil and roast in the preheated oven for around 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp. When your sausages and onions are done, your bubble and squeak should be ready too. If it still hasn&#39;t browned, put it under a hot broiler for 5 minutes. Remove the sausages to a plate and place the pan with the onions on the stove top. Whack the heat up to full and stir in the flour, balsamic vinegar and stock. Bring to the boil and leave to thicken to a nice gravy consistency, stirring every now and then, and season to taste. Remove the skewers and cut the sausages into wedges. Serve the bubble and squeak with a good portion of sausage, a spoonful of onion gravy and perhaps some lovely dressed watercress. \\Our agreement with the producers of \\Jamie at Home\\ only permit us to make 2 recipes per episode available online.

Store brisket well sealed overnight in a shallow pan.; In a medium sauce pot, place bacon, onion garlic, and celery. Cook over medium heat until browned. Add 4 bottles of beer to the pot. It&#39;s going to be a long day; you will need the other beers for the cook. Bring the pot to a boil. Add rub, mustard, pepper, zest, juice, soy sauce and vinegar. Continue to slowly simmer, for 1 hour, as the meat smokes. Start a charcoal fire on one side of the grill. Add post oak pieces that have been well soaked (1 hour), or still green and uncured. Control the heat of the fire by closing the air vents to the grill. Place brisket, fat side up, on indirect heat (not over the fire) and close the top of the grill. Grill should be 300 degrees. Baste meat continuously with mop every 30 minutes. When turning meat always carefully use a spatula and never prick the meat. Tongs or forks may pierce the meat allowing juices to escape making the meat dry and tough. Brisket will be done in about 4 1/2 to 5 hours or when internal temperature reaches 165 degrees. Allow to rest 30 minutes before slicing. Remove any excess fat and slice brisket across grain 3/8 inches thick. Texans don&#39;t use barbecue sauce, but they haven&#39;t tried these. Serve hot smoked sausages split, brisket sliced, BBQ sauce, white bread and pickled peppers. Place sausages on smoking grill beside the brisket with indirect heat, not over the fire. Cook at 300 degrees for 1 1/4 hours.

Let the mixture sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Mix the flour and salt together in a bowl. With the stand mixer motor running, slowly add the flour mixture to the yeast mixture. Keep mixing until a smooth, elastic dough forms, about 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Divide the dough into four 12-ounce pieces and shape into balls. Transfer the balls to a lightly greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish and brush with oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours or up to 3 days. For the pizza: Place a pizza stone under the oven broiler. Preheat the broiler for 30 minutes. Working in batches, dust a ball of dough heavily with semolina. Using your fingertips, press the dough from the center out into a 10-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick, leaving a 1-inch-thick crust around the edges. Hold the dough straight up, and with your fingertips circling the crust, let the dough naturally fall. Slide your fingers around the crust in a circular motion (like you would turn a steering wheel). Work the dough in this manner until it is stretched to about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a semolina-dusted pizza peel. Repeat for the remaining dough balls. Spread each pizza with 3 ounces mozzarella and 4 basil leaves, then drizzle with oil. Add 2 ounces Porchetta to each. Slide a pizza onto the stone and broil until the cheese melts and the crust is puffed and charred in spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with lemon zest. Repeat for the remaining pizzas.

Heat vegetable oil in large saute pan on medium to medium-high heat. Once oil is hot and sizzling, place shrimp in pan and cook until translucent on one side, approximately 1 1/2 minutes. Flip, then cook on other side until sides are curled up and translucent, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Remove shrimp from pan, cut into chunks and set aside. Place a whole-wheat tortilla shell on a flat surface, then place a small amount of each ingredient on top: spring lettuce mix, diced tomatoes, cooked shrimp chunks and island salsa. Spread along the bottom of the tortilla shell, making sure not to overfill. Take sides of tortilla shell and fold in towards center so the filling can still be seen. Bring up the bottom flap and continue to roll upward while tucking sides as rolled to the top, making sure to roll tightly to keep wrap together. Cut in a diagonal. Repeat with remaining ingredients. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 45840,&quot;Triple Chocolate Holiday Trifle 4 ounces good-quality bittersweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder 1 teaspoon ground (instant) espresso powder 1 1/4 cups boiling water 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon table salt 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar 3 large eggs, at room temperature 1/2 cup whole buttermilk 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 cup good-quality bittersweet chocolate chips 1 tablespoon ground (instant) espresso powder 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 1 tablespoon coffee-flavored liqueur, such as Kahlua 2 cups heavy whipping cream 1 cup (6 ounces) good-quality bittersweet chocolate chips, divided 2/3 cup heavy whipping cream 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon table salt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups chilled heavy cream 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur, such as Kahlua Chocolate-covered espresso beans, for serving Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat the bottom and sides of a 9- by 13-inch metal baking dish with cooking spray (I like Baker&#39;s Joy) and line with parchment paper. Lightly spray the paper. Combine the chocolate chips, cocoa and espresso powder in a mixing bowl. Pour the boiling water over top and whisk until the chocolate is completely melted. Set aside. In another bowl, add the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt and whisk to combine. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the beater blade, cream together the butter and sugar on medium to medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, until incorporated. Whisk the buttermilk and vanilla into the reserved chocolate mixture. Reduce speed to low. Add 1/3 of the flour mixture, followed by 1/2 of the chocolate mixture until just combined. Repeat with another third of flour, the remaining chocolate, and final third of flour. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth with a rubber or offset spatula. Bake for 28 to 32 minutes, until a toothpick pricked in center comes out clean. Cool the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a paring knife along the edges of the cake and gently invert it onto the cooling rack. Discard the parchment paper and allow the cake to cool completely. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low to medium-low heat. Add the chocolate chips and espresso powder, and cook until chocolate is completely melted. Pour in the condensed milk and coffee liqueur and whisk until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Set aside to cool. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or with an electric mixer) beat the cream until stiff peaks begin to form. Gently fold cooled chocolate mixture into the whipped cream until it is completely incorporated and no streaks remain. Cover and chill for 1 to 2 hours. Combine 1/2 cup chocolate chips, cream, corn syrup, brown sugar, cocoa and salt in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking at a gentle boil, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Add the remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips, butter and vanilla and whisk until glossy and smooth. Set aside. For the whipped cream: Just before serving, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or with an electric mixer) beat the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and coffee liqueur until soft peaks just begin to form. This can be assembled in a large trifle dish or individual glass serving dishes. Line up the individual dessert components. Break the devil&#39;s food cake into small pieces (it&#39;s okay if it crumbles; it will press into a cohesive layer in the trifle dish). Rewarm fudge sauce on low heat to thin, if necessary. Spread a layer of chocolate mousse in the bottom of the dish. Arrange a fairly thick layer of devil&#39;s food cake pieces over the mousse. Drizzle fudge sauce over the cake pieces. Repeat layering, ending with mousse. Refrigerate trifle for 2 to 3 hours to set. This dessert is best served at room temperature, so remove from the refrigerator at least an hour or two before serving. Top with fresh whipped cream and chopped chocolate-covered espresso beans. (If making individual trifles, top each trifle with one whole chocolate-covered espresso bean.) &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo]&quot; 45841,&quot;Crab and Artichoke Dip 2 cups chopped shallots 1/2 cup chopped garlic 2 tablespoons olive oil 8 ounces chopped artichoke hearts 8 ounces Dungenesss crab meat 4 cups spinach 1 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper 1/2 cup diced tomatoes 1 cup Boursin 1 cup bread crumbs Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

Add the garlic, rosemary sprigs and lemon half to the water and season well with salt. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain well and immediately cut the potatoes into halves. Place on a plate to allow the steam to escape. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, to make the seasoning salt, mix together the lemon zest, chopped rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Set aside Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and heat until it shimmers when it swirls in the skillet. Add the potatoes cut-side down to the skillet. Do not overcrowd the skillet. This may be done in 2 batches. Cook until the bottom of the potatoes are a deep golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a metal spatula, flip the potatoes and cook on the second side for an additional 3 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and drain well. Sprinkle with the seasoning salt and serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 45844,&quot;Warm Nectarines with Lemon Syrup 1/4 cup butter 2 cups sugar 2 lemons, zested and juiced 1 1/4 pounds fresh nectarines, peeled and sliced Creme fraiche, or vanilla ice cream Instructions: In a large skillet over high heat, combine butter, sugar, and lemon juice. Stir until mixture forms a nice syrup. You may need to add more butter if mixture is too dry. Add lemon zest and nectarines and stir until just soft. If you have it on hand, a splash of Cognac never hurt anyone and it&#39;ll make a nice flame (if you&#39;re cooking with gas). Spoon mixture into individual serving cups and top with cold creme fraiche or nice vanilla bean ice cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 45845,&quot;Sunny&#39;s Diablo Diablo Diablo Burger 4 ounces nacho cheese dip 2 pounds ground sirloin (85/15)<br> One 4-ounce can diced green chiles, drained<br> 1 tablespoon sambal or Thai chili sauce<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 hamburger buns<br> 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) salted butter, melted<br> 2 avocados, thinly sliced<br> 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice<br> 2 tablespoons hot sauce (I prefer Frank&#39;s RedHot here)<br> 1 teaspoon confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 1 heart romaine lettuce, finely sliced so it resembles grass in an Easter egg basket<br> 6 slices pepper Jack cheese<br> Instructions: Line a small baking sheet or plate with parchment paper.

Carefully remove skin from mango and cut away from seed as much of meat as possible (remember mangos have a flat seed, so you should be able to get 2 large meaty pieces) Carefully slice mango into thin strips. By this time the Brie has begun to thaw, and should slice easily into very thin strips. (Brie, being such a soft cheese, could never otherwise be sliced, unless frozen first.) Lay a tortilla on a work surface and place 2/3 of the Brie slices on the tortilla. Add about 6 to 8 of the mango slices, and top with remaining Brie. (This will glue the quesadilla together when cooked.) Top with remaining tortilla and press together. Heat nonstick 10-inch saute pan and add butter on medium heat. Saute quesadilla until golden brown on both sides. Remove from heat and allow to cool 5 minutes, cut into 8 slices and top with Avocado Salsa. In a large bowl, mix together all salsa ingredients.

Set aside a few whole chickpeas for garnish. Put the lemon juice, tahini, garlic and 2 teaspoons salt in the bowl of a food processor. Process, scraping down the sides of the bowl about halfway through, until thick and very smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chickpeas in 2 additions, processing until smooth after each addition. With the food processor running, slowly pour in the oil until the mixture is creamy. If the hummus is too thick, adjust the consistency by adding the reserved can liquid a few tablespoons at a time. Season with more salt if desired. Spread out the hummus in a shallow serving bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Dust with paprika and garnish with the reserved chickpeas. Serve with pita chips and vegetables for dipping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45886,&quot;Italian White Bean Turkey Soup with Sage 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 clove garlic, cut into wafer thin slices 3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage 19-ounce can cannelini beans pureed with 4 cups chicken broth 2 cups cubed cooked turkey 2 tablespoons lemon juice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Heat olive oil in a saucepan. Add garlic and saute over low heat until garlic turns golden. Add sage and saute a few seconds, then add pureed beans and broth. Bring to a simmer and add turkey; simmer a few minutes to heat turkey through. Add lemon juice, off heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45887,&quot;Nicely Spicy BBQ Sauce 2 quarts tomato puree 2 cups chopped onion 3 cloves garlic 1 tablespoon hot pepper flake 1 ancho cl, stemmed and seeded and cut into 1/2-inch strips 2 to 3 dry chipotle chiles, stemmed and seeded and cut into 1/2-inch strips 1 teaspoon celery seed 3 tablespoons salt 10 whole peppercorns 1/4 cup bourbon 1 1/4 cups brown sugar, lightly packed 1 1/3 cups apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon dry ginger 1 tablespoon dry mustard 1/2 cup maple syrup<br> Instructions: Infuse the sauce: Combine the tomato puree, onion, garlic, hot pepper flake, ancho, chipotle, celery seeds and salt in a large, nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until all the vegetables and dry chiles are soft, about 30 minutes. Prepare the jars and lids: Wash all jars and lids thoroughly with soap and water and rinse well. Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil. Strain the sauce: Ladle the sauce into a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl or other container, pressing with the back of the ladle to extract as much sauce while leaving solids behind. Alternatively, use a food mill for the same effect. Once strained, return the sauce to the saucepan. Finish the sauce: Place the peppercorns in a tea infuser or cheesecloth sachet, and add to the sauce. Add the bourbon, brown sugar, vinegar, ginger, mustard and maple syrup. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently to prevent sticking or scorching, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Remove the sachet of peppercorns, and remove sauce from heat. Fill and close the jars: Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the sauce in the saucepan. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the sauce into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight. Seal the jars: Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch of water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 10 minutes. Remove and cool: Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately. Label and store: Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Refrigerate after opening. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45888,&quot;Pasta con le Sarde 1 pound fresh sardines, heads and central bones removed, well-rinsed Salt and freshly-ground black pepper About 1 cup coarsely-chopped fennel tops 1/4 cup raisins 2/3 cup olive oil 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon toasted pine nuts (pignoli) 1 pound dried pasta such as spaghetti or penne Instructions: Soak raisins in a bowl of lukewarm water for 20 minutes.

Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or deep ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and season with 2 teaspoons salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and just beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Add the garlic and tomato paste, mix well and cook until the tomato paste darkens, about 3 minutes.<br> Salt and pepper the lamb shanks and lay them in a single layer, over the vegetables in the Dutch oven. Add enough stock to surround but not cover the shanks and bring to a simmer. Transfer to the oven. Braise the shanks, uncovered, turning every 30 minutes or so, until the meat is fork tender, about 2 hours. (The meat will brown during the final stages of braising.) Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for about 15 minutes to allow the fat to rise to the surface of the sauce. Transfer the meat to a plate.<br> Skim the fat from the surface of the braising liquid. Strain the sauce through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl, pressing down on the vegetables with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the vegetables. Degrease the sauce again if necessary and return to the Dutch oven. Simmer the sauce until reduced by about half. Return the shanks to the sauce, and warm gently over low heat. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.

Add the onion and saute until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another 2 minutes. Transfer the onions and garlic to a blender. Add the stock, chili powder, salt, pepper and tomato paste and blend on high until smooth, about 30 seconds. For the enchiladas: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chorizo and cook, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain off the rendered fat. Let cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat the canola oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Fry each tortilla until lightly crisp but still pliable, 10 to 15 seconds. Drain on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. In a large bowl, toss together the chorizo, home fries or potatoes and 1 cup of the cheese. Ladle about 3/4 cup of the enchilada sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Place about 1/4 cup of the chorizo mixture in the center of each tortilla and roll up. Arrange the filled tortillas in the baking dish seam-side down in a single row from end to end. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the top. Top with the remaining 1 cup cheese. Bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. While the enchiladas cook, combine the sour cream, hot sauce and lime juice in a small bowl.

Cut off edges of potato to form a rectangle. Keep edges for cooking with the chicken stock. Slice potato length-wise in 1/4-inch slices. Do the same width-wise, forming 1/4-inch cubes when finished. Wash, peel, and rewash cucumbers. Cut cucumbers in half; scrape the seeds out with a spoon and cut in half one more time. Then cut into diced cubes the same size as potatoes. You should have equal amounts of potatoes to cucumbers. Reduce the chicken stock with the potato edges by 75 percent or until the potato edges until they are soft. Smash the potato edges to form a smooth puree. Blanch the potato cubes in salted water. Heat extra-virgin olive oil in a saute pan. Lightly sear the shallots and cucumbers. Add the cornichons and vinegar. Cook until everything is al dente, then stir in the chicken stock puree and potato cubes. Season with freshly ground pepper and salt. For the Parsley Butter: Place the butter in a food processor and blend until smooth. When the butter is smooth, add fresh Italian parsley. Blend the butter and the parsley together until the parsley emulsifies with the butter. Add a touch of salt. Cool mixture to preserve the green color and fresh taste of the parsley. For the Verjus du Perigord: Over medium heat, melt the sugar, and cook until caramelized and golden brown. Add the verjus and reduce the liquid to 1/3 the volume. Add the veal stock and reduce by 1/4. Remove the foam that accumulates on top of the stock. Add creme fraiche and blend with hand blender. Slowly add the extra-virgin olive oil to form an emulsion and hand blend again. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Over a low flame melt a little olive oil and butter in a pan. It is important to keep the temperature very low, so the butter remains brown and maintains a nutty flavor. Lightly sear the scallops until golden brown on both sides. After searing the scallops, remove them from the pan and place on a drying rack. Bake for 2 to 3 minutes (depending on the size). The scallops should be medium rare. Reheat the potato-cucumber salad and add the butter at the last minute to retain the color and freshness of the parsley. On a hot, oversized plate, place the potato-cucumber salad in the center of the dish. Place the scallops on top. Drizzle the tops of the scallops with warm verjus and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling]&quot; 45893,&quot;Paprika Flank Steak with Watercress One 2-pound flank steak, brought to room temperature 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for drizzling 2 teaspoons smoked sweet paprika<br> 1 teaspoon granulated garlic<br> 1 teaspoon granulated onion<br> Salt and coarse black pepper Salt and coarse black pepper<br> 1 bunch scallions, trimmed<br> 2 bunches watercress, tops trimmed away from stems<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> 12 ounces smoked blue or Danish blue cheese, crumbled<br> Instructions: Preheat the griddle pan to medium-high.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the two sheets of dough. Using a 3 3/4-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 12 circles. Using a 2 3/4-inch round cookie cutter, cut out another 12 circles, re-rolling dough scraps if necessary. Place 6 of the larger circles on the parchment. Place 6 of the smaller circles on top of the larger circles, overlapping by 1/2 inch, to form the snowmen&#39;s heads. Spread the 6 snowmen shapes with a heaping tablespoonful of marmalade each, leaving a 1/4-inch border all around. Brush the edges with the beaten egg. Cover each snowman body with one of the remaining large circles, then cover the snowmen&#39;s heads with the smaller circles. Crimp the outer edges of the snowmen with a fork to seal, then lightly crimp the lower edge of the head to attach it to the body. Chill at least 30 minutes.<br> Bake the tarts until flaky and golden, 20 to 25 minutes, brushing with the milk after 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. Meanwhile, whisk together the lemon juice and confectioners&#39; sugar until smooth.

Add the shortening or oil and mix until mealy. Stir in 3/4 cup water to form a dough. Turn it out onto a surface and knead, adding more flour if needed, until a smooth, slightly sticky dough is formed, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a towel and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. (Full disclosure: When we&#39;re hungry, we skip this step. But letting the dough rest does make it easier to roll these out.) Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Divide the dough into 8 equal parts and roll them out on a lightly-floured surface until they&#39;re really thin, keeping the remaining dough balls covered. I like a 1/16- or 1/8-inch thickness but wouldn&#39;t turn down a 3/16-inch-thick one. Cook them in the skillet on both sides until they&#39;re just starting to show some brown spots, 45 seconds to 1 minute per side. Keep warm in a towel until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 45897,&quot;Tony&#39;s Smoked Beef Brisket 1 1/2 cups paprika 3/4 cup sugar 3 tablespoons onion powder 3 tablespoons garlic salt 1 tablespoons celery salt 1 tablespoons black pepper 1 tablespoon lemon pepper 1 teaspoon mustard powder 1 teaspoon cayenne 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1 trimmed brisket, about 5 to 6 pounds Instructions: In a bowl combine all the dry ingredients and blend well. Trim the brisket, leaving about 1/4-inch of fat. Season the brisket with about 1/4 cup of the rub (see Cook&#39;s Note). Let the brisket marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat your grill to 250 degrees F using charcoal and hickory. Using indirect heat, cook the brisket for 3 1/2 hours and flip. Cook another 3 1/2 hours, cooking for a total of 7 hours.

In large mixer bowl, cream together the granulated sugar and butter until light and fluffy with a heavy duty mixer. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix thoroughly after each addition. Add the coconut extract and mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Add half of the flour to the mixer bowl along with 1/2 cup of the half-and-half. Mix until the flour is mixed in, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the rest of flour mixture and the other 1/2 cup half-and-half. Mix until the batter is smooth and all of the flour lumps are gone. Fold in the coconut flakes. Fill 24 cupcake liners half full and bake for 20 minutes in the convection oven or 28 minutes in the standard oven. The tops of the cupcakes should be lightly browned. Check the cupcakes to make sure no batter sticks to a wooden toothpick when inserted into the cupcake. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the mousse filling: In large mixer bowl, beat the heavy cream, half-and-half, coconut extract and pudding mix until light and fluffy using a heavy duty mixer. It should have the consistency of whipped cream. Gently fold in the coconut using a plastic spatula. Put the filling in a pastry bag or zipper bag with a corner cut off. For the coconut buttercream: In large mixer bowl, beat together the butter and half of the powdered sugar using heavy duty mixer. Add the half-and-half and the rest of the powdered sugar, along with the coconut extract, and mix well. If the frosting is thicker than you would like, add 1 teaspoon of additional half-and-half at a time, mixing well after each addition, until the frosting reaches the correct consistency. The thickness may depend on the humidity levels in your region. Put into a pastry bag. To assemble: Make a hole in the middle of each cupcake using a sharp knife. Be sure and leave a small amount of cake in the bottom of the hole. Fill the cupcakes with the mousse filling. Frost with coconut buttercream. You may top the cupcakes with more flake coconut or toasted coconut as desired.

In a medium bowl, combine the sprinkles and 1/2 cup of crumbs from the Heart-Shaped Blondies. Set aside. Soften 1/2 cup of the ice cream and spread in an even layer on the bottom of the loaf pan. Freeze the layer of ice cream until set, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place the 12 heart-shaped blondies in a row and press them together as tightly as possible. Soften all of the remaining ice cream until smooth and easy to spread. Remove the loaf pan from the freezer and spread another 1/2 cup of softened ice cream over the bottom. Carefully place the log of blondies, heart lobes down against the ice cream, in the center of the pan. There should be a 1/2-inch gap between both ends of the log and the ends of the loaf pan. Spread the remaining softened ice cream around the log, filling the loaf pan to the top. Work carefully to keep the blondies pressed together tightly. Top the loaf with the blondie crumb/sprinkle mixture in an even layer. Fold the plastic wrap over the cake. Freeze until set, about 4 hours. Invert the pan to remove the ice cream cake. Peel off the plastic wrap and discard. Slice the ice cream cake like a loaf of bread, revealing the hidden heart inside. Serve immediately.<br> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing just until a smooth batter is formed. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking sheet and spread into an even layer. Lay another sheet of parchment paper over the batter and place an inverted baking sheet over the top. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool the blondies in the baking sheet slightly before inverting them onto a cooling rack. Cool completely. Cut the blondies into 12 hearts using a small heart-shaped cookie cutter with straight edges. The hearts should be about 1/2 inch thick. Crumble the remaining blondies into coarse crumbs. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45913,&quot;Christmas Chowder 4 live Maine &#39;chicken&#39; lobsters, approximately 1 pound each 4 medium potatoes (recommended: russet, German butterball, or Yukon gold) 2 ounces high-quality smoked slab bacon, diced to 1/4 inch 2 medium leeks, white part only, rinsed and diced to 1/2 inch Several cups water, lobster stock, or fish stock 2 ounces unsalted butter Freshly ground black pepper 1 cup heavy cream* Sea salt, for seasoning Pinch ground chipotle or cayenne pepper, for seasoning Fresh chives, snipped, for garnish Serving Suggestion: Crackers Instructions: Pour 1 inch of water into a pot large enough to contain all the lobsters. Bring the water to a full boil. Remove the bands from the lobsters&#39; claws and place them on their backs over the boiling water. Cover the pot tightly, and steam over high heat about 3 minutes. Quickly remove the lobsters from the pot and chill them rapidly by plunging them into a basin filled with ice and water. Set a wire strainer over a mixing bowl. Twist the tails off the lobsters over the strainer to catch their juices. Shell the lobster tails and claws over the strainer. Cut the tails into 4 quarters, leave the claw and knuckle meats whole, and reserve the lobster meat in a refrigerator. Peel the potatoes, split each into 4 wedges, and slice the wedges into 1/2-inch slices. In a large non-reacting soup pot, cook the diced bacon over moderate heat until golden and nearly crisp. Pour off all but about a generous tablespoon of the fat. Add the diced leeks, stir, and cook about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes, stir, cover the pot, and continue cooking over moderate heat, stirring frequently to prevent browning, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes depending upon the potato variety and the thickness of the slices. (Chef&#39;s Note: I like to mash some of the potatoes with a fork to give the chowder a luxurious but rustic texture, but good mealy potatoes, such as russets, will release some of their substance into the broth, and this step may be unnecessary.) Add the strained lobster juices and enough water, lobster or fish stock, to just cover the vegetables. Simmer 4 or 5 minutes. Keep the chowder base hot as you prepare the lobster meat and cream enrichment. Heat the butter in a wide skillet. Add the lobster meat, season with black pepper, and saute over moderate heat 3 or 4 minutes until the meat is firm, opaque, and pink. Pour in the heavy cream, and rapidly bring it to a simmer. Pour the lobster and cream mixture into the chowder base, and stir gently to combine. Taste for seasonings, and adjust with sea salt (preferably from Maine), plenty of fresh-milled black pepper, and a pinch of chipotle or cayenne pepper. Off heat, cover the pot and allow the chowder to ripen for 15 or 20 minutes before serving. Ladle into warmed soup plates, and sprinkle snipped chives over each serving. Accompany with plenty of warmed common crackers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45914,&quot;Cornbread 2 cups stone-ground yellow cornmeal 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon fine salt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for preparing the pan 1/4 cup sugar 2 large eggs, at room temperature 2 cups milk Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Season to taste with salt and pepper. Meanwhile beat water with egg whites, and gradually, in a thin steady stream, ladle half of the mushroom broth into the egg whites. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and set over moderate heat. As the broth reaches the simmer, stir it continuously with a whisk. When the simmer is reached, stop stirring; the egg whites should have mounted to the surface in a frothy \\cap. Gently move the saucepan to the side (half off heat) so that the edge of the liquid is barely bubbling. Make a quarter turn of the saucepan every 5 minutes until all parts of broth have had a chance to clarify. Line a wide strainer with a triple layer of washed cotton cheesecloth. Set the strainer over a deep saucepot (so that bottom of strainer remains above surface of liquid). Carefully ladle stock and egg white cap into cheesecloth, disturbing egg whites as little as possible. Towards the end of straining, as cheesecloth gets full, the liquid will pass down more slowly. Just lift the cheesecloth gently so liquid can drain through an unused section of it. Let cheesecloth and egg whites sit over saucepan undisturbed for 5 minutes. When ready to eat, reheat consomme in a clean saucepan; adjust seasoning and ladle it out. Garnish with raw mushroom slices and radish sprouts. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 45926,&quot;Tamarind Glazed Duck Tacos with Grilled Pineapple Relish and Pickled Onions 1/2 cup honey 1/2 cup tamarind concentrate 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 8 cloves roasted garlic 6 stemmed dried guajillo chiles, soaked in boiling water for 30 minutes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 Magret duck breast halves, about 8 ounces each, trimmed of excess fat 8 corn tortillas, warmed, for serving Pineapple Relish, recipe follows Pickled Red Onions, recipe follows Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving 1 golden pineapple, peeled, cut into 1-inch-thick slices Canola oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 large green onions (green and pale green parts), thinly sliced 2 small serrano chiles, minced, with or without seeds Juice of 1 lime 2 to 3 tablespoons canola oil 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1 large red onion, peeled, halved and cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices 1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano 1 cup fresh lime juice 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt Instructions: Combine the honey, tamarind concentrate, lime juice, garlic and chiles in a saucepan, bring to simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes. Transfer to a food processor, season with salt and pepper and process until smooth. Pour into a bowl and let cool. Preheat a charcoal grill for medium-low and medium direct heat, and indirect grilling. Have ready a squeeze bottle filled with water to handle flare-ups. Score the duck breasts with a sharp knife to make a diagonal cross-hatch pattern and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the duck on the grill, skin-side down, and cook, uncovered, until the skin is nicely browned, about 15 minutes. If the flare-ups are too great, or the duck browns too quickly, move the duck occasionally over the indirect heat, and then back to direct heat. Once almost all of the fat has rendered and the skin is a deep golden brown, flip the duck over, move over medium heat, brush generously with the tamarind glaze and continue grilling until an instant-read thermometer reaches 140 degrees F for medium-rare, about 5 minutes. Remove the duck to a cutting board, brush with more of the glaze and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing on the diagonal into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Spread some glaze on the corn tortillas. Top with some duck slices, Pineapple Relish, Pickled Onions and cilantro leaves. Preheat a charcoal grill for direct medium-high heat. Brush the pineapple slices with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the pineapple until charred on both sides and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.

Make a pocket in each slice of bread and set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together the marshmallow creme and hazelnut spread until smooth, then stir in the chocolate chips. Fill each pocket with some of the spread. Whisk together the half-and-half, honey, cinnamon and eggs in a shallow dish. Dip each bread slice in the batter and set aside. Lightly spray the grill pan with cooking spray. Grill the French toast until well-marked and crisp, being careful not to burn it, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Meanwhile, place the strawberries cut-side down on the grill pan and grill until slightly cooked, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside. Transfer the French toast to individual plates, drizzle with caramel, shave over chocolate, top with grilled strawberries and serve alongside the warm syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45949,&quot;Fresh Fig Preserves Recipe | How to Make Fig Preserves 2 teaspoons grated orange zest (2 oranges) 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice<br> 3 3/4 cups sugar<br> 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise<br> 2 pounds fresh ripe purple figs, stems removed and halved lengthwise<br> Instructions: Place the orange zest and orange juice in a medium (10-inch) heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset. Add the sugar, vanilla bean, and figs to the pot. Cover and bring to a full boil over medium heat. (Don&#39;t worry; it may look dry.) Stir the mixture and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Lower the heat, and cook uncovered at a full simmer for 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the little bubbles to be throughout the pot, not just at the edges. After 45 minutes, refrigerate a small amount of the liquid to see if it becomes syrupy. It should be like a soft fruit preserve. Keep cooking just until the liquid starts to gel when cold. If the liquid is too firm, add a little orange juice or water, cook for a minute, and test it again until it&#39;s right. Depending on how ripe the figs are, they will probably keep their shape, but it&#39;s fine if they don&#39;t. Discard the vanilla bean and serve or refrigerate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]</li></ol><p>&quot; 45950,&quot;Chocolate Egg Cream Cupcakes 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/4 cup chocolate syrup 2/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup vegetable oil 1 large egg 2 tablespoons whole milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 ounce milk chocolate, chopped 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup whole milk 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 2 pinches of salt 2 tablespoons malted milk powder Small pretzel rods, for topping Instructions: Make the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 6-cup muffin pan with paper liners. Whisk the cocoa powder with 1/3 cup hot water in a bowl. Whisk in the chocolate syrup until smooth; let cool slightly. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Whisk the vegetable oil, egg, milk and vanilla into the cocoa mixture until smooth, then fold into the flour mixture until just combined. Divide among the muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pan, then remove to a rack to cool completely. Make the frosting: Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave on 70 percent power in 30-second intervals, stirring, until melted. Let cool slightly. Beat the butter, vanilla and confectioners&#39; sugar with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy. Add 3 tablespoons milk; beat until smooth, 3 minutes. Remove half of the frosting to a separate bowl; add the cocoa powder, melted chocolate and a pinch of salt and beat until fluffy, 2 minutes. Mix the remaining 1 tablespoon milk and the malted milk powder in a cup, then add to the plain frosting; add a pinch of salt and beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. If the frosting is too soft, cover and chill until it is firm enough to pipe. Frost the cupcakes (see below) and top with pretzel rods. How to swirl the frosting: Put the 2 frostings in separate pastry bags (or zip-top bags). Snip off the tips. Position side by side in another pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes in a spiral motion to create a swirl. &quot;,&quot;[Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinotage, Malbec]&quot; 45951,&quot;Prickly Pear Syrup 2 1/2 pounds prickly pears 1/2 cup water 1 cup sugar 1 bunch fresh mint 1 cinnamon stick 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise Instructions: With the tip of a sharp knife, scrape off the thorns of the prickly pears. Cut off the ends of the fruit and then make a lengthwise slit through the skin and peel off and discard the skin. Repeat with the remaining fruit. Cut the fruit into large pieces, transfer to a food processor and process until pureed. Strain through a fine sieve. There should be approximately 2 cups of liquid. In a saucepan, combine the prickly pear puree, water, sugar, mint, and the cinnamon stick. Be sure to scrape the seeds from the vanilla, and then put both the seeds and the pod into the pan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook uncovered for about 20 minutes. Taste to make sure that the flavors are balanced. Strain through a fine mesh sieve. Use the syrup to ladle over fresh fruits. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 45952,&quot;Asparagus with Hollandaise 1 bunch asparagus (about 1 pound) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 large egg yolk 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice Pinch cayenne pepper plus more for sprinkling (optional) 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter Instructions: Hold both ends of a stalk of asparagus and bend it until it snaps. Then use a knife to trim the remainder of the bunch to match. Discard the trimmed stems. Bring a pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus and cook, uncovered, until tender, 4 to 6 minutes depending on the thickness. Drain in a colander. Meanwhile, put the egg yolk, lemon juice and cayenne in a blender. Pulse a couple times to combine. Put the butter in a small microwave proof bowl and heat in a microwave until just melted. With the blender running, gradually add the melted butter into the egg to make a smooth frothy sauce. If the sauce is really thick blend in a teaspoon of lukewarm water to loosen it up. Transfer the asparagus to a plate. Pour the sauce over the top of the asparagus, sprinkle with more cayenne if desired and serve right away. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45953,&quot;Meat Sauce 3 pounds ground beef (I used ground round) 2 pounds sausage 3 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 large yellow onions, diced<br> 2 green bell peppers, seeded and diced<br> 6 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 cup white wine or stock (your choice)<br> Two 28-ounce cans crushed tomatoes<br> One 24-ounce jar good store-bought marinara sauce (you can use another jar if you like the sauce to be more saucy than meaty)<br> One 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> One 6-ounce can tomato paste<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon ground oregano<br> 1 teaspoon ground thyme<br> 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper, optional 4 bay leaves<br> 1/4 cup finely minced fresh parsley or 3 tablespoons parsley flakes, plus more for serving<br> 1 whole rind from 1 wedge Parmesan, optional 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, optional, plus more for serving 2 pounds spaghetti, cooked al dente and tossed with olive oil, for serving Garlic-cheese bread, for serving Instructions: In a large pot over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef and sausage until totally browned. Remove the meat from the pot with a slotted spoon and put it into a bowl. Set aside. Discard any grease in the pot, but do not clean the pot. Drizzle in the olive oil. When it is heated, throw in the onions and bell peppers. Stir it around for 1 1/2 minutes, and then add the garlic. Stir and cook for an additional minute. Pour in the wine and allow it to bubble up and reduce for about 1 1/2 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, marinara sauce and tomato paste. Stir to combine, and then add the sugar, salt, oregano, thyme, crushed red pepper if using and bay leaves. Stir, and then add the cooked ground beef and sausage and stir to combine. Place the lid on the pot and allow to simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Add a little water or some low-sodium broth if it needs more liquid. After an hour, add the minced parsley and the Parmesan rind if using (or grated Parmesan if you prefer--or both!). Stir to combine, and then put the lid back on and allow it to simmer for another 30 minutes or so. Discard the bay leaves before serving. Serve a big bowl of oiled noodles and the meat sauce so guests can serve themselves. Top each serving with minced parsley and grated Parmesan (or Parmesan shavings) and serve with a big piece of garlic-cheese bread. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Garnacha, Tempranillo]&quot; 45954,&quot;Cookie Butter 12 gingersnaps, roughly crushed 6 whole graham crackers, roughly crushed 5 shortbread cookies, roughly crushed 3 tablespoons cold water 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Pinch of ground cinnamon 1/2 cup coconut milk Instructions: Combine the gingersnaps, graham crackers and shortbread in a food processor until finely ground. Add the cold water and pulse until combined. Let sit 10 minutes. Add the sugar, vanilla and cinnamon to the cookie mixture. With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the coconut milk and blend until smooth. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 45955,&quot;Spaetzle 3 cups all purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 6 large eggs 4 tablespoons water, or as needed 2 tablespoons unsalted butter Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: In a large mixing bowl combine the flour and salt and make a well in the center. Whisk the eggs with the water and pour them into the well. By hand or with a wooden spoon, begin whisking the egg mixture, drawing in a little flour each time you whisk, until you have a thick, wet doughy mixture. Continue working the dough, picking it up as you whisk to incorporate air into the mixture and make it a little bubbly. It should be a thick, \\dropping\\ consistency. There are several ways to form spatzle. The old-fashioned German way is to use a cutting board: spread the dough flat on the board, then with a flat spatula, cut little ribbons off the edge and push them into rapidly boiling salted water. Or, use a spatzle press, similar to a potato ricer but with less holes, it in fact looks like a giant garlic press. The idea is to push the dough through holes about 3/8 inches in diameter and let them fall into the boiling water - a colander with large holes will work well. If using a colander, use a large metal spoon to push the mixture through the holes. When the spatzle rise to the surface of the boiling water, give them a gentle stir and cook for about 20 seconds more, then drain briefly in a clean colander before tossing with butter, salt, and pepper. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 45956,&quot;Potato Pancakes with Chunky Granny Smith Applesauce and Cinnamon Creme Fraiche 1 small onion, peeled 1 large baking potato (about 1 pound), peeled 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 1 large egg, lightly beaten Pinch baking powder Canola oil, for frying Chunky Granny Smith Applesauce, recipe follows Cinnamon Creme Fraiche, recipe follows 3 to 6 tablespoons granulated sugar (depending on how sweet or tart you want it) 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 5 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into large dice 1 cup creme fraiche 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions: On a box grater, coarsely shred the onion and potato. Transfer to a colander or wrap in a cheesecloth sling, and squeeze as dry as possible. Let stand for 2 minutes, then squeeze dry again. Put the potatoes in a large bowl, add the flour, salt, pepper, baking powder and egg, and gently fold to combine. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering. Drop heaping tablespoons of the potatoes into the skillet and flatten them with the back of the spoon. Cook the pancakes over moderately high heat until the edges are golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the bottom, about 1 minute. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining potatoes, adding more oil to the skillet as needed. Serve the potato pancakes topped with Chunky Granny Smith Applesauce and a small dollop of Cinnamon Creme Fraiche. Cook&#39;s Note: Reheat the pancakes in a single layer on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven until they&#39;re crisp again. If you undercooked them a bit or didn&#39;t get the browning on them you&#39;d hoped for, you can compensate for this in the oven. To a large pot, combine 1 cup water, sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest, and apples. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Taste for sweetness and add more sugar if desired. Coarsely mash to a chunky consistency. Let cool to room temperature.; Whisk together creme fraiche and cinnamon, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.; &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 45957,&quot;Chocolate Peppermint Ice Cream Cake 1 stick plus 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 2/3 cups semisweet chocolate 2 (9-ounce) packages chocolate wafer cookies (about 80 cookies) 3/4 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1 cup semisweet chocolate 8 cups (1.75 quarts) premium vanilla ice cream, slightly softened in refrigerator for 20 minutes 1 cup coarsely crushed red and white striped hard peppermint candies 1 teaspoon peppermint extract Candy Brittle, recipe follows 2 1/4 cups sugar 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons light corn syrup 2 cups assorted candies (hot cinnamon candies, after dinner mints, candy cane pieces, sliced spice drops) Instructions: For the crust: Cut the butter into pats and add to a medium heatproof bowl along with the chocolate chips. Place the bowl over 1 inch of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn&#39;t touch the water. Once the butter and chocolate start to melt, stir to combine and remove from the heat. Finely crush the chocolate wafers in a food processor until it becomes a fine meal. In a large bowl, combine the wafer crumbs with the melted chocolate and blend until the crumbs are moistened. Reserve a heaping 1 cup crumb mixture in a small bowl. Press the remaining crumb mixture in the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch diameter springform pan with 3-inch high sides. Freeze 1 hour. For the glaze: In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the cream and corn syrup to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat, add the chocolate and whisk until it melts. Set aside to cool until room temperature, about 1 hour. For the filling: Quickly mix the ice cream, crushed candies and extract in a large bowl with a wooden spoon until blended. Put half the ice cream mixture onto the frozen crust and spread out. Evenly scatter the reserved cookie crumbs over the ice cream in the springform pan, pressing the crumbs down gently. Pour half of the chocolate glaze over the cookie crumbles and ice cream Freeze for about 3 hours. When you about ready to repeat the layers, place the glaze back over low heat, just until pourable, but not warm. Remove the springform pan from the freezer and repeat with the remaining ice cream and glaze. Place back into the freezer for at least 3 hours or overnight. Remove the cake from the freezer about 20 minutes before serving for easy removal of the springform sides. Release the pan sides and transfer the cake to a platter. Break off irregular pieces of the Candy Brittle and peel off the foil as you go. Press the brittle upright, candy side out, onto the top and sides of cake. In a small, heavy bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat, cook the sugar, 3/4 cup water and corn syrup until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat and boil, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 300 degrees F, about 15 minutes. Place a 24-inch long sheet of foil on your work surface. Be extremely careful, the syrup is extremely hot. Pour the boiling syrup in wide zigzag lines across the foil. Working quickly and using an oiled offset metal spatula, spread the syrup evenly onto the foil, leaving a 1-inch border. Immediately sprinkle with all the candies, pressing the larger pieces into the syrup to make sure they stick. Be careful not to touch the syrup. Cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato, Brachetto]&quot; 45958,&quot;NO RECIPE RECIPE: Chocolate-Dipped Cheesecake Lollipops crushed malt balls crushed toffee chopped roasted and salted peanuts chopped toasted hazelnuts cocoa nibs crushed chocolate-covered espresso beans Instructions: With a melon baller or a very small ice cream scoop, scoop 1 1/2-inch balls of cheese cake and arrange them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.

Mix cornmeal and flour. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat add butter. Dredge tomatoes in a cornmeal until completely covered. Carefully place tomatoes in a saute pan and fry for 2 minutes on each side. Drain on a paper towel; season with fresh cracked pepper. For the Sweet Corn Spoonbread: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bring to a boil one-cup of milk; add corn and cornmeal, stirring constantly, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the fire and beat in butter, sugar, salt, and the remaining milk. The cold milk should cool the mixture. Beat egg yolks. In a separate bowl, beat whites until stiff, then fold the stiffly beaten whites into egg yolks. Add to cooled milk mixture. Pour the mixture into a buttered dish and bake for 30 minutes. For the Smothered Shrimp: In a medium saute pan over high heat add butter and saute the shrimp. When the shrimp are slightly pink, add the onions and garlic and saute until translucent. Dust with flour and stir well incorporated to a paste. Add chicken stock 1 cup at a time working, with a wooden spoon. When gravy is formed, season with salt and pepper, and finish with chopped parsley. For the Poached Eggs: Bring water to a boil; add vinegar and salt. Crack 2 eggs and poach for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon.

Combine chuck with diced sausage, pepper, and onion. Portion off enough meat to make a burger, and shape the meat into a bowl to hold the Worcestershire and grilling seasoning. Pour just enough Worcestershire and grilling seasoning into the burger bowl and mix well to combine. Shape into a patty. Repeat with remaining meat mixture to make a total of 8 burgers. Place burgers on the grill. Brush the burgers with your favorite barbecue sauce as they cook. Once they are almost cooked to your desired degree of doneness, divide the following toppings over: the sauteed mushrooms, 2 slices of bacon, and 1 slice of cheese, in that order. Cook just until cheese is melted and toppings are heated through. Serve burgers on a hamburger bun or sourdough toast. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel, Syrah]&quot; 45969,&quot;Chicken Cacciatore 6 red bell peppers Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 11/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 large egg 2 cups milk 1 (3 1/2 pound) whole free range chicken, cut into 8 pieces Extra-virgin olive oil 3 anchovy fillets, mashed 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes 4 garlic cloves, sliced 1 medium onion, chopped 2 large ripe tomatoes, coarsely chopped 1/2 lemon, sliced in paper-thin circles 1 tablespoon capers, drained 1/2 bunch fresh basil, hand-torn (1/4 bunch to flavor the base, 1/4 bunch to finish the dish) 1 cup dry white wine (recommended: Pinot Grigio) 1 cup chicken broth Instructions: Prepare your wood burning brick oven according to manufacturer&#39;s directions or preheat a conventional oven to 400 degrees F. Place the peppers on a cookie sheet and season with salt and pepper. Roast the peppers for 15 minutes, turning periodically with tongs, so they are really charred and blistered on all sides. Put the peppers into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and steam for about 10 minutes to loosen the skins. Pull out the cores and seeds from the peppers and peel off the blackened skins; coarsely chop the peppers into chunks and set aside. Season the flour with the garlic powder, dried oregano, and a fair amount of salt and pepper. Whisk the egg and milk together in a shallow bowl. Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour and tap off the excess. Dip each piece in the egg wash to coat, then dredge again in the flour. Place a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat and pour in about 1/4-inch of oil. Pan-fry the chicken in batches, skin-side down, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over and brown the other side about 3 minutes longer. Remove the chicken to a side plate; it will not be completely cooked. Carefully pour out the oil from the skillet and add 1/4 cup of clean olive oil. Put the pan back on the stove over medium heat. Add the anchovies, red pepper flakes, garlic, onion, tomatoes, lemon slices, capers, 1/2 of the roasted red peppers, and 1/2 of the basil; season with salt and pepper. This part of the recipe is going to be your base. What we are looking for is a fragrant vegetable pulp, so simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring often, until everything breaks down. Add the remaining roasted peppers and basil. Tuck the chicken into the stew and pour in the wine and chicken broth. Transfer the chicken cacciatore to the hot oven and cook for 20 to 30 minutes until the chicken is cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Chianti, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 45970,&quot;Bananas Foster 3 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest 3 bananas, peeled and sliced into 2 thick diagonals 2 tablespoons rum Vanilla ice cream Instructions: Melt butter in skillet and stir in sugar and zest.

Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and let soak 30 minutes; drain and rinse. Return the beans to the pot and add the bacon, onion, chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, chicken broth and 4 cups water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer 30 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon salt and reduce the heat to medium low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, 1 1/2 more hours. Partially uncover the pot and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until the beans are creamy and the liquid is thick, about 30 more minutes. Add the vinegar and chives and season with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 45972,&quot;Venison Bangers and Parsnip Cocoa Nib Mash One 2-pound venison loin, ground 6 ounces pork fatback, ground<br> 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, finely chopped<br> 1/2 cup chicken stock, chilled<br> 1/2 cup dry red wine, chilled<br> 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon mace<br> 1 bunch fresh sage, chopped<br> Hog casings, soaked in tepid water for at least 30 minutes, for stuffing the bangers Canola oil, for searing 1/2 cup brewed coffee 1/4 cup chicken stock<br> 2 tablespoons toasted pistachios 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br> 4 pounds parsnips, peeled and chopped 8 ounces (2 sticks) butter<br> 1/2 large white onion, julienned<br> 4 cups heavy cream<br> 1/4 cup cocoa nibs Instructions: For the bangers: Combine the venison, pork fatback, breadcrumbs, chicken stock, red wine, salt, black pepper, mace and sage in the bowl of a stand mixer and mix on medium speed until well incorporated. Using a sausage-stuffer attachment, stuff the sausage meat into the hog casings. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Sear the bangers on both sides in a hot saute pan with a little canola oil until cooked through and the juices run clear when the bangers are poked with a skewer, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the pan and place in the oven to hold. For the pan sauce: Deglaze the pan with the brewed coffee. Add the chicken stock and the pistachios and reduce by half. Whisk in the flour and cook for an additional 2 minutes. For the parsnip cocoa nib mash: Combine the parsnips, 4 ounces (1 stick) of the butter and the onions in a saucepan over medium to medium-low heat. Cook until the parsnips are soft enough to puree, about 20 minutes. In another pot, combine the heavy cream and cocoa nibs and cook on low heat until the flavor of cocoa is in the cream, about 20 minutes. Strain and set aside. In a food processor, combine the parsnips and onions, half of the cream mixture and the remaining 4 ounces (1 stick) of butter and puree. If the mixture is too dry, add more of the cream mixture slowly to achieve the desired consistency; you will likely add an additional 1/4 cup of the mixture. On each plate, place the bangers over a dollop of the parsnip mash and pour the pan sauce over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]</p><p>&quot; 45973,&quot;Summer \\Sangrito<br> 1 bunch fresh mint or spearmint 1 cup Simple Syrup 1 apple, cored and diced 1 orange, peeled and diced Crushed ice, as needed 1 bottle Spanish rose wine 2 cups club soda 1 cup grapefruit soda (recommended: Hansens) 3 shots white rum Instructions: In a large pitcher, take half of the bunch of fresh mint leaves along with the simple syrup and muddle them together until the oil from mint is released.

It should have a little texture. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble dumplings: Hold a wonton wrapper in your hand. Dip a spoon in cold water and then drop 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the center of a wrapper (dipping the spoon in cold water first will make the filling come off easier). Gather the edges of the wrapper up around the filling and squeeze the sides slightly with your fingers. The sides will naturally pleat, leaving the filling slightly exposed. Tap the dumpling on the table so the bottom is flat and it stands upright. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. (You can freeze the leftover filling for 2 or 3 weeks.) Lightly oil the bottom of a 10-inch bamboo steamer and line it with the whole cabbage leaves. Stand the dumplings in the steamer in a single layer and don&#39;t let them touch. You should be able to get 12 siu mai in the steamer at a time. Bring 1 to 2 inches of water to a boil in a pot. Set the bamboo steamer over the pot, then cover it with the bamboo lid.

Trim a small portion from the underside of each half so it can sit on the work surface without wobbling. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Scoop out most of the flesh with a large spoon into a medium bowl, leaving about 1/8 inch of flesh above the white part of the rind (this will help the gelatin to adhere). Transfer the watermelon flesh and any juice from the bowl and rind to a blender and puree until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth (or a coffee filter). Discard the solids and reserve the juice; you should have about 5 cups total.<br> Measure 3 cups of the juice into a medium saucepan (save any remaining juice for another use).

Check the seasonings, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 45988,&quot;Charred Tomato Soup with Melted Mozzarella 2 tablespoons canola oil 12 red Roma tomatoes, washed, core removed, and a small \\x\\ drawn on the bottom of each with a knife Kosher salt 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/2 cup dry vermouth 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided 10 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced thin 3 medium shallots, peeled and sliced 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1(28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes 1 cup water 1 cup shredded fresh buffalo mozzarella 1 loaf sourdough bread Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Heat a large cast iron skillet and add the canola oil. When the oil begins to smoke lightly, add the tomatoes in a single layer. Season with salt, to taste, and add the sugar. You want to blister the skin slightly, drawing out water from the tomatoes, to intensify their flavor. Add the vermouth. Continue cooking on low heat. In a soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and add the garlic, shallots, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the oregano and stir to blend. Allow to cook, over low heat, until the shallots and garlic become tender and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes and the water. Turn the heat down to medium and cook until the tomato flesh starts to lose shape, 12 to 15 minutes. At this point, the soup should be mushy and blender-ready. If there are still some hard pieces, add a little more water and cook for a few additional minutes. Taste for seasoning. Put about half of the tomato soup in the blender and puree until smooth. Next, puree the roasted Roma tomatoes in the blender until smooth, adding the remaining olive oil through the top in a slow, steady stream. Taste for seasoning. Add both back to the remaining chunky soup. Taste for seasoning. On a flat surface, slice bread into 4 by 1/2-inch thick slices. Tear each piece into a freeform shape that sits nicely across the top of your soup bowls (the nice torn edges will get super crispy). Set on a sheet tray and toast in oven for 4 to 5 minutes until lightly golden and crispy. Ladle the soup into crocks or small oven-proof bowls. Top with 1 piece of toasted bread per bowl. Finish with some shredded mozzarella and broil until golden brown, about 2 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 45989,&quot;Mauricio&#39;s Tortilla Soup 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces 1 mounded tablespoon Tex-Mex seasoning<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 2 tablespoons salted butter<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 red bell peppers, diced<br> 1 medium yellow onion, diced<br> 3 tablespoons tomato paste<br> 4 cups low-sodium chicken stock<br> 4 cups hot water<br> One 10-ounce can fire-roasted tomatoes and green chiles<br> One 3.5-ounce can green chiles<br> 2 chipotles in adobo, minced, plus 2 tablespoons adobo sauce Two 15-ounce cans black beans, drained<br> 3 tablespoons masa harina<br> 1 lime, juiced<br> 5 small corn tortillas, cut into 2-inch strips 3 scallions, sliced<br> 1 cup sour cream<br> 1 cup pico de gallo (store-bought)<br> 1 cup crumbled queso fresco<br> Instructions: For the soup: Put the chicken thigh pieces in a bowl and add the seasoning mix, along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large pot or Dutch oven. When the butter has melted and the oil is hot, add the chicken thighs and brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes, then remove to a plate. Next, add the garlic, bell peppers and onion to the pot and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are softened, 3 to 4 minutes more. Stir in the tomato paste, coating the vegetables. Add the browned chicken, chicken stock, hot water, tomatoes and green chiles, green chiles, chipotles and adobo sauce. Stir in the black beans and bring to a boil. Mix the masa harina with 1/2 cup of water and add to the soup. Reduce to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes; the soup will thicken ever so slightly. Add the lime juice and taste, then adjust the seasoning as needed. For serving: Stir in most of the tortillas just before serving. Serve, topped with the remaining sliced tortillas, scallions, sour cream, pico de gallo and queso fresco. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 45990,&quot;Wild Rocket and Grilled Corn Salad 3 tablespoons orange zest 4 cobs of corn 1/4 cup orange blossom honey 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar 3 tablespoons orange blossom water 3 tablespoons orange juice Handful chopped fresh basil Handful chopped fresh mint 1 package rocket (arugula), washed 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and par boil the corn.

Spray a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray. Whisk together the brownie mix and cayenne in a large bowl. Add the vegetable oil, eggs and 1/2 cup water and stir until just combined; do not overmix. Stir in the crushed pretzels. Spread the mixture in the prepared dish and top with the whole pretzels in a 4-by-5 grid. Bake until the brownies are puffed and a tester inserted about 2 inches from the edge comes out with a few crumbs, 55 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool on a rack. For the caramel: Put the sugar in a small saucepan, drizzle with 2 tablespoons water and set over medium heat. Cook, without stirring, until the sugar melts. Continue to cook, swirling the pan occasionally so the edges don&#39;t burn, until the sugar syrup is a dark amber, about 8 minutes. Whisk in the butter, then the cream. Return to a simmer, just to combine, then remove from the heat. Whisk in the vanilla. Pour the caramel into a spouted glass measuring cup and let cool until the mixture is thick enough to drizzle, 3 to 4 minutes. Drizzle the caramel over the brownies and sprinkle lightly with the coarse salt. Let cool completely in the baking dish before cutting into squares, each with a whole pretzel on top. Serve topped with whipped cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 45992,&quot;Carpaccio Pizza 4 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 cup lukewarm water (105 to 115 degrees F) One 1/4-ounce package dry active yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for bowl 1 1/2 pounds freshest possible eye of round beef, trimmed of fat and sinew Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Fine sea salt Freshly cracked black pepper 3 sprigs rosemary, leaves stripped and left whole 4 ounces micro arugula or baby arugula 5 lemons, cut into 8 wedges each Instructions: For the pizza dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer, add 1/2 cup of the bread flour, the lukewarm water and the yeast. Mix well and let sit until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Whisk together the remaining 3 1/2 cups bread flour and the salt in another bowl so it will be evenly distributed. Once the yeast mixture is nice and bubbly and looks like foamy beer, add 3/4 cup cold water and the olive oil. Using a dough hook, turn the mixer on and add the flour in increments. Mix the dough until it starts creeping up the dough hook and coming away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Place the dough in a large bowl lightly greased with olive oil. Turn to coat all sides of the dough with oil. Cover the bowl loosely with a clean tea towel. Let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Punch the dough down, and let rise another hour. Divide the dough into 4 equal disks. Lightly flour a work surface. Using your fingers or heels of your hands (or a rolling pin, if you prefer) stretch the disks out to a 10- to 12-inch round. Poke your fingers in the dough a little to \\dock\\ it. Repeat with the remaining 3 pizza dough disks. Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F. For the carpaccio: Chill the beef in the freezer for 10 minutes. Thinly slice the beef against the grain with a very sharp knife. You should get close to 40 slices. You should only do this about 1 hour in advance of eating the meat, or it will discolor and become unappetizing. (You could also have your butcher do this for you on a professional meat slicer, but you will have to time it so that you are home in time to make the pizzas in the oven!) Store the carpaccio slices on waxed paper in one layer in the refrigerator until ready to use (up to 1 hour). If you stack the waxed paper layers, the bottom ones will discolor and become gray, so leaving them in one layer is best. For the pizza: One at a time, drizzle each round of dough with olive oil, season lightly with salt and pepper, and sprinkle the surface with fresh rosemary. Slide the dough onto a baking sheet into the oven and bake on the center rack until the sides are slightly charred and the pizza is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes (less if you&#39;re using a grill!). Rotate the pizza in the oven or on the grill as necessary to keep it from burning. Remove the pizza, set aside to cool off slightly and repeat with remaining pizzas. To serve, use a pizza wheel or a sharp knife to cut each pizza into 8 to 10 slices. Lay 1 to 2 slices of the carpaccio over each slice. Sprinkle the micro arugula over the top of all of the slices and season with salt and pepper. Serve with a lemon wedge on the side. Repeat with the remaining pizzas. To eat, squeeze the lemon wedge over the meat and enjoy immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Gavi]&quot; 45993,&quot;Smoked Salmon Bistro Salad 4 large eggs 4 oil-packed anchovy fillets 1/2 lemon, juiced (about 1 tablespoon) 1 tablespoon champagne vinegar Dash Worcestershire sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 3 heads frisee, torn into bite-size pieces (about 14 cups) 8 ounces sliced smoked salmon 4 ounces plain bagel chips (about 2 cups) Instructions:</p><ol><li>Place the eggs in a small saucepan and cover with cold water.

Line two standard muffin tins with 18 cupcake liners. Into a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a medium bowl using a hand mixer, whip the eggs until they thicken and ribbons form when the beater is lifted, 3 to 5 minutes. Slowly add the oil, vanilla and marmalade to the whipped eggs. Gently fold the liquid mixture into the dry ingredients to form the batter; it may feel a little thick. Add the shredded carrots and gently but evenly fold them into the batter. Distribute the batter among the cupcake liners. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. For the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat the cream cheese and butter until well blended and lightened in texture. Beat in the sugar and vanilla until blended. Beat in the food coloring of your preference if using. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag.

Spread the bread cubes on a large baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, about 15 minutes. Let cool. Adjust the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the sugar, apple cider and lemon juice in a large, high-sided saute pan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in the Gala and Granny Smith apples and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and caramelized, about 15 minutes. Add the apple brandy if using; cook a few minutes longer. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the apples to a bowl (you don&#39;t want the apples to be too wet) and let cool. Reserve the apple cooking liquid for serving. For the streusel: Mix together the butter, salt and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Add the flour, oats and cinnamon and mix until well combined. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Squeeze the mixture in your hands to form larger and smaller clumps. For the casserole: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with some softened butter. Whisk the eggs, yolks, vanilla and cinnamon in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk in the half-and-half, then fold in the cooled apples. Add the bread and stir to coat, pressing down to make sure bread is totally submerged. Let sit for 10 minutes. Transfer the apple-bread mixture to the buttered baking dish, pressing down to make sure the top is an even layer. Scatter the streusel evenly over the top. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until puffed and lightly golden brown, another 30 minutes or so. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Reheat the reserved apple cooking liquid. (If very thin, simmer briefly over medium heat until reduced to a syrup; if there isn&#39;t much, add some apple cider and simmer briefly.) Turn the heat to low and whisk in the cold butter, piece by piece, until emulsified.

Line 3 baking sheets with silicone baking mats. Sift the confectioners&#39; sugar into a large bowl. Whisk in the almond flour. Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment on medium speed until frothy, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium high and gradually beat in the superfine sugar until the mixture is just stiff and shiny, 2 to 2 1/2 more minutes, adding the food coloring and extract during the last 15 seconds of mixing. Fold the egg white mixture into the almond flour mixture using a rubber spatula, giving the bowl a quarter turn with each fold, until incorporated. Continue folding and turning, scraping down the bowl, until the batter is smooth and falls off the spatula in a thick ribbon, no more than 2 minutes (about 60 strokes). Transfer the batter to a piping bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. Holding the bag perpendicular to and 1/2 inch above the prepared pans, pipe 11/4-inch rounds (30 to 35 per pan). Firmly tap the baking sheets twice against the counter to release any air bubbles. Let the cookies sit at room temperature until the tops are no longer sticky to the touch, 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the humidity. Slip another baking sheet under one batch of macarons (a double baking sheet protects the cookies from the heat). Bake the macarons, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until the tops of the cookies are shiny and rise 1/8 inch to form a \\foot,\\ about 20 minutes. Transfer the top pan to a rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining two batches, using a double baking sheet for each. Sandwich the cookies with citrus curd or preserves. (The cookies will be crisp on top.

Use metal rulers to outline the mold that you would like to make. For my centerpiece, I used some ceramic art souvenirs I bought in Mexico. Place the rulers on a parchment paper lined sheet pan, and place the item to be molded in the center of that space. Pour the melted Elastack over the item to be molded until it is completely covered. Let this set for about 30 minutes until the Elastack hardens. When set, remove the original piece. Now the mold is ready to use. Make the cocoa pods: Use a ladle to fill the cocoa pod mold with white chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many cocoa pods as you would like. If you are using the cocoa pod as a container to hold something, do not glue the 2 halves together. Otherwise, use tempered chocolate to glue the 2 halves together. If you want to paint the cocoa pods, there are 2 methods. The first is to mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint the inside of the mold, applying color where you are inspired to do so. Then, follow the instructions that follow to make a mold. The second method is to use an airbrush. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate as you are inspired. Make the mask: Use a ladle to fill the cocoa pod mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. Give the mold another coat so it will be especially strong. Follow the same procedures. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many masks as you would like. Use the paintbrush techniques described above to paint the mask. Then use the airbrush to spray color over the face. If the airbrush splatters paint onto the chocolate surface, blend it with a paintbrush. Make the base: Use flexible aluminum strips or large cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 10-inches in diameter. Place the ring on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered chocolate inside the ring to form a 1-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper.<br> Make a support pole: Roll a piece of acetate into a tube that is 22-inches long and 3-inches in diameter and tape it closed. Set the tube on end and fill with chocolate. When it is full, invert the tube over the bowl of chocolate allowing the excess chocolate to flow back into the bowl. Let set. When the chocolate has set, repeat this step a few more times. You want the tube to be quite sturdy, as the rest of the centerpiece will depend on it. Allow the chocolate tube to set until hard. Remove the acetate. Use a hot knife to trim the base of the tube so it is flat. Then use the knife to scar the bottom. You want to make it somewhat textured so it will form a better seal to the base. Use tempered chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it. Repeat this procedure making another tube. Use a hot sharp chef&#39;s knife to cut the second tube into 2 equal pieces. A diagonal cut will be more pleasing to the eye in the finished presentation. To do this, heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \\cut\\ through the chocolate by melting it. Use tempered chocolate to glue the shorter pieces to the center pole. Then, glue the center pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it. Use a paintbrush to paint the support poles with tempered chocolate. This will give the support pole the illusion that is made from wood. Use the newly made Elastack molds. Use a ladle to fill the mold cavity with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean with a sharp knife. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. To unmold, invert the mold and peel the mold from the chocolate. Repeat to make more chocolate molds of the pieces in your design. I painted 1 of the ceramic pieces with a mixture of vegetable oil and powdered food colors. Then I used a towel to wipe a bit of the color off to make the painting look antique. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the chocolate pieces to the support pole. If you are using the cocoa pod as a container to hold the cookies, place cookies inside the bottom and rest the other 1/2 of the pod on top. You can also tie a pod closed with a ribbon to make a unique gift. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, Garnacha]&quot; 46007,&quot;Sliced Almond Mini 1 frosted cupcake (about 2 tablespoons frosting works best) 20 skin-on almond slices (about 1 teaspoon) 1 small piece brightly colored dried fruit, or a jelly bean half Instructions: Starting at the center of the cupcake, arrange the sliced almonds in a tight petal pattern.

Continue to fold one at a time, keeping the finished ones moist under the moist clean towel (the towel should not be dripping wet, just moist to the touch).<br> Time to Fry! In a deep frying pot, fill halfway with corn or vegetable oil. Heat until when wood chopsticks are placed in to touch the bottom, there are fast streams of bubbles streaming to the top (yes, that&#39;s the way my mother taught me!). Very important: before placing spring rolls in oil, make sure they are dry on the outside (if your towel was too damp, you must dry off the rolls in paper towel first, otherwise the oil will pop). Place spring rolls in a few at a time making sure to keep them separated while frying. If the oil is too hot, the outside will cook too quickly, leaving the inside undercooked -- adjust the temperature so that each spring roll takes about 5 to 7 minutes each to cook through and are golden brown. Drain and serve immediately.<br> Excellent when served with your favorite dipping sauce. Try a sweeter sauce with spring rolls such as a plum or duck sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 46032,&quot;Shrimp Summer Rolls with Curried Coconut Dipping Sauce 1/3 cup unsalted peanuts 1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil 2 teaspoons red curry paste 2 teaspoons fish sauce 1 tablespoon sugar 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce Kosher salt 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 2 teaspoons sugar 6 black peppercorns 12 medium shrimp (unpeeled) 1 ounce rice vermicelli 1 cucumber 3 scallions 8 8-inch-round rice paper wrappers 1/2 bunch mint 1/2 bunch basil 1/2 bunch cilantro 4 Boston lettuce leaves, torn Instructions: Make the sauce: Grind the peanuts in a food processor.

See instructions below. Lay out the cheesecloth on a work surface and brush with olive oil. Place the cheese in the middle and top with the bay leaves. Wrap the cheesecloth tightly around the cheese and tie closed with kitchen twine. Set the cheese, herb-side up, in the disposable pie pan. Once the grill reaches 250 degrees F, place the pan with the cheese on the cooler side of the grill. Close the grill and let smoke until slightly golden, about 20 minutes. If using a gas grill, turn off the flame and let the cheese sit, covered, 10 more minutes (this is not necessary if using charcoal; it imparts more smoky flavor). Remove from the grill and unwrap. Make a smoker box. Drain the wood chips and transfer to a small disposable aluminum pan (about 4 to 6 inches); cover tightly with foil. Poke 6 holes in both the foil and the bottom of the pan using a paring knife. How to set up your charcoal grill: Fill a chimney starter with briquettes; stuff the bottom with newspaper, ignite and let burn until the flames die and the coals are ashy. Dump the coals onto one side of the grill&#39;s bottom grate. Nestle the smoker box in the coals; put the top grate in place. When the chips start smoking, cover with the lid, closing the vents halfway, and heat the grill to 250 degrees F (use an oven thermometer if your grill doesn&#39;t come with one). Position the food on the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat). Close the lid and smoke as directed, adding more coals as needed to maintain the heat. How to set up your gas grill: Preheat the grill to medium high on one side; leave the burners off on the other side. Place the smoker box on the grate over the flame. When the chips start smoking, reduce the heat to low, close the grill lid and heat to 250 degrees F. Position the food on the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat). Close the lid and smoke as directed, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a grill temperature between 225 degrees F and 250 degrees F. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46047,&quot;Lemon Chicken and Shishito Pepper Kebabs Vegetable oil, for the grill 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 clove garlic, grated Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 24 to 30 small shishito peppers 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme Instructions: Preheat a grill to medium high and brush the grates with vegetable oil.

Place the cedar plank in the center of the hot grate, away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook until cooked through, around 20 to 30 minutes. The internal temperature should read 135 degrees F. Transfer the salmon and plank to a platter and serve right off the plank. Cook&#39;s Note: A direct method to grill the salmon may be used. Soak the cedar plank well. Spread the mustard and brown sugar on the salmon, but do not place the fish on the plank. Set up the grill for direct grilling on medium-high. When ready to cook, place the plank on the hot grate and leave it until there is a smell of smoke, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the plank over and place the fish on top. Cover the grill and cook until the fish is cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 135 degrees F. Check the plank occasionally. If the edges start to catch fire, mist with water, or move the plank to a cooler part of the grill. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 46053,&quot;Uyghur Spicy Beef Skewers 2 1/4 pounds beef sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes 1/3 cup vegetable oil 3 tablespoons light soy sauce 3 teaspoons sea salt 1 teaspoon dried chili flakes 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon ginger powder 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon sweet paprika powder 1 teaspoon ground Sichuan pepper 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 teaspoon ground cumin 2 lemons, cut into wedges<br> Instructions: For the marinade: Place the beef cubes in a large mixing bowl.

Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let it stand for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature or in the refrigerator overnight. The poolish should double in volume. Add 1 pound of the flour and 12 ounces of room temperature water to the poolish and mix together well with your hands. It will be very sticky. Cover the bowl with the kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes. Sprinkle the salt over the surface of the dough and then fold the dough onto itself several times until the salt is incorporated. Cover the bowl with the kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 1 hour. Cover your hands with flour and sprinkle flour around the outside edge of the dough. Fold the dough onto itself 6 to 8 times. Cover the bowl with the kitchen towel and let rest for 1 hour. Fold the dough onto itself 6 to 8 times, dust a board generously with flour and pour the dough out onto the board. Divide the dough into two equal parts and turn and form each part into a ball, stretching the dough to form a smooth top. Sprinkle flour heavily in 2 separate bowls (there should be enough flour to keep the dough from sticking) and turn each ball of dough upside down into a bowl. Sprinkle the top of each ball with flour, cover each bowl with a kitchen towel and let it rise until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes. Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. Turn each ball of dough bottom-side up onto its own sheet pan and use a knife or razor blade to score a tic-tac-toe design on the top of each loaf. Place the loaves in the oven, immediately lower the temperature to 450 degrees F and bake for 30 minutes. (Do not open the oven door!) The loaves are done when they are golden brown and make a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom. Cool the loaves on a baking rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46057,&quot;Green Bean Casserole Kosher salt 2 pounds fresh green beans, ends cut off<br> 4 tablespoons butter, plus more for buttering the casserole dish 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/2 large onion, chopped<br> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br> 2 1/2 cups whole milk<br> 1/2 cup half-and-half<br> 1/4 cup chicken broth, plus more if needed 3 tablespoons sherry<br> 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> Freshly ground black pepper 3/4 cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese<br> 3/4 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese<br> 3 large jarred piquillo or roasted red peppers, diced<br> Onion Strings, recipe follows 1 large onion, very thinly sliced 2 cups buttermilk<br> 1 to 2 quarts (4 to 8 cups) canola oil<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 scant tablespoon kosher salt<br> 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil; prepare a bowl of ice water. Cut the green beans in half if you like the pieces a little smaller. Blanch the green beans by dropping them into the boiling water and cooking them for about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from the boiling water with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge them into the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain the beans once they&#39;re cool and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a casserole dish. Add the bacon pieces to a skillet over medium heat. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the garlic and onion and continue cooking until the bacon is done (but not crisp) and the onions are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Sprinkle the flour into the skillet and whisk immediately to evenly mix it into the butter. Cook for a minute or two, then stir in the milk, half-and-half, chicken broth and sherry. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Add the cayenne, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and some pepper, then the grated Cheddar and Monterey Jack. Stir until the cheese melts. If the sauce is too thick, splash in some chicken broth as needed. Add the peppers along with the reserved bacon/onion mixture and stir to combine. Put the green beans in the prepared casserole dish. Pour the sauce over the green beans and stir gently to combine. Bake until the sauce is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Top with the Onion Strings. Put the onion slices in a baking dish, cover with the buttermilk and soak for at least 1 hour. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot until a deep-frying thermometer registers 375 degrees F. Combine the flour, salt, cayenne and some black pepper in a bowl. Grab a handful of the onions, throw them into the flour mixture, tap to shake off the excess and plunge into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, a few minutes, then remove immediately to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat until all the onions are cooked. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 46058,&quot;Sunburst Cherry Blossom Pie 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup butter flavored shortening, chilled (recommended: Crisco) 1/2 cup ice cold water (plus 1 tablespoon) Leftover crust 8 red cherries 15 dried cherries 1 tablespoon baking glitter, if desired 1 (12-ounce) frozen package dark sweet cherries, thawed, (recommended: Dole) 21/2 cups frozen, pitted red tart cherries, thawed 1/2 cup dried cherries 3 tablespoons melted butter 1/4 cup tart cherry juice concentrate 3 drops almond extract 3 drops red food coloring 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar 1/2 vanilla bean pod (extracted seeds only) 1/4 cup minute tapioca (recommended: Kraft) 1 tablespoon cream 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/4 cup powdered sugar 2 tablespoons cream Instructions: For the Pie Crust: Place flour, salt and shortening in a bowl.

Transfer the rice to a bowl and cover with cold water. If you have time, allow it to soak for 30 minutes. Soaking the rice ensures an even cook. If you do not have time to soak, the rice will still turn out, it will just be a little extra sticky. Drain the rice and transfer to a medium saucepan. Cover with the 1 3/4 cups water and stir in the salt. Bring the rice to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the rice wine vinegar and sugar and set aside. Remove the pot from the heat and allow it to sit, covered, for 5 minutes before stirring in the vinegar mixture until fully absorbed. Divide the rice into 4 bowls and set aside to cool slightly while you prep the rest of the ingredients. For the tuna: Dice the tuna into 1-centimeter (1/2-inch) cubes and add to a bowl along with the sriracha, mayonnaise and sesame oil; toss to combine.

Then, beat the eggs in a bowl using a fork or whisk. Take a saute pan and coat the bottom of the pan with the olive oil, so it is fully covered. Then turn the heat on medium, being careful to not let the oil burn. Splash in a speck of the egg batter to see if the oil is hot enough; the egg will puff up when the oil is ready. At this point, dip the dredged fish into the beaten egg, making sure to cover both sides well, and then place in the saute pan with the hot oil. Let the fish cook on each side until golden brown; be careful not to burn fish in the hot oil. Also, please note that the fish is very tender and breaks easily, so use caution when flipping the fish with a metal spatula or tongs.<br> For the margarita sauce: In another saute pan, add half of the butter, the chicken stock, the wine, pinch of salt and pepper, and squeeze in three-quarters of the fresh lemon. Make sure to save a few lemon wheels for garnish and set aside. Simmer the sauce for several minutes on medium heat, and then add the cooked fish to the sauce and let that simmer on low heat for a couple of minutes more. This is to infuse the sauce flavor with the egg-battered fish. For the potatoes: Take the potatoes and cut into cubes. Par-cook them by boiling them in a small pot of water until they begin to soften, but still retain some firmness. In another saute pan over medium-low heat, coat the bottom of the pan with the olive oil and add the butter. Once the butter and olive oil have joined together, add the potatoes to the mixture and turn the heat to medium-high. Next, add the paprika, salt and pepper to taste. Stir the potatoes so that they are all coated evenly with the mixture. Taste one of the potatoes to know when they are finished cooking (they should be slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside). Place the cooked potatoes in a bowl and strain any excess oil from the potatoes. Garnish the potatoes with the parsley and finish with a pinch of table salt.<br> Plate the fish from the margarita sauce, then pour just a bit of the sauce over the fish to highlight the bottom of the plate surrounding the fish. Pour the remaining sauce into a small cup for dipping the fish and/or potatoes. Garnish the top of the fish pieces with 2 thinly sliced lemon wheels and a parsley sprig. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 46072,&quot;Tasso Maque Choux 1 tablespoon olive oil 3 ounces diced Tasso ham 3 cups sweet corn kernels 1 cup onions 1/2 cup chopped green bell peppers Salt Cayenne pepper 1 cup chopped, peeled and seeded tomatoes 1/2 cup heavy cream Instructions: In a large saute pan, over medium heat, add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the Tasso and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the corn, onions and bell peppers. Season with salt and cayenne pepper. Saute for about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the corn is tender.

Now put the ham in a bag large enough to hold it and pour in the marinade. Tie up the bag. Let this marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 days and up to 4 days. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Take the pork out of the marinade and put it into a Dutch oven or roasting pan, fat-side-up. Cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Turn it fat-side-down, cover and cook another 1 1/2 hours. Turn the meat one last time and cook 1 hour more. Now the meat should be almost falling off the bone. If it is not, it needs more time covered in the oven. Turn up the heat to 375 degrees F and cook, uncovered, 30 minutes to brown. Now remove the roast to a cutting board and allow it to rest a few minutes. Pull apart the pork with 2 large forks, degrease the remaining drippings from the roasting pan and pour the jus over it. Toss and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 46074,&quot;Chili-Corn Casserole 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 ears corn, kernels cut off Kosher salt 6 scallions, chopped 3 to 4 cups leftover Slow-Cooker Texas Chili, recipe follows 1 1/2 cups shredded pepper jack or Monterey jack cheese (about 6 ounces) 1 (18-ounce) tube precooked polenta, cut into 12 rounds 2 1/2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar Kosher salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 small onion, finely chopped 5 cloves garlic, smashed Two (4.5-ounce) cans chopped green chiles, drained 1 tablespoon ground cumin 3/4 cup chili powder 1 14 -ounce can diced tomatoes with chiles 1 to 2 tablespoons green hot sauce Sliced scallions, fresh cilantro and/or sour cream, for topping Tortilla chips, for serving (optional) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

In a medium saucepan, heat the cream, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves over medium heat, stirring occasionally, just until it comes to a boil. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse at least 15 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the granulated sugar. Whisking constantly, gradually pour in the hot cream mixture. Whisk in the pumpkin puree. Pour the mixture into 4 ovenproof ramekins and arrange in a hot water bath. Bake in the center of the oven until almost set but still a bit soft in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. The custard should \\shimmy\\ a bit when you shake the pan; it will firm up more as it cools. Remove from the water bath and let cool 15 minutes. Tightly cover each ramekin with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic does not touch the surface of the custard. Refrigerate at least 2 hours, and up to 24 hours. When ready to serve, preheat a broiler to very hot (or fire up your kitchen torch). Uncover the chilled custards. Pour as much coarse sugar as will fit onto the top of 1 of the custards. Pour off the remaining sugar onto the next custard. Repeat until all the custards are coated. Discard any remaining sugar.

Lay the tortillas on your work surface. Sprinkle some cheese on half of each tortilla, leaving 1/2-inch border. Put some purslane on top of the cheese, and drizzle about 2 teaspoons of the salsa verde on top. Top the purslane with the remaining cheese. Fold the tortillas in half. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 teaspoons of the butter and melt until the foam just about subsides. Put in 2 of the tortillas and cook, pressing lightly with a spatula once or twice, until the underside is golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip, and cook until the second side is brown and the cheese is melted, about 2 more minutes. Transfer the tortillas to a cutting board. Wipe out the skillet. Repeat with the remaining butter and tortillas, lowering the heat a bit if the butter or tortilla browns too quickly.

Peel and cut the bananas into 1/2-inch thick slices. Trim the top off the pound cake and cut the rest into the same size squares as the banana chunks. Cut the top and bottom off the pineapple and remove the rind from around the sides. Cut the pineapple in half and then into quarters. Trim the core and cut each piece again lengthwise. Cut the strips into 1/2-inch thick pieces. On a wooden skewer, alternate pieces of banana, pound cake, and pineapple until the skewer is full, leaving about 2 inches for a handle. You should have 8 to 10 skewers. Finish with a cherry. Brush with melted butter and grill for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. (Alternatively, you can broil the skewers for about 1 to 2 minutes per side.) Sauce: Meanwhile, heat the cream in a small pan over medium heat; do not let it boil. Add the chocolate to the warm cream. Let sit for a few minutes, then stir the mixture to melt all the chocolate. Cool for a few minutes and pour into a squeeze bottle.

Turn to blacken on all sides. When fully charred, remove to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let pepper cool, until you can handle it comfortably. Using your fingers, remove blackened skin to reveal the red color underneath. (A paper towel will wipe off what you can&#39;t remove with your fingers.) Coarsely chop the pepper and place it in the bowl of a food processor. Add the yolks, garlic, vinegar, chili paste, and salt to taste. Puree until the mixture is homogeneous. While the machine is running VERY slowly drizzle in the oil, until incorporated. Check the aioli for texture and flavor. If it&#39;s too thick, add a few drops of water to thin it down, or on the flip side if it&#39;s too thin add more oil. The desired outcome is a fairly thin aioli. Check the flavor and add more salt or chili paste, if desired. Refrigerate until ready to use. To cook the mussels: In a pot, large enough to accommodate all the mussels, generously coat with olive oil. Add the onions and bring to a medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Cook the onions until they are very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic, thyme and bay leaf and cook for another 2 to3 minutes. Stir to be sure the garlic doesn&#39;t burn. Add the mussels and stir to coat with the oil. Add the wine and cover the pot. Steam the mussels for 5 to 6 minutes or until all the shells open. If some shells don&#39;t open, cook them for a little longer. Sometimes the freshest mussels are the most stubborn to open. Remove the mussels that don&#39;t open after longer cooking. When in doubt, throw out. While the mussels are steaming, grill or toast the slices of bread. Serve the mussels in individual bowls with lots of the juice from the bottom of the pot. Generously drizzle each bowl with the aioli. Garnish with toast. (You may want to have more toasted bread on hand to sop up the delicious liquid!) *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 46092,&quot;Giada Dog at Pink&#39;s 6 all-beef hot dogs 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 8 cremini mushrooms, sliced into 1/4-inch slices<br> 1 small onion, halved and sliced thin from root to tip 1 small onion, halved and sliced thin from root to tip<br> 1 red pepper, thinly sliced<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 2/3 cup yellow cherry tomatoes, halved<br> 1 cup shredded mozzarella 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 6 potato hotdog buns<br> Instructions: Heat a 10-inch saute pan over medium heat.

For the garlic butter: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the butter and garlic, and cook until the butter has melted and garlic has become fragrant, 5 to 6 minutes. Mix in the parsley. Reserve to the side in a small bowl. For the donkey sauce: In a small mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, roasted garlic, mustard, salt, Worcestershire and pepper. Mix well. Cover and reserve. For the black and blue burger: Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Divide the ground beef into eight portions; roll each into a loose ball, then flatten into a 4-inch patty. On four of the patties, place 2 ounces of the blue cheese. Cover with a second patty and gently seal the edges to form a stuffed patty about 1 1/2-inches thick. Season the stuffed patties on both sides with the blackening spice. Grill, spaced 3 inches apart to prevent flare ups, until a crust has developed on the first side, about 3 minutes. Flip, and cook to develop a crust on the reverse side, 2 minutes. Top each burger with 2 slices of bacon and 1 ounce of the remaining blue cheese. Cover with a piece of foil and cook another 30 seconds to melt the cheese. Remove the burgers to a serving tray to rest. Lightly brush the cut sides of the brioche buns with garlic butter, and toast on the grill until crisp and golden, 5 to 10 seconds. To assemble: Smear the buns with some donkey sauce. Layer the bottom buns with pickles, onions and a burger. Top with tomatoes and lettuce. Cover with the bun tops and secure with wooden skewers.

Remove both ends and cut the lotus root into 1/4-inch-thick slices (about 32 slices, if possible). Soak the slices in a large bowl of cold water to prevent the lotus root from turning black and remove some of the starches. Add the ground pork, Shaoxing wine, 1 teaspoon of the potato starch, 4 teaspoons of the soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of the toasted sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of the sugar, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, the ground white pepper and the chicken bouillon powder if using to a large bowl. Add all the scallion white parts and half of the green parts and 3 tablespoons cold water, and stir in one direction until the mixture is combined and very sticky, 3 to 5 minutes. Set the filling aside.<br> Drain the lotus root slices and arrange them in pairs of similar-size slices on a sheet of paper towel. Pat dry with a second paper towel. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the pork filling on 1 piece of each pair of lotus root slices. If there is leftover pork filling, evenly divide it among the slices. Top the filling with the remaining lotus root slices to make sandwiches. Gently press them together so the pork fills the holes of the lotus roots on both sides; smooth the filling around the edges.<br> To fry the lotus roots: Fill a wok or a Dutch oven with about 1 1/2 inches frying oil (about 4 cups for a wok) and heat it over medium heat to 300 degrees F. Set a cooling rack in a baking sheet. As the oil is heating up, lightly dust the outside of the stuffed lotus roots with flour.<br> Mix the batter by whisking the flour, baking powder, baking soda, five-spice powder, 1/3 cup potato starch, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in a medium bowl until combined. Slowly drizzle in the seltzer and whisk until the batter is just smooth and resembles the consistency of a crepe batter. If the batter is too thick, add a tablespoon of cold seltzer at the time until it reaches the right consistency. Stir in 2 ice cubes to keep the batter cold.<br> When the oil is ready, one at a time, dip a stuffed lotus root into the batter to coat and then carefully lower it into the hot oil. Repeat with more stuffed lotus roots so you are frying 7 to 8 pieces at a time, regulating the heat to bring it back to 300 degrees F. Cook, gently moving the lotus roots so they don&#39;t stick to the bottom, until light golden, 5 to 6 minutes (you aren&#39;t cooking them all the way through because they will be fried again). Remove from the oil using a spider or slotted spoon and set on the prepared baking sheet to drain. Repeat with the remaining stuffed lotus roots. (The lotus roots will turn soggy after a few minutes, that is normal.)<br> Increase the heat to high heat and bring the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry half the stuffed lotus roots until dark golden brown and very crunchy, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove them to the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining stuffed lotus roots.<br> To make the dipping sauce: Whisk together the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl until dissolved. Add the white vinegar, chili crisp, sesame seeds, remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil and green parts of the scallions.<br> Serve the lotus roots warm with the dipping sauce.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 46097,&quot;Lime Chicken Tequila Tailgate 2 ounces olive oil 1 cup julienned red onion 1 tablespoon minced jalapeno 1/2 cup roasted and julienned red bell pepper 1 roasted chicken, boned, skin discarded and shredded 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped garlic 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish 4 tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish 5 ounces mozzarella, grated 4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 3 ounces tequila 1/4 cup diced Roma tomatoes, for garnish 4 sourdough rolls, warmed Instructions: Layer 2 (15-inch) sheets of heavy aluminum foil together and fold 1/4-inch of the edges together to create 1 sheet. Repeat with another 2 pieces of foil, to create 2 double foiled sheets. Bend the edges of 1 of the sheets up 2 inches, to help keep the liquid in the foil. On a double sheet of foil, layer (in this order), the oil, onions, jalapeno, red bell peppers, chicken, salt and pepper, garlic, cilantro, cheeses, lemon juice and tequila. Put the second, double layered foil sheet on top of layered ingredients. Fold both double layered sheets of foil together in 1/4-inch folds, 4 times. When all the sides are folded together, make sure that the pouch is not leaking. Refrigerate until ready to cook. To cook preheat the oven or grill to 250 degrees F. Remove the foil pouch from the refrigerator and put on the grill, being careful not to snag the foil pouch and tear it open. Grill for 10 minutes, then flip and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove the pouch from the grill and slice the bag open.

When just about smooth (one or two small pieces of chocolate may remain visible), immediately remove the chocolate from the stove and briskly stir in the remaining chopped chocolate. Stir constantly until perfectly smooth. To assemble chocolate crisps: When smooth, stir in cereal and, when well combined, use a large rubber spatula to help pour into prepared baking sheet. Use an offset metal spatula to spread chocolate mixture evenly in pan, then lift pan and give it one or two good rap&#39;s on the counter to remove any air bubbles and assure an even layer. Place in freezer (uncovered) for no longer than 5 minutes, then remove and, using sturdy cookie cutters (plain or flutted), cut chocolate into shapes. As you cut, gently push chocolates out of the cutter onto second sheet, lined with wax paper. Note: Since cutting cooled chocolate into shapes takes a little muscle, place a pot holder or a folded dry kitchen towel over top of cutter to protect your hand. To wrap and store: If desired, wrap crisps individually in colored foil wrappers (available in stores that specialize in candy making). Alternatively, store unwrapped crisps in a tin, separated by sheets of wax paper. Tempered chocolate should be stored at a comfortable room temperature. Shaping Variation To form drop candies: After tempering chocolate, choose any type of addition: i.e. crispy cereal, cocktail peanuts, raisins, walnuts, minimarshmallows, mini m &amp; m&#39;s, diced chewy caramels and the list goes on... After stirring in your chosen addition, drop mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls onto wax paper lined tray, with 1inch in between each mound. When finished, place tray in the freezer for 3 to 5 minutes (no longer). Remove and let sit at room temperature until completely set. Store in an airtight tin, separated by sheets of wax paper. Chocolate Variation and Temperature Guide Beginners should stick to working with the darker chocolates (semisweet, bittersweet and dark sweet). The lighter chocolates (milk and white chocolate) are more heat sensitive because of the milk solids. If you feel more confident using a chocolate thermometer, purchase a mercury thermometer specifically designed for chocolate. When melting the initial bulk of chocolate, don&#39;t allow the temperature to rise above 118F. At 115F, it&#39;s the right time to remove the bowl from heat and stir in remaining chopped chocolate. After stirring until smooth, check temperature. The darker chocolates should be cooled to 90F to be in proper condition after setting. Lighter chocolates should be cooled to 86F. Keep stirring briskly until desired temperature is reached, then chocolate is ready to work with as directed in your given recipe. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 46113,&quot;Irish Beer Cheddar Soup 64 ounces Irish lager, such as Harp 25 ounces chicken stock 2 tablespoons onion powder 2 tablespoons white pepper 2 pounds peeled and diced potatoes 2 ounces cornstarch 6 ounces water 1 pound Cheddar, shredded 8 ounces Cheddar cheese sauce Instructions: Add the beer, chicken stock, onion powder and white pepper to a large pot over medium heat and bring to a boil.

The next day, strain the chickpeas and discard the soaking liquid. Rinse the chickpeas and return them to the pot. Add the remaining teaspoon baking soda and water to cover by about 3 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, skimming off and discarding any foam that rises to the surface, until the chickpeas are very soft and creamy (not crumbly) when pressed between a thumb and forefinger, about 40 minutes. If the liquid boils off while cooking, add more water to cover and continue to cook. Strain the chickpeas and discard the liquid. Let the chickpeas sit in the strainer to drain and dry out for 5 minutes. Put the chickpeas in the bowl of a food processor along with the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, all but a pinch of the dill and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and process until the mixture is a paste, scraping down the bowl as necessary. With the motor running, slowly pour in 1/4 cup of the ice water and continue to process until the mixture is smooth and light, about 5 minutes, adding more water a tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency is reached. Transfer the hummus to a shallow bowl and cover by lightly pressing plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the hummus; let sit at room temperature until ready to serve, up to 1 hour. (The hummus can also be made a day ahead and refrigerated. Take the hummus out of the refrigerator to warm up 30 minutes before serving.) Before serving, remove the plastic wrap from the hummus. Smooth the outer rim of the hummus with the back of a large kitchen spoon, creating a slight well in the center. Dollop the yogurt in the center. Scatter the radish slices and capers on top, sprinkle with the reserved dill and serve with slices of pumpernickel bread and cucumbers. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 46118,&quot;Slow Roasted Veal Shank with Melted Cabbage and Cippolini Onions 1 veal shank, (4 pounds) minus hock (10 to 12 inches long) Sea salt and pepper 4 ounces olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 carrots, diced 2 celery stalks, diced 1 onion, diced 10 ounces white wine 5 whole garlic cloves 2 bay leaves 4 sprigs thyme 4 sprigs parsley 6 peppercorns 1 green leek 1-ounce bacon fat 1-ounce duck fat 1 onion, sliced thin 6 shallots, sliced 1 head cabbage, shredded Salt and pepper to taste 1/4 tablespoon caraway seeds 4 ounces white wine 16 ounces of oxtail stock 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1-ounce rice wine vinegar 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup sugar 1 pound cippolini onions Salt to taste 1 sprig thyme Chicken stock to cover 6 tomatoes, concasse (finely chopped) 1 clove garlic, minced 1 tablespoon ginger, grated 1 tablespoon rice vinegar 1 tablespoon sugar to taste 1 tablespoon mustard seeds Instructions: Season shank with sea salt and pepper.

Add the raisins, remove from the heat, and let macerate for at least 4 and up to 24 hours at room temperature. Strain the raisins, finely chop, and set aside for the cupcake batter. Bring the strained rum to a boil in a small saucepan and reduce to 1/4 cup. Remove from the heat and let cool before adding to the buttercream. Combine the butter and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and whip until light and fluffy, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl once. Add 3 cups of the powdered sugar and whip until light and fluffy. Add the cooled reduced rum and the rum extract and add more powdered sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, and whip until slightly thick, spreadable consistency. For the cupcakes: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Fill mini muffin tins with liners and spray the liners with nonstick spray. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, 1 1/2 cups of the sugar, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg together in large bowl. Whisk together the melted butter, buttermilk, oil, vanilla, rum extract, and yolks in a medium bowl. In a clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites at medium-high speed until foamy, about 30 seconds. With the machine running, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar; continue to beat until stiff peaks just form, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer to a separate bowl and set aside. Wash the bowl and dry. Add the flour mixture to the now-empty mixing bowl fitted with whisk attachment. With mixer running at low speed, gradually pour in the butter mixture and mix until almost incorporated (a few streaks of dry flour will remain), about 15 seconds. Stop the mixer and scrape the whisk and sides of the bowl. Return the mixer to medium-low speed and beat until smooth and fully incorporated, 10 to 15 seconds. Using a rubber spatula, stir 1/3 of the whites into the batter to lighten, and then add the remaining whites and gently fold into the batter until no white streaks remain. Quickly fold in the reserved raisins. Fill the cupcake molds 7/8 full and bake until just firm, about 10 minutes. Let cool in the pan set on a baking rack for 5 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the tins and let cool completely on the racks.

Add the sausage and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking up the pieces with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink in the middle and cooked through, 6 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the sausage to a plate. Add the pepper and onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the rosemary and cook until just fragrant, about 1 minute.<br> Meanwhile, whisk the eggs, cream, cheese, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper together in a large bowl until combined. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the sausage. Pour the egg mixture on top and gently stir to incorporate the fillings.

On low speed, mix in the flour, cream, vanilla extract, lemon zest, salt, and pear brandy. Set aside for 10 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, peel, quarter, core, and slice the pears. Arrange the slices in a single layer, slightly fanned out, in the baking dish. Pour the batter over the pears and bake until the top is golden brown and the custard is firm, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, sprinkled with confectioners&#39; sugar, and creme fraiche. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 46134,&quot;Fresh Baked Boules 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 (1/4-ounce) packet fresh fast-acting yeast 1 1/2 cups warm water, between 100 and 115 degrees F, as measured with a candy thermometer (any hotter will kill the yeast - an organic leavener; too cool and the yeast won&#39;t be activated) 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus some extra for kneading 1/4 cup melted butter Instructions: Dissolve salt, sugar, and yeast in the warm water and allow the yeast to proof. (\\Proofing\\ the yeast is testing it for viability. It will develop a foam which looks like the head of a beer. If it doesn&#39;t proof, the yeast is dead and should be discarded.) Proofing takes about 15 minutes. Place flour in a food processor fitted with a dough blade, and through the feed tube with the food processor running, slowly pour the proofed yeast mixture, until the dough comes together and is a cohesive mass. Transfer the dough to a floured board, and knead for about 5 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel and allow dough to rise, so that it roughly doubles in volume. (This will take about 30 minutes to 1 hour). The dough has risen enough if you make an indentation with your finger and it does not spring back.) Punch the dough down and allow it to rise again. (Allowing the dough to rise a second time gives it a finer texture.) Note: It will not rise as much the second time. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Divide the dough in half, and transfer half to a floured board and keeping the balance covered with the towel. Shape the dough into a circle by pulling from the side and pushing the dough under and up from the bottom to form a dome, rotating to make it circular. Cover with a piece of oiled plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes. Repeat for each section of dough. Grease a round cake pan for each loaf and transfer dough to the pans. (This shape will keep the dough from flattening out while it bakes.) Brush with melted butter and bake until the crust is golden brown and crispy. When done, the bread should sound hollow when tapped, approximately 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes in pan. Remove from pan and serve warm or room temperature with butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46135,&quot;Seared Tuna, Yellowtail and Salmon with Three Dipping Sauces 1 pound skinless salmon fillet, sliced into 1-inch-thick strips 1 pound skinless tuna loin, sliced into 1-inch-thick strips 1 pound yellowtail fillet, sliced into 1-inch-thick strips Canola oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Garlic-Lime Aioli, recipe follows Spicy Ponzu, recipe follows Orange-Ginger Sauce, recipe follows 1 cup mayonnaise 2 cloves garlic, smashed to a paste with salt Zest and juice of 1 lime Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 1 teaspoon cl-garlic sauce Pinch sugar Freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 tablespoons peeled and finely grated fresh ginger 1/4 teaspoon red cl flakes 1 1/2 cups fresh orange juice 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce Juice of 1 lime 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest 1/4 teaspoon grated lime zest 1 large scallion (white and green part), thinly sliced 1 teaspoon toasted white sesame seeds Instructions: Preheat a charcoal grill or kamado-style ceramic charcoal cooker for direct grilling over high heat.

Add the remaining olive oil and sear the pork, turning until all sides are golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes total. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat registers 150 degrees F, about 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside for 5 minutes to rest on a cutting board. Deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup chicken broth. Reduce a little and swirl in 2 tablespoons butter. Thinly slice the pork, divide among 4 plates. Drizzle with pan sauce and serve with the greens and dinner rolls or biscuits. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, GSM]&quot; 46142,&quot;Chicken&#39;s Egg Easter Basket 1 Vanilla Cupcake, recipe follows Basic Glaze Icing, tinted light blue, recipe follows Green Coconut Grass, recipe follows 6 small yellow malted milk eggs 2 2/3 cups sugar 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces 2 large eggs 2 large egg yolks 2/3 cup milk 2/3 cup water 2 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/3 cups cake flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 3 (1 pound boxes) confectioners&#39; sugar 1 cup water 5 tablespoons light corn syrup 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract Food coloring, as desired (see suggested colors below) 2 cups sweetened shredded coconut 1 to 2 teaspoons liquid green food coloring 1/2 to 1 teaspoon liquid yellow food coloring Instructions: Dip cupcake into the icing; let excess drip back into bowl. Place cupcake on a rack over paper towels to catch any drips. Top with a small mound coconut grass. Place malted milk eggs on top. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 12-cup cupcake tins with paper liners. (To avoid cupcakes sticking if they overflow slightly, lightly spray the tops of the pans.) Put tins on a baking sheet. Set aside. Process sugar and butter in a food processor until very creamy, scraping sides as needed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, pulsing after each addition. Add the milk, water, and vanilla and process to blend. Whisk both flours, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add the dry ingredients, in 3 batches to the wet, pulsing, and then scraping batter off the sides of the processor as needed after each addition. Process until the batter is very smooth, about 2 minutes. Evenly pour the batter into the prepared cups, filling them 3/4 of the way full. Bake until the cakes are just firm and spring back when gently pressed, and the tops are golden, 18 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly in tin, and turn out of tin when cool enough to handle. Cool cupcakes completely on a rack before frosting. Put the sugar in an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on the lowest speed, slowly add the water, the corn syrup and vanilla extract. When the sugar is sufficiently moistened (it won&#39;t fly out of the mixer), raise the speed to high, and beat for 2 minutes until completely smooth and glossy. Divide and color, as desired. Store at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the icing, to prevent forming a skin. For cupcakes: Dip the surface of the cupcakes into the icing, allowing excess to drip into bowl. Clean any excess from the sides. Alternately, use a knife or a spreader to apply. Whisk as needed to keep icing glossy and smooth while using. For Light Blue Icing: Combine 2 to 3 drops of blue food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing. For Deep Yellow Icing: Combine 4 to 5 drops of yellow food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing. For Purple Icing: Combine 4 drops of red and 5 drops of blue food coloring to 1 cup of Basic Glaze Icing. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a mesh rack on top, if available. Put coconut in a shallow bowl. While tossing with a large spoon, add food coloring drop by drop until the desired color is reached. A little more green than yellow makes a pretty grass color. Add a few tablespoons water to moisten the mixture and help disperse the color evenly. If the color is too dark, add additional water, as needed, to dilute to the desired color. Drain the coconut in a sieve or strainer. Spread the coconut in an even layer on the rack, or directly on the lined baking sheet. Place in the oven until dry, about 10 to 15 minutes. Use immediately, or store in covered container for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 46143,&quot;Apple Chips with Sweet Yogurt Dip Vegetable oil cooking spray<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon salt<br> 1 red Gala apple<br> One 6-ounce Granny Smith apple<br> 1 1/2 cups plain 2 percent or whole milk Greek yogurt<br> 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Pinch salt<br> Instructions: For the chips: Place 1 rack at the top and 1 at the bottom position and preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line 2 large heavy baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly coat the parchment with nonstick spray. For the topping: In a small bowl, stir the sugar, cinnamon and salt until blended. For the apple chips: Stand each apple upright. Cut 1/4 inch vertically off the right and left sides of each apple. Set the mandoline or v-slicer for cutting 1/16-inch-thick slices. Place 1 apple, cut-side down, on the slicer. Cut slices until the apple core is exposed. Turn the apple over and cut slices off the remaining side until the core is exposed. Arrange the apple slices in a single layer on one of the baking sheets. Repeat with the second apple. Using your fingertips, sprinkle the apple slices generously with the topping. Bake until the edges curl and the chips are golden and feel crisp, 40 to 45 minutes. Pull the parchment with the apples onto the work surface and cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes (the chips will crisp more as they cool). For the dip: In a medium bowl, stir the yogurt, maple syrup, vanilla and salt until blended. Cover and chill until ready to serve.

Add the turkey wings and brown. Remove the turkey wings and add the remaining oil, onion, carrots, garlic, herbs, and peppercorns and cook for 5 minutes, scraping the brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Return the wings to the pot and add chicken broth. Bring to the boil, skimming any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Strain out and discard the solids and set aside the stock. Once your turkey has roasted, set the pan over medium heat on the stove top. Discard some of the fat if there is too much (you&#39;ll need about 1/4 cup). Add the butter and cook until melted. Add the flour to the pan and, using a whisk, stir constantly to incorporate the fat and flour. Once you have a consistent paste add the warm stock in a steady stream while you stir to work out any lumps. Cook until the gravy has thickened, about 10 to 15 minutes. Season well with salt and pepper and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46175,&quot;Tomato Basil Tartlets 1 (10 by 9-inch) sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed 1/3 cup olive tapenade 1 cup (2 1/2 ounces) shredded fontina cheese 8 cherry tomatoes, quartered 6 basil leaves, chopped Fleur de sel or other large flake sea salt Instructions: Special equipment: a 2 1/4-inch round cookie cutter Place an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Using the tines of a fork, prick the pastry all over. Using a 2 1/4-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 16 rounds of pastry. Place the pastry rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Lay a piece of parchment paper on top of the pastry rounds. Place another baking sheet directly on top of the parchment paper to keep the pastry even while baking. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until golden. Remove the top baking sheet and the top piece of parchment paper. Spread 1 teaspoon of tapenade on each pastry round. Place about 1 tablespoon of cheese on top. Arrange 2 pieces of tomato on the cheese. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes until the cheese has melted. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the chopped basil on top. Transfer the tartlets to a platter and garnish with a pinch of fleur de sel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 46176,&quot;Detroit-Style Pepperoni Pizza 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 batch Pizza Dough, recipe follows 8 ounces sliced pepperoni, about 1/8 inch thick (look for smaller-size pepperoni sticks)<br> 16 ounces brick cheese (or whole-milk mozzarella), cut into 1/2-inch cubes<br> Pizza sauce, store-bought or homemade, recipe follows 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon rapid rise yeast<br> 1 teaspoon sugar Olive oil, for oiling the bowl 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> One 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes<br> 2 teaspoons sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Position an oven rack in the bottom of the oven and preheat to the highest temperature setting, 500 to 550 degrees F. Pour the oil in a large, square metal cake pan (or, ideally, an authentic Detroit-style pizza pan). Put the Pizza Dough in the pan and gently stretch it out to fit so the dough reaches the corners. If the dough is being temperamental, set it aside for another 10 minutes to relax and try again. Layer the pepperoni on the dough. Then lay the cheese cubes all over, especially around the perimeter up to the edge of the pan (this creates the coveted crispy cheese crust). Dollop the pizza sauce on top in 3 lines. Bake in the ultra-hot oven until bubbly and golden and a crispy cheese crust has formed, 10 to 15 minutes. Using a fish spatula, loosen up the edges and place on a cutting board. Slice into squares and serve! Put the flour, salt, yeast and sugar in a food processor with a metal blade attachment and pulse to combine. Add 1 cup warm water, then process until a ball forms, about 30 seconds (if a ball does not form, add a bit more flour). Process for another 30 seconds, then roll into a tight ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Proof in a warm spot until the dough doubles in size, about 2 hours. Heat a small saucepot over medium heat and add the oil. Add the Italian seasoning and garlic and saute until fragrant; do not let the garlic burn. Add the tomatoes and sugar and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and simmer until concentrated, about 30 minutes. Set aside to cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 46177,&quot;Grasshopper Pie 24 chocolate wafer cookies 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 tablespoon creme de menthe 6 cups mini marshmallows 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons creme de menthe 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon pure peppermint extract 1 cup heavy cream 9 chocolate wafer cookies 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoons creme de menthe Fresh mint leaves, for garnish Instructions: For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Process the cookies and granulated sugar in a food processor until finely ground. Add the melted butter and creme de menthe, and pulse until moist. Press the crumbs into a 9-inch pie plate, and bake until firm, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the crust cool completely on a wire rack. For the filling: Microwave the marshmallows and butter in a microwave-proof bowl on high until the butter is melted and the marshmallows have broken down, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine, and let cool for 5 minutes. Beat the creme de menthe and heavy cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy peaks form, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer, add 1/3 of the cooled marshmallow mixture and beat on medium-high until combined, about 15 seconds; repeat with the remaining marshmallow mixture in 2 batches. (The whipped cream won&#39;t hold its peaks, and the cream-marshmallow mixture will appear quite loose, but it firms quickly as it cools in the pie crust.) Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust. Cover the pie with plastic, and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours or overnight. For the chocolate mint whipped cream: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar, cocoa powder and peppermint extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium high speed until combined. Add the heavy cream, and beat on medium-high until fluffy peaks form. To assemble: Arrange the wafer cookies on top of the pie. Top each cookie with 1/2 teaspoon creme de menthe (it will soak in almost immediately). Transfer the whipped cream to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip, and pipe it onto the soaked cookies. Garnish with mint leaves. The pie can be refrigerated, loosely covered, up to overnight or served immediately. Serve with any extra leftover whipped cream on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 46178,&quot;Raita 1 cucumber, grated 1 tomato, chopped finely 1/2 cup buttermilk 1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt A pinch of salt A pinch of pepper Instructions: Place the cucumber and tomatoes in a sieve for about 15 minutes to drain off any excess liquid.

Scoop the solids off the top of the can of coconut cream into a separate large bowl. (Discard the liquid; if any liquid has risen to the top, pour it off before scooping out the solids.) Break the solid coconut cream into small chunks, then add the heavy cream and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. (There may be a few small chunks of coconut cream.) Fold about half of the whipped cream into the mango mixture with a rubber spatula until combined, then fold in the remaining whipped cream until no white streaks remain. Spoon the mixture into a freezer-safe 9-by-5-inch loaf pan or 2-quart baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm and scoopable, at least 6 hours or overnight.

Sprinkle the meat with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Lightly cover with plastic wrap and chill until ready to assemble, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. For the stuffing: Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up any large pieces with a wooden spoon, until lightly browned but not fully cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.<br> Return the skillet to medium-high heat and melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add the celery, onion and half of the thyme and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any brown bits, until tender and just beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the bowl with the sausage.<br> Return the skillet to medium-high heat, pour in the wine and scrape up any brown bits. Simmer until the smell of alcohol subsides, about 2 minutes. Add the broth and bring to a simmer, then pour into the sausage mixture. Add the stuffing mix and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, cover and chill until ready to assemble.<br> For the mushrooms: Return the same skillet to medium-high heat and melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until they begin to brown in spots, about 3 minutes. Toss and cook on the other side, undisturbed, until browned in spots, about 3 minutes more. Add 1 tablespoon butter, the remaining garlic and thyme and some salt and pepper and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until browned and very fragrant, about 3 minutes more. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool. Cover and chill until ready to assemble. For the green beans: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and line a plate with a paper towel. Add the green beans to the boiling water and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and transfer to the lined plate. Let cool. Keep the water boiling.<br> For the squash: Line a plate with a paper towel. Add the squash to the boiling water and cook until tender but still holding their shape, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to the lined plate and let cool. Cover and chill until ready to assemble. Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Set a rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and coat the rack with cooking spray.<br> Spread the stuffing over the turkey breast, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Gently press the stuffing into the meat to adhere. Position the turkey so that one of the short sides is facing you. Starting 3 inches from the bottom edge, arrange a compact row of cranberries crosswise over the stuffing (maintaining the 1-inch border on the left and right sides). Arrange a compact row of green beans crosswise over the breast, next to but not covering the cranberries. Arrange the mushrooms crosswise over the breast, next to but not covering the green beans. Arrange the butternut squash crosswise over the breast, next to but not covering the mushrooms and ending no further than halfway down the length of the turkey.<br> Working from the bottom edge, roll the breast up tightly. Tuck in any filling that spills out of the sides once the turkey breast is rolled completely. Tie the roulade tightly with kitchen twine every 2 inches to make a compact log. Tie once more lengthwise to keep the filling secure. Place the roulade seam-side down on the prepared rack and baking sheet. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, then brush over the roulade. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.<br> Transfer to the oven and pour 6 cups warm water into the baking sheet. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted perpendicularly into the center of the thickest part of the roulade registers 150 degrees F, 3 to 3 1/2 hours (check on the skin after 2 hours and cover with foil once it is deep golden brown). Let sit at room temperature, loosely covered with foil, for 1 hour; the internal temperature will continue to climb and will reach 165 degrees F.

For the sauerbraten: Place the beef in a large, heatproof, nonmetallic bowl. Pour in the hot marinade and cool to room temperature. Add the parsley, turn the beef in the marinade, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 4 days, turning the beef in the marinade every 8 hours.<br> On the 5th day, remove the beef from the marinade and pat it dry. Strain the marinade, reserving both liquid and solids. Rub the beef with half the salt and pepper, then dredge with flour. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium-size heavy kettle over moderate heat, add the beef and brown well on all sides; this will take 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the beef to a plate, pour off and discard all casserole drippings, then add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the casserole and melt over moderate heat. Add the carrots, onions, and reserved marinade solids and saute, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Return the beef to the casserole, add 2 cups of the reserved marinade and the tomato paste, and bring to a boil over high heat. Adjust the heat so the marinade bubbles gently, cover the kettle with a round of foil, set the lid in place, then simmer the sauerbraten 3 1/2 to 4 hours, turning occasionally, until tender. Carefully replace the foil and kettle lid each time you turn the meat. As soon as the sauerbraten is tender, remove it to a large plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Skim as much fat as possible from the marinade, then strain it, discarding the solids. Return the marinade to the casserole, add the remaining reserved marinade along with the sugar, sherry, red wine, and raisins and boil, uncovered, over high heat for 5 to 7 minutes, until reduced by half and of good gravy consistency. Taste, and if the gravy is too sour, smooth in 1 to 2 tablespoons of the jelly. Season the gravy with the remaining salt and pepper. To serve: Slice the sauerbraten across the grain and about 1/4-inch thick, arrange on a large heated platter, overlapping the slices slightly, and smother with the gravy. Pass any extra gravy separately. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 46191,&quot;Kansas City Barbecue 2 cups sugar 1/4 cup paprika 2 teaspoons chili seasoning 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 cup salt 2 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 rack Baby Back Ribs Barbecue Rub Apple juice in a spritzer 2 cups BBQ sauce, your favorite Instructions: Combine all ingredients in shaker and use as \\rub\\ on the following meats. Peel membrane off the back of each slab. Then rinse the slab off to get rid of bone dust. Dry with cotton towel. Take shaker of \\rub\\ and lightly coat both sides of meat. Preparing smoker: Put charcoal in chimney with paper underneath and light. (Do not use charcoal lighter-it will taint the flavor of the meat.) Let coals get hot, about 30 minutes. Transfer coals into smoker, and add 1 hickory log per hour on top of charcoal if smoker is big. (Adjust if using small smoker.) Wait until temperature of smoker reaches 220 degrees. Leave damper open so you don&#39;t trap stale smoke in chamber. Over course of cooking, maintain heat with additional coal and wood, as needed. After placing ribs inside smoker, spritz with apple juice once an hour. After about 3 hours, when meat is nice dark color, spritz one last time and wrap in foil. Let ribs cook in foil for another 2 hours, giving you a total cook time of 5 hours. You can feel when the ribs are tender rather than rubbery (they bend rather than bounce back). Unwrap them (carefully), lift them out of juice and place on cutting board, brush on room temperature BBQ Sauce.

Add the boiling water and stir until fully combined and no streaks of flour remain. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface, reserving the bowl, and knead until spongy and pliable, about 2 minutes. It should resemble soft clay. Place the remaining 2 tablespoons rice flour in the same bowl. Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, roll into a rope about 1/4-inch thick, then cut the rope into 1/4-inch-wide segments. Roll each segment into a ball, then place in the bowl. Gently toss all the balls from that piece of dough with the flour to prevent sticking and clumping. Repeat with the remaining 3 pieces of dough. Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over medium heat. Using a slotted spoon, sift the excess rice flour from the balls, then place them in the boiling water. Stir gently at first to prevent clumping and then allow the balls to cook until they all float, about 3 minutes. Drain the boba balls, reserving the saucepan. Transfer the boba back to the saucepan and add the remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, the molasses and 1/2 cup water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the brown sugar and molasses become thick and syrupy, 8 to 10 minutes. (The mixture should be slightly thicker than maple syrup.) Transfer the boba mixture to a medium bowl and refrigerate until completely cooled, about 1 hour. For the ice cream pops: When the boba mixture is ready, make the ice cream base. Stir together the condensed milk and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. Whip the heavy cream in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold one-third of the whipped cream into the salted condensed milk until combined, then fold this mixture into the remaining whipped cream until fully incorporated. Fill each ice pop mold with 2 tablespoons of the ice cream base, followed by 2 teaspoons of the boba mixture (see Cook\\u2019s Note). Fill the remaining space in the molds with more ice cream base, then drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon of the boba syrup on top. Using a small spoon or small offset spatula, run it through the ice cream to create swirls of boba and syrup. Insert the ice pop sticks, then gently tap the molds on the work surface to release any air bubbles. Carefully transfer the molds to the freezer and freeze for at least 8 hours or, ideally, overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 46199,&quot;Twin Peaks Martini 1 ounce whiskey 1 ounce Dubonnet Splash triple sec Lemon twist Instructions: Combine all drink ingredients in a shaker over ice.

Sear the pork on all sides, then transfer to a quarter sheet tray and roast for 8 to 10 minutes, turning the pork halfway through cooking. Reserve the saute pan with the drippings for a later use. For the chutney: Heat a large, straight-sided saute pan over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook to render the fat. Add in the shallots and season with salt, and cook until soft and aromatic, 6 minutes. Add in the bourbon, brown sugar, vinegar, mustard, peaches, cinnamon, thyme bundle and some salt, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer, stirring the peaches frequently until the liquid evaporates and the peaches are a chutney-like consistency, 10 minutes. Check to make sure the peaches are cooked through.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Butter and flour a mini Bundt pan.<br> For the Cakes: Place the pineapple in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until coarsely chopped. In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, combine the chopped pineapple, 2 tablespoons pineapple juice, sugar, and butter over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook until the liquid evaporates and the mixture begins to brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and let marinate overnight in the fridge. Drain the beef in a colander with a bowl underneath, reserving the marinade. Place the flour, pepper and some salt in a shallow plate and, working in batches, toss the beef in the flour, shaking off any excess. In a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, cook the bacon until the fat has been rendered and the bacon is slightly crispy. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon from the pot, leaving the fat in the pot and reserving the cooked bacon. Working in batches, add the coated beef to the pot with the reserved bacon fat and brown on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer the beef from the pot to a bowl and repeat with the remaining beef and seasoned flour until all the beef has been browned. Pour off any excess fat in the pot and increase the heat to high. Pour the sherry into the pot and, using a wooden spoon, scrape up the bits on the bottom of the pot. Pour the liquid over the beef. For the bouquet garni: Using kitchen string, tie together the celery, parsley stems, thyme, and bay leaves, making a bouquet garni. For the stew: Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat in the same pot used to brown the beef and add the garlic, carrots and onions. Cook until the onions are slightly golden, about 4 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Add the reserved marinade, beef with juices, cooked bacon and bouquet garni, and bring to a simmer. Cook over medium-low heat, partially covered, until the beef is tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil and blanch the pearl onions for 2 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water, peel and set aside. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium saucepan over high heat until the foam subsides. Saute the onions until brown spots appear. Add 1 3/4 cups water, bring to a simmer and partially cover. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until they are tender, about 20 minutes. Uncover and cook until the liquid is reduced and the onions are glazed, about 10 minutes. Over high heat, melt the remaining tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet and saute the mushrooms until they are golden and all the liquid they have released evaporates, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Wait until the last 15 minutes of cooking the stew to add the pearl onions and mushrooms, and then cook for the remaining 15 minutes. Remove the bouquet garni and skim the fat from the stew. Season with salt and pepper. Serve stew over roasted fingerling potatoes and garnish with chopped parsley. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah]&quot; 46223,&quot;White Bean Fish Stew 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 ribs celery, diced<br> 1 bulb fennel, top only, coarsely chopped, fronds reserved<br> 1 onion, diced<br> Kosher salt<br> Crushed red pepper 2 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 1 1/2 pounds cod fish bones<br> 1/2 cup dry white wine<br> 2 bay leaves<br> 1 small bundle fresh thyme, tied with twine<br> Olive oil 2 ribs celery, diced<br> 1/2 bulb fennel, diced<br> 1/2 onion, diced<br> Pinch crushed red pepper<br> Kosher salt 2 cloves garlic, smashed<br> 1/2 cup dry white wine<br> One 16-ounce can cannellini beans, drained<br> One 16-ounce can San Marzano tomatoes<br> Pinch of saffron<br> 2 cod cheeks<br> 4 shrimp, shelled and deveined<br> 2 calamari, cleaned and cut into rounds<br> 10 mussels, cleaned<br> Good-quality olive oil, for finishing Pinch of fennel pollen<br> 4 slices crusty bread, grilled with olive oil<br> Instructions: For the fish stock: Heat a large pot over medium heat and coat with the oil.
