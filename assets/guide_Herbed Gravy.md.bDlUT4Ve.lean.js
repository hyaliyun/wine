In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the egg, egg yolks, and 1/2 cup of the sugar together on low speed until just combined. Meanwhile, scald the cream in a small saucepan until it&#39;s very hot to the touch but not boiled. Add the cardamom and mix well. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the cream to the eggs. Add the framboise and vanilla. Distribute the raspberries among 6 (6 to 8 - ounce) ramekins and then pour the custard mixture into the ramekins until they&#39;re almost full. (I use a large glass measuring cup for easy pouring.) Place the ramekins on a sheet pan and carefully pour hottest tap water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the custards are just set when gently shaken. Remove the custards from the water bath, cool to room temperature, cover and refrigerate until cold. To serve, spread 1 tablespoon of sugar evenly on the top of each ramekin and heat with a kitchen blowtorch until the sugar caramelizes evenly.

Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and simmer for about 25 minutes or until the juice is reduced to a syrup. Remove from the heat. Strain the reduction through a chinois or fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lay out a large piece of aluminum foil. Make a 1/2-inch thick bed of kosher salt on a jellyroll pan. Rinse and dry the beets. Remove all but 1 inch of the stems (leaving the roots and part of the stems prevents the beets from bleeding). Coat the beets with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and place them on the jelly-roll pan. Wrap the beets with the foil to form a package and set it on the bed of salt. Roast the beets for 30 to 40 minutes or until tender. To test for tenderness, insert a skewer or paring knife into 1 of the beets. If the skewer meets with no resistance, the beets are done. When the beets are cool enough to handle, cut off the roots and stems. If you wish, keep the stems on a few beets for presentation. Slip the skins off the beets with your fingers. Cut the beets into quarters and put them in a medium-sized bowl. Toss with the remaining olive oil and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. To serve, place a few assorted beet quarters inside a small cup, positioning the ones with stems near the top. Drizzle with the red beet juice reduction and garnish with thyme leaves. Repeat to make 5 more servings. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 44985,&quot;Pit Fired Ham Glazed with Pineapple and Mango Maple Syrup 2 cups store bought mango sauce or 2 mangoes, peeled, seeded and diced 1 cup maple syrup, light or dark 1 4 ounce can pineapple chunks 1 (16-ounce) can pineapple rings, juice reserved 13 to 15 pound ham, bone-in Toothpicks, as needed Instructions: Preheat a barbecue, charcoal pit, or oven to 350 degrees F. In a small saucepan, add the mango sauce or mangoes. Stir in the maple syrup, pineapple chunks and pineapple juice and bring to a simmer. Continue to simmer for 8 minutes and then remove from the heat. Working with a sharp knife, score the ham on the bias, fat side up, by drawing the knife from 1 side of the ham to the other. Be sure and make the incisions deep enough (about 1/2-inch) so that the glaze can reach the meat underneath the layer of fat. Continue scoring the top of the ham in the other direction to form a criss-cross pattern over the top. Using the toothpicks, attach the pineapple rings to the top and sides of the ham. With a pastry brush or a large spoon, liberally apply a layer of the glaze. Place the ham in the oven or a barbecue pit and cook, frequently applying coats of the glaze about every 20 minutes. Allow 20 to 25 minutes per pound of ham in a barbecue pit and 10 to 15 in a 350 degree F oven.

Season both the eggs and the bread crumbs with salt and pepper. Take the squid rings and tentacles and coat them with the egg. Remove and allow any excess egg to drip off, and then roll the pieces in the bread crumbs. Place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and refrigerate. In a medium-size saute pan, heat the cl oil lightly. Add the garlic and season with salt and pepper. Take care not to brown the garlic but instead sweat it so that the liquid emerges and it becomes translucent. Add the sliced celery and stir to coat everything evenly. Cook for 1 minute. Stir in the lemon slices and set aside to cool. Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot (or alternatively, a deep fryer). Heat the oil slowly to 375 degrees F.

When oil is hot, stir in minced onion, green and red pepper, celery and garlic. Cook over medium-low heat until vegetables are softened and fragrant, about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomato puree, tomato paste, ketchup, vinegar, molasses and Worcestershire sauce. Bring mixture to a simmer and turn heat down to very low. Simmer sauce with the cover ajar for 1 hour. Meanwhile, heat an 8-inch skillet over high heat and when hot, add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil. When oil is hot, add chopped mushrooms and cook mushrooms, stirring over high-heat until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn heat off and set skillet aside. After sauce has been simmering for 1 hour, uncover and add Sauteed chopped mushrooms, prepared fresh tomatoes, oregano, Bovril seasoning and some freshly ground black pepper. Bring back to a simmer and cook with the cover ajar for 30 minutes more. Uncover and let cool until needed. Note: If you plan on cooking right away, just measure out 2 cups of the sauce, and let the remaining sauce cool. Freeze for the next time. To add browned ground meat: Heat a 10-inch deep-sided skillet over medium heat and, when hot, add the ground meat and break up with a wooden spoon. Cook meat until separate and golden brown, then remove from the stove and drain out any excess fat from skillet. Return pan to stove and stir in 2 generous cups of prepared sauce to meat. Bring mixture to a gentle simmer over low heat and cook (uncovered) until flavors mingle and the mixture is piping hot throughout, about 10 minutes. Add some more freshly ground black pepper to taste and Note: If serving 4, brown 1 pound of ground meat and add 1 generous cup of sauce. To assemble Sloppy Joe&#39;s and serve: Spoon ground beef mixture onto split hamburger buns that have been spread lightly with butter and broiled to toast the buttered side only. Serve hot. Variation Tips: This Sloppy Joe mixture is not only great on buns, but it&#39;s also fabulous over hot (lightly buttered) pasta. Toss in some cooked peas (fresh or frozen) and you&#39;ve got yourself a hearty and delicious meal. Alternatively, stir this into a bowl of cooked long grain white rice, for a change of texture. And don&#39;t throw out any leftovers...heat it up the next night and spoon it onto baked potatoes. Eat (as is) or if desired, sprinkle the top lightly with grated cheddar cheese and broil until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Now, add a simple green tossed in a light vinaigrette and you&#39;ve got yourself yet another easy and delicious meal! &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 44992,&quot;Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs 4 cups pickle brine (use your favorite brand)<br> 4 cups buttermilk<br> Canola oil, for deep-frying 2 cups potato starch 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup rice flour<br> 4 teaspoons salt<br> 3 teaspoons smoked paprika<br> 3 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 2 teaspoons bullet cl<br> 1 cup honey 1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter<br> 1 pound all-purpose flour 2 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper 4 teaspoons baking powder<br> 2 1/2 teaspoons salt<br> 1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter<br> 1 1/2 cups milk<br> 3/4 cup sour cream Nonstick cooking spray, for the parchment 1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter 1 cup honey<br> 1/2 cup chili crisp<br> 3 tablespoons pickled jalapeno juice<br> 1/2 teaspoon mushroom seasoning<br> 12 American cheese slices Instructions: For the chicken: Trim the thighs of any excess fat or cartilage.

Scrape along the wishbone with the back of a paring knife to expose the bone. Reach in with index finger and thumb to remove the wishbone by pulling it out, being careful not to tear the meat. Make incision along the breastbone and from breastbone down to rib cage. Follow rib cage to thigh and wing joints and carefully cut through thigh and wing joints leaving wing attached to breast. Separate the breast from the thigh and leg. Remove the wing at the middle joint and cut the end of the attached wing bone square. Push the meat on the wing down toward the breast, cleaning the bone with a paring knife. Push the meat on the bones of the thigh and leg, leaving the leg bone attached to the meat at the drum end. Square off the end of the drumstick with a French knife. Remove the thigh and the thighbone. Repeat for other half of duck. (Note: you may use boneless duck breasts if limited on time.) Lay breasts skin side down, clean the excess skin, and shape into teardrops with a boning knife. From the thick end, pierce the breast directly beneath the skin, straight in to the tip of the breast, making a pocket. Be careful not to poke through the flesh while making pocket. Pocket should extend the length of the breast. In a saucepan, saute the leeks in the butter until tender. Add the herbs and carefully deglaze the pan with apple brandy. Add 1 ounce of cream, reduce until thickened, and cool. In a meat grinder, grind the thigh meat and liver through the fine die. Using a food processor, process until smooth. Add remaining cream, and mix well. Add leek mixture, and season, to taste. Using a pastry bag, pipe approximately 2 tablespoons of forcemeat into each duck breast pocket. Plug the end of the pocket with the tender. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Brown duck breast in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, skin-side down, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn duck breast over, place in the oven, and cook until desired temperature is reached. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 45000,&quot;Bon Voyage Baked Alaska 6 eggs, separated 1/2 cup plus 4 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/8 cups cake flour, sifted 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 half-gallon neopolitan (vanilla-chocolate-strawberry) ice cream in a rectangular carton 2/3 cup water 2 tablespoons cornstarch 2 tablespoons sugar 8 egg whites, at room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar (make sure it is a fresh container, i.e. not stale) 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup chocolate sauce (heated, if desired) 1/2 cup raspberry sauce (heated, if desired) 1/2 cup caramel sauce (heated, if desired) Instructions: For the cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and lay parchment paper over the bottom of a jelly roll size baking pan (17 1/2 by 11 1/2-inches by 1-inch deep). With an electric beater, beat together the egg yolks, just 1/4 cup of the sugar (reserving the rest), and vanilla until the mixture becomes a pale yellow and thickens. Sift cake flour over the egg yolk mixture and set aside briefly. Wash and dry the beaters. In a separate metal bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar together and gradually beat in the balance of the sugar until stiff peaks form. To the egg yolk/flour bowl, fold in 1/3 of the beaten egg whites until just barely combined. Repeat 2 more times with each of the remaining 1/3 of the beaten egg whites. Spread into jelly roll pan and bake in oven for about 15 minutes or until the surface is golden brown and springs back when touched. Let cake cool in pan. While the cake is cooling, it would be a good idea to make room in the freezer for the sheet cake and ice cream. When the cake is completely cool, peel off the browned surface of the cake. (You can do this simply by loosening it and rolling it off.) Firmly press a flat baking sheet without edges (which is the same size or larger than the baking tin) against the top edges of the baking tin and invert the cake so it is transferred to the flat sheet and remove the parchment paper. Then cut the cake in half lengthwise and in half crosswise. Two of these quarters will be dedicated to the top and bottom of the baked Alaska, respectively. Using a broad thin spatula, slide one of these quarters to a flat oven safe platter. Loosen the carton from the half-gallon of ice cream and place the entire brick onto the cake on the platter. Then slide the other quarter onto the top of the brick of ice cream and put the whole platter into the freezer. The remaining 2 pieces of cake will fit over the sides and ends of the brick of ice cream. Cut the cake to fit the dimensions of the sides and ends utilizing the most efficient positioning which will result in the fewest number of cuts. You will need 2 rectangles measuring approximately 8 inches by 3 inches and 2 rectangles measuring approximately 8 by 5-inches. Cover with plastic wrap if you are not using these immediately, to prevent them from drying out. Some of the meringue topping will be used to secure these rectangles to the sides of the ice cream. To make the meringue topping, make a slurry with 2/3 cup water gradually whisked into a small saucepan to which you have added cornstarch and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. As it thickens and becomes translucent, cover and remove it from the heat. In a scrupulously clean large metal or glass bowl, with scrupulously clean beaters, beat the egg whites (they must be at room temperature) until foamy. Add vanilla and cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Very gradually beat in sugar on high until glossy and stiff peaks form, but do not allow it to get dry. Reduce the speed of the beater to low and gradually add the cornstarch slurry. When it has all been added increase speed to medium for about 10 seconds. This can be refrigerated with plastic wrap on top for a short while before use. Immediately before serving the Baked Alaska, make sure your oven rack is in a position to provide enough clearance for the meringue and pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the sheet cake and ice cream from the freezer. Using some of the meringue as a \\glue\\ position the pre-cut pieces of cake to fit the sides and the ends of the brick of ice cream. Then spread the rest of the meringue in a thick layer over the entire assembly, swirling it decoratively with the back of a spoon, and being sure to cover the lower edge of the cake on all sides so the meringue touches the pan base. Slide the Alaska into the oven and bake until the meringue browns, 5 or 10 minutes. Serve immediately with accompaniments of chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce, and caramel sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45001,&quot;Roasted Mussels with Spicy Pork Sausage 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 cup finely chopped onion 4 ounces Spanish chorizo, chopped 2 cups canned crushed tomatoes, with their juice 1 cup dry white wine Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds mussels, rinsed, scrubbed, and de-bearded 1 cup chicken stock or dry white wine 4 lemon wedges, for garnish Instructions: Tomato Sauce: To make the tomato-sausage base, put a saucepan over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the onions and cook until translucent, stirring, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chorizo and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and wine, reduce the heat to a simmer, and simmer gently until slightly thickened and reduced, about 10 to 15 minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Keep the tomato base warm while you cook the mussels. Mussels: Put the mussels in a large skillet or wok over high heat, add the stock or wine, and cover with a lid. Cook the mussels until they open, about 5 minutes. Remove the lid, and pour the tomato-sausage base over the mussels. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until fully heated through. Divide the mussels among 4 shallow soup bowls and serve immediately, garnished with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 45002,&quot;Three-Cheese White Pizza 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 2 teaspoons sugar 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the bowls 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Kosher salt 2/3 cup ricotta cheese 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (about 1 ounce) 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing 2 cloves garlic, grated 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano or rosemary 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes Kosher salt 4 ounces fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced Instructions: Make the dough: Combine the yeast, 1 cup warm water (about 100 degrees F) and the sugar in a food processor and pulse once to combine. Let sit until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the olive oil; pulse to combine. Mix the flour and 2 teaspoons salt in a medium bowl; add to the food processor and pulse until the dough pulls away from the side and gathers around the blade. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form into 2 even balls. Transfer to 2 lightly oiled bowls; cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 2 to 4 hours. (You can make the dough ahead; wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to 1 week or freeze up to 2 months. Bring to room temperature before using.) Set a pizza stone or large baking sheet on the lowest oven rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Meanwhile, make the topping: Combine the ricotta, parmesan, olive oil, garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes in a bowl; season with salt and set aside. Stretch 1 ball of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured pizza peel or inverted baking sheet. Spread half of the ricotta mixture on top, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with half of the mozzarella, then brush the edge lightly with olive oil. Slide the pizza onto the hot stone or baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool 2 minutes before slicing.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the mustard, vinegar and shallots. Whisk in the canola and olive oils to emulsify the dressing, and then fold in the capers and dill. Season with pepper only, as the capers are salty. On the large-hole side of a box grater, grate the onion into a strainer set over a bowl. Then, peel the potatoes. It is important to work quickly to avoid potato oxidation. You do not want to store the potatoes in water, as the starch will be washed away. Using the large-hole side of the box grater, grate the potatoes into the strainer. Press out the liquid and discard. Toss the potatoes with the onions and season with salt and pepper. In an 8-inch nonstick saute pan set over medium-high heat, melt the Clarified Butter. It will seem like a lot of butter. Pack the potatoes into the pan, so that the layer is 1/2-inch thick. Saute the potatoes until the bottom just starts to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Carefully and gently flip the potato pancake onto a small plate browned-side up. Then slide the potato pancake back into the pan and brown on the other side over medium-high heat. Place in the oven and cook until evenly golden, another 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the potato pancake on a paper towel and cut into quarters. Roll the smoked salmon into rosettes. Top the potato pancake slices with the smoked salmon rosettes, a few dollops of creme fraiche and the dill fronds. Drizzle with the vinaigrette before serving. Heat the butter in a heavy-duty saucepan over very low heat until it&#39;s melted. Simmer gently until the foam rises to the top of the melted butter. The butter may splatter a bit, so be careful. Once the butter stops spluttering and no more foam seems to be rising to the surface, remove from the heat and skim off the foam with a spoon. Line a mesh strainer with a few layers of cheesecloth or gauze and set the strainer over a heatproof container. Carefully pour the warm butter through the cheesecloth-lined strainer into the container, discarding any solids from the bottom of the pan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 45012,&quot;Pizza on a Stick 1 13.8-ounce package refrigerated pizza dough All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 cup marinara sauce 1 1/2cups shredded mozzarella cheese 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese 3/4 cup chopped pepperoni, black olives and/or mushrooms Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing 2 cloves garlic, minced Pinch of dried oregano Pinch of red pepper flakes Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-by-16-inch rectangle. Cut into 6-by-8-inch quarters, then cut each quarter in half diagonally to make 8 triangles. Brush each triangle of dough with marinara sauce, leaving a 1/2-inch border all around; sprinkle with mozzarella and parmesan (reserve some of the sauce and cheese for topping). Layer a few pieces of pepperoni, olives and/or mushrooms over the cheese, reserving a few pieces for topping. Slightly fold in the two far corners, then roll up the dough from the long side, like a burrito, until the filling is fully enclosed in a tube, pressing gently to seal. Carefully insert a popsicle stick or wooden skewer into the center of each pizza roll and arrange on the prepared baking sheets. Brush the rolls with olive oil and more marinara sauce; sprinkle with garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes. Press any extra filling ingredients onto the rolls.

Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and swirl to coat the skillet. Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper on the smooth side of each breast. Place in the skillet seasoned side down and cook without disturbing until brown and crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes. Season the top side of the chicken and flip. Cook 1 minute over the burner; then transfer the skillet to the oven until chicken registers 165 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 6 to 8 minutes more. Place on a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing. For the sauce: smash the garlic clove, sprinkle with the salt, and with the side of a large knife, mash and smear the mixture to a coarse paste. Transfer to a blender with the parsley, mint, pepper, lemon zest, and juice. Pulse until coarsely chopped and then slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Pour into a small bowl and adjust seasoning.

Put a jelly roll pan or a half sheet pan in the oven. Begin by making the tomato sauce. In a large saute pan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons olive oil, the minced garlic, thyme and oregano. Cook until just fragrant then add the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Lower the heat and simmer for 7 to 8 minutes to reduce and concentrate the flavor. Shut off the heat and set aside. Take the preheated jelly roll pan out of the oven and drizzle some olive oil over the entire surface. Cut the dough into 2 pieces and reserve 1 piece for another use. Stretch the pizza dough out so it is just bigger than the pan, then lay it inside the pan, so the dough comes up the sides to form a crust on the rim. Smear with tomato sauce then tear up the mozzarella and scatter it evenly over the top of the pie. Tear the basil leaves, spread them over the top and drizzle with a little more olive oil. Give it a final season with salt and pepper, to taste, then bake in the hot oven until golden and bubbly, about 15 to 18 minutes In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes. If you&#39;re using a stand mixer, combine the salt and flour to the bowl and pulse a few times to mix. Add the yeast mixture, at the lowest speed, until the flour incorporates. When the dough starts to come together, increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough gathers into a ball. This should take about 2 minutes. Add the olive oil and pulse a few more times. Stop the machine periodically to scrape the dough off the hook. Get a feel for the dough as you&#39;re making it by squeezing a small amount together between your thumb and fingers. If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water, if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it over itself a few times, kneading until it&#39;s smooth and elastic. If you&#39;re making the dough by hand, add the yeast mixture to a large bowl and stir in the salt and the 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then begin stirring in the flour. When the mixture becomes too stiff to stir with a spoon, knead in the rest of the flour by hand, adding just enough so that the dough is soft but not too sticky. As you work, squeeze a small amount of dough together between your thumb and fingers. If it&#39;s crumbly, add more water; if it&#39;s sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Form the dough into a round and put it into a lightly oiled bowl, turning it over to coat the dough entirely with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot (i.e., over a gas pilot light) until it doubles in size, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, cut into slices and serve. . &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 45019,&quot;Ghouly Cupcakes 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1/2 cup root beer, flat 1/3 cup unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/4 cups sugar 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 1/4 cup sour cream 2 large eggs, room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 8 large egg whites 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 pinch fine salt 1 teaspoon banana extract, or more to taste 1 to 2 drops pastel food coloring, optional Candied eyeballs Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line standard muffin tins with cupcake liners or spray footed cupcake holders with nonstick spray.<br> Put the butter, root beer, and cocoa in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on HIGH until the butter melts, about 2 minutes. Whisk to combine.<br> Meanwhile, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the sour cream, eggs, and vanilla together in a small bowl. Whisk the hot cocoa mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir in the sour cream mixture just to combine; take care not to overmix. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared muffin cups, filling each one about 3/4 of the way full, about 1/4 cup per cupcake. Bake cupcakes until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely in the tin on a rack. Remove from liners and return cakes to a rack.<br> For Frosting: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a mixer&#39;s bowl above the water. Whisk the egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt in the bowl by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and continue whisking until the mixture is hot to the touch and the sugar dissolves, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until eggs beat up into a cool stiff meringue, about 5 minutes. Add a few drops of desired extract and/or food coloring and lightly beat into the meringue.<br> To decorate: Using a spoon, offset spatula or piping bag, dollop, spread or pipe about 1/2 cup meringue on top of each cupcake to make a ghost or monster of your choice. Decorate with candied eyeballs or other candies.

To make the filling: Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl, stirring to incorporate. To make the sauce: Put the herbs in a food processor with the green onions, lemon zest, salt, and pepper; pulse to chop it up a bit. Add about 1/4 cup of olive oil and puree it down until smooth and bright green. Coat a wide saute pan with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and place over medium heat. When the oil gets hazy, add the anchovies and mash them up with a wooden spoon so they melt into the oil. Toss in the garlic and stir it around until it just begins to turn golden, not brown. Carefully pour the herb sauce into the anchovy oil, stirring to incorporate. Mix in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper. To make the pasta dough: In an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook*, combine the flour and salt. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and continue to mix. Drizzle in 1 tablespoons of the olive oil and continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Sprinkle some flour on work surface, knead and fold the dough until elastic and smooth, this should take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax. *Alternatively if you don&#39;t have an electric mixer: Combine the flour and salt on a flat work surface; shape into a mound and make a well in the center. Add the eggs and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the well and lightly beat with a fork. Gradually draw in the flour from the inside wall of the well in a circular motion. Use 1 hand for mixing and the other to protect the outer wall. Continue to incorporate all the flour until it forms a ball. Continue as directed above. Cut the ball of dough in 1/2, cover and reserve the piece you are not immediately using to prevent it from drying out. Dust the counter and dough with a little flour. Press the dough into a rectangle and roll it through a pasta machine, 2 or 3 times, at widest setting. Pull and stretch the sheet of dough with the palm of your hand as it emerges from the rollers. Reduce the setting and crank the dough through again, 2 or 3 times. Continue tightening until the machine is at the narrowest setting; the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should be able to see your hand through it.). Dust the sheets of dough with flour as needed. Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Dust the counter and sheet of dough with flour, lay out the long sheet of pasta, and brush the top surface with the egg wash, which acts as a glue. Drop tablespoons of your favorite filling on 1/2 of the pasta sheet, about 2-inches apart. Fold the other 1/2 over the filling like a blanket. With an espresso cup or fingers, gently press out air pockets around each mound of filling. Use a sharp knife to cut each pillow into squares and crimp the 4 edges with the tins of a fork to make a tight seal. Dust the ravioli and a sheet pan with cornmeal to prevent the pasta from sticking and lay them out to dry slightly while assembling the rest. Cook the ravioli in plenty of boiling salted water for 4 minutes; they&#39;ll float to the top when ready, so be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Lift the ravioli from water with a large strainer or slotted spoon. Bathe the ravioli in your favorite sauce to lightly coat and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 45023,&quot;Spiked Weekend Smoothie 8 large strawberries, trimmed, halved, and frozen 3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 1/2 teaspoon orange zest 1 cup vanilla frozen yogurt or ice cream 1 tablespoon sugar, or more if berries are not very sweet 2 tablespoons orange liqueur Orange wedges, for garnish Instructions: In a blender, combine frozen strawberries, orange juice, and orange zest.

Carefully combine the potatoes and vegetables, add bacon back to the pan then season the warm salad with salt and black pepper, to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 45036,&quot;How to Make Homemade Pumpkin Pie | Classic Pumpkin Pie 1 1/4 cups all purpose flour 2 teaspoons sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup cold butter (1 stick), diced 1 large egg, lightly beaten Flour for rolling the dough One 15-ounce can unsweetened pure pumpkin puree (about 2 cups) 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 3 eggs, lightly beaten 1 1/4 cups half-and-half 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg Instructions: Make the dough by hand. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean-sized bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture.<br> Alternatively, make the dough in a food processor. With the machine fitted with the metal blade, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean-sized bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don&#39;t let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand.<br> Form the dough into a disk, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.<br> On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough with a rolling pin into a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie pan and trim the edges, leaving about an extra inch hanging over the edge. Tuck the overhanging dough underneath itself to form a thick edge that is even with the rim. Flute the edge as desired. Freeze the pie shell for 30 minutes.<br> Set separate racks in the center and lower third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Put a piece of parchment paper or foil over the pie shell and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake on a baking sheet on the center rack until the dough is set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and lift sides of the parchment paper to remove the beans. Continue baking until the pie shell is lightly golden brown, about 10 more minutes. Cool on a rack.<br> Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.<br> While the pie shell is cooling make the filling. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, brown sugar, eggs, half-and-half, spices, and salt until smooth. Return the pie shell to the baking sheet and pour in the filling.<br> Bake on the lower oven rack until the edges of the filling are set but the center is still slightly loose, about 50 to 60 minutes. (If the edges get very dark, cover them with aluminum foil.) Cool on a rack. Serve room temperature or slightly warm.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45037,&quot;Split Pea Soup with Crispy Kielbasa Good olive oil 2 cups chopped leeks, white and light green parts, spun-dried (2 leeks)<br> 1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onion (1 large)<br> 2 cups (1/2-inch) diced, scrubbed carrots (3 large)<br> 1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves)<br> 1 pound dry green split peas<br> 8 cups good chicken stock, preferably homemade 1 smoked ham hock<br> 8 fresh thyme sprigs, tied with kitchen twine<br> 2 large fresh bay leaves<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 12 ounces smoked kielbasa, halved lengthwise and sliced diagonally in 1/4-inch-thick pieces<br> Minced fresh parsley, for serving<br> Instructions: Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large (11 to 12-inch) pot or Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset, over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, onion, and carrots and cook for 7 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender and starting to brown. Stir in the garlic and cook for one minute. Stir in the peas to coat with oil and cook for one minute. Add 8 cups of the chicken stock, 2 cups water, the ham hock, thyme bundle, bay leaves, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, partially covered, for 1 1/4 hours, stirring occasionally, until the peas are very tender and falling apart. After 45 minutes, stir more frequently, scraping the bottom of the pot to be sure the soup doesn\\u2019t burn. Discard the thyme bundle, bay leaves, and ham hock. Transfer 2 cups of the soup to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and pure. Return the pure to the pot, adding more chicken stock or water if the soup is too thick. To serve, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium (10 to 11-inch) saut pan over medium heat. Add the kielbasa and saut for 5 to 6 minutes, tossing occasionally, until the kielbasa is browned. Serve the soup hot with the kielbasa and parsley sprinkled on top. Make ahead: Reheat the soup over low heat, adding chicken stock or water to thin. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45038,&quot;Monster Meatballs 6 slices Texas toast 1 cup milk<br> 1 1/2 pounds ground turkey<br> 1 1/2 pounds ground sausage<br> 2 cups finely grated Parmesan 1/4 cup minced fresh parsley, plus more for garnish<br> 5 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 large onion, finely diced Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil, for frying<br> 4 cups store-bought marinara 2 1/4 pounds bucatini, cooked, for serving 12 fresh basil leaves, chopped Instructions: Soak the Texas toast in the milk in a shallow bowl for 10 minutes. Add the turkey, sausage, Parmesan, parsley, garlic, onion and some salt and pepper to a bowl. Add the Texas toast and milk. Mix together (the bread will get broken up as it mixes) and form 3 oversized balls. Heat some oil over medium heat in a small Dutch oven. Add the meatballs and carefully brown/sear the surface, moving them around to keep their shape. The meatballs should be somewhat crowded in the small pot. Pour in the marinara and add water if needed to cover. Bring to a simmer, cover and simmer, carefully turning the meatballs halfway through, until cooked through, about an hour. To serve: Plate up the bucatini and top with the sauce and meatballs.

Lay each triangle on a lightly floured work surface with the tip facing you. Gently pull the tip toward you; this light stretch adds layers to the finished croissant without adding density. Use the palms of your hands to roll each triangle up from the base to the tip. (At this stage, they can be frozen for up to 1 week if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Thaw on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet overnight in the refrigerator before proceeding.) Place the rolled croissants on a parchment covered baking sheet; spaced about 2 inches apart. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Allow the croissants to proof at room temperature until they have doubled in size and appear light and full of air; about 1 1/2 to 3 hours depending on the temperature of the room and of the dough. For the Pain au Raisin: Have dough rolled to the 10 by 36-inch rectangle. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of almond cream over the dough, spreading it all the way to the edges of the rectangle. Sprinkle the top of the almond cream with the hydrated raisins. Roll the dough toward you, starting at the long side. Try to keep the roll tight and even. Cut the roll into 1-inch-thick slices. You will have a tail on each slice. To close the pain au raisin, simply tuck the tail under the dough. Place the pain au raisin on a parchment covered baking sheet, spaced about 2 inches apart. Allow the Pain au Raisin to proof at room temperature until they have doubled in size and appear light and full of air; about 1 1/2 to 3 hours depending on the temperature of the room and of the dough. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Make an egg wash by whisking together the egg yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small bowl until well combined. With a pastry brush, very gently coat the pastries completely with egg wash. Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Leftovers can be stored in the freezer if well wrapped in plastic wrap for up to 2 weeks. Thaw at room temperature and warm in the oven before serving. For the egg wash: Prepare the dough: Melt the 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Allow the butter to cool to room temperature. It should be warm to the touch. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the cold water. Place the flour, salt, sugar, milk, and melted butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Set the mixer on medium speed and mix just until the ingredients are dispersed, about 5 seconds. Add the dissolved yeast and beat on medium-high speed until the dough is well combined and no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl, about 1 minute. If the dough is too soft, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it is firmer. (The dough is too soft when it cannot hold its shape.) If the dough is too hard, add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time until it has softened. (The dough is too hard when it is difficult to mix in the mixer.) Remove the dough from the mixing bowl. If the dough is slightly sticky and ropy, knead it with your hands for about 30 seconds, until it is smooth. Pat it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and let it proof at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll it out to an 8 by 15-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Wrap the rectangle in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. The cold retards the rising process, allowing a slow fermentation to help develop the flavor of the dough. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap the rectangle, and place it with a long side facing you on a lightly floured work surface. Spread the softened butter evenly over the right two thirds of the dough. Incorporate the butter by folding the (butterless) left third of the dough over the center, Then fold the right third of the dough to the left, to resemble a folded letter. Roll this out into another 10 by 30-inch rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Fold each short end of the dough to the middle so they meet but do not overlap. Then fold one half over the other half and, if necessary, rotate the dough so that the seam is on your right. Wrap the folded dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap it, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Roll it into a 10 by 30-inch rectangle and turn it so a long side faces you. Give the dough a single fold by folding the left third of the dough over the center, then fold the right third of the dough to the left. Now the dough should resemble a folded letter. Wrap in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out the dough into a 10 by 36-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Keep the thickness even and the edges straight. This will make it easier to cut the croissants or pain au chocolat. For pain au chocolat: With a sharp chef&#39;s knife, cut the dough into 3 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch rectangles. Lay each rectangle on a lightly floured work surface, with a long side facing you, and place about 1/2 tablespoon of the chopped chocolate in the upper third of each one. Fold that third of the dough over the chocolate. Place about another 1/2 tablespoon of the chocolate along one seam of the folded dough. Fold the bottom third of the dough over the chocolate. (At this stage, they can be frozen for up to 1 week if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Thaw on a parchment covered baking sheet overnight in the refrigerator before proceeding.) Turn over the pain au chocolat so the seams face down. This will keep them from opening as they bake. Place them on a parchment covered baking sheet; spaced about 2 inches apart. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and allow the pain au chocolat to proof at room temperature until they have doubled in size and appear light and full of air, about 1 1/2 to 3 hours. For the Danish with apricots or cherries: Roll the dough into a 10 by 36-inch rectangle. Roll up the dough into a long cylinder that is about 2 inches in diameter. Use a sharp knife to make cut 1 1/2-inch slices and lay flat to see the spirals. Place on a parchment covered baking sheet. Allow the Danish to proof at room temperature until they have doubled in size and appear light and full of air; about 1 1/2 to 3 hours. Use your fingers to make an indentation/pocket in the center of the dough. Add a dollop of almond cream to the center of each Danish. Top with fruit (I used canned apricots halves and cherries) that have been drained on a wire rack placed over a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Place the apricot half cut side down onto the almond cream. Or use 3 to 4 cherries. Place the butter, sugar, and almond flour in a medium-size mixing bowl and beat with an electric mixer set on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. The mixture will be dry and sandy until the butter begins to incorporate. Add the egg and mix well. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the side of the bowl as needed. The egg is well incorporated when the mixture is light and creamy, about 3 minutes. It is important to allow time for this air to beat in, otherwise, the almond cream will be too heavy. Add the flour and beat on low speed just until it is no longer visible, about 30 seconds. Pour the almond cream into an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Allow it to come to room temperature before using and beat it lightly with an electric mixer set on medium speed until it returns to its initial volume and is once again light in texture and color. Place the raisins in a mixing bowl or glass jar and add water so that it covers the raisins by at least 1/2-inch. Stir in the rum or flavored alcohol. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 24 hours. It is even better to allow the raisins to hydrate for 2 to 3 days. You can keep them in the refrigerator for a few weeks. When you are ready to use them, strain the amount that you need through a fine-mesh sieve before adding them to the recipe. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 45040,&quot;Jerk BBQ Wings 2 tablespoons all-purpose seasoning 5 pounds wings<br> 4 ounces plus 2 tablespoons jerk rub<br> 12 ounces barbecue sauce<br> 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1 tablespoon browning<br> Instructions: Apply all-purpose seasoning to the wings in a bowl and mix.

Slice 1 fennel bulb paper-thin, then slice 1 onion, 1/2 of the celery root, and 1 of the apples to the same thickness. Switch to a vegetable peeler, and working over the same bowl, peel 1 carrot into thin ribbons. Mix the vegetables and spread them evenly on a baking sheet. Place the sheet in the oven to dry the vegetables until completely brittle, about 2 1/2 hours. (If you have an oven with a convection function, this will shorten the drying time to 1 hour.)<br> Transfer the vegetables to the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade and pulse until reduced to flakes. Store, covered, at room temperature. This can be done 1 day ahead.<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> To prepare the birds, halve the remaining fennel, onion, carrot, and celery root, then cut them again into several small wedges. Place them in a large baking dish along with the potatoes and garlic. Generously season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and mix to coat.<br> Season the guinea fowl with salt and pepper inside and out. Stuff the cavities with whole sprigs of thyme. Rub them all over with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Place the birds on the bed of vegetables. Roast, uncovered, for 45 minutes, basting occasionally with pan juices.<br> Cut the remaining apple into several wedges and add it to the roasting pan. Continue roasting and basting until the skin on the birds turns golden brown, another 20 minutes. Remove the birds from the oven, sprinkle them generously with dried vegetable flakes, then continue to roast until the juices run clear, another 10 minutes. Transfer the birds and roasted vegetables to a serving platter. Cover loosely with foil and let rest while preparing the sauce.<br> To make the pan sauce, pour the pan juices into a small saucepan. Skim and discard as much fat off the top as possible. Over medium-low heat, deglaze the roasting pan with the cider and simmer for 5 minutes, scraping the bottom of the roasting pan to loosen the browned bits. Add the hot cider from the roasting pan to the pan juices, and over high heat, reduce the liquid by half. Stir in the butter, season with salt and pepper, and pour it into a sauce boat. Sprinkle the birds and the vegetables with persillade. Carve the guinea fowl at the table and serve with the cider sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barolo, Ribera del Duero]&quot; 45053,&quot;St. Patrick&#39;s Day Mint Schnapps Shakes 1 pint vanilla ice cream (2 cups) 1/4 cup peppermint schnapps 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 to 4 drops green liquid food coloring 2 mint sprigs Instructions: Blend the ice cream, peppermint schnapps, vanilla and food coloring in a blender until smooth.

If using a charcoal grill, build the hot coals on one side only. If using a gas grill, heat one side only to medium-high heat. Place a cooling rack over indirect heat. Place a heavy-bottomed saucepot over direct heat. Slice the tomatoes in half. Drizzle them with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes on the cooling rack on the grill, cut-side down, to soften and take on some smoke while you make the sauce, 10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, add a drizzle of olive oil to the saucepot along with the bacon. Cook, stirring occasionally until the bacon is crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, onions and crushed red pepper flakes if using and cook until the onions soften, an additional few minutes. Add the wine. Tie the fresh herbs together with a piece of butcher&#39;s twine and add to the saucepot. When your tomatoes have begun to soften, remove them from the grill. Remove the skins (they will come off really easy), add the tomatoes to the saucepot and season with salt and pepper. Close the grill and continue to cook the sauce until the tomatoes fully break down and the sauce thickens slightly, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta 2 minutes less than the package directions. Using tongs, pull the pasta out and add it directly to the tomato sauce, along with 1/3 cup of the starchy pasta water. Mix to combine. The sauce will stick to the pasta. Remove the saucepot from the heat. Add the butter and a drizzle of olive oil to the pasta and stir to combine. Add the basil and and stir again. Serve with freshly grated Parmesan over top. (Alternatively, you can cook the sauce and pasta over medium-high heat on a stovetop.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 45055,&quot;Cracked Black Pepper Bread 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons milk 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons butcher&#39;s grind cracked black pepper One 1/4-ounce package active dry yeast 5 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon fine salt Vegetable oil, as needed Instructions: In a small saucepan, combine the milk, butter, sugar, and pepper. Place over medium-high heat and bring to about 110 degrees F. Remove from the heat and sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the milk. Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Pour the milk and yeast mixture into the bowl of flour and mix until a soft, ragged mixture is formed. Transfer the mixture to a well-floured work surface and knead until a soft elastic dough is formed, about 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and place in a warm spot, until puffed and doubled in size, about 2 hours. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Transfer the dough to the work surface and, using your hands, gently flatten it into a 10-inch-long oval shape. Fold the dough into thirds lengthwise, overlapping the sides in the center. Press down on the overlapping sides to seal and make a seam. Place it seam side-down in a buttered 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, cover with a kitchen towel, and return to the warmest part of the kitchen until the dough has risen about 1 1/2 inches over the top of the pan, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Brush the top of the dough lightly with warm water and, using a sharp knife, make 1/4-inch-deep slit down the center. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove the loaf from the pan and place in the center of the rack. Continue baking until the loaf sounds hollow when rapt lightly with your knuckles on the bottom and top, and a thermometer inserted in the center reads 200 degrees F., about 15 minutes. Transfer the bread loaf to a cooling rack and let cool for 2 hours before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45056,&quot;Candied Sweet Potatoes 3 pounds sweet potatoes 6 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon nutmeg 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon almond extract 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup peach liqueur, like Schnapps 1 teaspoon lemon zest 1 teaspoon orange zest 1 cup orange juice 1 lemon, juiced 1/2 orange, sliced Instructions: Peel and slice sweet potatoes.

I have a memory of my mother taking this out of the oven and I could smell the chocolate and the almonds more than anything else. So delicious. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Use the butter to thoroughly grease the bottom and sides of a 1 quart loaf pan. Add the 2 whole eggs to a small pot and cover them with cold water. Bring the water to a gentle boil over medium heat. When the water boils, lower the heat to a simmer and cook the eggs for 6 minutes. Remove the eggs from the pot and run them under cold water to stop them from overcooking. In a medium bowl add the ricotta and whisk until free of lumps. Add the sugar, rum, chocolate and almonds and stir to blend. Set aside. Peel the hard-boiled eggs and put the yolks through a small strainer to break them into small bits. Add the egg yolks to the ricotta mixture. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, add the 2 egg whites and beat until stiff peaks form, about 3 to 5 minutes. Gently fold the egg whites into the ricotta mixture with a rubber spatula, retaining as much fluffiness as possible. Transfer the mixture to the loaf pan.

Dust a large baking sheet with flour. Put the flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl and mix together to combine. Make a large hole in the center of the flour mix, then pour in the water, just enough to make a dough that is loose and easy to knead, but not too sticky. If it feels tight like Blu-tack (poster-tack) then add more water. As you knead it, the dough will become less sticky, so if you can add all the1 1/4 cups/11fl oz/300ml your loaf will be much lighter with a lovely open texture. Knead the dough for 10 minutes by hand on a lightly floured counter or for 5 minutes in an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the thyme and knead for an additional 30 seconds, or until it is well combined. Put half the chorizo in the middle of the dough and then fold the edge around it to cover and knead it for an extra minute. On a floured surface, shape the fougasse into a ball, making sure the top of the ball is taught and smooth. Using a rolling pin, roll it out into a rough oval shape and transfer to the flour-dusted baking sheet. Using a very sharp knife, or razor blade, carefully cut slashes in the loaf to look like a fern leaf, then with floured hands open up the slashes wide, as they will close up a lot when the bread is left to double in size. Push the remaining chorizo into the top of the dough, then cover the dough loosely with oiled plastic wrap (you may need several pieces). Let rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size. Remove the plastic wrap, then brush the dough with milk and place in the oven. Throw a couple of handfuls of ice cubes in the bottom of the oven or spray the oven with water before closing. This will keep a crust from forming too quickly on the bread, which would prevent the bread from rising nicely. Alternatively, put a roasting pan with water in the bottom of the oven instead. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the bread is well risen, a beautiful golden brown and smells wonderfully cooked. It will come off the sheet once fully cooked too. It is tough to top the taste of warm bread straight from the oven, slathered in oodles of good butter. &quot;,&quot;[Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinot Noir]&quot; 45071,&quot;Open Faced Cucumber Sandwiches Eight 3/8-inch-thick slices sourdough bread 1/2 bunch watercress, chopped 1 cup homemade or store-bought buttermilk dressing 2 ounces cream cheese 1 English cucumber, thinly sliced 1 red pepper, seeded and sliced into thin rounds Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

The best ducks are Moscovy ducks, available from specialty butchers, but any duck will work.) 1 teaspoon salt 3 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper 4 shallots, minced 1/4 cup creme de Cassis 1/2 cup black currant jam (unsweetened if possible), or black cherry, boysenberry, or similar preserve 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place the duck skin side up. Using a sharp knife, score 4 (1/4-inch-deep) cuts across the skin at a 45 degree angle. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper over the meat side of each duck breast. Heat a well-seasoned skillet or nonstick pan over high heat. When pan is hot, add duck breasts, skin side down, and cook for 5 minutes, or until skin is brown and crispy. Flip and cook for 2 more minutes. If you are unfamiliar with duck breasts, don&#39;t be put off by their unusual look. The fat-to-meat proportions reverse themselves when cooked, as much of the fat is rendered and the meat expands. Remove pan from heat (save the drippings) and transfer duck breasts, skin side up, to a cooking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Bake on the top rack of the oven for 6 minutes. Carefully discard all but 2 tablespoons of duck drippings from the pan. Return pan to medium heat and add shallot. Stir occasionally for 3 minutes, or until shallot begins to turn golden. Add Cassis to the pan and stir with a wooden spoon to loosen up the browned bits left by the duck. Add jam, vinegar, and remaining teaspoon of black pepper, and stir occasionally for 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Remove duck from the oven and slice each breast at a 45 degree angle into 1/4-inch-thick strips (properly cooked duck should resemble medium-rare steak). Arrange in a fanlike pattern on a warmed plates and spoon Cassis compote overtop. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45098,&quot;Limoncello Dessert 1 pint lemon sorbet 1 pint vanilla ice cream 4 jiggers limoncello, Italian lemon liqueur available at any large liqueur store, any lemon liqueur may be substituted 1 lemon, zested Wafer cookies, for garnish Instructions: Place 1 scoop of lemon sorbet along side 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream in each dessert cup.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the duck broth, rice, scallions, and red bell pepper. Season with the salt and pepper. Lay a banana leaf shiny side down, and place about 1 cup of the rice mixture in the center of the leaf. Fold the ends over the rice to form a sealed packed. Continue making the tamales. Using a wok or a double boiler, steam the tamales until the rice is very hot, about 10 to 15 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine the corn, red onion, papaya, tomatoes, cilantro, lime juice, fish sauce, cumin, salt and pepper. Allow the mixture to sit for about 1 hour for the lime juice to soften the papaya.

While the asparagus water is heating up start the beef tenderloin steaks. Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Season the steaks with some salt and pepper. Coat pan with a little extra-virgin olive oil and add the steaks. Meat will sear in hot pan. Cook beef 4 minutes on each side for medium. Once the beef is going, start the scallops; preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium- high heat with 2 turns of the pan of extra-virgin olive oil, about 2 tablespoons. With paper towels pat the scallops dry, season with a little salt and pepper and then add to the hot skillet. Sear the scallops in a single layer, causing them to caramelize, 2 minutes on each side. Once the steaks and scallops are going, add the asparagus tips to the boiling water for 3 minutes, or until just tender. Remove the beef fillets from the skillet to a serving platter.

Bring the pot to a medium-high heat and cook the pancetta for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onions, season generously with salt and stir to coat with olive oil. Cook the onions for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently. The onions should become very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Pulse to combine the tomatoes in a food processor. Add the tomatoes to the pot and rinse out 1 of the empty tomato cans with water and add that water to the pot (about 2 to 3 cups). Season generously with salt and TASTE IT!!!! Tomatoes take a lot of salt. Season in baby steps and taste every step of the way. Cook the sauce for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally and tasting frequently. Use the sauce right away on pasta or for any other tomato sauce need. This sauce can also be cooled and stored in the refrigerator for a few days and freezes really well. For the meatballs: Coat a large saute pan with olive oil, add the onions and bring to a medium-high heat. Season the onions generously with salt and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. The onions should be very soft and aromatic but have no color. Add the garlic and the crushed red pepper and saute for another 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat and allow to cool. In a large bowl combine the meats, eggs, Parmigiano, parsley and breadcrumbs. It works well to squish the mixture with your hands. Add the onion mixture and season generously with salt and squish some more. Add 1/2 cup water and do 1 final really good squish. The mixture should be quite wet. Test the seasoning of the mix by making a mini hamburger size patty and cooking it. The mixture should taste really good! If it doesn&#39;t it is probably missing salt. Add more. Add more anyway. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Shape the meat into desired size. Some people like &#39;em big and some people like &#39;em small. I prefer meatballs slightly larger than a golf ball. Place them on a cookie sheet and bake them for about 15 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked all the way through. If using right away, add them to your big pot of marinara sauce. If not using right away, they can be frozen for later use. Serve with pasta and sauce or just eat them straight out of the pot! Top with fresh ricotta cheese, garnish with chopped pickles and chives and serve with grilled garlic bread.

Bring to a simmer and cook until the meat is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Strain the meat and reserve the cooking liquid for a later use. In a food processor, process the meat to a medium-fine consistency and add the remaining 1 tablespoon garlic salt, the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, the kidney fat, garlic, onion and cumin. Mix well, cover and refrigerate until cool, at least 2 hours or up to overnight. For the cornmeal mixture: In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, chili seasoning, kidney fat, onion and garlic, and mix well. Add 1/2 cup of the reserved beef liquid and, using your hands, mix to incorporate all the ingredients. Continue to add more liquid until the mixture can be pressed into a ball in your hand and will hold its shape even when tossed around lightly, about 1/4 cup. Cover and place the cornmeal mixture in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. After the meat mixture and cornmeal mixture have cooled, run both mixtures through the food processor separately to achieve smooth and uniform textures to build the tamales. Dip the tamale wrappers in water or soak the cornhusks in hot water to soften. Lay the wrappers flat on the work surface. Scoop about 3 tablespoons of the chilled cornmeal mixture and form it into a boat about 4-inches long and 1 1/2-inches wide. Fill the center of the cornmeal boat with 2 teaspoons of the meat mixture and then pinch the cornmeal to cover and seal in the ends. Repeat for the remaining cornmeal and beef, making 18 to 25 tamales total. Roll the tamales in the wrappers, folding over one end and leaving the other end open.<br> Fold the open end over and tie three tamales into a bundle; repeat for the remaining tamales. Refrigerate the tamales for 2 hours before cooking. For the boil mixture: Add 8 cups water, the salt, cumin, cayenne and garlic powder to a pot and bring to a simmer. Place the tamales in a separate pot with the open ends facing up. The tamales should be tightly packed so they all stand upright. Pour the simmering boil mixture over the tamales.<br> Cover and cook for 3 hours over medium heat. Remove from the heat and set aside for 30 minutes. Add enough water to cover the tamales and cook for 1 more hour. Remove the tamales from the pot and unwrap.

Stir in the raisins. For each cookie, drop 1 generous tablespoon of batter onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing the mounds about 1 inch apart (or use a mini ice cream scoop). Using moistened fingertips, flatten each to a 2-inch-diameter round. Sprinkle each cookie with a bit more raw sugar. Bake the cookies until brown and a bit firm to the touch, 17 to 20 minutes. Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to a rack and cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]&quot; 45167,&quot;Cheese and Herb Popovers Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan One 16.5-ounce container (about 3 cups) multicolored cherry tomatoes, halved 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 2 teaspoons sugar<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 3 sprigs fresh thyme<br> 3 stems fresh rosemary<br> 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature<br> 2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan 1/2 cup chicken stock<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br> 1 cup cake flour<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat leaf parsley 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves<br> 2 scallions, chopped<br> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: For the blistered tomato dip: Spray a popover pan with nonstick spray and place in the oven. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Add the tomatoes, olive oil, sugar, salt, vinegar, pepper, thyme and rosemary to a large skillet. Toss the tomatoes to evenly coat. Cook over medium heat until the skins blister and the juices release, about 10 minutes. Let cool slightly, then remove and discard the herb sprigs and pulse in a blender 3 to 4 times to make a chunky dip (see Cook&#39;s Note). Set aside. For the popovers: Clean the blender and put in the eggs and milk. Blend until frothy, about 1 minute. Add the Parmesan, chicken stock and butter. Blend until incorporated and homogenous, 1 minute more. Add the flour, parsley, thyme, scallions, salt and pepper to the batter. Blend once again, just until incorporated. Divide the batter evenly among the 6 popover cups, filling each halfway. Bake the popovers, rotating the pan after 20 minutes, until golden brown and puffed above the edge of the pan, about 35 minutes.

Serve warm. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 45170,&quot;Baked Alaska Ali Babas 3 tablespoons chopped currants, dried or dark raisins 3 tablespoons chopped dried cherries or cranberries 3 tablespoons chopped dried apricots 3 tablespoons hot water 3 tablespoons dark rum 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 3 tablespoons warm water (105 to 115 degrees F) 1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 3 eggs, lightly beaten 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, cut into 6 pieces 3/4 cup water 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice 1/4 cup dark rum 2 1/2 cups vanilla bean ice cream 4 egg whites (about 1/2 cup) 3/4 cup sugar 4 teaspoons water 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Sliced fresh fruit or berries and dried cherries, for garnish Instructions: To make babas: Put the currants, cherries and apricots in a bowl with hot water and rum. Let them macerate while you prepare the dough. In a large bowl, or in the work bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, stirring to dissolve. Let stand for about 5 minutes. Add the flour, sugar, salt and eggs to the bowl. If using a machine, fit the bowl with the paddle attachment, and beat on a low speed. Otherwise, use a wooden spoon and beat for a minute, then turn it out onto a clean surface, and use a scrapper to gather the dough up, then slap it down, scraping and slapping to beat the soft and sticky dough. Beat the dough for about 5 minutes, stopping to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl if you are using a machine. Take another 5 minutes to gradually beat in the soft butter, 1 piece at a time, making sure each piece is absorbed before adding the next. The dough will be very soft, but smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl at least twice the volume of the dough. Cover and let it rise at room temperate until it doubles in size. This will take about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Brush small bucket-shaped \\baba\\ molds of standard-size muffin tins generously with melted butter or spray with cooking spray. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Deflate the dough with your fist. Drain the macerated dried fruit, reserving the liquid to add to the rum soaking syrup. Work the fruit into the dough until it is uniformly distributed. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Place 1 portion in each of the prepared molds or tins. Cover and let rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size. This will take about 30 to 35 minutes. Bake until the babas are light golden brown, approximately 30 to 35 minutes. Unmold and let cool. Babas can be kept frozen for up to 2 weeks. Thaw before soaking in syrup. To make the soaking syrup: Heat the water and sugar in a small saucepan until the sugar dissolves. Add the orange and lemon juices, rum and reserve macerating liquid. Keep warm. To make the meringued ice cream: Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper, or oil it lightly. Put the baking sheet in the freezer for a few minutes so that it is very cold. Scoop 8 portions of vanilla bean ice cream onto the prepared baking sheet, keeping the scoops at least 3 inches apart. Freeze until the ice cream is very firm. Whisk the egg whites, sugar, water and cream of tartar in a bowl. Place over a pan of gently boiling water; the bowl should not touch the water. Cook, whisking constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, until the mixture reaches 160 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the heat. With an electric mixer, whip until the meringue is cool and forms stiff peaks. Put the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip and pipe the meringue decoratively over the frozen ice cream scoops, covering them completely. (Or, cover the frozen ice cream scoops with the meringue, lifting the meringue with the back of a spoon to create decorative swirls.) Immediately return to the freezer. Make sure the ice cream is as firm as possible before browning the meringue. Brown the meringue with a propane torch by moving the flame back and forth about 4 inches away until the meringue is golden brown all over. You can also preheat a broiler and, watching carefully, broil until the meringue is golden brown, about 30 to 40 seconds. Immediately return to the freezer. To assemble and serve: Cut the rounded dome off the top of each baba. Discard the dome portion. Immerse the babas, a few at a time, in the rum soaking syrup for about 1 minute, turning them so they can absorb the syrup like a sponge. Strain the leftover soaking syrup. Set it aside. Place each baba, cut side up, on a plate. Place a meringued ice cream scoop on top of each and spoon some of the soaking syrup around. Garnish with sliced fresh fruit or berries and dried cherries, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45171,&quot;Duck Fat Roasted Potatoes 1 cup duck skin 2 cups water 1 pound fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise 3 cloves garlic, sliced Kosher salt 6 sprigs fresh thyme 3 sprigs fresh rosemary Serving suggestions: Serve with garlic aioli, chopped cracklins, and sea salt. Instructions: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat add the duck skin and water and cook until the water has evaporated, the fat has rendered out of the skin (the yield will range from about 1/2 cup to 1 cup depending on the size of the duck), and the skin is brown and crispy. Strain. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the duck fat, potatoes, garlic, pinch salt, thyme, and rosemary. Toss together to coat well. Cook 5 minutes on the stovetop and then place the skillet in the oven for 5 minutes, or until the potatoes are nicely browned and tender. Serve with a garlic aioli, and garnish with chopped cracklins and sea salt. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45172,&quot;Meringue Kisses 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 1/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1 11-ounce bag white chocolate chips 1 tablespoon coconut oil or shortening Red sanding sugar, for dipping Instructions: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 250 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in a large clean dry bowl with a mixer on medium speed until foamy. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until thick and opaque, about 1 more minute. Gradually add the confectioners&#39; sugar, about 1/4 cup at a time, and beat until stiff shiny peaks form, about 5 more minutes. Transfer the meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe about seventy 1-inch drops on the baking sheets, pulling the bag up to form a peak; leave space between each. Bake at 250 degrees F until dry and crisp, about 3 hours. Let cool completely on the baking sheets. Store in an airtight container in a dry place for up to 1 week. Combine the white chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted. Dip the bottoms of the meringues into the white chocolate, then dip in red sanding sugar; let set on parchment. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 45173,&quot;Grilled New Zealand Lamb Rack with Asian Ratatouille, Shoestring Potatoes, and Roasted Garlic Infused Jus 1 tablespoon black peppercorns 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup dark soy sauce 2 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2 tablespoon dried 1/4 cup finely chopped garlic 2 medium sized shallots, sliced 1/2 cup canola oil 4 lamb racks, about 1 pound each, chine bone removed Salt and black pepper, to taste Asian Ratatouille, recipe follows Citrus Fennel, recipe follows Fennel Oil, recipe follows Roasted Garlic Jus, recipe follows Shoestring Potatoes, recipe follows 1/2 cup tomatoes, seeds removed, cut into 1/4 dice Chopped chives, for sprinkling 2 medium sized Japanese eggplants, julienned, lengthwise 2 zucchini, julienned, lengthwise 2 yellow squash, julienned, lengthwise 4 tablespoons canola oil 2 1/2 teaspoons chopped garlic 2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger 1 large yellow onion, julienned 2 tomatoes, cut into 1/8 dice 4 sprigs thyme, chopped, leaves only 1/2 cup Thai basil, leaves only 1/2 cup basil, leaves only 3 tablespoons soy sauce Salt and pepper, to taste 1 fennel bulb thinly sliced 1 orange, juiced 1/2 lemon, juiced 1/2 lime, juiced 1/2 cup canola oil 1 tablespoons sliced shallots Salt and pepper 1/2 cup canola oil 2 tablespoons toasted and ground fennel seeds Pinch ground turmeric 6 cloves garlic, halved 5 cloves shallots, halved 1 cup red wine 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons black Chinese vinegar 3 cups chicken stock 2 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons canola oil Salt and pepper 4 baking potatoes, like russets Canola oil, for deep frying Salt Instructions: In a small dry skillet, heat the peppercorns over medium heat until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Quickly grind the peppercorns just until broken up. In a large bowl, add the ground peppercorns, mustard, soy sauce, thyme, garlic, shallots, and oil. Mix, add the racks, and turn to coat them. Marinate in the refrigerator, turning occasionally, at least eight hours or better, overnight. Prepare an outdoor grill, or preheat the broiler. Season the lamb with the salt and ground pepper and grill over high heat, or broil turning once, until brown and crispy, 12 to 15 minutes for medium-rare. Cut each cooked rack in half, and arrange so that the bones of the halves are interlaced. Alternatively, cut the racks into double chops. Place a mound of the Asian Ratatouille on a large platter and stand the racks or chops against it. Place a small amount of the Citrus Fennel next to the chops. Sauce with the Garlic Jus and drizzle everything with the Fennel Oil. Place the Shoestring Potatoes on top of the lamb and finish with the tomatoes and the chives. Place the eggplant, zucchini, and squash in 3 separate pans. Season with salt and let rest for 1 hour to allow the moisture to be released. Pat the vegetables dry. Prepare a saute pan coated with 1 tablespoon of oil over high heat. Add 1/2-teaspoon garlic, 1/2-teaspoon ginger, and the eggplant and saute until the eggplant is golden brown. Season with ground black pepper. Set aside. Repeat this process for both the zucchini and the squash. Then in a saute pan over medium high heat, cook the onion, remaining garlic, and ginger for 8 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and thyme and continue to cook for another 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Add the eggplant, zucchini, squash, Thai basil, basil, and soy sauce. Adjust the seasonings, being careful not to over salt, as the julienned vegetables received salt in the preliminary steps. In a mixing bowl, combine the fennel, orange juice, lemon juice, lime juice, canola oil, shallots. Season with salt and pepper. In a mixing bowl, combine the oil, and prepared fennel seeds and turmeric. Let stand 24 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare an ovenproof saute pan over high heat. Add the oil, shallots, and garlic. Place the pan in the oven and roast for 10 minutes, turning occasionally to prevent burning. Remove the pan from the oven and return to the medium heat on the stove-top. Deglaze the pan with the wine, the balsamic vinegar, and Chinese vinegar, and then, reduce. Add the chicken stock, thyme, and further reduce by 1/2. Season the reduced sauce and then strain to remove the garlic and shallots. Julienne the potatoes or using a sharp knife, cut them into thin strips. Fill a fryer or medium heavy pot 1/3 full with the oil and heat over high heat to 350 degrees F. Add the potatoes to the oil and fry until light brown, about 6 minutes. Drain on a paper towel and keep at room temperature. When ready, heat oil to 425 degrees F and re-fry the fries until golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. &quot;,&quot;[Shiraz, Pinot Noir, Grenache Blanc, Tempranillo]&quot; 45174,&quot;Sweet and Sour Cucumbers 1 3/4 cups white vinegar 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 clove garlic, crushed, plus 2 tablespoons, thinly sliced 2 serrano pepper, seeded, and sliced into half moons 2 English cucumbers, ends trimmed and thinly sliced on a mandoline 1 red onion, peeled and thinly sliced on a mandoline Instructions: In medium saucepan over high heat, combine the vinegar, salt, sugar, the crushed garlic clove and 1 serrano pepper.

Set aside to proof until you see bubbles on the surface, about 10 minutes. (If there is nothing at all, start again with fresher yeast.) Stir in the all-purpose flour, then cover with plastic and set aside in a warm place, at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cream together the butter and granulated sugar in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until light and fluffy, 8 to 10 minutes. Do not skimp on or rush the creaming time. Add the eggs with the mixer on low speed, one by one, followed by the vanilla and salt. If the mixture seems to separate, increase the speed slightly and keep going; it will come back together. Add the bread flour and mix on low speed until fully incorporated. Pour in the yeast mixture and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Put the dough in an oiled bowl and proof again in a warm place for about 1 1/2 hours. Lightly sprinkle a cool surface with an even layer of flour. Flour a baking sheet and set aside. Lightly flour a rolling pin and a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, being careful not to use too much. Turn out the dough onto the surface and use the rolling pin to first gently flatten the dough, then roll it out to 1/2- to 1-inch thick. Cut rounds of dough with the cookie cutter and turn them onto the floured baking sheet to rest in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes (see Cook&#39;s Note). (You cannot re-roll or use scraps unless you fry them \\as is,\\ so cut your doughnut rounds very close together to maximize yield.)<br> For the pastry cream: Put 2 cups of the heavy cream, 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar and the vanilla bean seeds and pod in a saucepan and whisk to combine. Bring to a boil over low heat. Meanwhile, combine the eggs and remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar in one bowl and the cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup heavy cream in a second bowl. Beat both with a whisk to a homogeneous mixture. Set aside.<br> When the cream comes to a boil, whisk half of the cream into the egg-sugar mixture and then IMMEDIATELY whisk it back into the pan with the hot cream. (This is called tempering and will allow you to combine boiling the cream and eggs without making scrambled eggs.)<br> Return the pan to medium heat and gradually whisk in the cornstarch-milk mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. (It is necessary to bring this mixture to a boil to cook the starch; otherwise the pastry cream will feel starchy and gritty.) Cook until thickened to the consistency of vanilla pudding (YUM!), 3 to 5 minutes. Strain into a bowl and chill with plastic wrap pressed against its surface (chilling can be done really quickly over an ice bath) until firmed up, about 2 hours.<br> Prepare the frying oil: Heat the oil in a medium heavy-bottomed pot fitted with a deep-frying thermometer until it reaches 350 degrees F. Fit a cooling rack into a sheet pan for landing the finished doughnuts.<br> Fry the doughnuts: When the oil reaches 350 degrees F, drop 2 to 3 doughnuts into the hot fat and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon or fish spatula and set on the cooling rack. Continue with remaining doughnuts and set aside to cool.<br> For the filling: Mix the peanut butter and heavy cream in a saucepan over medium heat and warm until smooth. Remove from the heat and mix into the pastry cream. Chill over an ice bath and refrigerate until ready to use.

Cut it into large pieces and using a food processor, process it into small pieces. In a saucepan, combine the ground cauliflower and milk and bring to a simmer, cooking until very soft. Strain the cauliflower through a sieve set over a bowl, reserving the milk. Puree the cauliflower in a blender, using only as much milk as needed to blend well. Pass through a fine sieve and season with salt and sherry vinegar, to taste. Let cool. To prepare the vegetables and shellfish: Separate the chard leaves from the stem. Cut the stems into batons and blanch them in boiling salted water until tender. Cut the leaves into a large chiffonade. Clean the wood ear mushrooms in a large bowl of water, swishing them vigorously to remove any grit. Dry on paper towels. Freeze the spiny tailed lobster just until the shell is frozen (not the meat). Use scissors to cut across the top of the shell to separate it from the meat. Carefully remove the meat, and remove the digestive track by pulling it out through the back of the lobster with a tweezer. Trim the scallops by removing the \\foot\\ and rinsing the scallops quickly in cold water. Dry on paper towels. To make the white soy dashi butter: Put the soy sauce with dashi in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and reduce until it&#39;s syrupy. Add the cream and continue to reduce by half. Slowly whisk in the butter pieces until the mixture is well emulsified. Season with lime juice, to taste. Hold the butter at 140 degrees F. To finish: Put the lobster, mushrooms, and chard leaves and stems in the warm soy dashi butter and cook them slowly just to warm through. Heat the clarified butter in a heavy skillet until almost smoking. Add the scallops, reduce the heat, and cook until golden brown. Turn and sear the other side. The total time in the pan should be about 4 minutes. Transfer the scallops to a plate and let rest. Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter in a nonstick pan over medium heat.

Place a chocolate chip flat-side down into each hole of the egg holder to form pupils. In a small mixing bowl, mix 1 packet of gelatin with 1/4 cup cold water, mixing until combined and free of lumps. Heat 1/2 cup water in the microwave for 1 minute, until hot. Pour the hot water into the cool gelatin mixture and whisk until the gelatin is dissolved completely. Stir in the blue food coloring. Using a pipette or eyedropper, drop 3 to 4 drops of blue gelatin around each chocolate chip to form the blue iris of each eye. Place the egg holder into the freezer for 30 minutes, until the blue is set. Meanwhile, mix the remaining packet of gelatin with 1/4 cup cold coconut milk in a small bowl. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and whisk until the mixture is free of lumps. Heat the remaining 1/2 cup coconut milk in the microwave for 1 minute, until hot. Pour the hot milk into the cool gelatin mixture and whisk until the gelatin is dissolved completely. Allow this mixture to cool for about 5 minutes, so that you do not melt the pupil and iris. Remove the egg holder from the freezer and carefully spoon about 2 teaspoons of the coconut mixture into each eye until the chocolate chip is covered. Return the egg holder to the freezer for 30 minutes more, until the gelatin is set. To remove the gummies, gently push each eyeball with a fingertip until loosened from the egg holder. Place the gummy eyeballs onto a serving platter. In a small mixing bowl, combine the vodka and red food coloring. Dip the tip of a tiny paintbrush into the mixture and carefully paint veins onto the eyeballs by drawing curved lines from the bottom of each gummy into the center of the iris.

Remove from heat, pour into a bowl and whisk in yeast. Set aside while preparing other ingredients. Place flour, sugar and salt in bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade; pulse to mix. Add the 4 tablespoons butter and pulse until butter is absorbed and mixture is powdery in appearance. Add eggs and milk mixture and continue to pulse until dough forms a ball. If the dough refuses to form a ball, add up to 3 tablespoons more flour, one tablespoon at a time, pulsing once or twice between each addition. To mix by hand, combine flour salt and sugar in a bowl and stir well to mix. Rub in butter by hand, being sure to leave mixture cool and powdery. Beat eggs until liquid and add to flour mixture along with yeast-milk mixture. Stir vigorously with a rubber spatula to form a dough. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rest 5 minutes. Scrape dough to floured surface and fold dough over on itself 6 or 8 times, sprinkling with up to 3 tablespoons more flour if dough is very soft. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 8 hours. After the dough has chilled, prepare butter: Place half the flour on work surface and place butter on it. Scatter remaining flour on butter and pound the butter with a rolling pin to soften it to a malleable consistency. Scrape butter together and form into a cylinder. Immediately remove dough from refrigerator and press in into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Distribute dabs of butter in a 6 by 9-inch rectangle at the closer end of the dough, covering dough as completely as possible. Fold the top (unbuttered) portion of dough down over the middle section and the bottom (buttered) portion up to cover it. Position the dough so the fold is on the left and roll the dough back to its original size, flouring the surface and dough as necessary. Fold both short ends in to the middle of the dough and fold again at the middle, making 4 layers. Reposition the dough so that the fold is on the left again and repeat rolling and folding. Double-wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate dough several hours or overnight before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45196,&quot;Sweet Potatoes Glazed with Molasses, Pecans and Bourbon 1 stick unsalted butter, quartered 3/4 cup molasses 1/2 cup light brown sugar Pinch cayenne pepper 1 cup bourbon Salt and freshly ground black pepper 8 large sweet potatoes, par cooked and cut into 2-inch dice 3/4 cup toasted chopped pecans Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Combine the butter, molasses, brown sugar and cayenne in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until smooth, about 5 minutes.

Line standard cupcake pans with 36 standard cupcake liners. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl. Set the bowl aside. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, cream the sugar and margarine with the whisk attachment, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. In a small bowl or cup, combine the water and egg replacer and stir to dissolve the egg replacer. Add the egg replacer to the sugar and mix until combined. Scrape the bottom of the bowl. Add the ginger juice and mix until combined. In a small bowl, combine the soy milk and vanilla and set aside. Turn the mixer speed to low and slowly add the dry ingredients and the soy milk, alternating between the 2, ending with the soy milk. Fold in the minced ginger by hand into the batter. Fill the cupcake liners 3/4 full with batter and bake until a toothpick inserted into each cupcake comes out clean, 19 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the filling: In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, stir together the puree and sugar. Heat on medium-high heat until the mixture begins to bubble around the edges. In a small bowl, mix the water or brandy and cornstarch into a slurry. Slowly add the cornstarch mixture to the puree while whisking. Cook for 2 more minutes while stirring. Let cool completely. Put the cooled peach filling into a piping bag and cut 1/2 inch off the tip. For the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer, whip the shortening and margarine until completely combined. Scrape the bottom of the bowl to ensure that all the ingredients are mixed thoroughly. Add the blueberry puree and vanilla and mix until incorporated. Scrape the bottom of the bowl. On low speed, slowly add the sugar a little at a time. Add the blueberry juice and mix to combine. Scrape the bottom of the bowl and mix on medium-high speed until all the ingredients are combined and the frosting is fluffy, about 2 minutes. Put the frosting into a pastry bag and cut 1/2 inch off the tip. To assemble: With a plastic drinking straw or a small paring knife, make holes in the center of each cupcake. Squeeze the peach filling into the center of each cupcake until filled but not overflowing, about 1 tablespoon per cupcake. Pipe a dollop of blueberry frosting onto each cupcake. Garnish with a few fresh blueberries, if using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 45229,&quot;Maple-Brined Grilled Chicken 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup 3 cloves garlic, smashed Small bunch fresh thyme sprigs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds bone-in chicken pieces, such as legs, thighs and breasts, halved Olive or vegetable oil for brushing the grill grates Serving suggestions: green salad, cornbread and/or your favorite barbecue sauce Instructions: Stir the maple syrup, garlic, thyme, 1 tablespoon salt, a generous grind of pepper and 3 cups of water together in a large bowl until the salt is dissolved. Add the chicken, making sure it&#39;s completely covered by the brine. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours. Prepare an outdoor grill or grill pan for high heat. Drain the chicken and pat very dry. Lightly oil the grill grates and grill the chicken, flipping occasionally, until no longer pink near the bone, 15 to 20 minutes (depending on the size of the chicken pieces).

Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water to cool, then transfer to a large bowl and add the celery. Meanwhile, whisk the mayonnaise, mustard, olive oil, buttermilk, Worcestershire sauce, paprika and chives in a large bowl. Brush 3 tablespoons of the dressing all over the steak. Toss 1/2 cup of the dressing with the potatoes and celery; set aside the remaining dressing. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt evenly in a large cast-iron skillet and heat over high heat until very hot, 5 minutes. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil (about 1/4 teaspoon) into the skillet. Add the steak; sear until well browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium high; flip the steak and sear until well browned on the other side, 4 to 5 more minutes for medium rare. Remove to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes, then thinly slice against the grain. Toss the watercress with the remaining dressing. Serve with the steak and potatoes. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 45232,&quot;Add Thyme for Whipped Potatoes 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 4 garlic cloves, peeled 4 sprigs fresh thyme 1/2 stick butter 3 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into equal-size chunks Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, add the half-and-half, garlic, thyme, and butter and heat until the butter is melted. Allow to sit over very low heat to infuse the flavors and keep hot. In a large pot, add the potatoes, cover with water and generously season with salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and then reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Immediately drain the potatoes and put them through a food mill over a serving bowl. If you don&#39;t have a food mill, you can hand mash or use a hand mixer, but be sure to not over-whip if using an electric hand mixer or the potatoes will get gummy. Pour the hot infused half-and-half mixture through a fine mesh sieve into the potatoes. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine and season with a little salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed. Eat and enjoy! TIPS: Serve the potatoes in a warm serving vessel to help keep them hot. Keep the butter wrapper to cover the top of the whipped potatoes, butter side down, to keep them moist if they are not being served immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45233,&quot;Chicken Flautas with Avocado Cream Vegetable or canola oil, for frying 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 small red onion, diced 1 jalapeno, diced 1 garlic clove, minced 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 rotisserie chicken, skin removed and meat finely shredded 1 cup salsa 1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro leaves 1 cup shredded Cheddar/Monterey jack blend 1 lime, juiced Salt 16 (5 to 6-inch) flour tortillas 2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce, for serving 1 very ripe avocado, halved, pitted and flesh removed 1 (4-ounce) container sour cream 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice Salt Instructions: Fill a large pot with enough oil to reach 2 inches up the side of the pan.

Place your wire rack in the tin, so it sits about halfway down, or bend some chicken wire to fit. Carefully pierce the lid of the tin 5 or 6 times with a screwdriver. Most salmon fillets come around the same size and thickness, so their cooking times are similar. Sprinkle the salmon fillets with salt and rub with a drizzle of olive oil. Then lay them skin side down on top of the wire (this acts like a grill rack) and put the lid on the tin. Place it on the burner, over a medium heat, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. After a couple of minutes it will start to smoke a bit. While the fish is cooking, mix all the salsa ingredients together - you can go as light or as heavy on the chiles as you like. When the fish is ready, turn the heat off and leave it to sit for 3 minutes before opening the tin. This will allow any residual smoke and heat to penetrate the fish. Lift the salmon fillets out and place onto individual serving plates. Spoon over some chille salsa and sprinkle with your whole cilantro leaves. Drizzle over some extra-virgin olive oil and serve with the lime halves and the rest of the salsa in a little bowl.

Letting the cheese sit out in the air will allow the cheese to form a crust and make it easier to grill. Preheat the grill to medium-high direct heat, leaving some space for indirect cooking. Grill the chorizo, turning occasionally, until nicely charred and hot inside, about15 minutes. Chop roughly and set aside. Heat a griddle over the direct heat. Lightly brush the top of the cheese with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Place on the griddle, seasoned-side down, and cook until the cheese is dark golden brown and crusty, about 5 minutes. Brush the top lightly with oil, season again, carefully flip over and move the griddle to the indirect heat. Continue cooking until the bottom begins to turn light brown and the cheese is melty, covering if need be. Remove to a plate and sprinkle with the oregano and red pepper flakes. Brush the bread on each side with some olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill over direct heat for about 1 minute per side-the bread should be crisp and a bit charred outside, but chewy inside. Heat a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and melt. Crack the eggs into the skillet, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with another pan. Cook until the whites are set and the yolks still runny, about 3 minutes. While the eggs cook, whisk together the vinegar and mustard in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil until emulsified. Taste and whisk in the honey if desired. Put the rocket, tomatoes and onions in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle some vinaigrette around the sides of the bowl and gently toss to coat. To serve: Smear some cheese on the toasted bread. Top with an egg, chopped chorizo, a drizzle of olive oil and parsley leaves. Serve each crostini with some rocket salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 45251,&quot;Easy Tzatziki 1 hothouse cucumber, unpeeled and seeded 2 (7-ounce) containers Greek yogurt, such as Fage Total 1/4 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic (2 cloves) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Grate the cucumber by hand on a box grater, as you would grate carrots.

Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, covered, until soft throughout, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove from the heat. Fry the bacon in a medium skillet over low heat until golden. Spoon off excess fat. Add the onion and saute until lightly golden. Add the beans with their liquid, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook for 2 minutes longer. The mixture should remain thin and soupy. Keep warm. This may be prepared a day or 2 in advance and refrigerated. Reheat before serving. To flatten the steaks, coat four 15 x 12-inch sheets of plastic or parchment paper with 1/2 teaspoon of the oil each. Sandwich each tenderloin, with the grain running vertically, between two sheets (with the oiled side facing the meat). Flatten each one with the flat side of a heavy cleaver or mallet, using steady even sweeping strokes from the center out as you would roll pie dough, until the steak is a thin oval of about 14 x 10 inches. It will take about 5 minutes per steak. Preheat a lightly oiled very large nonstick skillet or cast iron pan. Peel the paper off the steaks and season all over with salt and pepper. Sear, one at a time, in the hot pan 30 to 40 seconds per side. Coat each of two large serving plates (platters would be great) with the warm bean mixture. Top each with a hot steak. Prepare the garnish by melting the butter in a small hot skillet over medium-high heat. Saute the scallions and jalapenos with salt and pepper to taste and the lime juice for 1 minute. Sprinkle over the steaks.

Turn the pan on low and allow the butter to gently melt without browning. Once it is melted, tilt and swirl the pan to coat the bottom and the sides (this will help you slide the eggs out later). Ok, pay close attention: We are going to Frankenyolk these eggs. That means you&#39;ll make one egg have two yolks. (If you get lucky and get a double-yolk jumbo egg, go buy a lottery ticket.) Crack one egg into the pan. Then separate the second egg over a bowl, leaving just the yolk in one side of the shell and the whites in the bowl. Take the yolk in the shell and, using the edge of the shell, gently break the thick clear albumen (egg white) of the egg already in the pan and pour the separated yolk right next to the other yolk. Keep the yolks next to each other so they cook at the same time. Repeat this process with the rest of the eggs so you have 4 eggs with 2 yolks each. What to do with the whites? Make an egg white omelet the next day if you feel guilty. If not, how about a meringue pie for dessert tonight? Haaaiii!! Cook the eggs on medium-low heat until the whites are cooked through and the yolks are still runny. This takes a good 8 to 10 minutes, so be patient and work on the other steps. Brown edges on a fried egg are just wrong in my book. If the eggs finish before the other steps, just remove the pan(s) from the heat. Cook the refried beans: In a medium pot, add the oil and chorizo and cook on medium heat, using a wavy potato masher or wooden spoon to break the chorizo into bits to create crumbles like ground beef. Once the orange fat is rendered, add the onions, a tiny pinch of salt and cumin and the garlic and cook, stirring them into the chorizo. When the onions are tender and stained with the fat of the chorizo, add the refried beans and chopped pickled jalapenos. Cook until the beans are softened and loose. If they dry up a bit, add a splash of water or, if you are feeling slightly dangerous, add a bit of the pickling juice from the jalapenos. Keep warm. Char the tortillas: In a large dry pan (cast-iron, please) or griddle over high heat, add the stack of tortillas. Cook and flip in a way that once the bottom tortilla is charred, it moves to the top of the stack, flipped. Continue to flip and alternate sides until each tortilla has had a date with the bottom of the pan. Time to build your plate! Build your plate: Place equal amount of the refried beans on each plate. Slightly level them out with the back of your spoon. Sprinkle each with an equal amount of cheese and then slide a double-yolk sunny-side up egg on top. Sprinkle some pico de gallo around the edges so you don&#39;t mess with the yolks. Season each yolk with salt and a crack of black pepper. Sprinkle the entire plate with cilantro and spritz with lime juice and a shake of hot sauce. Serve each plate with 2 folded charred tortillas. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 45263,&quot;Nicely Spicy BBQ Sauce 2 qts tomato puree 2 c. chopped onion 3 cloves garlic 1 Tbsp hot pepper flakes 1 ancho cl, stemmed and seeded and cut into 1/2-inch strips 1 ancho cl, stemmed and seeded and cut into 1/2-inch strips<br> 2 to 3 dry chipotle chiles, stemmed and seeded and cut into 1/2-inch strips 1 tsp. celery seeds 3 Tbsp salt 10 whole peppercorns 1/4 c. bourbon 1 1/4 c. brown sugar, lightly packed 1 1/3 c. apple cider vinegar 1 tsp dry ginger 1 Tbsp dry mustard 1/2 c. maple syrup Instructions: Infuse the sauce: Combine the tomato puree, onion, garlic, hot pepper flake, ancho, chipotle, celery seeds and salt in a large, nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until all the vegetables and dry chiles are soft, about 30 minutes.<br> Prepare the jars and lids: Wash all jars and lids thoroughly with soap and water and rinse well. Fill your canner with enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch and bring to a simmer. Using a pair of canning tongs, lower the jars in gently, tilting them to fill with the hot water. In a small saucepan, keep some water warm but not boiling; place the lids in the water. Have an additional kettle of water on to boil.<br> Strain the sauce: Ladle the sauce into a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl or other container, pressing with the back of the ladle to extract as much sauce while leaving solids behind. Alternatively, use a food mill for the same effect. Once strained, return the sauce to the saucepan.<br> Finish the sauce: Place the peppercorns in a tea infuser or cheesecloth sachet, and add to the sauce. Add the bourbon, brown sugar, vinegar, ginger, mustard and maple syrup. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently to prevent sticking or scorching, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Remove the sachet of peppercorns, and remove sauce from heat.<br> Fill and close the jars: Using canning tongs, remove the jars from the canner, carefully pouring the water back into the canner. Set next to the sauce in the saucepan. Turn the heat under the canner to high. Use a ladle to pour the sauce into the jars through a canning funnel, leaving 1/2-inch headspace at the top. Run a clean chopstick around the inside of the jar to dislodge any trapped air. Wipe the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel. Place the lids on, and screw on the rings until just finger-tight.<br> Seal the jars: Using canning tongs, gently transfer the jars to the canner, taking care to keep them vertical. When all the jars are in the canner, there should be at least 1 inch of water covering them; if you need more, add water from the kettle until the jars are sufficiently covered. Bring the water to a full rolling boil, and process for 10 minutes.<br> Remove and cool: Using canning tongs, gently remove the jars from the canner and transfer them to a kitchen towel or cooling rack, again keeping them vertical. Do not set hot jars directly on to cool counter surfaces. Leave to cool, undisturbed, for at least 12 hours. If any of the jars do not seal when cool, reprocess using the method above, or refrigerate and use immediately.<br> Label and store: Add a label to the lid or side of your jar, noting the date it was canned. Remove the rings and store jars in a cool, dark place for up to one year.

Reserve the remaining marinade separately to use as a sauce for the noodles. For the noodles: Fill a large pasta pot with a perforated insert with heavily salted water and bring to a boil. (Alternatively, use a large pot with a small heatproof colander lowered into it.) Prepare an ice bath in a medium bowl and season with a pinch of salt; set aside. Add the broccoli florets to the boiling water and cook until bright green, 1 to 2 minutes. Lift the insert and drain away excess water. Transfer the broccoli to the ice bath. Return the insert to the pot with the boiling water. Drain the broccoli and transfer to a small sheet pan or plate lined with paper towels. Cook the noodles in boiling water until tender, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the insert, draining the excess water, and pour the noodles into a large bowl. Dress the noodles with the reserved marinade. Add the carrots, broccoli and edamame and toss to combine. For the cucumber salad: Mix together the fish sauce, vinegar, maple syrup, cl-garlic sauce and garlic in a small bowl. Toss with the cucumbers and set aside. Toast the black and white sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat until slightly fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove the seeds to a bowl. Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel. Increase the heat to medium-high and lightly coat with about 1 tablespoon canola oil. When the oil glistens, remove the pan from the heat and set the tuna steaks in the oil; you should hear a sizzle. (Reserve the tuna marinade.) Return the pan to the heat and sear the tuna for about 30 seconds on each side. Turn off the burner and pour in about half the reserved tuna marinade, turning the steaks to coat. Return the pan to medium heat, bring the marinade to a simmer and cook for about 1 minute. Remove the steaks from the heat and let rest for a few minutes before slicing across the grain. Return the pan to low heat to keep the sauce warm Add the soba noodle salad, cucumbers and sliced tuna to the bento box sections. Garnish the tuna and cucumbers with the toasted sesame seeds and the soba noodle salad with the scallion greens. Serve with the warm sauce.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 45292,&quot;Beer Can Roasted Herb Chicken 4 tablespoons Irvine Spices Roasted Garlic Pepper Seasoning 3 teaspoons kosher salt 4 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves 4 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 4 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 4 (1 1/2-pound) frying chickens 4 cans beer, your choice, exterior of can rinsed Instructions: In a large mixing bowl, combine the garlic pepper seasoning, salt, rosemary, thyme and parsley. Rub inside cavity of chicken with mixture and heat grill. Open each can of beer, pour out (or drink) about 1/4 of the contents and place a chicken on end over the open can of beer with the tips of the legs pointing down.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Place the flour in a medium bowl and dredge the chicken in the mixture. Tap off any excess. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven until almost smoking and saute the chicken in 2 batches until golden brown on both sides. Remove the chicken to a baking sheet and finish cooking in the oven, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of oil in the pan. Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and cook until soft. Increase the heat to high, add the wine and reduce until almost dry. Add the chicken stock and continue cooking to a sauce consistency. Whisk in the butter, tarragon and peas and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the chicken from the oven and serve with the sauce. Mushroom Duxelle: Heat olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat until almost smoking, add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown and dry. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until soft. Add the wine and cook until reduced. Add the thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste. Potatoes: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Pour 2 tablespoons of the clarified butter into an iron skillet and heat over high heat. Arrange potatoes slices in the pan in concentric circles, overlapping the slices, drizzle each layer with butter, season with salt and pepper and spread some of the mushroom duxelle over the entire surface. Repeat to make 4 to 5 layers. Heat the pan on top of the stove until the butter bubbles. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the potatoes are golden brown and soft, 20 to 25 minutes. Press the potatoes with a pot lid during the baking once or twice to keep them flat. Remove from the oven and pour out excess butter. Let sit 10 minutes before inverting onto a round platter. &quot;,&quot;[Albarino, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45296,&quot;Italian Ice Pops 1 (12-ounce) bag or 1 1/2 cups frozen raspberries, defrosted 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon) 3 or 4 tablespoons simple syrup, recipe follows 14 wooden ice pop sticks 1/4 cup water 1/2 cup sugar Instructions: In a blender, combine the raspberries and the mint. Puree until combined. Add the lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of the simple syrup. Blend to combine. Taste the mixture and add the remaining 1 tablespoon simple syrup if you like. Spoon the mixture into an ice cube tray and freeze for approximately 30 minutes, or until partially frozen. Insert the wooden sticks and return trays to the freezer for another 3 to 5 hours. In a saucepan, combine water and sugar over medium heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved. Take pan off heat and cool the syrup. Any extra cooled syrup can be saved in an airtight container. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Cava]&quot; 45297,&quot;Guacamole Dip 6 ripe avocados 3 limes, juiced 1 medium yellow onion, chopped 1 garlic clove, smashed then minced 2 serrano chiles, cut into rounds 1 big handful fresh cilantro with stems, about 1/2 cup, finely chopped Extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Halve and pit the avocados. With a tablespoon, scoop out the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash the avocados using either a fork or potato masher, leaving them still a bit chunky. Add the remaining ingredients, and fold everything together. Drizzle with a little olive oil, adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and give it 1 final mix with a fork. Lay a piece of plastic wrap tight on the surface of the guacamole so it doesn&#39;t brown and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]&quot; 45298,&quot;Grilled Crayfish (or Spiny Lobster) with Dressings Crayfish or spiny lobster Dressings, recipes follow, optional 1 large ripe tomato 1 small finger fresh root ginger, peeled 1 large lemon, juiced 1/2 cup virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) butter 1 smallish red onion, peeled and finely diced 1/2 red cl, medium heat, diced 1 lime, juiced 1 large handful cilantro (fresh coriander), roughly chopped 1/2 teaspoon sea salt Instructions: Regardless on the size of your crayfish, they are best cooked whole. This way the carapace acts like an oven itself, whereby the shell heats up and bakes the flesh inside. However, if you are cooking a fairly large crayfish it&#39;s advisable to split it down the back with a sharp heavy knife. This will help it to cook quicker and make it more manageable to serve once it&#39;s cooked. I love cooking it on a barbecue, but it can be cooked just as well at home under a domestic grill, if split in half. Cooking times will vary, but a whole crayfish of around 1 to 1 3/4 pounds will take about 15 to 20 minutes above a hot barbecue, turning it around to cook through evenly. If the crayfish is halved, it will take between 10 to 15 minutes. A large crayfish, around 2 pounds, will take 25 to 35 minutes and if split, about 15 minutes. Serve grilled crayfish very simply with a little olive oil and lemon juice, or melted butter. However, the following dressings add a little oomph to this delicious meat. Place all of the above in a blender and puree to a thick dressing. Taste for seasoning, then let rest for at least 30 minutes before serving. Heat the butter in a small pan, when it?s bubbling add the onion and cl and cook over a moderate heat until the onion just begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Take it off the heat, stir in the juice, cilantro, and salt. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 45299,&quot;Chicken Paella 1/4 cup olive oil 1 tablespoon dark chili powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander<br> 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup diced yellow onion 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper 1/4 cup diced celery 2 sprigs fresh marjoram<br> 1 sprig fresh thyme<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 2 tablespoons minced garlic<br> 3/4 cup tomato puree<br> 2 cups long-grain rice<br> 4 cups chicken stock<br> 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped<br> 1 lemon<br> 2 ripe Hass avocados, sliced, for garnish 1 cup chopped Castelvetrano olives, for garnish Instructions: For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat a large enameled cast-iron pot over medium-high heat, and add the oil. Mix the chili powder, cumin and coriander together in a bowl. Sprinkle the chicken liberally with salt and pepper and the spice mixture. Add the chicken to the pot, skin-side down, and sear until the skin is golden brown; flip, and sear for another 3 minutes. Remove the chicken thighs to a small baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Bake until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Remove and let rest. For the rice: Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in the pot that was used for the chicken. Add the onions, peppers, celery, marjoram and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until the onions become translucent, then add the garlic; cook for another 3 minutes. Add tomato puree and cook for 2 minutes. Add the rice and saute for 2 minutes. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil and then reduce to a low simmer. Place in the oven and cook for 20 minutes, or until rice is cooked. Let the rice sit for at least 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork. Add the cilantro, and season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice.

Cut the green beans in half if you like the pieces to be a little smaller. Blanch the green beans: drop them into lightly salted boiling water and allow the green beans to cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove them from the boiling water with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge into a bowl of ice cold water to stop the cooking process. Drain the beans once they&#39;re cool and set aside. Add the bacon pieces to a skillet over medium heat. Cook the bacon for 2 minutes, and then add the peppers, garlic and onions, and continue cooking until the bacon is done (but not crisp) and the onions are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Sprinkle the flour into the pan and whisk immediately to evenly mix it into the butter. Cook for a minute or 2, and then pour in the milk and half-and-half. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, while the sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, some black pepper and the cayenne, and then add the grated cheese. Stir while the cheese melts. Turn off the heat. Add the bacon/onion mixture and stir to combine. Add the green beans and stir gently to combine. Pour into a baking dish and top with the panko.

Butter two 8-inch-round cake pans and dust with cocoa powder, tapping out the excess. Combine the butter, milk and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Transfer to a large bowl, add the cocoa powder and granulated sugar and whisk until smooth. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Whisk the eggs and vanilla into the cocoa mixture, then stir in the flour mixture in two additions until just combined (it&#39;s OK if there are a few small lumps). Divide the batter between the prepared pans; tap the pans against the counter to remove any air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 35 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then run a knife around the edges and invert onto a rack to cool completely. Make the frosting: Put the white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth; let cool. Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the melted white chocolate until combined. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar until smooth and fluffy; beat in the vanilla. (If the frosting is too soft to spread, chill about 15 minutes.) Place one cake layer on a platter and spread with one-third of the frosting. Top with the second cake layer; cover the whole cake with the remaining frosting. Top with shaved white and dark chocolate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45338,&quot;Anise Spiced Mulled Wine One 750-milliliter bottle Cabernet Sauvignon 2 cups apple cider<br> 1/4 cup brandy<br> 1/4 cup agave syrup 2 pods star anise<br> 2 cinnamon sticks<br> 2 oranges<br> 1 lemon<br> Instructions: Combine the wine, cider, brandy, agave, anise and cinnamon in a saucepan.

In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, cinnamon, baking powder and salt to combine. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well to fully incorporate and scraping the bowl well after each addition. Add the vanilla and mix to combine. Add the dry ingredients in 2 to 3 additions, mixing to incorporate and gently scraping the bowl before continuing.<br> Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap. Working with a few pieces at a time, divide the dough into heaping tablespoon pieces, rolling each into a ball. Then roll each dough ball into a strand about 7 inches long. Starting at one end, form each dough strand into a spiral; it should look like a cinnamon roll when seen from above.<br> For the cinnamon-sugar coating: In a small bowl, stir together the granulated sugar and cinnamon to combine. Gently press the top of each dough spiral into the sugar mixture, giving it a slight all-over coating, then transfer to the prepared baking sheets. Leave at least 1/2 inch between each spiral and stagger the rows. Bake until the cookies are browned and crisp, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely. For the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, cream and milk; the glaze should be thin enough to easily flow off a spoon.<br> Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons of glaze in the center of each cookie, using the back of your spoon to spread it slightly and allowing it to drip down the sides naturally (see Cook&#39;s Note). Let set for 30 minutes at room temperature for the glaze to firm up. The cookies can then be stored in an airtight container in a single layer for up to 1 week.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45340,&quot;Chocolate Stacks 4 boxes of Nabisco Famous Wafers 2 pints of heavy whipping cream 1 cup of sugar 3 jiggers of Canadian whiskey (use a blended whiskey for better results) 2 teaspoons of real vanilla extract 1 jar of maraschino Cherries 1 can of Hershey&#39;s chocolate syrup (refrigerated) 1 pound of slivered almonds 1 bottle of Betty Crocker&#39;s Decor Nonpariel&#39;s Instructions: In a cold metal bowl, beat the whipping cream to the soft peak stage and add the sugar and vanilla extract slowly. As the whipping cream comes up to the hard peak stage, add the whiskey slowly. (Sample to insure taste.) In a food processor, grind 3/4 of the slivered almonds into a fine powder. Place in a bowl and set aside. (Reserve 1/4 as decoration during final assembly.) Assembly: Begin by placing one wafer on your tray. Paint the top of it with a thin layer of Hershey&#39;s sauce. Next add a teaspoon of the ground almonds and spread it evenly. Then add a teaspoon of the whipping cream mixture. Repeat this until you have 6 layers and top it with a dollop of whipping cream. Add a cherry to the top of each stack and a few whole slivered almonds. Then garnish lightly with the Decor Nonpariels. Cover the completed pan of stacks with a sheet of Glad wrap and put them into the refrigerator overnight. Note: The whipping cream will soften the wafers. You will need to serve and eat these stacks within the next two or three days. After that the cream starts to harden and they don&#39;t taste a good. ENJOY! This recipe will yield two trays of 24 stacks. Two per person will serve 12. You will need two aluminum roasting pans to hold the completed dessert. &quot;,&quot;[Port, Tawny Port, Moscato, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 45341,&quot;Almond Citrus Cupcake Nonstick cooking spray, for spraying liners 2 cups cake flour<br> 1 2/3 cups granulated sugar<br> 1 cup almond meal<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 3/4 teaspoon salt<br> 6 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 4 egg whites<br> 1 egg<br> 1 cup whole milk<br> 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1 teaspoon almond extract<br> Zest of 1 lemon<br> 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 4 ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> 1 pound confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 2 tablespoons orange zest (from about 1 large orange)<br> 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Pinch salt<br> Instructions: For the cupcake batter: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

Grease two 8-inch round (or square if you have) baking dishes with clarified butter. Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan set over medium heat. Add the onions and sweat until they are almost translucent and fully tender, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the kale in stages, reserving about a quarter of the kale for the salad, and increase the heat to medium-high. Continue to cook the kale, turning with tongs, until all is fully wilted. Season the kale mixture with salt and pepper. Add the red cl flakes and fold into the mixture, allowing the cl flakes to bloom, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the water from the feta and stir to combine. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour the mixture into the bowl of a food processor. Process to help disperse the heat and steam, then let cool slightly. Add the feta and process until just combined. Put the kale mixture into a bowl and add the lemon zest and juice, parsley and oregano. Stir again until the mixture is fully incorporated. Allow the mixture to cool for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to release any trapped steam. Taste the mixture and adjust seasonings if necessary. Add the beaten eggs and mix again. For the assembly: Remove two sheets of phyllo dough from the package to a large (at least 30 inches long by 20 inches wide) working surface so that they lay next to each other. Brush 1 inch of the right edge of the first sheet with melted butter and overlay the second sheet. Brush the melted butter over the entirety of both sheets. Add the filling 3 to 4 inches away from the closest edge, in an even layer, keeping it as uniform as possible, in a cylindrical line on the buttered phyllo sheets. Fold the bottom edge over the top of the filling, then butter the top surface with melted butter and repeat until you have a long log. Wind the log into a tight spiral and add to the prepared baking dish. Brush the top with more melted butter. Repeat with the remaining filling and phyllo, placing 2 logs in each baking dish. Bake until flaky and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. For the yogurt topping: Meanwhile, combine the Greek yogurt, dill, lemon, and salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Add to a squeeze bottle and keep refrigerated until ready to serve. Add the reserved kale to a large bowl and toss with the lemon juice and olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Remove the baking dishes from the oven. Squeeze the Greek yogurt mixture over the top of the spanoKALEpita. Garnish each baking dish with the kale salad. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 45362,&quot;Easter Bunny Cake 6 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 3 sticks (12 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br> Pinch fine salt<br> 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract<br> 2 to 3 tablespoons milk 2 baked 9-inch round cake layers (your favorite recipe or an 18.25-ounce boxed cake mix) 1 1/4 cups sweetened flaked coconut<br> 2 store-bought biscotti<br> 1 tube pink decorating icing<br> 2 black jelly beans<br> 2 marshmallows<br> 1 white jelly bean, halved lengthwise<br> 1 pink jelly bean<br> 1 black licorice wheel, such as Haribo Instructions: For the frosting: Combine the sugar, butter and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a hand-held electric mixer). Mix on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium high and mix until smooth. Adjust the consistency with milk until the frosting is easy to spread. For the bunny: Spread a thin layer of frosting (about 2/3 cup) on the flat side of one cake layer and top with the flat side of the second cake layer. Measure 5 inches across the top of the cake and cut down through the layers, creating 2 layered pieces that are slightly different sizes. Place the larger piece of cake cut-side down on a large platter or cake board. If using a rectangular cake board, place the larger piece so that the long edges are parallel with the long edges of the board. This is the body of the bunny. Cut the smaller piece of cake in half crosswise, so you have 2 layered wedges. Place one wedge in front of the body, with one flat side on the board and the other flat side against the body. The curved side will be on top. Take a serrated knife and round off the sharp edges on top of the head. Cut the tip off (the nose) at a 45-degree angle. Reserve all scraps in a bowl. Separate the layers of the remaining wedge of cake. These will be the back legs. Round the sharp edges of the cake wedges with your knife and add to the scrap bowl. Place one piece on each side of the bunny, with one flat side down and the other flat side facing forward (the round side towards the back of the bunny), about 1 inch from the end of the bunny&#39;s body. Mix the cake scraps in the bowl with a fork until mashed and then pack into a ball with your hands. Place the ball behind the bunny&#39;s body and adhere with a dab of frosting. This is the bunny&#39;s tail. Frost the entire bunny, tail and all, using 2 to 3 cups of the frosting, keeping some definition with the bunny parts and frosting more generously around any sharp edges to give a rounded look to the bunny parts. Sprinkle the bunny with the coconut to fully cover. Gently pat to adhere. Insert the biscotti between the head and body, pressing into the cake to secure them. These are the ears. Place the base of the ears close together at the center of the head and angle them out. Frost the front of each biscotti with some frosting. Then, using the pink decorating icing, frost a smaller strip in the center of each biscotti, going down to where the ears meet the head but not going all the way to the top. To make the face, press a black jelly bean into each side of the head for the eyes. Cut one of the marshmallows into 3 circles, discard the middle piece and press the 2 end circles, cut-sides in, into the front of the face for the bunny cheeks. Push the white jelly bean halves into the face below the cheeks, round-sides out, for the teeth. Place the pink jelly bean above for the nose. Unroll the licorice wheel and cut 2 pieces, each about 1 1/2 inches long. For each piece, peel the strips apart halfway down and then cut each separated strip in half lengthwise so you end up with a piece looking a bit like a broom. Repeat with the second piece of licorice. Tuck each piece, with a dab of frosting, behind a marshmallow cheek, with the cut ends facing out for the whiskers. Cut the second marshmallow in half lengthwise. Make 3 slits in each half, going about halfway through (these are the toes), and place in front of the legs for the bunny&#39;s feet. Adhere the bottom of the feet with frosting if necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 45363,&quot;Braised Red Cabbage 1/4 cup peanut oil 1 medium red onion, sliced 1 cup brown sugar 2 Granny Smith apples, sliced 1/2 cup red wine vinegar 2 cups red wine 2 cups orange juice 1 cinnamon stick 3 teaspoons ginger powder Salt and pepper 4 pounds red cabbage, cut into julienne A few gold leaves for decoration (optional ? available at specialty stores) Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

When the liquid comes to a slow drip, set the strainer into a bowl and set the bowl in the refrigerator to continue to slowly drip for 30 minutes. Make sure the bottom of the strainer does not touch the bowl. (The purpose of straining the cucumber is important to retain the thick consistency of tzatziki sauce. You can either discard the cucumber liquid or reserve it to make a refreshing cucumber water drink.)<br> Empty the yogurt into a medium bowl. Add the strained cucumber along with the garlic, dill, vinegar and oil into the bowl and gently mix with a whisk. When all the ingredients are equally distributed, your tzatziki sauce is ready. Season with salt and pepper, if using. (Sauce can be prepared a day in advance and refrigerated.)<br> For the bifteki: In a medium bowl, add the ground beef, red onion and mint leaves. With your hands, work in all the ingredients until everything is equally distributed. Then add the crumbled cheese and mix, being careful not to overwork the mixture. You want the cheese to stay relatively chunky. Form into a loaf and cut into 6 equal pieces, about 5 ounces each. Form each piece into an oval-shaped meatball and then pat down to form an oval shaped patty. (Patties can be prepared a day in advance and refrigerated.)<br> For the sandwich: Cook each patty on a hot charcoal grill or broiler for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until desired temperature is reached. (I like this patty cooked to medium, unlike my burgers that I prefer on the rare side.)<br> Lightly toast the baguettes on the grill, if desired. Remove from the heat and then spread 1 tablespoon of tzatziki sauce on the top half of each baguette piece. When the patties are ready, remove from the heat and cut on a bias into 3 equal parts. Spread the cut pieces over the bottom half of the toasted baguette. Top the patty with sliced tomatoes and sliced red onions. Sprinkle some salt and pepper and Spanish smoked paprika, if using. Press both sides of the baguette together and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 45370,&quot;Grilled Shrimp Skewers with Soy Sauce, Fresh Ginger and Toasted Sesame Seeds Wooden skewers (4-inch) 24 large shrimp 1/2 cup light soy sauce 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 1/4 cup peanut oil, plus extra for drizzling Salt and pepper 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds Instructions: Soak 4-inch wooden skewers in cold water for 1 hour.

Cook the potato slices for 5 minutes (do not cook longer) in heavily salted, boiling water. Meanwhile, slice the eggplant into 1/4-inch slices, brush with the olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoons salt and the pepper on both sides. Place on a baking sheet and cook in the oven, 6 to 7 minutes per side. Set aside the potato and eggplant slices for assembly. For the meat sauce: In a large saucepan, sweat the onions with some salt in the olive oil over medium heat. After 5 minutes, add the ground beef and cook until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes.

Carefully lower in 4 of the eggs and boil for 5 minutes (this is for a runny yolk; if you want it firmer, add a bit of time). While they&#39;re boiling, prepare a large ice bath. When 5 minutes is up, immediately place the eggs in the ice bath. In a large bowl, combine the chicken, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, black pepper, scallions and 1 teaspoon of the ginger. In 3 smaller bowls, set up your breading station. In the first bowl, combine the flour, 1/4 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste. In the second, whip up the remaining 2 eggs with a splash of water. In the third bowl, combine the panko, some black pepper and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon ginger. Working with wet hands, divide the chicken mixture in 4 parts. Place them on separate squares of parchment paper and flatten out into circles, about 1/2-inch thick. Peel the eggs, coat them in the flour mix and then wrap each in the chicken mix. It helps if you fold up the parchment paper to help the chicken onto the egg. Once the egg is fully encased in the meat, coat it in the flour mix, then the egg mix and then the panko mix. Place back on the parchment and hold in the freezer until the rest of the eggs are ready to go. Fill a large pot with 3 to 4 inches of oil and heat it to 350 degrees F.

Stir and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Gradually add 4 cups of the flour and the salt, and mix until the mixture comes together. Add 1 to 1 1/2 cups additional flour 1/2 cup at a time to make a stiff dough, either stirring with the wooden spoon or working with your hands. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and no longer sticky, about 5 minutes, adding just as much flour as needed. (Dough should be heavier and stiffer than regular yeast bread dough.) Grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until almost doubled, about 1 hour. Grease a baking sheet with the remaining teaspoon of oil. Remove the dough from the bowl and punch it down. Divide into 12 equal pieces, about 2 to 3 ounces each, measuring about 4 inches across. Form each piece of dough into a ball. Roll each ball into a 4 to 6-inch log. Join the ends and place fingers through the hole and roll the ends together. Repeat with the remaining dough. Place on the prepared baking sheet, cover with a clean cloth, and let rest until risen but not doubled in a draft-free spot, 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, about 25 minutes; remove. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, remove the skin and work the potatoes through a ricer set over a large bowl (should have about 2 cups). Set aside. Stir together the warm water, agave and yeast in a measuring cup or small bowl. Let sit until a small layer of foam develops at the top, 3 to 5 minutes. (If this doesn&#39;t happen, discard and try again with new yeast.) Add the potatoes, rice flour, tapioca starch and 3/4 teaspoon salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until the mixture is combined and forms a fine, crumbly meal. Continuing to mix on medium, add the egg white and oil, slowly drizzle in the yeast mixture and mix until the dough comes together (it will be slightly tacky). Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough increases by half, about 1 1/2 hours. Form the dough into two or four balls, for small or medium pizzas, then either cook them as desired or wrap them well and freeze for up to 1 month.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the sesame oil, black soy sauce, balsamic, sugar, salt, and cl Oil. Whisk to blend. Stir in half of the sliced scallions. Set aside in the refrigerator. When the water boils, season with salt until the water tastes like seawater. Plunge the pasta in the boiling water and cook, 3 to 5 minutes, until al dente. Place a colander in the sink. Remove the pot from the heat and pour off most of the water into the colander, catching any pasta as the water pours out. Remove the colander from the sink and fill the pot still containing the pasta with cold water. You want the pasta to cool quickly by being submerged in the cold water. This will assure a chewy texture. Drain the pasta thoroughly in the colander, shaking it a few times to remove excess water covering the pasta. Spread a kitchen towel on a flat surface and turn the noodles onto the towel. Gently use a second towel to dry the noodles. Removing the excess moisture assures that the sauce will have its proper flavoring effect on the noodles. Any water from cooking the pasta dilutes the noodles and makes them taste more like water than anything else. Gingerly transfer them the bowl with the sauce. Use your hands to mix the pasta and the sauce, taking care that all of the pasta gets coated. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until ready to serve. These noodles can marinate for a few hours or overnight before serving. Serve them cold, tossing them again in the sauce just before serving, and garnish with the remaining scallions. Remove the stems from the chiles then place in a food processor and blend until they are completely broken down. Use a rubber spatula and scrape into a medium sized saute pan. Add the oil and stir well. Set the pan over medium-low heat. Gently warm up the oil slowly so it draws out the color and flavor of the chiles. Stir well and season with salt. Once the oil is barely simmering, cook for 5 to 6 minutes. hut off heat and allow to cool.

Add the green apples and reduce the heat to low and cook until the apples soften, about 5 minutes. Add the gari, sugar, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. Once completely softened, it only takes a couple minutes, puree everything in a food processor. Set aside to cool. Once the mixture is cooled, add equal parts yogurt and puree again. The chutney can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. For the samosas: In a preheated saucepan over medium-high heat, add a little bit of vegetable oil and brown the chicken with the onions, garlic puree, cumin and chili flakes, about 15 minutes. The chicken will render liquid as will the onions. Once browned and fully cooked through, season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool. Then, add the Asiago and sage. Set aside. Cut the spring roll wrappers in half, creating two long, rectangle-shaped strips. Using a pastry brush, place egg wash on the top half of the strip. Add about 1 tablespoon of the chicken filling to the bottom half of the strip (the half that does not have the egg wash). Starting at the bottom, fold the wrapper at a 45-degree angle, making triangles over and over as you work your way up, similar to folding spanakopita. Apply egg wash if needed to seal the edges once you are done folding the wrapper. Heat a deep pot with oil to 350 degrees F. Deep-fry the samosas until lightly browned and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Then drain on paper towels and season with salt and pepper while the samosas are still hot and wet.

Add the warm water and stir until the yeast dissolves. Set aside until the mixture foams and the yeast activates, about 10 minutes. Add the olive oil, salt and sugar and mix with a wooden spoon until combined. Wait a few minutes, then add the flour and mix until the dough becomes shaggy and you\\u2019re no longer able to mix.<br> Transfer the dough to a floured surface, reserving the bowl, and knead by hand until it feels soft and stretchy, about 5 to 7 minutes. (Make sure you knead the dough enough. A properly kneaded dough will allow you to later shape it into smaller balls without it breaking.) Form a tight ball.<br> Coat the reserved bowl with oil, then place the dough back in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or a towel and set aside at room temperature to rise for 60 minutes.<br> When the dough is almost ready, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br> For the assembly: Divide the dough into 8 to 12 equal pieces, depending on how large you\\u2019d like the manakeesh, and place on the baking sheet. Use your fingers to spread each piece into a round flat disc about 1 1/2 inches thick. Top each disc with an equal amount of the cheese.<br> Bake until the dough is lightly golden and puffs slightly, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Add the paste to a small bowl. Add the vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and lots of pepper. Mix well. Whisk in the olive oil gradually. Add the cheese and whisk again. Set the dressing aside for 1 hour or longer (if overnight, refrigerate the dressing and bring it to room temperature about 1 hour before serving). Makes about 1 cup. (You can put all of the ingredients into a jar, cover tightly with a lid and shake to blend. This is a great way to store the dressing.) To make the crackers: Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of the cheese into the pan so it forms a lace-thin layer that fills the bottom of the skillet. The cheese will bubble in the pan. When the top side of the cheese has reached a pale gold color, after 3 to 4 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and allow the cheese to firm up for 1 minute. Carefully turn the cheese over with a spatula, return to heat, and cook until cheese is golden on both sides, about 1 more minute. Remove the cracker and drain it on paper towels to absorb any excess fat. Wipe the skillet clean with paper towels and repeat the process 5 more times with the remaining cheese. In a large bowl combine the endive, radicchio, and arugula. Drizzle enough dressing over the top to lightly coat the leaves (you may not need all the dressing). Toss to coat the leaves evenly. Arrange the leaves on serving plates. Sprinkle a bit of Parmesan over each salad. Split each cracker into 2 or 3 pieces and garnish the salads with them. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 45473,&quot;Caramel Cinnamon Rolls 1 cup milk 1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast 1/4 cup vegetable shortening 1 cup granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 large eggs 7 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Vegetable oil, for brushing 2/3 cup packed light brown sugar 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1 stick unsalted butter 1 cup heavy cream 1 1/2 cups packed dark brown sugar 1 stick unsalted butter, melted 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Instructions: Warm the milk in a small saucepan until steaming. Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Combine the milk, shortening, granulated sugar, salt and eggs in a large bowl with a wooden spoon. Add the yeast mixture and mix until combined. Stir in the flour to form a soft dough. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, make the caramel: Combine the brown sugar, corn syrup and butter in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil; cook until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the heavy cream; whisk until combined and slightly cooled. Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet; spread the caramel on the baking sheet and let cool completely. Make the filling: Mix the brown sugar, melted butter and cinnamon in a bowl. Punch down the dough and roll out into a 12-by-24-inch rectangle on a floured surface. Spread the filling on the dough and roll up, starting at a long side. Cut into 1-inch pieces and arrange cut-side up on the caramel. Cover loosely and let sit at room temperature until puffed, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Uncover the rolls and bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. (Put a baking sheet on the lower oven rack to catch any drips.) Let cool slightly on the baking sheet, then invert onto a large cutting board or platter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 45474,&quot;The Turducken: Boneless Turkey Stuffed with a Boneless Duck and Boneless Chicken \\One Big Bird<br> 3 pounds coarsely ground pork 2 1/2 teaspoons liquid smoke 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped garlic 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme Pinch chili pepper flakes Pinch ground mace Pinch ground allspice Pinch ground bay leaf Pinch ground sage Pinch cayenne pepper, optional 3 teaspoons bacon fat 1/2 pound butter 4 pounds frozen chopped spinach, thaw and remove excess liquid or 3 pounds freshly chopped spinach 2 cups sauteed onion 1 teaspoon ground fennel seed 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon white pepper One 6-pound fresh whole duck One 4-pound fresh whole chicken 1 cup olive oil, divided About 5 tablespoons blackening spice, divided One 25-pound fresh whole turkey 2 tablespoons freshly chopped garlic 5 pounds favorite cornbread dressing<br> 3 whole roasted red bell peppers, cut into strips 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 quarts of your favorite turkey gravy Instructions: For the andouille sausage stuffing: In a large bowl, mix the pork, liquid smoke, garlic, salt, paprika, black pepper, chili pepper flakes, mace, allspice, ground bay leaves, sage and cayenne pepper, if using, with some cold water. In a pan or on a flat-top, brown off the sausage mixture in about 3 teaspoons of bacon fat for flavor. Once the sausage mixture is browned, chill immediately. For the spinach stuffing: Melt the butter in large skillet. Add the spinach, onion, fennel seed, salt and white pepper and saute for 5 minutes until hot. Set aside to cool. Preparation of the duck and chicken: It is wise to de-bone the duck and chicken first for practice. Place the fresh chicken breast-side down on large cutting board. Starting at the bird&#39;s neck, you will cut through the skin along the length of the spine. Using the tip of the knife and starting from the neck end, separate the meat from the rib cage on 1 side. Disjoint the wing from the shoulder blade and reserve for stock. Work towards the thigh bone, cut through the ball and socket joint and \\pop\\ loose using upward pressure with your hand from under the bird. Using your thumbnail, loosen the \\oyster meat\\ (the most tender part) from the frame. With the knife, remove the thigh and leg bone, but keep the leg attached to the bird. Repeat the process on other side of chicken. When both sides are finished, the bird will lay flat. Grab rib cage by the neck area and gently pull towards back to remove the entire carcass and breast bone cartilage. Repeat the same de-boning procedure for the duck. In a well ventilated area or with an exhaust fan on high, preheat a large cast-iron pan to very hot. Rub the boneless chicken and duck with olive oil. Generously sprinkle with blackening spice on both sides. Place skin-side down in the pan for 1 to 2 minutes then turn over and repeat. Refrigerate. De-bone the turkey using the same procedure as the chicken and duck with 2 exceptions: The turkey wings should be left attached to the meat and the bone-in drumstick should be disjointed from the boneless thigh meat and left attached to the meat. The final product should be a flat boneless turkey (except for the wings and drumsticks). To stuff the turducken: Place the turkey skin-side down on a flat surface. Rub the meat with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons chopped fresh garlic and 1 tablespoon blackening spice. Spread an even layer of cornbread dressing over the meat about 3/4 inch thick and pat down with hands. Spread 1/4-inch layer of spinach stuffing. Sprinkle with 2 cups of the andouille sausage stuffing. On top, place 6 to 8 slices of roasted red bell peppers. Place the chilled duck, skin-side down, on top of layered stuffing. Repeat the layered stuffing as above. Arrange the chilled chicken, skin-side down, on top of the stuffed duck. Spread the remainder of the stuffing on top of chicken. Press down gently with hands to compact all ingredients. To truss the turducken: This may take another person&#39;s help. Lift the sides of the turkey together. Have a helper hold the bird closed while sewing the back of the turkey together using butcher&#39;s twine, making the stitches about 1inch apart, starting at the back of turkey and working towards the neck. Be careful since the Turducken has no boney frame. Roll over breast-side up and finish sewing the neck portion of bird. Tie off and cut twine. Now sew up the opening at the leg section of turkey. Truss the legs together with twine. For extra support, tie butcher&#39;s twine around the bird&#39;s width every 3 inches down along the bird&#39;s length. Position your hands evenly under the turducken and lift into a large roasting pan with rack inside. The pan should be at least 3-inches deep to catch drippings during cooking. Rub the entire exposed skin of the bird with 2 tablespoons of olive oil then sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of blackening spice and salt. Add 1/2 cup water to the bottom of the roasting pan. Wrap the drumsticks with aluminum foil. Place parchment paper over the entire bird. Loosely tent the roasting pan with aluminum foil. Bake at 200 degrees F for 12 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Remove all foil and parchment paper the last hour of roasting time and turn up temperature to 325 degrees F. Baste with the drippings. When done, remove from the oven and let set in the roasting pan for at least 1 hour. With 2 heavy duty spatulas, insert underneath and remove the turducken from the rack to place on carving platter. Remove all butcher twine including pulling out the portion along the spine. To serve, cut the turducken in half lengthwise, then cut servings crosswise in approximately 1-inch thicknesses. Serve with gravy and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 45475,&quot;Octopus 1 lemon, halved, plus 1 lemon, halved 1 (3 pound) octopus, cleaned of beak and ink sac 3 tablespoons dried Greek oregano 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons Greek olive oil 1 teaspoon salt Instructions: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Tear off two 18-inch-long pieces of aluminum foil. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and toast the almonds, tossing occasionally, until lightly toasted. Remove the bottom leaves of the cauliflower, and trim the stem down to the base. Turn the cauliflower on its side. Starting near the stem end, cut the cauliflower crosswise to make two 1-inch-thick rounds. (If you start near the top, the cauliflower will crumble.) Cut each round in half so you have 4 semicircles. Save any trimmings for another use. Whisk together the harissa and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a small bowl. Place 2 cauliflower steaks on each piece of foil. Brush both sides of each steak with the harissa mixture, and sprinkle on a little salt. Wrap the steaks up to make foil packets as flat as possible, for maximum contact with the grill. Place the 2 foil packets on the hot grill, sealed-side down, and grill for 12 minutes. Flip the packets, and open them up with tongs to allow the steam to escape. Cook the cauliflower in the opened foil until tender and nicely browned on the bottom, 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Using an instant-read thermometer, adjust the temperature of the water so that the combined temperatures of the flour and the liquid give a base temperature of 130 degrees if using a Cuisinart or KitchenAid or 150 degrees if using a Braun. Beat 2 of the eggs and add them to the liquid. With the machine running, pour all but 2 tablespoons of the liquid through the feed tube. Process for 30 seconds. If the dough seems too dry and is not forming a smooth ball, add the reserved liquid and process for 15 seconds more, for a total of 45 seconds. Stop the machine, and take the temperature of the dough with an instant-read thermometer, which should read between 75 degrees and 80 degrees. If the temperature is lower than 75 degrees, process the dough for an additional 5 seconds, up to twice more, until the dough reaches the desired temperature. If the temperature is higher than 80 degrees, remove the thermometer, scrape the dough from the food processor into an un-greased bowl, and refrigerate for 5 to 10 minutes. Check the temperature of the dough after 5 minutes; it should be 80 degrees or cooler by that time.; Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it in a large ungreased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and ferment for 1 1/ 2 to 2 hours at room temperature, 70 to 72 degrees. The dough will have noticeably increased in volume and will be light and soft. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently flatten it with the palms of your hands, but do not punch out all of the air bubbles that have formed as the dough has fermented. Form the dough into a loose ball; lift up one edge and fold it into the center. Do this about 4 or 5 times until the dough is formed into a ball. Return it to the bowl, cover, and let proof at room temperature until it doubles in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/ 2 hours. One hour before baking, put the oven rack on the second shelf from the bottom of the oven and place the baking stone on the rack. Place a pan on the bottom of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Using a dough scraper or kitchen knife, divide it into 2 pieces. Form each piece into a log shape to be rolled like a baguette. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. To form the dough into round turban shapes, roll one piece into a strip about 14 inches long. Taper the dough so that it is noticeable thicker at one end; use both hands to roll the dough into a point on the other end. Starting with the thicker end, coil the dough so that it forms a tight spiral. Wrap it around, then tuck the thin end under the loaf to keep it from unraveling. With the palms of your hands, press the top of the loaf lightly to flatten it slightly, then transfer it to one corner of a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the second piece of dough. Place it diagonally across from the first loaf spaced about 2 inches so the loaves do not stick together as they bake. Cover with a towel and let proof for about 45 minutes at room temperature. The loaves will be visibly puffed and will increase in volume by at least half. Just before baking, beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon of water. Brush each loaf with the egg wash, then sprinkle the loaves with poppy seeds or sesame seeds. Carefully pour about 1 cup of warm water into the pan in the oven. Immediately slide the baking sheet of dough onto the baking stone in the oven and turn the heat down to 400 degrees.

Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the ice cubes to bring down the temperature. Once cooled and the ice cubes have dissolved, add to a resealable plastic container (or a plastic bag) and add the pork chops. Place in the fridge for 1 hour. Tie each pork chop around the perimeter with a piece of kitchen twine. This will help the chop retain a nice, round shape while cooking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the chops from the brine and pat dry with some paper towels (removing the excess moisture on the surface allows the pork chop to sear and caramelize). Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Set a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Coat the pan with oil and when the oil starts to smoke, add the pork chops to the pan. Cook over high heat until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the chops over and reduce the heat slightly to allow the chops to cook through. Cook on the second side until golden brown, about 8 minutes. When done, remove the pork chops from the skillet and place onto a sheet tray. Divide the slices of the Brie between the chops and layer evenly on each so they are covered well. Place the sheet tray into the oven and cook until the Brie is just melted and the pork has cooked to 140 to 145 degrees F. Remove from the oven and transfer the chops to a plate to rest. For the pan sauce: Meanwhile, place the skillet back over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil and then add the apples and onions. Saute for 4 to 5 minutes, and then add the Calvados. Allow the alcohol to cook off (you can flambe at this stage if desired by igniting the Calvados in the pan). Once the Calvados has reduced, add the stock and simmer. Season with some salt and pepper. Allow to reduce for 2 to 3 minutes, and then remove from the heat and swirl in the cold butter cubes. This will thicken the sauce and give it a nice sheen. Serve the Brie-topped pork chops with the sauce. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 45565,&quot;Pan-Seared Florida Pompano and Spiny Lobster in Squab Consomme, and Poached Foie Gras 1 tablespoon butter 4 pompano fillets, bloodline removed Salt and white pepper, for seasoning Squab Consomme, recipe follows 4 (1-ounce slices) foie gras 1 cup celeriac, chiffonade 1 small black truffle, julienned 2 bulbs spring garlic, shaved fine 2 spiny lobster tails, poached until medium rare and sliced into 1/4-inch medallions 2 spiny lobster tails, poached until medium rare and sliced into 1/4-inch medallions<br> Sprigs chervil, for garnish 2 squab, boned, breast and leg meat reserved for Squab Consomme, recipe follows (may substitute 1 duck, prepared the same way) 1 cup peeled and chopped carrot 1 cup peeled and chopped onion 1 cup peeled and chopped celeriac 4 cups chicken stock 15 whole white peppercorns Sprig thyme Sprig rosemary<br> 4 squab breast and leg meat, reserved from above 4 egg whites, lightly beaten 1 stalk fresh lemon grass, chopped 5 star anise, crushed 1/3 cup sherry vinegar 1 small beet, peeled and chopped 1 cup peeled and chopped carrot 1 cup peeled and chopped onion 1 cup peeled and chopped celeriac Squab Stock, see recipe above Instructions: In a large saute pan or skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.

Bring to medium heat and slowly render the pancetta, stirring occasionally and making sure it does not burn, until very crispy. Set the pancetta aside to drain and reserve the fat in the pot. Add 3 test kernels to the pot and cover. Once they pop, add the rest of the kernels and partially cover to let out steam. Once they start popping aggressively, shake the pot to keep things moving. Make sure to not keep the cover completely sealed; always let it vent to insure maximum texture. Once the popping frequency slows down, take it off the heat. In a small food processor, blend the salt and sugar to create a popcorn dust. Add the butter to the popcorn and stir, then add the pancetta, cheese and a couple pinches of the popcorn dust to taste. Shake vigorously to mix. Serve! &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 45588,&quot;Chocolate and Vanilla Pudding Swirl Pie 3 1/4 cups whole milk 1/4 cup cornstarch<br> 3/4 cup sugar<br> 1 pinch kosher salt<br> 4 large egg yolks<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped<br> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br> 1 premade 9-inch chocolate cookie pie crust<br> 1 cup raspberries, plus more for garnish 8 ounces whipped topping, such as Cool Whip<br> Instructions: For the pudding: Heat 3 cups of the milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat until just barely simmering. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup of milk and the cornstarch in a bowl until all the lumps are gone. Then whisk in the sugar, salt and egg yolks. Slowly pour about 1 cup of the hot milk into the yolk mixture while whisking, then add the contents of the bowl into the pot with the rest of the milk. Bring to a simmer while constantly whisking and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add the vanilla. Divide the pudding into 2 large bowls. Add the chocolate to 1 bowl, stirring until melted and smooth. Add the butter to the plain vanilla bowl, stirring until melted. Pour the chocolate pudding into the cookie pie crust, then spoon the vanilla pudding on top and gently spread it with an offset spatula so that it covers the chocolate layer. Use the offset to gently reach down to the chocolate layer and spin and flip it to swirl the puddings. Repeat all over the surface of the pie. Refrigerate until completely set, at least 4 hours. For the raspberry whipped topping: Add the raspberries to a bowl and mash with a fork. Gently fold the mashed raspberries into the whipped topping until combined. Dollop on top of the pie slices. Garnish with fresh raspberries. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]</li></ol><p>&quot; 45589,&quot;Fried Chicken 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon salt 2 teaspoons paprika 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 3 cups solid vegetable shortening Instructions: In a bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade. Lightly season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and place them in the bowl with the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 12 hours. In a large paper bag, combine the ingredients for the breading mixture. (My mother insists this gives extra flavor and I agree.) Put the chicken parts, a few at a time, in the bag and shake until they are well coated with the mixture. Place the breaded chicken on a rack with a baking sheet. When all of the pieces are breaded, refrigerate them for 15 minutes. In a large cast iron (or regular skillet), melt the shortening over low heat. Heat until shortening reaches 350 degrees F. Test 1 piece first. The oil should bubble and react as you add the first piece. Use a pair of heat-resistant tongs to gently place the chicken pieces, skin side down, in a single layer in the skillet over medium heat. Cook, undisturbed, 5 to 8 minutes, or until you can see the underside of the chicken browning. Remove the skillet from the heat and gently turn the pieces on their second side. Cook for an additional 10 minutes. When the chicken is cooked through, remove it and transfer it to a rack. Immediately season it (while it is still hot) with salt. Serve immediately or keep in a warm oven until ready to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 45590,&quot;Pizza on a Stick 1 cup sliced pepperoni 1 cup sliced Italian sausage 1/2 French bread loaf, toasted and cubed 1/2 green pepper, cut into bite-sized pieces 1/2 cup halved fresh mushrooms 1/2 cup zucchini slices 1/4 cup Italian dressing 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella 1 cup spaghetti sauce, warmed Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Shake off any excess flour and carefully place the rings into the hot oil. Fry in batches until golden brown, turning to cook evenly and prevent sticking, about 3 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Season the fried onion rings with more onion ring masala and salt, and repeat with the remaining onions. Make sure the vegetable oil comes back up to 375 degrees F in between batches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 45597,&quot;Tiny Lavender Shortbread Bites Cooking spray or softened unsalted butter for pan 3/4 cup (90 grams) confectioners\\u2019 sugar 1 cup (226 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon culinary-grade lavender buds, roughly chopped 1/2 teaspoon kosher sea salt 2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon granulated sugar Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8-inch square cake pan with cooking spray or softened butter. Line with a long sheet of parchment paper that extends up and over two opposite sides of the pan. Whisk together the confectioners\\u2019 sugar and butter in a large bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the lavender and the salt into the bowl, one at a time, vigorously whisking after each. Gently fold in the flour with a flexible spatula just until the last streak disappears. Scrape the dough into the prepared pan and press it into the bottom with your hands. Rub the remaining teaspoon of lavender into the granulated sugar in a small bowl and sprinkle over the shortbread. Bake for 30 minutes, rotating at the halfway point, until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and immediately slice the shortbread, still in the pan, into 16 squares, using a sharp paring knife. Then slice each square in half diagonally to make 32 tiny triangles. Once cooled to room temperature, lift the shortbread from the pan with the parchment overhang. Run a butter knife around the edges if it resists. Keep the shortbread in an airtight container on the counter for up to 3 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 45598,&quot;Hot Ham and Cheese Wreath 2 8-ounce tubes refrigerated crescent roll dough 1/4 cup jalape?o jelly 6 ounces deli ham, sliced paper thin 3 ounces gruyre cheese, shredded (about 1 cup) 3 ounces pepper Jack cheese, shredded (about 1 1/4 cups) 1 to 2 jalape?o peppers, thinly sliced Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375?

Pierce the eggplant all over with a fork. Grill, turning often, until charred all over and softened, 25 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, coat the bell pepper with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Grill, turning as needed, until charred all over, about 15 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to separate bowls; cover the pepper and let cool. Peel the charred skin from the pepper (do not rinse). Cut in half, discard the seeds and finely dice. Remove the skin from the eggplant. Cut in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Return the pulp to the bowl and set aside until juicy, about 15 minutes. Transfer the eggplant to a cutting board and finely chop; reserve the juices that have collected in the bowl. In a medium heavy saucepan, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and celery, season with salt and pepper and saute until the onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the diced bell pepper, tomato and sugar and saute until the tomato softens, about 3 minutes. Add the olives, capers, raisins and the eggplant and eggplant juices and cook 3 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and chocolate. Reduce the heat to low and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Preheat a grill to medium high and prepare for indirect grilling: For a charcoal grill, bank the hot coals to one side and leave the other half empty. For a gas grill, preheat all the burners, then turn off half the burners and keep the others on medium-high heat. Grill the steak: Pat the meat dry with paper towels. Lightly brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the steaks on indirect heat (the unlit side of the grill); cover and cook, turning halfway through, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 110 degrees F, about 30 minutes. Transfer to direct heat and cook, turning, until the steaks are charred and the thermometer registers 125 degrees F to 130 degrees F for medium-rare doneness, 4 to 6 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Stir the parsley and basil into the caponata; season with salt and pepper. Carve the meat from the bones and slice against the grain.
