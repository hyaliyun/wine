Sprinkle the pork generously with salt and brush both sides with the olive oil herb paste.<br> Stand the pork rack up and curl it around so that the two ends meet; be sure that the thick meaty part of the pork is on the inside. Secure the roast by tying it twice around the outside of the roast with twine.<br> Place the pork in a large roasting pan fitted with a pizza pan tray and stuff the center of the pork with the Pear and Chestnut Stuffing. (There will be leftover stuffing. Place the leftover stuffing in a baking dish and cook for 35 minutes at 350 degrees F.)<br> For the pan sauce: Place the garlic and diced veggies around the pork. Add half the chicken stock, the wine and bay leaves to the pan. Sprinkle everything with salt.<br> Cover the pork bones with aluminum foil to prevent the bones from burning. Place the pork in the oven. Roast until the pork is starting to brown, about 30 minutes.<br> Turn the oven down to 325 degrees F.<br> Roast the pork for 2 1/2 more hours, basting the pork occasionally. Rotate the pork a couple of times during the cooking time. If the liquid level reduces, replace it with the remaining stock.<br> When the pork is cooked to the proper doneness - an instant-read thermometer should read 140 to 145 degrees F - remove it from the oven. Carefully transfer the pork to a serving platter and cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Let the pork rest for 20 to 25 minutes.<br> Bring the pan juices to a boil. Taste and re-season if needed. Blend the veggies if desired to create a smoother sauce. I also like to leave them in.<br> To serve: Remove the twine. Scoop out the stuffing and cut the pork in between the bones to create chops. Top with pan sauce. Coat a wide, straight-sided pan with olive oil and add the bacon. Bring the pan to a medium heat and let the bacon get brown and crispy.<br> Add the celery, onions and fennel and season with salt. Cook the veggies until they get soft and very aromatic, 8 to10 minutes. Add the rosemary and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more.<br> Toss in the chestnuts, cranberries and pears, and stir to combine. Add the wine and let it reduce by half.<br> Put the bread in a large mixing bowl and add the cooked veggie mixture to the bread. Stir to combine and douse the bread with half the stock. Use your hands to combine the bread, veggies and stock. Add more stock when/if needed to really saturate the bread. Season with salt and taste it to make sure it is delicious. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barolo, Tempranillo]&quot; 56851,&quot;Spaghetti with Lemon, Garlic and Pecorino Two 8-ounce pieces Pecorino-Romano, such as Locatelli 1 head garlic, broken down into cloves and peeled<br> Kosher salt<br> 1 pound spaghetti<br> 1/2 stick unsalted butter<br> 1/4 teaspoon red cl flakes<br> 3 tablespoons lemon juice<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley<br> 2 cups baby arugula<br> Extra-virgin olive oil, for finishing<br> One 4-ounce piece burrata<br> Instructions: Add the Pecorino-Romano pieces to a medium saucepan and cover with water (about 2 cups). Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, add the garlic cloves to a small saucepan and add just enough water to cover. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn off the heat and strain. Add the garlic cloves back to the same saucepan and repeat the process 2 more times. (This will bring out the natural sweetness of the garlic.) Allow to cool to the touch, then carefully shave very thinly on a mandoline. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook to very al dente according to the package directions. Meanwhile, add the butter to a large saute pan and turn the heat on medium-high. Once the butter begins to melt, add the garlic and cl flakes. Let the butter melt and the garlic to fully bloom in the butter, about 1 minute. Strain the cheese stock directly into the saute pan, then stir and allow to come to a simmer. Add the cooked pasta and lemon juice to the sauce and finish cooking the pasta in the sauce. Add the chopped parsley and toss to combine. Pour the pasta into a serving bowl and top with the arugula, then drizzle with olive oil and salt to taste. Top with the burrata. Gently open the burrata just a touch, then serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 56852,&quot;Roasted Red Pepper and Goat Cheese Spread 1 16oz can roasted red peppers, drained 1lb goat cheese 1/4 cup Parmesan, grated Pinch of sugar 1/4 cup parsley, chopped Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: Put peppers into work bowl of a process bowl and puree. Add all other ingredients and pulse until combined. Season with salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 56853,&quot;Chocolate Cake 2 cups sugar 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus for dusting<br> 3/4 cup cocoa powder 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 2 eggs<br> 1 cup milk<br> 1/2 cup vegetable oil<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1 cup boiling water<br> Lemon juice, for wiping out bowl 10 large egg whites<br> 2 1/2 cups sugar<br> 3 cups (6 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into cubes, plus for greasing cake pans 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br> Pinch salt<br> 3 tablespoons hazelnut spread 1/2 cup chopped toffee crunch bar Instructions: For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. Stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a stand mixer bowl. Add the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in the boiling water; the batter will be thin. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes, and then unmold the cakes onto wire racks and let cool completely. For the frosting: Wipe out the mixer bowl with paper towels and lemon juice to remove any trace of grease. Add the egg whites and sugar, and heat over a pot of simmering water, whisking constantly but gently, until the mixture reaches 140 degrees F on a candy thermometer. (If you don&#39;t have a candy thermometer, the sugar should be completely dissolved and the egg whites hot.) Transfer the mixer bowl to the stand mixer and whip on high speed, using the whisk attachment, until the meringue is white, thick and glossy, and holds stiff peaks, 8 to 10 minutes. Switch over to the paddle attachment and, with the mixer on low speed, add the butter cubes, one at a time, mixing until fully incorporated and smooth. Add the vanilla, salt and hazelnut spread. (Makes 10 cups.) To assemble: Level and tort both cakes--you will now have 4 layers. Place one cake layer on a cake board, spread with a generous layer (about 1/2 inch) of the hazelnut buttercream, and sprinkle the toffee crunch on top. Repeat until you have stacked all 4 cake layers. Frost the cake with the remaining buttercream. Slice and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 56854,&quot;Kielbasa and Honey Mustard Pinwheels 1 sheet frozen puff pastry (half of a 17.3-ounce package), thawed All-purpose flour, for dusting 1/3 cup honey mustard 8 ounces diced kielbasa (about 1 1/2 cups) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Unfold the puff pastry onto a lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling pin, gently roll the dough out to a 10-by-15-inch rectangle. With a small offset spatula, spread the honey mustard evenly over the dough, making sure to go all the way to the edges, then sprinkle the kielbasa pieces over the mustard. Starting at a long side, roll the dough into a log as you would a jelly roll, then pinch the seam shut and place onto the prepared baking sheet, seam-side down. Refrigerate the log until slightly firm, at least 30 minutes; this will make it easier to cut it into rounds. (See Cook&#39;s Note) Cut the chilled puff pastry log into 1/2-inch-wide slices (you should get 20 to 22 slices) and place the slices cut-side down onto the baking sheet. If needed, adjust the slice shape to form a circle. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 18 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]&quot; 56855,&quot;Popcornapalooza 2 tablespoons ancho cl powder 2 tablespoons light brown sugar<br> 1 tablespoon dried parsley<br> 1 teaspoon cayenne, optional<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 8 sliced bacon, cooked until crispy<br> 3 teaspoons garlic powder<br> 1 batch prepared stove-top gourmet popcorn (1 cup unpopped, 14 to 15 cups popped)<br> 4 tablespoons melted butter (3 ounces)<br> Instructions: In a food processor, combine the cl powder, cayenne, if using, the parsley, brown sugar, bacon and salt. Buzz them until they are powdered. Toss in the garlic powder and mix to combine. Put the prepared popcorn into a large bowl and drizzle with the melted butter, tossing to coat. Add the spice mixture and toss again, then serve. It&#39;s like one thousand angels saying \\Hello!\\ to your taste buds. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 56856,&quot;Steak-Cut Oven Fries with Blue Cheese Dip 1 cup mayonnaise 1 cup crumbled Maytag or other blue cheese (about 6 ounces) 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 shallot, minced 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon celery seed 2 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley Freshly ground black pepper 4 medium russet potatoes (about 2 pounds), scrubbed 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt Instructions: To make the blue cheese dip: In a food processor, combine the mayonnaise, blue cheese, buttermilk, shallot, lemon juice and zest, Worcestershire, salt, and celery seed. Pulse until evenly combined but still slightly chunky. Stir in the parsley and season with pepper, to taste. Transfer the dip to a bowl and refrigerate for the flavors to come together while you make the fries. To make the fries: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F. Put a baking sheet on the center rack and preheat for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the potatoes lengthwise into wedges by eighths, leaving the skins on. In a large bowl toss the wedges with the olive oil. Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and arrange the potato wedges cut-side down on it, keeping them evenly spaced. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the remaining oil in the bowl over the potatoes (it helps them get crispy). Bake until browned and crisp, about 30 minutes. Transfer the fries to a serving platter and season with salt, to taste. Serve immediately with the blue cheese dip. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 56857,&quot;Stuffing for Sunday Start-Up Leg of Lamb 4 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup finely minced onion 1/4 pound finely chopped mushrooms 1 teaspoon minced garlic 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary 1 cup soft bread crumbs 1/2 cup pitted Nicoise olives 1/4 cup minced parsley Salt and pepper Instructions: Melt 4 tablespoons butter. Saute onion for about 5 minutes or until tender. Add the mushrooms and saute for another 5 minutes or until tender. If they give off a lot of water, then reduce over high heat until mushrooms are dry. Add the garlic, rosemary and bread crumbs and remove from heat. Season with olives, parsley and then with salt and pepper to taste. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 56858,&quot;Coffee Creme Brulee 4 egg yolks 1 cup sugar, divided 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 1 tablespoon instant coffee 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions: Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. In a medium-size bowl, beat egg yolks and 6 tablespoons sugar with a whisk for approximately 1 minute, or until smooth. Reserve. In a second medium-size bowl, add coffee and 1/4 cup creme. Whisk thoroughly until smooth, then add remaining creme and whisk until well blended. Add coffee creme mixture and vanilla to egg yolks. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold together. Use a ladle to pour mixture into individual ramekins, 3/4 of the way to the top. Place ramekins into a roasting pan. Transfer to oven. Before closing oven door, pour water into pan (but not into the ramekins themselves!) until it reaches 1/2 way up the side of the ramekins. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until when you shake the pan, the brulee giggles slightly. Remove from oven and leave out on counter, allowing the residual heat of the water to finish the cooking process. When brulees have fully solidified and cooled down, sprinkle 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar evenly overtop each individual portion. Under a watchful eye, use a small blowtorch to caramelize the sugar. Alternatively, place ramekins 1-inch below oven broiler until sugar caramelizes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56859,&quot;White Bean Salad with Grilled Figs 2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 4 plum tomatoes, seeded and diced 1 lemon, juiced 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1/2 pound pancetta, small dice 12 figs, halved Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup crumbled blue cheese 1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves 1 teaspoon chopped thyme leaves Instructions: Preheat the grill to high heat.

Top each with a chocolate dessert cup. Using a cookie cutter that fits the inside of the chocolate cup, cut 12 rounds of the Banana Panna Cotta. Place one round inside each chocolate cup and pipe about 2 tablespoons of the Peanut Butter Mousse on top of each. Finely slice the bacon into little matchsticks and top the mousse with a pinch of the bacon and a shard of praline. Serve immediately. Spray an 8-inch square baking dish or cake pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Combine the gelatin, heavy cream and milk in a medium saucepan and let it sit for 2 to 3 minutes to bloom the gelatin. Set over medium heat, add the sugar, vanilla bean seeds and pod and bring to a simmer, stirring until the sugar and gelatin are dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the vanilla pod and add the gelatin mixture a blender along with the bananas, lemon juice and salt and puree until smooth.

Add the corn syrup, vanilla and a pinch of salt. Continue mixing until satiny and light, another 3 to 5 minutes. Whip the cream until it holds soft peaks. Add about a third of the whipped cream to the peanut butter mixture and mix well to loosen it up. Add the remaining whipped cream and fold gently until completely combined. Transfer to a pastry bag and refrigerate until ready to use.<br> Place a large piece of parchment paper on a flat surface, preferably granite or wood. Combine the peanuts, granulated and brown sugars, butter, milk, bourbon, salt and vanilla in a large pot and attach a candy thermometer to the side, being sure that the thermometer goes deep into the mixture. Turn the heat to medium-high. Meanwhile, fill a bowl that&#39;s larger than the pot halfway with ice water and set it aside. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon. When everything has melted together, start checking the temperature. When the thermometer reaches exactly 236 degrees F, remove the pot from the heat and stick it in the bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process, stirring constantly, 45 seconds. Pour all of the mixture onto the parchment and spread it out to about 1/8-inch thin. Make sure you&#39;ve distributed the peanuts evenly. If you feel like it, sprinkle just a bit of salt on top. Let it cool all the way, about 1 hour. (If you&#39;re in a humid environment, it might stay sticky, but put it in front of a fan, and it should dry.) Break up into shards. Store shards carefully in a tin, stacked no higher than three layers, separated by wax paper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56873,&quot;Filet of Beef Meurice 2 pounds beef tenderloin, cut into 8x1/2 inch thick slices Salt, black pepper to season 1 garlic clove, pressed Clarified butter 1 10 ounce tin champignons, drained 1/4 cup brandy, warmed Squeeze lemon juice 8 ounces chicken liver pate 5/8th cup cream 1 tablespoon horseradish Instructions: Season steaks with salt and pepper and squeeze garlic over them.

Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the water to prevent noodles from sticking. Cook noodles for about 10 minutes, drain and set aside on a baking sheet. Do not overcook noodles as they will cook more in the oven. Prepare the Bechamel Sauce: In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the milk while continuing to whisk, until the sauce is smooth. Simmer for about 10 minutes until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Set aside. Prepare the Spinach Filling: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large saute pan over medium heat, add half of the spinach, stirring until wilted and tender, about 3 minutes. Remove the spinach, place in a colander and squeeze out excess liquid, and then roughly chop. Repeat the process with the remaining spinach. Heat the remaining olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in the saucepan and add the garlic. Saute until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes, then add scallions. Saute another 2 to 3 minutes until scallions are soft, then add the spinach along with the parsley, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Stir the feta cheese and beaten egg into the cooled spinach mixture. Assemble the lasagna: Coat the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch lasagna pan with a thin layer of bechamel sauce. Arrange 4 noodles lengthwise on the sauce, slightly overlapping each other. Pour 1/3 of the bechamel sauce over the noodles. Then add 1/3 of the spinach mixture, spreading it out evenly. Top the spinach mixture with 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan. Repeat with 2 more layers of noodles, sauce, spinach mixture, and Parmesan. For the topping, unroll the phyllo dough on a flat surface and keep it covered with a damp towel so that it doesn&#39;t dry out. Place a sheet of phyllo on top of the lasagna. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle some bread crumbs evenly. Top with another phyllo sheet, brush with more butter and sprinkle with more bread crumbs. Repeat with the 2 remaining layers of phyllo. Make sure the edges are nicely sealed with butter so that they don&#39;t curl up during the baking process. Top the final layer with a mixture of the remaining melted butter, bread crumbs, and Parmesan. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, being careful not to overcook the phyllo. Remove from oven and let cool slightly before serving. Cut into squares and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 56876,&quot;Nostalgic Popping Candy Cupcakes 1 3/4 cups cake flour 1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 5 tablespoons butter 1 1/4 cups sugar 2 extra-large whole eggs 3 large egg yolks 2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/3 cup vegetable oil 1/3 cup buttermilk, shaken Popping Candy Buttercream, recipe follows 8 tablespoons unsalted sweet cream butter, softened 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 to 3 cups powdered sugar, well sifted 1 to 3 teaspoons cream, as needed Popping candy, for garnish (recommended: Pop Rocks) Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Bring to a boil and cook, covered, until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Drain and reserve. (To test a bean for doneness, choose a small one. Smaller beans take longer to cook because of their dense centers. The bean should taste creamy, rather than powdery, inside.) Make Pesto by pureeing garlic, olive oil, and a few basil leaves in a blender. Gradually add remaining leaves until all are pureed. Transfer to a small bowl, add grated cheese, and stir. Set aside.Cut each vegetable into even 1/2inch dice and set aside. To avoid discoloration, reserve potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Bring chicken stock to a boil in a large stockpot.

Spray a 15-by-10-by-1-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. In a large bowl, mix the salt, 4 cups of the flour and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Using a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Add 1 tablespoon of the water at a time to moisten it and mix, repeating until a dough starts to form. Knead the dough into a ball. Divide the dough in half and flatten each half into a rectangle. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.<br> Lightly flour a work surface and roll 1 piece of dough into a 19-by-13-inch rectangle. Place the dough on the prepared pan and ease it onto the pan and up the sides, making sure not to stretch the dough too much so it doesn&#39;t become too thin. Trim the leftover dough, leaving just enough to cover the sides of the pan. Fold the dough as desired on the edges. In a large bowl, combine the apple slices, cinnamon and remaining 1/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup sugar. Toss until the apples are coated. Arrange the apple mixture evenly on the dough.<br> On a lightly floured surface, roll the remaining piece of dough into a rectangle. With leaf-shaped cookie cutters, cut out dough leaves. Arrange the leaves on top of the apple mixture to cover the pie; it is okay to leave some space in between the leaves so you can see the apple filling.

Combine the butter and chocolate in a mixing bowl on top of a pot of simmering water. If you don&#39;t have experience melting chocolate then be very careful not to burn the mixture. Never melt chocolate directly over the cooking element. Heat the chocolate mixture until melted and set aside to cool slightly. In a mixer on medium-high speed, beat the eggs, the egg yolks and the sugar for about 5 minutes, or until they are thick and a light yellow color. On low speed gradually add the flour and then the chocolate-butter mixture. Butter 6 (6 to 8-ounce) ramekins and dust with the cocoa powder. Tap out the excess but make sure they are well coated. Pour the batter into the ramekins, filling them about 7/8 of the way to the top. Place on the preheated sheet tray and bake for 15 to 18 minutes. The consistency when done should be where the edges of the cake are firm and the top is still soft to the touch. This dessert has very thin line between being under and overdone! Remove from the oven and let sit on a cool surface for 3 to 5 minutes. Run a paring knife between the cake and ramekin to loosen the sides. Invert your dessert plate over the ramekin (be careful, they&#39;re hot) and flip over. Tap the plate lightly and lift off the ramekin. Serve with vanilla ice cream and garnish with raspberries and strawberries, if desired. If the cake runs all over the plate you need to increase the cooking time. If the cake is hard and does not ooze chocolate, lessen the cooking time. If the cake does not come out then make sure the ramekins are well buttered and covered in the cocoa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 56948,&quot;Artichoke and Radicchio Clafoutis 2 large eggs, at room temperature 3 large egg whites, at room temperature 4 teaspoons sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon firmly packed fresh yeast 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 lemons, juiced 2 cups water 20 baby artichokes 2 ounces pancetta or bacon, diced into 1/4-inch cubes, optional Salt and freshly ground pepper 8 white mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices 1 large shallot, finely chopped 2 ounces arugula, well washed, dried and trimmed 1 small head radicchio (about 3/4 pound), trimmed and leaves separated Instructions: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg whites and sugar; set aside.

Mix in the ground beef and breadcrumbs by hand, then form into 4 oval patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Set a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the patties and brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the patties to a plate; set aside.<br> For the onion and mushroom gravy: Turn the heat down to medium and add the mushrooms and thyme. Cook until the mushrooms release their liquid and are browned, about 8 minutes. (The mushrooms might seem dry at first, but will eventually release liquid and add moisture to the pan.) Transfer the mushrooms to a plate; set aside. Melt the butter in the pan, add the onions and garlic and cook until translucent and lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and cook, stirring, until the butter and liquid are absorbed, about 1 minute. Pour the broth and Worcestershire into the pan and stir until the flour is dissolved.<br> Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir the mushrooms back into the pan and nestle in the beef patties. Cover with a lid and reduce the heat to medium low. Let simmer until the sauce has thickened and a thermometer inserted into the patties registers 165 degrees F, about 10 minutes.<br> Turn the patties over a few times to coat in the sauce. Season with salt and pepper and top with the parsley.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Rioja]&quot; 56956,&quot;Chocolate Very Orangey Cookies 1/2 cup demerara sugar or light brown sugar 1/2 cup coconut sugar or light brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup refined coconut oil, at room temperature<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\\u202f<br> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\\u202f<br> 1 teaspoon baking powder\\u202f<br> Zest and juice of 1 orange (2 tablespoons juice)\\u202f<br> 3.1 ounces (90 grams) dark chocolate bar, broken into one-piece squares (2 squares per cookie)\\u202f<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, beat together the demerara sugar, coconut sugar, coconut oil and vanilla with a wooden spoon. Stir in the flour, baking powder, orange zest and juice.<br> Spoon approximately 1-tablespoon-size balls of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets.<br> Gently flatten the balls using a metal tablespoon, then place two squares of chocolate in the center of each ball. Bake until the edges start to brown, about 10 minutes. Remove the tray to a cooling rack. After 1 minute take the cookies off the baking sheet and transfer to the rack. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Barolo, Pinot Noir, Syrah]</p><p>&quot; 56957,&quot;Blackberry Brown Betty with Pecan Crumble 2 1/2 cups whole milk 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped out, seeds and pod reserved 6 large egg yolks 1 cup granulated sugar 6 tablespoons cornstarch 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup pecans, halves or pieces, divided 1 3/4 cups cake flour, divided 1/2 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract 3 pints fresh blackberries, rinsed and dried Instructions: For the pastry cream: In a small saucepan, bring the milk and vanilla bean pod and seeds to a boil over medium heat. Once it comes to a boil, cover the pan, remove it from the heat, and let steep for 15 minutes.<br> In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks, sugar and cornstarch together until very thick. Slowly drizzle one-third of the hot milk into the yolks, whisking constantly. Remove the vanilla bean pod. Return the yolk mixture to the saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook, whisking continually, until the mixture comes to a boil. Continue whisking while the mixture boils for 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Remove from the heat. Whisk slowly until the mixture cools a bit, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk in the butter 1 tablespoon at a time.<br> The pastry cream needs to be chilled before using. One method is to cover the surface of the cream with a sheet of buttered parchment, or butter wrappers, and refrigerate it until it is very cold. The other method, which I prefer, is quicker: Set the bowl of pastry cream in a larger bowl filled with lots of ice and some cold water and allow it to sit until very cold. (Think of chilling a bottle of wine or champagne-you need some water to ensure even cooling.) If you choose this method, stir the cream occasionally for even cooling. The pastry cream can be made up to 3 days in advance and refrigerated.<br> For the crumble topping: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the pecans on a baking sheet and bake until toasted, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove and let cool. Coarsely chop 1/4 cup of the pecans.<br> Put the remaining 3/4 cup pecans in a food processor along with 1/2 cup of the cake flour. (The flour will help keep the nuts from turning into pecan butter.) Pulse the pecans until they&#39;re very finely chopped. Add the rest of the flour, the confectioners&#39; sugar, turbinado sugar, salt and baking powder. Pulse until mixed, 3 to 4 times.<br> With the machine running, add the melted butter and vanilla. Pulse until large clumps form. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the reserved 1/4 cup chopped pecans. Refrigerate until chilled. The topping can be made several days in advance and can also be frozen for up to 1 month.<br> To bake the betties, heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Have ready eight 6-ounce ramekins or baking dishes. Divide the chilled pastry cream evenly among the ramekins. The cream should fill just under one-third of the ramekin. I like piping the cream into the ramekins, but using a spoon old-school works just as well.<br> Evenly portion the berries on top of the pastry cream. Remove the crumble from the refrigerator. Break off clumps about 1/2 to 3/4 inch in diameter, keeping the clumps about the same size, and divide them evenly among the ramekins.<br> Arrange the ramekins on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake until the berries start to bubble and the topping turns golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.<br> Remove from the oven, let cool for 10 to 15 minutes, and serve dusted with confectioners&#39; sugar. You can also serve the betties topped with ice cream, whipped cream or creme fraiche, or you can pour a little warm heavy cream into each betty. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56958,&quot;Mustard Barbecue Sauce 1/2 cup cider vinegar 1/2 cup minced onion 3 jalapeno peppers, minced 1 cup yellow mustard 1 cup deli mustard 1 cup dark corn syrup 1 ounce molasses Salt and cayenne pepper to taste Instructions: Mix the ingredients in a sauce pan and bring to a boil.

Whisk together the milk, sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan, and bring to a low simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly to prevent sticking on the bottom. Once the mixture comes to a simmer, continue whisking until it is just thicker than heavy cream, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, pour about 1 cup of the mixture into the egg yolks and whisk to combine. Pour this milk-egg mixture back into the milk mixture in the saucepan. Return the saucepan to medium heat, and whisk until very thick, 3 to 4 minutes. (When you drag the whisk through the thickened pudding, the streaks should hold firm for a few seconds.) Whisk the butter and vanilla into the pudding, and transfer it to a large bowl to cool. Set the bowl in some ice water and whisk frequently to help the pudding cool faster. For the raspberry topping: While the pudding cools, stir together 2 tablespoons water and the cornstarch in a small bowl. Heat the raspberries and sugar in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the raspberries thaw and break down and the sugar dissolves completely, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the cornstarch mixture, and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly; continue cooking and stirring until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, and let the mixture cool completely. Build the pie: Spread 1/2 the cooled pudding into an even layer in the pie crust. Scatter the peaches over the pudding, then the cookies over the peaches. Finish with an even layer of the remaining pudding. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Spread the raspberry topping over the pudding. (Stir the topping first to smooth out if needed.) Refrigerate the pie until the pudding is completely set, about 2 hours. Slice and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 56961,&quot;Grilled Kofta Kebabs 1 medium onion 1 slice bread (white or whole wheat) 2 tablespoons milk 1 pound ground beef 1 pound ground lamb 1 cup fresh parsley, chopped 1 teaspoon ground allspice 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon sumac 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced Neutral oil, for the grill grates 1 cup whole-milk yogurt 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 clove garlic, grated Warm pita, sliced tomatoes, fresh parsley leaves and thinly sliced onion, for serving Instructions: For the kofta: Place 16 to 20 wooden skewers in a container of water and press down to make sure they\\u2019re fully submerged, then soak for at least 1 hour.

Combine walnuts, cinnamon, ground cloves, sugar and bread crumbs together in a large bowl. Grease a baking pan with the melted butter. It should be the same size as the sheets of pastry. Trim the pastry to fit, if needed. Brush 1 sheet of pastry with melted butter and place in the bottom of the pan. Repeat this until you have a layer about 5 or 6 sheets deep. Cover with some of the nut filling. Place 2 more buttered pastry sheets on top and cover with more of the nut filling. Continue the layers until all of the filling is used. Use the last 4 or 5 of the buttered pastry sheets as the top layer. Using a small sharp knife cut a diamond shaped pattern into the baklava, cutting through the layers to the bottom of the pan. Stud the top of the baklava with the whole cloves. Bake in the center of the pre-heated oven for 1 1/2 hours. For fan-forced ovens it may be necessary to cover the baklava with aluminum foil to prevent it becoming too dark. When baked through remove and cool to room temperature. To make the syrup: Place the sugar, honey, water, cloves, butter and cinnamon in a saucepan and stir to combine. Boil for 7 to 10 minutes, then remove the cloves and cinnamon, with a slotted spoon and add the lemon juice. Pour the boiling syrup over the room temperature baklava.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix the breadcrumbs, milk and roasted garlic in a bowl; it should have an oatmeal-like consistency. Set aside. In another bowl, mix the ketchup, steak sauce, sriracha, maple syrup and steak seasoning. If the sauce is too spicy for you, add a little more ketchup to mellow the heat. Set aside. In a bowl, combine the ground beef, sausage, parsley, eggs, pepper-onion mixture and two-thirds of the meatloaf sauce. Mix well, but don&#39;t overwork. Take a small ball of the mixture and make a bite-size patty. Saute the patty in a pan until cooked through, then taste. Add salt and pepper to the meatloaf mix as needed. When you are happy with the flavor, place the meatloaf mixture in a greased loaf pan, or form it into a log and place it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven; adjust the oven to a low broil.

Prepare the sugar cookie dough according to the package directions. Evenly press half of the cookie dough into the prepared skillet all the way to the edge. (Reserve the remaining dough for another use.) Bake until the top just turns golden and a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cookie comes out clean, 11 to 13 minutes. Cool in the skillet for 30 minutes. Carefully remove the cookie with a large offset spatula and place it on a cutting board. Cut the cookie: Heat up a small, sharp knife by submerging it in boiling water for 3 minutes. Wipe the knife dry and gently cut the cookie into 8 wedges making sure the pieces stay together in a circle. Take it slow when cutting or the cookie could crumble. Let the cookie cool completely on the cutting board. Meanwhile, make the royal icing: Whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft glossy peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes (you may need to add up to 1 teaspoon more water). Transfer a quarter of the icing to a pastry bag fitted with a small no. 13 star pastry tip. Color the remaining icing red using the food coloring. Transfer 1/4 cup of the red icing to a small bowl and add water, 1/4 teaspoon at a time, to thin it out (when you drizzle the icing with a spoon, the lines should disappear within 5 seconds). This will be your filling icing. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a small no. 3 round pastry tip. Transfer the remaining thick red icing to a pastry bag fitted with a small no. 4 round pastry tip. Decorate the cookie: Using the thick red icing with the no. 4 tip, pipe a 2-inch circle in the center of the cookie. With the same icing, pipe eight 1-inch circles overlapping the 8 cut lines, positioning them about 1 inch in from the edge of the cookie. Each cookie wedge should have 2 half circles on it. Fill in all the circles with the filling icing with the no. 3 tip. Sprinkle each circle with red sanding sugar to coat. If excess sanding sugar gets on the cookie, fan it away or brush it off with a small pastry brush. (Your Santas are taking shape: the wedges in the large center circle are hats; the smaller circles are mittens.) Place a dragee on the tip of each cookie wedge to form a small white circle in the middle of the red center circle. (These are the pom-poms on the Santa hats.) Pipe a white icing border around the center red circle. (This will be the bottom of the hats.) Working on one cookie wedge at a time and starting at the white border, pipe a white ?V? that fits snuggly between the 2 red half circles. Repeat with the remaining cookie wedges. You should have a white 8-point star surrounding the middle red circle. (You&#39;ve just made 8 Santa beards.) Pipe a small dot of thick red icing with the no. 4 tip in the middle of each \\V.\\ (Now each Santa has a nose.) Finish by piping a white border around the edge of the cookie. (This is the bottom of each Santa&#39;s coat.) Let the icing dry before serving, about 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 56992,&quot;White Wine Poached Egg with a Bacon-Frisee Salad 1 or 2 slices ciabatta bread, grilled with extra-virgin olive oil 8 ounces bacon, cut into lardons, reserving at least 1/2 cup bacon fat for dressing (good for 4 servings) 2 medium heads frisee, trimmed and outer leaves removed and soaked in ice water with a big pinch kosher salt 1 head fennel, halved, cored and sliced paper thin on a mandolin, and add to ice water with frisee 1 heaping tablespoon Pickled Onions, recipe follows 1 handful frisee, trimmed and washed 2 tablespoons Warm Vinaigrette dressing, recipe follows About 2 cups white wine, for poaching (or about 1-inch liquid in small saucepan) Splash white wine vinegar, for poaching 1 bouquet garni (1 clove garlic, bay leaf, shallot, 1/2 teaspoon peppercorns in cheesecloth tied with butcher&#39;s twine with extra string to tie to handle of pot) Pinch kosher salt 1 chicken egg, cracked into individual ramekin Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 shallot, minced (1 tablespoon) 1/2 clove garlic, smashed Pinch kosher salt 1/4 cup red wine vinegar or big splash 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1/2 cup warm bacon fat Freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds red onions, sliced White wine vinegar Sugar Kosher salt 4 cloves garlic 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 tablespoons black peppercorns 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes 2 teaspoons mustard seeds Instructions: For the salad: Place the bacon lardons into a saute pan and cook to render the fat and crisp.

Soak the channa dhal in a small bowl of water for 10 minutes. Drain. In a saucepan, boil the potatoes in salted water for 8 to 10 minutes or until they are tender when pierced with a knife. Drain, reserving the liquid for later. In a wide nonstick pan with a lid, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the mustard seeds and cover. When the mustard seeds have popped, toss in the cumin seeds and curry leaves and shake the pan, allowing the cumin seeds to brown and the leaves to sizzle. Next, add the drained channa dhal and fry, stirring constantly until golden. Put in the onions and saute until soft but not brown, then add the ginger and green cl, and fry for 1 minute. Stir in the turmeric, cayenne, and salt and fry for 1 more minute. Finally, add the drained potato and 1/2 cup of the reserved liquid, reducing the heat to medium low, and simmering, with the cover on. Periodically add more of the potato liquid (1/4 cup at a time), and stir occasionally, until the mixture is paste-like and the potatoes have broken down, about 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and remove from the heat. Cover and set aside. Fry the dosas according to the instructions in the Sourdough Crepes recipe. After frying each 1, place golden side down and spoon about 2 tablespoons of the potato filling onto 1 half. Fold in half, and place the filled dosa on a warm platter: cover, while you continue frying the rest. Serve promptly. Place the urad dhal in a large bowl and rinse with many changes of water until the water no longer appears cloudy. Drain. In a large bowl, combine the drained urad dhal with the rice, fenugreek seeds, and 2 1/2 cups water. Soak the ingredients together for 4 hours at room temperature, until the dhal and rice expand and soften. When a grain of rice just breaks under the pressure of your fingernail, the ingredients have soaked long enough. Drain the urad dhal and rice, reserving the liquid. Place roughly half of the solids and half of the liquid in a blender and grind them long enough to get a smooth consistency with some graininess remaining, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Test by rubbing a little batter between your fingers. The largest grains should be the size of granulated sugar. Pour the mixture into a large bowl. Repeat the process with the remaining solids and liquid, and add the mixture to the bowl. Stir in the salt. The mixture should be very thick, so it will be necessary to thin it with approximately 1/4 cup water to get the consistency of pancake batter. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and place in an oven, kept warm to a temperature of 90 degrees for 12 to 15 hours. This can be achieved with the help of a trouble light or floodlight fitted with a 25-watt bulb. Plug the power cord into an outlet close enough to the oven so that the bulb can rest on a rack in the oven. Turn on the light and prop the oven door open about 1 inch with the handle of a wooden spoon. Check the temperature periodically to be sure it stays at 90 degrees. During warm summer months it may not be necessary to use the lightbulb. The batter should nearly double in volume and smell a little sour. Remove the bowl from the oven and stir the contents. The batter will be thick and foamy. If you choose not to fry the crepes immediately, refrigerate the batter at this point. Remove it from refrigerator 1/2 hour before frying. When ready to fry the crepes, check the consistency of the batter: it should pour smoothly like pancake batter. Add the baking soda and a little more water if needed. Heat a nonstick griddle or frying pan over medium low heat (2 pans will speed up the process). Spread about 1/4 teaspoon oil evenly over the griddle. Ladle 1/4 cup of the batter into the center of the hot griddle, and immediately, using the back of the ladle, gently but steadily spread the batter in a circular motion from the center out, creating a thin pancake. If the batter does not spread easily into a thin layer, thin it with a little more water. As the crepe cooks, small holes will form on the surface. Sprinkle a few drops of oil on top, to help make it crisp. When the bottom turns a golden color (about 1 minute) turn it over and fry the other side 30 seconds or until lightly browned. Fold the crepe in half, golden side out, and place it on a platter. Keep the fried crepes warm as you repeat the process, oiling the griddle each time. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Rangers, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 56999,&quot;Pan-Seared Pork Tenderloin with Braised Turnips and Parmesan 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon garlic salt<br> 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1 teaspoon mustard powder<br> 1 pork tenderloin, cut into 1-inch medallions (about 8)<br> Kosher salt 2 tablespoons canola oil<br> 3 scallions, minced<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 cup turnip dice (1/4-inch), tops reserved<br> 1/2 cup white wine<br> 1 cup chicken stock<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 1/2 teaspoon fresh rosemary, minced<br> 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Chopped fresh chives, for garnish<br> Instructions: Combine the cumin, garlic salt, oregano and mustard powder in a small bowl. Sprinkle the pork medallions on all sides with salt, followed by the rub. In a large straight-sided saute pan, heat the canola over high heat until it begins to smoke, then turn down the to medium. Add the pork medallions and sear until caramelized on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, then sear on the other side until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 130 degrees F, about 4 more minutes. Remove the pork and set aside to rest. Return the pan to the heat and add the scallions and garlic. Cook over low heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the turnips and cook, stirring to coat the vegetables, for 1 minute. Add the white wine and chicken stock, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and reduce by three-quarters, about 5 minutes. Chiffonade 1/2 cup of the turnip greens and add to the sauce with the butter and rosemary. Return the pork and any accumulated juices to the pan. Remove from the heat and top with the Parmesan. Divide among plates and garnish with the chives. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 57000,&quot;Cracker Crumb Blue Fish Filets 1/4 cup warm bacon fat 1 small onion, diced (about 1/2 cup) 1 cup washed and finely diced celery 1/2 cup dry sherry 1/4 cup chopped dill 1 1/2 teaspoons celery salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 2 cups unsalted chowder crackers, finely crumbled 2 pounds small blue fish filets, about 4 to 5 filets 3 tablespoon olive oil Salt and pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

Pour the warm water into the bowl (be sure it&#39;s at least 110 degrees F when it?s in the bowl) and mix in the yeast, sugar and saffron. Allow to sit for 5 minutes, until it starts to froth, which tells you that the yeast is active. Add the eggs and egg yolk and mix on low speed. With the mixer on low, gradually add 4 1/2 cups of the flour, scraping down the bowl as you go. With the mixer on low, add the salt and butter, then slowly add between 1 and 1 1/2 more cups of the flour, mixing on low for about 5 minutes and continuing to add a dusting of flour to the bowl but only enough so the dough doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom of the bowl. The dough will be soft and a little sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead it by hand for a full 2 minutes. Roll the dough into a ball with the smooth side up. Brush a large bowl with vegetable oil and place the dough in the bowl, smooth-side down. Roll the dough around to cover it with oil, then turn it smooth-side up, making sure the entire dough is covered with oil to prevent a crust from forming. Cover the bowl with a clean dry kitchen towel and allow to rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, until doubled in size. Punch the dough down lightly and turn it out onto an unfloured cutting board. With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Turn the first ball of dough smooth-side up and roll it into a cylinder. Roll the dough into a rope 17 inches long and lay it seam-side down on the parchment paper. Repeat for the other 3 balls of dough, laying them side by side on the parchment paper. To braid the dough, pile one end of the ropes on top of each other and pinch them together and under. With the pinched end away from you, take the far right rope and move it left over 2 ropes. Then take the far left rope and move it right over 2 ropes. Continue taking alternate ropes and laying them over 2 ropes until you?ve braided the entire bread. Pinch the ends together and fold them under. Cover the bread with a clean dry kitchen towel and allow it to sit in a warm place for 45 to 60 minutes, until doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Brush the bread thoroughly with the egg wash and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the outside is browned and it sounds hollow when you tap the bottom. Place the challah on a baking rack and cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 57002,&quot;Guy Cooks With Kids: E.J. and Guy&#39;s Pasta 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup chopped onion 1/4 cup chopped Italian sausage (hot or sweet) 1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper 1/4 cup thinly sliced mushrooms 1/4 cup chopped broccoli 3 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 1/3 cup cubed grilled chicken 1/4 cup chicken stock 1 cup whole wheat penne rigotte, cooked al dente and strained 1/2 cup heavy cream 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving, optional 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley 3 tablespoons chopped fresh spinach 1/4 cup chopped Roma tomatoes Instructions: Preheat a saute pan over high heat, add the olive oil and allow to come up to a high temperature.

Either ask your butcher to spatchcock the guinea fowl or chicken, and the pheasant for you, or have a go at doing it yourself. Turn the bird upside down and cut underneath the legs with a good pair of scissors. Remove the bony part of the carcass that has no meat on it (bearing in mind that you want to save the incredible meat around the legs) and open the bird out like a book. You can then stuff the cavities of the other birds with flavorings - a sprig of rosemary, a sprig of thyme and a little orange or lemon zest. Place the onion, celery and carrots in a large roasting pan (or 2 small ones) and lay the sausages and birds on top. Throw in the bay leaves and the rest of the thyme and rosemary. Drizzle with olive oil and massage it into each bird. Season all the meat generously. Place in the preheated oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 350 degrees F. Cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, turning the birds a few times, until the meat is juicy and cooked through to the bone. After half an hour, bring 1 quart of salted water to the boil in a non-stick pan and whisk in the polenta. Turn the heat right down, place a lid on so it&#39;s ajar (otherwise the pan might spit hot polenta at you!) and simmer for 50 minutes, stirring it as often as you can. If it starts to become too thick, add some more hot water. Remove the birds from the oven, lift them out of the pan and keep warm. Put the pan on the burner, pour in the wine and simmer gently to make a quick sauce. Then see to the polenta - it&#39;ll need some serious perking up now. Stir in about 3/4 of the butter and all the grated Parmesan. Once smooth, taste and season if required. It should now be delicious! Spoon all the polenta onto a big board or platter, spread it out evenly and put to 1 side to firm up a little. Give your sauce a stir and add the rest of the butter. Strain it through a sieve into a pan, pressing down hard. Cut the bigger birds into drumstick thighs and breast pieces and place with all the other birds on top of your polenta. Slice the sausages and add to the pile. Spoon the red wine sauce over the top and finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Put the board in the middle of the table and let everyone dive in.

Serve warm over ice cream or frozen yogurt. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 57010,&quot;Iles Flottantes 3 ounces/80 grams sugar 4 free-range egg yolks 1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out 18 fluid ounces/500 milliliters milk 1/2 teaspoon ground long pepper or freshly ground black pepper 3 ounces/75 grams sugar 2 ounces/50 grams slivered almonds 2 free-range egg whites (2 1/4 ounces/60 grams) 1 3/4 ounces/45 grams icing sugar (confectioners&#39;), sifted if lumpy Couple of drops of lemon juice Pinch of salt Instructions: For the creme anglaise: Mix the sugar and egg yolks together in a bowl. Place the vanilla pod and seeds in a pan with the milk and pepper and bring to a boil. Remove the pod (you can rinse and dry it and use it for vanilla sugar). Then pour a little of the hot milk onto the egg yolk mixture, whisking continuously. Gradually whisk in the rest of the milk, and then pour the mix into a clean pan, set over a gentle heat and whisk constantly. Do not let the custard simmer at any point or it will split. After 5 minutes it will begin to thicken slightly and become the consistency of single cream (it will thicken more when it cools down). Transfer to a bowl and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours. For the praline: Line a baking tray with baking paper. Put the sugar and 1 fluid ounce/25 milliliters water into a large pan; heat gently until the sugar dissolves, and then increase the heat to high. When the mixture starts to bubble, add the almonds and continue to cook for 5 minutes, stirring continuously to prevent the almonds sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. Once the sugar and nuts have become a dark golden-brown caramel colour, pour onto the prepared tray and spread as thinly as possible with a palette knife (be quick as it sets fast). Set aside to cool. For the meringue islands: Put half the egg whites into a clean glass or metal bowl. Add the sugar, lemon juice and salt and whisk until snow white. Add the rest of the egg whites and continue whisking until the meringue forms stiff peaks when the whisk is removed. Gently drop 6 spoonfuls of meringue into a large pot of simmering water and simmer until they are slightly puffed up and just set, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place onto a sheet of baking paper until needed. To assemble, pour a ladleful of creme anglaise into each of 6 glasses and gently place a meringue in the centre. Snap the praline into small pieces and sprinkle on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 57011,&quot;Gluten-Free Blueberry Oat Pancakes with Lemon Maple Syrup 1 banana (1/2 cup), mashed 2 large eggs 1/3 cup gluten-free oats 1/2 cup fresh blueberries 1/2 cup maple syrup 1 teaspoon lemon zest (optional) Instructions: Combine banana, eggs and oats and let stand 10 minutes to thicken.

Bring the water to a simmer and remove from heat. While waiting for water to boil, the mozzarella curd needs to be shaved with a sharp knife into thin layers and set aside in a large bowl. When water is ready, ladle over the shaved curd, just enough to cover. Allow curd to warm before you begin forming your mozzarella. Using a wooden spoon, stir the mixture until the curd begins to pull (you should have a string like effect). Work quickly with the curd to achieve a consistent silken texture. Hold the cheese in the bowl with wooden spoon and pour off excess water. Take the cheese in your hands and begin to fold under itself creating a round shape of desired size. Pinch between your thumb and index finger, place fresh mozzarella in a bowl of cool water, continue this process until all the fresh mozzarella is formed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Prosecco]&quot; 57015,&quot;Aussie Shrimp on the Barbie With Mango Relish 20 large shrimp, peeled and deveined 2 minced garlic cloves 1/4 cup olive oil 2 Tbs. minced shallots 1 Tbs. chopped fresh parsley 1 Tbs. chopped fresh thyme leaves salt and pepper to taste<br> salt and pepper to taste 1 peeled, pitted and finely diced mango 2 Tbs. finely diced red onion 1 minced garlic clove 1 small Thai bird cl, seeded and minced 1 Tbs. sugar 2 Tbs. olive oil salt and pepper<br> salt and pepper Instructions: SHRIMP: Soak 8 (4) bamboo skewers in water for 10 minutes to prevent burning.

Serve with meringue or vanilla ice cream, if desired. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde]&quot; 57039,&quot;Naan 1 large egg, beaten 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 3 1/2 tablespoons milk 1/2 teaspoon sugar Kosher salt 4 1/2 to 5 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons oil, for the grill Melted butter, for brushing Instructions: Whisk the egg and baking powder in a large bowl. Add the milk, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 cup water. Stir until smooth. Add 4 1/2 cups of flour and mix slowly. Add additional flour if necessary. Knead the dough until smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Preheat a lightly oiled grill on high, about 500 degrees F. Divide the dough into 3 to 4 tennis-ball-sized pieces of dough. Roll the balls out into a thin circle and place on the preheated grill. Cook, turning once, until puffed and lightly browned, less than 1 minute. Continue the process until all of the naan is cooked, then brush with melted butter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57040,&quot;Stirato Bowl or container Spatula Plastic dough scraper Rectangular baking stone Rimmed baking sheet, for the oven Dowel or wooden spoon with a long handle or a chopstick Parchment paper, cut to the size of the baking stone Cutting board or second baking sheet, to move the loaves to the oven Cooling rack 500 grams unbleached all-purpose flour 375 grams water 80 degrees F (27 degrees C) 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast 1 tablespoon sourdough (optional) 10 grams sea salt Semolina flour, for dusting the loaves Instructions: Morning: Combine the flour, water, yeast, and sourdough, if using, in a bowl, mixing together with a spatula or your hand moistened with water for about 1 minute. After the ingredients are combined, make a small indentation on the top of the dough. Add the salt to the small well you&#39;ve just made in the dough, and about 1 tablespoon of water to cover it, but don&#39;t mix it in yet. Cover the bowl and let the dough sit for 20 minutes. Moisten your hands slightly and use the dough scraper to loosen the dough from the bowl. Rather than knead the dough, you&#39;re going to stretch and fold it in the bowl. Working from the edges of the dough, pull the dough out to stretch it and then fold it over toward the center. You can also squeeze the dough with your fingers to help incorporate the salt. If your hands begin to stick to the dough, moisten them again with water. Work around the dough and stretch and fold it 12 times. This action should take about 1 minute in total. Flip the dough over so the folds are underneath and the smooth side is on top. Cover the bowl and let the dough sit for another 20 minutes. Do the stretch-and-fold action for one more round. By now you&#39;ll notice that the salt is incorporated and the gluten offers noticeable tension. After folding about 12 times, turn the dough over again, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest for 20 minutes. Do the stretch-and-fold action 2 more times, at 20-minute intervals. In the final round, the dough should feel very elastic and should be glistening. If it isn&#39;t, add a few more stretch-and-fold actions but be careful not to rip the dough. Turn the dough over so the smooth side is face up. Cover the bowl and let it sit for 6 to 7 hours. The goal here is for the dough to rise until it has at least tripled in size, but has not collapsed in on itself. By the end of the rise, you might see big air bubbles on the top of the dough. Afternoon: Preheat the oven to 470 degrees F (245 degrees C), with your baking stone on the middle rack, 60 minutes before baking. In the lower part of the oven, or on the bottom, place a rimmed baking sheet that can hold half a cup of water. Place a piece of parchment paper roughly the size of your baking stone on an overturned and lightly floured baking sheet or a cutting board. Dust the parchment lightly with a 50/50 mixture of white flour and semolina flour or just white flour and set it aside. Flour a two-foot-square area of your counter generously with the flour/semolina mix or white flour. Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour. Using a plastic dough scraper, gently loosen the dough from the bowl and pour it out onto the counter, being careful to keep it in one piece. The outer, smooth surface will have landed on the floured surface, becoming the bottom of the dough. The top of the dough will be sticky. Dust it lightly with flour. Flour your hands and gently make a rectangle that&#39;s about 3/4 to 1 inch thick and about 10 by 16-inches, with the long side on the east-west axis, or parallel to the edge of the counter. Don&#39;t fuss over it to make it perfect or you&#39;ll compress the dough, losing the open structure of the air holes. Sprinkle a thick line of flour across the middle of the dough, moving east-west, marking where you will divide the rectangle in half lengthwise. Then sprinkle another two lines of flour through each of those portions, again moving east-west. You will cut the dough along the three lines, making four long loaves. Using a dowel, the wooden handle of a kitchen spoon, or a chopstick, press on the floured line so the pieces separate. A thick, dull tool works well because it joins the dough together at the seam. If the tool does not fully cut through the dough, use your dough scraper to finish cutting the pieces. Separate the pieces so they are not touching each other and cover them with a light towel. This second fermentation will take about 20 minutes. When the loaves are ready, they will be very light and spring back within one second when you press your finger very lightly into the dough. Baking: Pour 1/2 cup water into a measuring cup. Sprinkle the loaves lightly with semolina/flour. Loosen two loaves gently with the dough scraper. If you put enough flour on the counter it won&#39;t take much effort. Place your hands under the dough at either end of one loaf, then turn it upside down onto the floured parchment paper. To prevent the dough from sagging in the middle while you move the loaf, you can move your two hands closer together, slightly crimping the loaf lengthwise. The floured underside is now facing up. Do this with the second loaf, too. (If your baking stone is big enough, you might be able to place all four loaves on the parchment paper and bake them at once.) Now, here&#39;s the fun part. Lightly grab either end of the dough and gently stretch out the loaf to just under the size of your baking stone. If it resists, don&#39;t pull it-the dough will rip. Do the same with the second loaf. You can straighten out the edges by gently repositioning the loaf with your dough scraper, but don&#39;t fuss too much. Open the oven and slide the parchment paper off the cutting board or baking sheet and onto the baking stone. The loaves will bake on the parchment paper the entire time. Close the oven. Take the 1/2 cup water and pour it onto the baking sheet, being careful not to get burned by the steam. Shut the oven door. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes. Do not open the oven until at least 18 minutes into the bake. Bake until dark brown. Using a peel, or oven mitts, remove the loaves to a cooling rack, and let them stand for at least 20 minutes before eating. Repeat the baking method with the second two loaves. These loaves are best eaten within four hours. If you do not eat all the bread, the loaves can be frozen in a plastic bag. When you&#39;re ready to eat a loaf, remove it from the freezer until it defrosts and bake it for 5 minutes in a 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) oven to crisp up the crust. Once reheated, it will go stale relatively quickly. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Gavi]&quot; 57041,&quot;Almond-Crusted Chicken 1 cup whole unblanched almonds<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons Spanish pimenton or paprika<br> 2 large egg whites<br> 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 6 ounces each) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted<br> 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar<br> 5 cups mesclun salad greens Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Put the almonds in a mini-chopper or food processor and pulse until finely chopped.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil, plantain, and buttermilk. Add the liquid mixture to the dry mixture, along with the walnuts, and stir until batter is just mixed. There will be lumps in the batter. In another bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks and fold them into the batter. Heat a griddle over low heat and brush with some of the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil. Drop the batter onto the griddle by tablespoons and cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bubbles form on top and bottom is golden. Flip pancakes and cook for another minute or until undersides are golden. Using a spatula, transfer pancakes to a platter and keep warm until all of the pancakes are cooked, repeating the process with the remaining oil for brushing the grill. Serve pancakes with the Walnut Coconut Yogurt and maple syrup, if desired. In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, walnuts, coconut, and syrup, until combined.

Remove the tomatoes from the water and chop them. Slice the stems off of the mushrooms so they can lay completely flat. Slice each cap in half so you have 8 round mushroom slices. Carefully cut each slice into a heart shape with a cookie cutter. Top half of the heart shaped mushrooms with 1 tablespoon of tomatoes and 1 tablespoon of cheese. Top with remaining mushroom slices. Brush the top side of each \\sandwich\\ with olive oil. Preheat a large, nonstick skillet or grill pan. Place the mushroom sandwiches in the pan carefully, oil side down, and cook for 2 minutes.

Add the ghee and mix in with your fingers until the dough looks crumbly. Add ice-cold water, starting with 1/4 cup then adding 1 tablespoon at a time, until a soft but stiff dough forms. Knead the dough until it\\u2019s evenly combined (don\\u2019t over knead), 2 to 3 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes. For the filling: Coarsely crush the peas in a food processor. Heat the ghee in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds and let sizzle until slightly darker, about 30 seconds. Add the green chiles, ginger and asafoetida, if using, and cook, stirring often, until the raw aroma of the ginger dissipates, 30 to 45 seconds. Add the crushed peas and sugar and cook until the mixture dries out a little, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the turmeric, red cl powder, coriander, raw mango powder, garam masala and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and cook until the spices are toasted and the raw smell dissipates, about 2 minutes. Add the chickpea flour and cook until toasted, about 3 minutes. Adjust salt to taste, raw mango powder for additional tang and red cl powder for spice. Transfer to a bowl to cool. To assemble and fry: Pour vegetable oil into a large Dutch oven or wide heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of about 3 inches. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted in the oil registers 340 degrees F. While the oil is heating, divide the dough into 10 balls. A kitchen scale isn\\u2019t necessary but is helpful in dividing. Divide the green pea mixture into 10 tight balls. Flatten the dough balls with your hand or a rolling pin into 3- to 3 1/2-inch rounds. Try to keep the edges thinner. Dust the worksurface lightly with flour if the dough begins to stick. Place a flattened dough round in the palm of your hand and make a bowl. Put a green pea ball in the center. Fold the dough edges over the stuffing, pleating them as they come together, and seal tightly. Flatten the ball with the palm of your hand or a rolling pin to about 3 inches in diameter; cover with a damp cloth. Repeat with the remaining dough and green pea balls and keep them covered with a damp cloth. Double-check that the temperature of the oil is 340 degrees F. Gently slip in 3 to 5 patties and fry, moving them around occasionally so they cook evenly and flipping them halfway, until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes on each side. Don\\u2019t overcrowd the pot; you need to allow enough space for the kachoris to puff up while frying. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Repeat with the remaining patties. The kachoris can be served with any chutney such as cilantro-mint chutney, tamarind chutney or cilantro-pea chutney. Save leftover kachoris in an airtight box after they have come to room temperature; otherwise, they will become soggy. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache Blanc, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 57045,&quot;Cream Tacos: Tacos de Crema 1 1/2 pounds whole, unhusked tomatillos 3 garlic cloves 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 to 2 serrano chiles 1/4 cup olive oil, divided 1 pound Mexican sausage (recommended: longaniza or chorizo), minced 12 corn tortillas 1 white onion, minced 1/4 cup minced cilantro leaves 1 cup sour cream 4 poblano or Anaheim chiles, roasted, sweated, peeled, seeded, de-veined, and cut into strips 12 cilantro sprigs, washed and dried Instructions: Blanch the tomatillos in 1 quart boiling water for 3 minutes.

Whisk in the champagne. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water. (The pot should be sitting over, not in the water.) Whisk vigorously until thick, about 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pot and place it in a bowl of ice water. Cool until room temperature, stirring occasionally. Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Fold the cream into the cooled champagne mixture. Spray a loaf pan with nonstick spray. (I like to use a pan approximately 3 1/2 by 11 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches but a 9-inch square pan will work.) Line the pan with plastic wrap, making sure to press the plastic wrap into the corners of the pan. (The nonstick spray helps the plastic wrap stick to the pan. The plastic wrap makes the terrine easier to unmold.) Gently spread half of the champagne cream into the loaf pan. Place the pan in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Refrigerate the remaining champagne cream. Combine the water and the remaining 3/4 cup sugar in a small sauce pot. Bring the sugar and water to a boil over high heat and boil for 1 minute until the sugar is dissolved. Cool the mixture to at least room temperature. (It can be made several days in advance and refrigerated.) Peel and pit the 2 pounds of peaches. Puree them in a food processor. Strain the puree through a medium holed sieve. There should be 3 cups of peach puree. Stir 1/2 cup of the sugar syrup into the peach puree. Add the remaining pinch salt and the lemon juice. Taste the peach puree. If it is not sweet enough add a little more sugar syrup. (The amount of sugar necessary will depend on the natural sweetness of the peaches. Extra sugar syrup can be used to sweeten ice tea.) Freeze the peach puree in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. When the peach puree is frozen, spread it evenly into the loaf pan over the frozen champagne cream. Let the puree become firm again in the freezer, then carefully spread the remaining champagne cream on top. Freeze the semifreddo for several hours until hard. It can be made several days in advance. Peel the remaining peaches. Cut them in half and remove the pits. Cut in 1/2 inch pieces. Taste the peaches. If they are not very sweet, stir in a little granulated sugar. Often peaches are naturally sweet enough and do not need additional sugar. To unmold, invert the loaf pan onto a cutting board. Run a wet hot towel over the pan. Remove the pan. Carefully peel off the plastic wrap. Slice the semifreddo and place on a plate. Serve with some of the fresh peaches. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57053,&quot;Tip Top Salad 4 heads iceberg lettuce (1 per person) 2 cups diced roast turkey breast (about ? small breast) 1 cup sweetened dried cranberries 1 cup diced celery 1/2 green apple cored (but not peeled) and diced 1 cup crumbled blue cheese Candied Walnuts, recipe below 1 cup crumbled blue cheese 1 cup mayonnaise<br> 1 cup sour cream<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 2 teaspoons coarse black pepper 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br> 1 cup walnuts 2 tablespoons sugar Instructions: Tip Top Dressing: To make the &#39;lettuce bowls&#39;: Cut a slice from the bottom of each iceberg head so the lettuces all have a flat, stable base.

Pull the leaves off the rosemary and thyme sprigs. Throw the crushed peppercorns into a bowl with the salt and herb leaves and add the minced garlic. Use your fingers to toss it all together, then set it aside. Place the beef, fat-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Drizzle the olive oil all over the surface and rub it in with your hands. Sprinkle the peppercorn-herb-salt mixture all over the surface of the beef, pressing it lightly with your hands. Roast the beef 45 minutes for the first stage. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F and insert a meat thermometer sideways into the roast. Roast the beef an additional 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the thermometer registers 120 degrees F to 135 degrees F in the center for medium rare. (The meat will continue to cook for a bit after you remove it from the oven.) Remove the beef from the rack and let it rest about 15 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. When you&#39;re ready to serve, carve it into slices of your preferred width. Make the batter before removing the prime rib from the oven: Combine the eggs and half-and-half in a bowl and whisk until they&#39;re totally combined. Throw the flour and 2 teaspoons salt into a sifter and sift them straight into the bowl. Whisk until it&#39;s nice and smooth, then refrigerate until the prime rib is ready. After the beef is removed from the pan, increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Use a slotted spoon to remove the peppercorns, herbs and excess salt from the drippings. Pour the remaining drippings into a separate container. They should be speckled and lovely! Pour a small amount (about 1/2 teaspoon or so) of the drippings into each cup of a standard muffin pan and place the pan in the hot oven for a couple of minutes, or until just before the drippings begin to smoke. Carefully remove the pan from the oven and immediately fill the muffin cups about 1/2 to 2/3 full. Bake 13 to 14 minutes, or until they&#39;ve \\popped\\ about as much as they can pop. Serve them in a basket with a pretty napkin right next to the prime rib. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Barolo]&quot; 57081,&quot;Bulgogi-Inspired Beef Quesadillas 1 red onion, thinly sliced 1 cup white vinegar<br> 1/4 cup sugar<br> 1/4 cup kosher salt 1 1/4 cups soy sauce<br> 1/2 cup gochujang<br> 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sesame oil<br> 1/4 cup sesame seeds<br> 1/4 cup white vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons mirin 1 Asian pear, coarsely chopped<br> 2 pounds ground beef<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 12 slices American cheese<br> Six 10-inch flour tortillas<br> 1/2 head iceberg lettuce, shredded<br> Sesame seeds, for sprinkling Instructions: For the pickled onions: Combine the onions, vinegar, sugar and salt to in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.

Set aside and cool to warm. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit on the milk for 1 minute. Add 8 cups of the flour. Stir until just combined, and then cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside in a relatively warm place for 1 hour. After 1 hour, remove the towel and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt and the remaining 1 cup flour. Stir thoroughly to combine. Use the dough right away, or place in a mixing bowl and refrigerate for up to 3 days, punching down the dough if it rises to the top of the bowl. (The dough is easier to work with if it&#39;s been chilled for at least an hour or so beforehand.) To assemble the rolls, remove half of the dough from the pan. On a floured baking surface, roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 30 by 10 inches. The dough should be rolled very thin. For the filling: Pour 3/4 to 1 cup of the melted butter over the surface of the dough. Use your fingers to spread the butter evenly. Generously sprinkle half of the ground cinnamon and 1 cup of the granulated sugar over the butter. Don&#39;t be afraid to drizzle on more butter or more sugar! Gooey is the goal.<br> Now, beginning at the end farthest from you, roll the rectangle tightly towards you. Use both hands and work slowly, being careful to keep the roll tight. Don&#39;t worry if the filling oozes as you work; that just means the rolls are going to be divine. When you reach the end, pinch the seam together and flip the roll so that the seam is face down. When you&#39;re finished, you&#39;ll wind up with one long buttery, cinnamony, sugary, gooey log. Slip a cutting board underneath the roll and, with a sharp knife, make 1/2-inch slices. One \\log\\ will produce 20 to 25 rolls. Pour a couple of teaspoons of melted butter into disposable foil cake pans and swirl to coat. Place the sliced rolls in the pans, being careful not to overcrowd. (Each pan will hold 7 to 9 rolls.) Repeat the rolling/sugar/butter process with the other half of the dough and more pans.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cover all the pans with a kitchen towel and set aside to rise on the countertop for at least 20 minutes before baking. Remove the towel and bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Don&#39;t allow the rolls to become overly brown. While the rolls are baking, make the maple icing: In a large bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, butter, coffee and salt. Splash in the maple flavoring. Whisk until very smooth. Taste and add more maple, sugar, butter or other ingredients as needed until the icing reaches the desired consistency. The icing should be somewhat thick but still very pourable.<br> Remove the pans from the oven. Immediately drizzle the icing over the top. Be sure to get it all around the edges and over the top. As they sit, the rolls will absorb some of the icing&#39;s moisture and flavor. They only get better with time... not that they last for more than a few seconds. Make them for a friend today! It&#39;ll seal the relationship for life. I promise. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57101,&quot;Orange Sling 1 1/2 ounces orange vodka (recommended: Grey Goose) 1/2-ounce Danish cherry liqueur (recommended: Cherry Heering) 1/4 cup ginger liqueur (recommended: Canton) 1/2-ounce freshly squeezed lime juice 2 ounces pineapple juice 1 dash bitters 1/4-ounce grenadine Orange twists, for garnish Instructions: In a cocktail shaker add all of the ingredients, except the grenadine.

Butter a 9-inch springform pan, then line the bottom and sides with parchment paper and butter the paper. Wrap the outside of the pan with foil. Make the praline layer: Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the brown sugar, corn syrup, kosher salt and vanilla. Spread in the prepared pan and scatter the pecans on top; set aside. Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking soda, nutmeg and fine salt in a large bowl. Whisk the buttermilk and bourbon in another bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, 10 minutes. With the mixer on low, beat in the eggs, one at a time. Add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, starting and ending with flour. Fold in the pecans. Pour the batter into the pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a rack, 30 minutes.

Melt butter in a saucepan with the milk. Let cool slightly before adding to egg mixture. In a separate mixing bowl, sift all the dry ingredients together. Add the eggs to this mixture, just to moisten. Do not over mix. Crumble the defrosted poi into the mix, to taste. The poi gets soft as the batter cooks, so too much will result in a \\gooey\\ pancake. Make sure to add the poi just before you pour the pancakes. This will result in little \\pudding pockets\\ in the cake. Heat the griddle, then spoon mixture onto griddle, and cook until bubbles form around the edges. Turn the cakes and cook for another 25 seconds or until the bottom is slightly browned. Top with coconut syrup. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 57108,&quot;Fresh Strawberry Milkshakes 1/2 pound fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced, plus whole strawberries, for garnish 2 heaping tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 pint vanilla ice cream 1/2 cup milk Instructions: In a mixing bowl combine the sliced strawberries, sugar and vanilla extract and stir to combine well. Set aside and allow to macerate for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour. In a large mixer, place the strawberries, ice cream, and milk. Blend until smooth.

Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Moscato, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 57109,&quot;Caramelized Onion and Potato Knishes 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 6 tablespoons schmaltz, melted and cooled, or neutral oil, such as vegetable oil (see Cook&#39;s Note) 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar 2 tablespoons schmaltz or neutral oil, such as vegetable oil (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 large yellow onions, cut into a medium dice Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon chopped thyme leaves (from about 12 sprigs) 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, cut into medium chunks 5 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/3 cup sour cream, plus more for serving 1/4 cup dill fronds, chopped 2 tablespoons minced chives (from 4 to 6 chives) Nonstick cooking spray 1 large egg Instructions: For the pastry: Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the schmaltz, vinegar and 1/2 cup water and stir into a shaggy ball with a spoon or large rubber spatula. (It&#39;s OK if some of the flour remains dry at the bottom of the bowl; the dough will come together during kneading.) Attach the dough hook to the mixer and knead on medium speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Dump out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it into a uniform ball, about 30 seconds. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes while making the filling. (The dough can be made and refrigerated up to 1 day ahead.) For the filling: Heat the schmaltz over medium-high heat in a medium heavy-bottom pot. Add the onions and 2 teaspoons salt and stir until coated. Cover and cook the onions, stirring occasionally, until they are translucent and begin to brown at the edges, about 15 minutes. Continue to cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally at first and then more frequently as the onions become sticky, soft and dark golden brown, about 30 minutes. Add the thyme and garlic and cook, stirring and scraping up all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until the mixture is very fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and set aside. Cover the potatoes with cold water in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook until the potatoes until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the potatoes and then return them to the pot. Cook the drained potatoes over low heat, shaking the pot to prevent sticking, until the potatoes are dry, about 1 minute. Combine the potatoes, caramelized onion mixture, cream cheese, sour cream, dill and chives in a large mixing bowl. Use a potato masher to mash the mixture together until everything is evenly combined. Season generously with salt and black pepper. Set aside to cool to room temperature. (The filling can be made and refrigerated in an airtight container up to 1 day ahead.) To form the knishes: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl and set aside. Divide the dough in half. Use your hands to roll 1 of the dough halves into a 6-inch-long log on a lightly floured surface, then use a rolling pin to roll the log out into a 16-by-12-inch rectangle. The dough will be very thin. Square off the sides, if necessary to prevent the end pieces from being too thick and uneven. Position the dough so that the long edges are parallel with the edge of the counter. Shape half of the filling into a 2-by-16-inch log. Transfer the filling on top of the dough, 1 inch in from the bottom edge. Gently stretch the dough up and around the filling. (It&#39;s ok if the dough tears a little as at this stage as it will be hidden as the dough is rolled up.) Then continue rolling up the filling in the dough into a long log. Score the log in 2-inch intervals and then cut the log into 8 segments.<br> Working with one segment at a time, turn the piece so one of the cut side is up and pinch and smooth the top until sealed. Turn over so the other cut side is facing up, and pinch and smooth that side until sealed as well. Place the formed knish, with a sealed side down, on one of the prepared baking sheets and then gently press down to flatten it slightly. Repeat the process with the remaining segments, pastry and filling until all the knishes have been formed (see Cook&#39;s Note).<br> Arrange the knishes about 1 inch apart on the baking sheets. Lightly brush the tops and sides with the reserved egg wash. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the knishes are golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes before serving.<br> The knishes can be served hot, warm, or at room temperature with sour cream.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57110,&quot;Creamy Corn and Pepper Relish 6 cobs fresh corn, shucked or (28-ounce) can corn 1 red pepper 1 large poblano pepper (poblanos are called pasillas in California and the Southwest) 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 medium onion, diced 1 yellow pepper, diced 1 orange pepper, diced 4 Roma tomatoes, diced 1 to 2 ounces cream cheese 1/4 cup milk or cream Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, chopped 1 bunch fresh chives, chopped Instructions: Heat grill to medium.

Stir in the tomato paste. Add tomatoes with their juices, wine, fish stock and bay leaf. Cover and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until the flavors blend, about 30 minutes. Add the clams and mussels to the cooking liquid. Cover and cook until the clams and mussels begin to open, about 5 minutes. Add the shrimp and fish. Simmer gently until the fish and shrimp are just cooked through, and the clams are completely open, stirring gently, about 5 minutes longer (discard any clams and mussels that do not open). Remove bay leaf. Season the soup, to taste, with more salt and red pepper flakes.

Cook the garlic, stirring occasionally at first and more often as it colors, until golden brown, about 7 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-low, add the onions and a large pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and red pepper flakes, and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, bay leaves, basil sprig, thyme and 1 teaspoon salt, raise the heat to medium and bring the sauce to a lively simmer. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until quite thick (if you draw a spoon through the sauce, you&#39;ll see the bottom of the pot for a few seconds before the sauce fills back in), about 30 minutes. As the sauce thickens, turn the heat down a bit so the bottom doesn&#39;t scorch. Stir in the chopped basil. Let cool to room temperature before assembling the lasagna. (Makes 1 quart.) To assemble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Squeeze the spinach in your hands to remove as much liquid as possible. Put it in a large bowl, and stir in the ricotta, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan, the egg, 1 teaspoon salt and the nutmeg. Spread 3/4 cup of the tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Lay 3 lasagna noodles across the sauce (they won&#39;t touch). Spread 3/4 cup tomato sauce on top. Dollop 1/3 of the ricotta mixture (about 1 cup) across the sauce, and use the back of a spoon to spread it (it will smush into the tomato sauce, which is fine). Scatter 1 cup of the mozzarella on top. Repeat the layering 2 more times. Top with the last 3 noodles, spread the last 3/4 cup tomato sauce over them and scatter the remaining 1 cup mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan over the top. Spray a large piece of foil with cooking spray, and cover the baking dish. Bake until the noodles are soft and the cheese has melted, about 40 minutes. Remove the foil, and continue to bake until the cheese is bubbling and the lasagna is slightly browned around the edges, about 15 minutes more. Let rest 10 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 57116,&quot;Shrimp Tempura with Soy Sake Dipping Sauce 1 cup soy sauce 1/4 cup sake 1 tablespoon hot chili sauce (recommended: Srirachi Hot Chili Sauce) 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined 1 cup rice flour, plus 1 cup for dusting 1 cup cold seltzer water 1 egg yolk 1 tablespoon sesame oil, optional Vegetable oil, for frying Kosher salt Instructions: Make the dipping sauce: Combine all ingredients in a bowl.

This leaves the head, legs and skin of the body. You can ask your butcher to do this. Quarter the pork butts. Chop all seasonings to the texture of coarse ground pepper. Pour all seasoning in a large mixing bowl with garlic and olive oil. Mix until texture is similar to wallpaper paste. Poke holes in the pork butt with a knife. Open the holes with your fingers and fill with seasoning. Take the remainder of the seasoning and coat the inside of the pig. Fill the gut of the pig with the pork butts and sew the stomach of the pig as you go along using steel wire and needle nosed pliers. Once the pig is stuffed, take stainless steel chicken wire and wrap the pig (this is a substitute for the ribcage) to hold it together while cooking. Fill a large grill with wood chips and heat to 425 to 450 degrees F. After the grill is heated, place 2 large pieces of wet oak on the fire. Place the pig on a large grill (use wood chips for your charcoal-- it is a nice hot steady temperature which lasts along time). BBQ for approximately 6 to 8 hours, maintaining a grill temperature of 425 to 450 degrees F. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah]&quot; 57122,&quot;Bengal Tiger Pizza 20 rounded cups high-gluten flour 5 ounces slow-rise yeast 1-ounce salt 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil 8 ounces fresh basil, leaves only 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, leaves only 4 cloves garlic Salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil, for blending About 2 cups shredded mozzarella pizza cheese About 2 cups shredded provolone pizza cheese 2 cups cooked tandoori chicken 1 cup real crabmeat One 4-inch piece hearts of palm, thinly sliced 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves Instructions: For the dough: Mix the flour, yeast, salt and 2 cups of body temperature water until well combined, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the Olive Oil and roll it into the dough. Place the dough in a pot, cover loosely with plastic and refrigerate for 8 hours. Remove the dough from the pot and roll into 18-ounce balls, place on a tray and let rise 6 to 8 more hours. For the green sauce: Blend the basil, cilantro, garlic, salt and pepper in a blender, slowly adding enough Olive Oil so the consistency becomes slightly thinner than peanut butter. For the pizza: Preheat the oven to 550 degrees F. Roll and toss 1 ball of dough until it is 18-to-20 inches around. Reserve the remaining dough for another use or for other pizzas. Place the round on a pizza pan and cover with the green sauce; keep any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Top with a blend of mozzarella and provolone pizza cheese.

Add the butter and pulse just until it resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons ice water. With the processor running, drizzle in the yolk mixture. The dough should just come together. If it looks dry add more water, up to 4 tablespoons. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until it comes together; it will be stiffer than a regular pie crust because of the cornmeal. Divide into four pieces, press into discs, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the filling: Toss the potatoes, yam, parsnips, celery and mushrooms with 4 tablespoons oil. Season with salt and pepper and spread evenly on a baking sheet. Roast, tossing once halfway through, until golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. You don&#39;t want to cook these all the way though since they will cook more in the pot pie. (They should be al dente, but starting to get some color.) Combine the flour and remaining 4 tablespoons oil in a saucepan over medium heat and cook until smooth and bubbly like pancake batter, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the mushroom broth. Simmer until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season to taste and remove from the heat. Add the roasted veggies to the mushroom broth along with the peas, thyme, rosemary and sherry vinegar. Divide the filling among four 8-ounce ramekins. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll each into a 5-inch disc. Wet the rim each ramekin and lay a crust over the top. Poke each 5 or 6 times with a fork and place in the oven.

Grill the corn until lightly charred on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove the kernels from the cobs and reserve the cobs. Break the reserved corn cobs in half and place them in a large pot with the stock. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and then turn off the heat and steep the cobs in the stock for 30 minutes. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Add the fennel and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Remove the fennel from the pan and set aside. Add another 2 tablespoons of the butter to the pan and cook the corn kernels until soft and velvety, 10 to 15 minutes. Season the corn with salt and pepper, and set it aside. Pass the corn stock through a strainer into a saucepan and discard the cobs. Keep warm over low heat. Heat the oil in a high-sided skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and saute, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until it no longer appears chalky on the outside, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the wine and simmer, stirring frequently, until absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups of the corn stock, stirring frequently until the liquid is absorbed, about 7 minutes. Add another 1 1/2 cups of stock and simmer, stirring frequently, until the liquid is mostly absorbed and the rice appears fluffy, but is still slightly firm. If the rice is still hard or chewy, add the remaining stock, 1 cup at a time, and keep stirring until the proper doneness is reached. The total cooking time should be 20 to 25 minutes. You might not use all 6 cups of stock, but any remaining stock can be refrigerated and used for another dish. Stir in the reserved fennel and corn kernels, the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.

Will hold for 5 days under refrigeration.; In a large skillet melt the 4 ounces of butter, turn up the heat to full and quickly sear the fish (in batches so it doesn&#39;t leach). Add the flour and allow to cook out for 2 minutes, next add the olives, wine, and 1 cup whipping cream. Bring to a simmer, correct the seasoning and allow to cool. Lightly brush one sheet of phyllo with some melted butter. Place another sheet on top of the first and also brush that one with melted butter. Cover remaining sheets and set aside. Cut the 2 layered sheets crosswise into 3 equal strips. Place one rounded tablespoon of filling about 1-inch from the end of each strip. Starting at the edge, bring up the phyllo and roll it over the top of the filling, roll once and then tuck the ends in as you would an eggroll, and continue to roll the strudel until you reach the end of the dough. With end underneath, brush top with melted butter and place on parchment lined sheet pan. Repeat this until you have used all the phyllo. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine the 2 cups heavy cream, lemon juice, and saffron in a non-reactive bowl, correct seasoning and allow to stand (this will allow the acid time to acidulate the cream and thus thicken slightly to yield a sauce consistency). Strudels will hold 5 days under refrigeration, or can be frozen for up to 4 weeks. Acidulated cream will also hold up to 5 days under refrigeration. Place on a sizzle plate (2 per order) and bake for 8 to 10 minutes until hot inside and golden brown outside.

In a large saute pan, heat the 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil and sear the pork loin on all sides. Transfer pork to a roasting pan and rub with roasted garlic pepper seasoning. Slowly roast in the oven until fork tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow pork loin to rest for 8 to 10 minutes before slicing. While the pork is in the oven, begin the marmalade. In a hot skillet, heat the onions, red peppers and orange peppers (heat them dry with no oil) for about 3 minutes. The idea is to remove the liquid from the onions, by \\sweating them down.\\ Add the honey, vinegar, wine, hot sauce and cranberry sauce, and stir well. Reduce over medium-low heat until there is no liquid left in the pan and marmalade mixture is tacky. To make the garlic bread, melt the butter in the extra-virgin olive oil over low heat. Add garlic and gently cook until it begins to soften. Assemble slices of bread on a baking sheet and spoon even amounts of the garlic-oil-butter mixture on each slice. After you have removed the pork from the oven to rest, toast the garlic bread briefly in the oven. Slice down the pork tenderloin, and assemble the appetizer by layering a medallion of pork and a small amount of the marmalade on each piece of garlic toast. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Gavi]&quot; 57155,&quot;Meat-Stuffed Grape Leaves with Yogurt Sauce (Adapted from Nancy Harmon Jenkins the Mediterranean Diet Cookbook) 1 jar grape leaves (36 leaves) 1/2 cup finely-minced onion 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 pound lean ground lamb 1 cup long-grain rice 1 cup chopped Italian plum tomatoes 2 cups beef stock 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1 tablespoon minced dill 1 tablespoon minced mint 1 tablespoon minced parsley Salt and freshly-ground black pepper 1/4 cup lemon juice Yogurt Sauce (see next recipe) Instructions: In a large saucepan of boiling water scald 36 grape leaves in batches.

Cook, stirring with a slotted spoon so the garlic slices gently cook and become crispy, and remove them as they brown. Drain on a kitchen towel and sprinkle with salt. Heat a couple of spoonfuls of the oil from the garlic in a large skillet over medium heat and add the pancetta. Cook until the pancetta becomes crispy, then remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the spinach to the same skillet and season with salt. Toss lightly so the spinach gets coated with the oil and wilts slightly, about 1 minute. (The spinach should only be partially wilted and still appear somewhat raw.) Pour off any water that might accumulate in the bottom of the skillet and stir in the vinegar and pancetta. Transfer to a serving bowl and top with the garlic chips. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 57161,&quot;Homemade Breakfast Sausage Nonstick cooking spray 2 teaspoons brown sugar<br> 2 teaspoons poultry seasoning<br> 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon anise seed<br> 1 pound ground pork<br> Instructions: Preheat a cast-iron griddle pan over medium-high heat and spray with cooking spray.

Using an electric whisk, start whisking the yolks and sugar over the simmering water. The mixture should become pale and thick like super-aerated double cream, and by the end it should have at least tripled in volume and be exuberantly frothy. This could take up to 15 minutes. Continue whisking as you slowly pour in the Prosecco; you should then have a soft, billowing mass. Remove the bowl from its pan of simmering water, and place on a cold surface or stand it in a pan of cold water, and whisk until cool. Then whisk the whipping cream and fold into the egg mixture. Pour into 2 glasses, garnish with chocolate shavings, if using, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Vin Santo, Riesling]&quot; 57169,&quot;Nutty Brittle Aluminum foil Non-stick cooking spray 24 soft caramel candies, unwrapped 3/4 cup toffee peanuts Instructions: Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.

Line a baking sheet with foil.<br> Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions in a large pot of boiling salted water. Drain, rinse, and transfer the spaghetti to the baking dish.<br> Meanwhile, turn on the broiler and place a rack 6 inches away from the heating element. Place the grape tomatoes and jalapenos on the prepared baking sheet, skin side up, along with the whole garlic cloves and onion. Broil, for 5 to 7 minutes, until the tomatoes, jalapenos, garlic, and onion are softened and have begun to blacken. Remove from the oven, and when cool enough to handle, dice the tomatoes, jalapenos, garlic, and onion.<br> Turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees F.<br> To make the sauce for the spaghetti, in a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour until well combined and slightly browned, about 30 seconds. Slowly pour in the milk and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens just a bit, 3 to 5 minutes. (You want it to coat the back of your spoon, but not be too thick, like custard. If it gets too thick, you can slowly add more milk, about a teaspoon at a time.)<br> Once the sauce thickens, immediately turn off the heat and slowly stir in half of the cheeses, about 1/4 cup at a time, until melted and incorporated into the sauce.

Pulse for a few seconds to combine. Add the butter and pulse 10 to 12 times, until the butter is in small bits the size of peas. With the motor running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse just until the dough starts to come together. Dump onto a floured board and knead quickly into a ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Roll the dough slightly larger than 10 x 14 inches. Using a ruler and a small knife, trim the edges. Place the dough on the prepared sheet pan and refrigerate while you prepare the apples. Peel the apples and cut them in half through the stem. Remove the stems and cores with a sharp knife and a melon baller. Slice the apples crosswise in 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place overlapping slices of apples diagonally down the middle of the tart and continue making diagonal rows on both sides of the first row until the pastry is covered with apple slices. (I tend not to use the apple ends in order to make the arrangement beautiful.) Sprinkle with the full 1/2 cup sugar and dot with the butter. Bake 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the pastry is browned and the edges of the apples start to brown. Rotate the pan once during cooking. If the pastry puffs up in one area, cut a little slit with a knife to let the air out. Don&#39;t worry! The apple juices will burn in the pan but the tart will be fine! When the tart&#39;s done, heat the apricot jelly together with the Calvados and brush the apples and the pastry completely with the jelly mixture. Loosen the tart with a metal spatula so it doesn&#39;t stick to the paper.

Use the back of the knife to gently scrape the caviar out of the bean and into a large saucepan. Add the vanilla bean, half-and-half and sugar and heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and set aside. Whisk the egg yolks in a mixing bowl until pale yellow and slightly thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Temper the yolks by slowly drizzling a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture into the bowl, whisking the whole time. Repeat with a second ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture, again whisking the whole time. Pour the tempered yolks back into the saucepan with the remaining half-and-half mixture and cook over low heat, stirring gently with a wooden spoon, until it&#39;s thick enough to coat the back of the spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a clean bowl. Pour the custard through the strainer into the bowl. Add the heavy cream to the strained mixture and stir everything together. Refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours. Pour the chilled mix into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. Transfer to a freezer-safe container and place in the freezer until frozen firm, at least 6 hours (but overnight is best for nice scoopable ice cream).

With a sharp French knife or boning knife, score the skin side of the fish in a oneinch diagonal pattern. The best equipment for steaming this fish is a wok and a large bamboo steamer. Shallow, heat resilient ceramic bowls that fit inside the steamer are perfect. You may have to steam the fish in waves, or you can stack an additional steamer onto the original to create a layered steamer tower. If you do not have heat resistant bowls to serve the fish in, any shallow stainless pan will work and then you just will have to transfer the fish into serving bowls. Peel the shrimp, leaving heads intact. Slice shrimp down the middle, beginning at the base of the head and continuing to the beginning of the tail. Remove the vein. Hold the shrimp by the tail and then pull the tail through the slit, going under so the tail stands upright. For steaming in individual bowls: Place one piece of lightly salted fish in the center of the bowl. Combine in a stainless steel bowl, 3 to 4 cups of water, julienned ginger, tomato sections, cup of cilantro sprigs, and 4 to 5 umeboshi plums, seeds removed and lightly mashed between your fingers. In each bowl, place two shrimp and ladle two pieces of tomato and about 6 to 8 cups of the liquid around the fish, making sure to get equal amounts of ginger and plum in the bowl. Sprinkle cracked white pepper on top of the fish. While you are preparing the bowls, set up wok with water and steamer(s). Turn on heat, bringing it up to full steam. Carefully place bowl(s) in steamer, then cover and cook till fish is done. The cooking time will vary according to the thickness of the fish and the intensity of the steam. An average piece of bass, approximately one inch thick, will cook in approximately six to seven minutes. Cautiously remove bowl(s) and garnish with fresh cilantro sprigs. Serve with ample steamed rice. If you have a rice steamer, proceed as you would to steam any rice. A banana leaf placed in the steamer will impart a wonderfully fragrant perfume. To cook jasmine rice: Bring four cups water to a boil. Add rice, salt and oil and boil hard until you see big rounds of boiling rice, approximately three to four minutes. Reduce heat to simmer, cover pot and cook for 15 minutes. Check rice with a fork, taste. If it is a little al dente, leave covered on stove with the heat off for three to four more minutes. Serve in individual bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 57187,&quot;Telban&#39;s Family Cracker Stuffing 4 sleeves saltine crackers 2 stalks celery 1 cup butter 1 medium onion 4 eggs 1/2 cup milk Instructions: With crackers still in their sleeves, crush up with your hands (easier to crush this way, and it keeps your hands cleaner). Place crushed crackers in large bowl. In a frying pan, saute the butter and onion until the onion are tender, about 5 minutes. Chop celery into small pieces and add to the crackers. Add cooked onions and butter to the crackers; mix well. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well. Add milk a little at a time (you might not use all of the milk), until the cracker mix is moistened. Cracker mix should form a ball which you can hold in your hand. Use to stuff a 12-pound turkey. When stuffing a turkey this does not expand, so you want to pack it in tight. When the turkey is ready, you pull out the stuffing in one big chunk and slice it. Great on a turkey sandwich the next day! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57188,&quot;Stuffed Jalapeno Pepper Monkey Bread 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted Two 16-ounce tubes refrigerated biscuit dough<br> 2 teaspoons paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt<br> One 18-ounce box frozen jalapeno poppers 4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, grated (about 1 cup)<br> 1/4 cup ranch dressing<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush a 10-inch nonstick bundt pan with butter to lightly coat, then put the remaining butter in a medium bowl. Cut the biscuits into quarters. Combine the paprika and garlic salt in a large bowl.<br> Working in batches, toss the biscuit pieces in the butter, then transfer them with a slotted spoon to the bowl with the spices; do not stir. When all of the biscuit pieces have been added to the spice mixture, stir gently until evenly coated.<br> Build a ring of alternating biscuit pieces and jalapeno poppers in the bottom of the prepared bundt pan. Top the first layer with half of the remaining biscuit pieces and jalapeno poppers, pressing down gently so they stick together. Sprinkle the Monterey Jack in a ring over the top, making sure that none of it hits the sides or middle of the pan. Scatter the remaining dough pieces and jalapeno poppers over the top. Brush with any remaining butter.<br> Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the top is a deep golden brown and the dough is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then use an offset spatula to gently loosen any cheese that might have baked onto the sides of the pan. Flip out the monkey bread onto a serving platter.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Beat together the egg whites and salt, in a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and continue to beat until soft peaks form. While beating, add the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form.<br> Put the pastry bag in a large and tall deli or plastic container and fold the top over the container so you can see clearly into the bag and it stands upright. Dip the paintbrush or wooden skewer in to the red food coloring. Starting from the bottom of the bag, brush a thin stroke of food coloring from the tip to the top of the bag. Repeat on the opposite side of the bag with the blue food coloring. Fill the bag with the meringue. Try to spoon it directly into the center so as not to disturb the food coloring. Snip the bottom of the bag with scissors so you have a 3/4- to 1-inch opening. Pipe 1-inch-diameter mounds of meringue spaced 1-inch apart onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the meringues are no longer glossy and feel light and dry when picked up, about 1 hour. Open the oven for a few minutes, then turn it off and shut the door. Leave the meringues in the oven until they are completely dry inside, about 2 hours. The meringues can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.<br> To decorate them, combine the white chocolate chips and coconut oil and in a large microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted. Carefully dip the bottom of each meringue into the melted white chocolate, letting any excess drip off.

Remove from the heat and sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of granulated sugar over top. Set aside undisturbed until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the salt, 2 3/4 cups flour and remaining granulated sugar in a large bowl. Generously butter a 10-inch springform pan. Combine the melted butter, vanilla and egg yolk in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low until combined. Add the yeast mixture and continue to mix on low until combined. Add the flour mixture and mix on low until a thick and slightly sticky dough forms. Once the dough comes together, switch to the dough hook and knead on medium speed, adding up to 1/4 cup more flour if needed, to make a soft, smooth ball that sticks to the hook, 3 to 4 minutes. Coat a large bowl generously with cooking spray. Add the dough, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the dough is doubled in size, about 1 hour. For the filling: Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and cook, swirling, until melted. Add the diced apples and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the apple butter. Transfer to a medium bowl to cool completely. When the dough is ready, punch it down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead a few times, then roll into a rectangle 12 inches by 18 inches, keeping the longer side closest to you. Spread the cooled apple filling evenly all over the dough. Sprinkle with the granulated sugar. Use a pizza cutter to cut the dough crosswise into 1-inch strips. Starting on the left side, roll 1 strip up jelly roll style. When you get to the end, press another strip to the first one and continue rolling. Repeat this with 2 more strips. Carefully transfer the rolled dough to the center of the prepared pan. The spiral should be facing up. Continue coiling the remaining strips of dough filling-side in around the middle roll until the pan is filled. This might get messy, but that&#39;s part of the fun. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Bake until the cinnamon roll is puffed and golden brown, about 50 minutes. Let cool on a rack for 10 minutes. For the glaze: Meanwhile, microwave the cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl until softened, 10 to 15 seconds. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar and milk and whisk until smooth. Remove the outer ring from the springform pan. Pour the glaze on top of the cinnamon roll, then use a spatula to spread it all over. Cut into 8 to 10 wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 57193,&quot;Grilled Sea Scallops on Tortilla Chips with Avocado Puree and Jalapeno Pesto 20 large sea scallops Olive oil Salt Freshly ground black pepper 10 blue corn tortilla chips 10 yellow corn tortilla chips Avocado Puree, recipe follows Jalapeno Pesto, recipe follows Cilantro leaves, for garnish 1 ripe Hass avocado, peeled, pitted and coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons chopped red onion 2 limes, juiced 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups cilantro leaves 4 jalapenos, grilled and chopped 1 clove garlic, chopped 2 tablespoons pine nuts Salt Freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Instructions: Heat grill to high.

Add the asparagus and cook until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. With tongs, remove the asparagus and set aside to cool. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the asparagus cooking water cool to warm. In a deep, 14-inch nonstick saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over high heat. Cook the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned but not yet crisp. Set aside in a bowl to cool. Pour the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil into the pan, keep the heat high and use a wooden spoon to scrape up the bits of meat from the bottom. When the oil is hot, add the shallot, reduce the heat to medium-high and saute until softened. Add the rice to the pan and cook, stirring well, until the rice begins frying, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the wine, stir well and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to let it reduce slightly. Reduce the heat to medium low, add the cheese rind and slowly start adding the asparagus water in 4- to 6-ounce ladlefuls, stirring constantly and giving the rice time to absorb the liquid before adding another ladleful. Cook until the rice is nearly al dente, 12 to 15 minutes. Chop the asparagus into 1-inch pieces and add them to the rice along with the sausage meat and any juices that have collected in the bowl. Season the risotto with salt and pepper and continue cooking, adding asparagus water if necessary to keep the liquid level balanced, until the water is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 2 minutes. Serve with a sprinkle of parsley, a dash of Parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]</p><p>&quot; 57195,&quot;Potato and Leek Soup 1 large or 2 small leeks, about 1 pound 2 bay leaves 20 black peppercorns 4 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons butter 2 strips bacon, chopped 1/2 cup dry white wine 5 cups chicken stock 1 to 1 1/4 pounds russet potatoes, diced 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 3/4 teaspoon white pepper 1/2 to 3/4 cup creme fraiche or heavy cream 2 tablespoons snipped chives Instructions: Trim the green portions of the leek and, using 2 of the largest and longest leaves, make a bouquet garni by folding the 2 leaves around the bay leaves, peppercorns and thyme. Tie into a package-shaped bundle with kitchen twine and set aside. (Alternately, tie 2 leek leaves, bay leaves, peppercorns and thyme together in a piece of cheesecloth.) Using a sharp knife, halve the white part of the leek lengthwise and rinse well under cold running water to rid the leek of any sand. Slice thinly crosswise and set aside. In a large soup pot over medium heat, melt the butter and add the bacon. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is very soft and has rendered most of its fat. Add the chopped leeks and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Add the reserved bouquet garni, chicken stock, potatoes, salt and white pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are falling apart and the soup is very flavorful. Remove the bouquet garni and, working in batches, puree the soup in a food processor or blender. (Alternately, if you own an immersion blender, puree the soup directly in the pot.) Stir in the creme fraiche and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.

Generously season the water with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. While the potatoes cook, place the bacon in a cold skillet and turn to medium-low heat. Add the olive oil and thyme to the pan. Saute the bacon and thyme until just starting to crisp, about 7 minutes; we want to render the bacon slowly. Once the bacon has rendered some of its fat, add the onions to the bacon and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vinegar, butter and mustard. Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them and add immediately to the pan with the sauteed bacon. Stir to coat, adjusting the seasoning, if necessary. Add the remaining fresh herbs, toss and serve. This salad can be served warm or at room temperature.

Add the spinach to the mixture, cover the pan and cook until the spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes. You don&#39;t want to overcook the spinach, just wilt it. Taste for seasoning. For the pork: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place an oven-proof saute pan over medium-high heat and melt 1 tablespoon butter. Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper and, with tongs, place the loin in the hot butter. Brown the pork thoroughly on all sides, 7 to 8 minutes total. Top the pork with the sage leaves, thyme (be careful as the thyme might crackle) and garlic. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and place in the oven. Cook the pork 20 to 30 minutes, but make sure to not overcook. The internal temperature should read 160 degrees F on a meat thermometer. (If you are concerned about overcooking, turn the oven onto warm while finishing the rest of the dish.) Transfer the pork to a platter, tent with some foil and let rest. Remove the whole leaves from the saute pan. For the gravy: In the pan you browned the pork, melt the butter over medium to medium-high heat. Sprinkle the flour into the hot pan juices and whisk together to make a roux. Continue to whisk and cook the roux until turns light brown, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the apple cider and continue to stir. Pour in chicken broth and boil the mixture until the gravy is thick, 5 to 7 minutes depending on desired thickness. Squeeze the lemon half into the mixture. Taste for seasoning (salt, pepper, etc). Sprinkle in the torn tarragon leaves. Finish by whisking in the cream. To serve: Divide the onion-apple saute among 4 plates. Slice the pork and divide over the onion-apple saute. Cover the pork with gravy. Garnish with some thyme and a wedge of lemon. Serve with cous cous and asparagus. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57204,&quot;Barbecued Texas-Style Quail 6 quail, dressed 4 ounces (1 stick) butter, melted 1 cup spicy rub, recipe follows 6 whole jalepenos 6 strips bacon Butter, for basting 1 cup Adams Steak Seasoning 1 pinch (go easy) chili powder 1 pinch (go real easy) red cl flakes 2 pinches garlic powder, or to taste Instructions: Rub the quails with butter and apply a light coating of the seasoning to the bird.

Process the graham crackers, brown sugar and ginger in a food processor until they form a fine crumb. Add the butter and rum, and pulse until the crumbs are soft and moist. Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch pie plate, and bake until firm, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the crust cool completely on a wire rack. For the rum pudding: Set a fine sieve over a mixing bowl; set aside. Whisk the milk, brown sugar and cornstarch in a medium saucepan until the cornstarch is dissolved and no lumps remain. Add the egg yolks, ginger and salt, and whisk until combined. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, 8 to 10 minutes. When the mixture is thick, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 1 minute more, whisking vigorously. Pour the pudding through the sieve set over the mixing bowl, and use a spatula to press it through (this will catch any eggy bits). Whisk the butter into the pudding until it&#39;s incorporated, then whisk in the rum. Pour the pudding into the cooled pie shell. Lay plastic wrap directly on the pudding, and refrigerate the pie until it&#39;s cool and set with a slight jiggle, about 2 hours. For the rum-and-lime whipped cream: Beat the confectioners&#39; sugar, rum, lime juice and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until combined. Add the heavy cream, and beat until fluffy peaks form. Transfer the whipped cream to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe the whipped cream onto the cooled pie, and garnish with crystallized ginger. The pie can be refrigerated, loosely covered, up to overnight or served immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Rum, Tawny Port, Cream Sherry, Madeira]&quot; 57226,&quot;Jasmine Martini 1 cup sugar 1 cup water 2 strips orange zest 1 handful pesticide-free jasmine flowers, plus more for garnish 1/2 cup vodka 1/4 cup Grand Marnier 1 lemon, juiced Instructions: Combine the sugar, water, and lemon zest in a pot over medium heat.

Put the zucchini, bell peppers and asparagus in a large bowl and toss with a scant 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and scant 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette, making sure everything is nice and coated. Transfer the coated veggies to the grill. Add the onions directly to the grill and give them a good brush with the vinaigrette and olive oil mixture. Grill, turning the veggies every 2 minutes, until tender and well-marked, about 8 minutes. Remove to a serving platter. Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette for serving, then brush the salmon on each side with 1/2 tablespoon of the remaining vinaigrette; drizzle on both sides with the remaining olive oil. Grill the salmon for 2 minutes, then rotate 45 degrees and cook for another 2 minutes. After 4 minutes total, flip the salmon and grill on the other side for 2 minutes, then rotate and cook for 2 minutes more. Brush with some of the remaining vinaigrette while cooking if needed. Transfer the salmon to the serving platter with the vegetables. Drizzle everything with the reserved vinaigrette. Sprinkle over the feta, olives, and parsley.

Pour the water over the tea leaves and let steep for 10 minutes. (If using a traditional kettle or pot, bring the water to a boil and let cool for 1 for 2 minutes before using.) Strain the steeped tea into a 1-gallon glass jar. Add the sugar and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Discard the tea leaves. Add the remaining 8 cups filtered water to lower the temperature to lukewarm. If the water is still warmer than 100 degrees F, leave on the counter for 10 minutes, then recheck. Anything hotter than 100 degrees F can damage the SCOBY. Add the kombucha and the SCOBY. Cover the jar with a coffee filter secured with a rubber band and place in a warm, well-ventilated area out of direct sunlight until the mixture begins to take on a pleasantly sour and tangy flavor and is lightly effervescent, 2 to 3 weeks. The ideal fermentation temperature is between 75 and 85 degrees F. When you\\u2019re happy with the flavor, wash your hands very well. Gently remove the SCOBY and transfer to a clean bowl. Reserve 2 cups of the kombucha and add to the bowl with the SCOBY. Add the mango and the ginger to the jar with the remaining kombucha. Re-cover with the coffee filter and rubber band. Let sit at room temperature until the kombucha has taken on the flavor of the fruit and ginger, 2 to 4 days. Meanwhile, you can start a second batch of kombucha with the SCOBY and reserved 2 cups of plain kombucha, following the same steps above using a clean 1-gallon glass jar (see Cook\\u2019s Note). When the flavored kombucha is ready, strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup or bowl. Discard the solids, then divide the kombucha evenly among six to eight 12- to 16-ounce plastic soda bottles with tight-fitting lids Be sure to leave at least 1 1/2 inches of headspace in each bottle for gas to expand. Twist the lids on tightly and park on the counter until the bottles are firm to the touch, indicating that the kombucha is carbonated, 1 to 3 days. Move to the fridge and chill before drinking. The kombucha will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gewrztraminer]&quot; 57229,&quot;Easy Weeknight Beef Stroganoff 2 lb boneless beef top sirloin steak, cut into 2x1/4-inch strips* 1 cup chopped onion (1 large) 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 can (18 oz) Progresso?

Add the beef, season with salt and pepper and cook, breaking the beef into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, leaving behind any drippings, and reduce the heat to medium. To the same skillet, add the mushrooms, season with salt and cook until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the cooked mushrooms to the bowl with the beef. Add the oil, paprika, garlic, carrot and onion to the skillet and cook until the carrots are soft and the onion is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook until the tomato paste has toasted and is evenly coating the vegetables, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the broth, Worcestershire and 1 1/2 cups of water to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and stir in the pasta. Cover and cook according to package directions until just al dente. Uncover, stir in the reserved beef and mushrooms and cook until heated through.

Wrap the garlic head in aluminum foil, and put it in the oven until soft, about 30 minutes. Let garlic cool to the touch then snip off the tip of bulb or pierce cloves with knife, and squeeze the pulp into a large bowl (like frosting through a pastry bag, peel away any loose papery husk so as not to get it into the flesh). In the meantime, heat 1/2 teaspoon olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the red onion and a little salt and cook until just softened and the sharp flavor is gone, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the cooked onion to the bowl with the garlic and add the minced hot pepper, pinch of salt, diced tomatoes, and cumin; gently toss. Halve and pit the avocados with a knife. Then score the flesh in 1/4-inch cross sections. Try not to puncture the avocado skin and cut yourself. Scoop out the flesh and add it to the bowl and immediately add 1/2 of the lime juice along with chopped cilantro; gently stir and taste. If not acidic enough add more lime juice, follow suit with additional salt, cumin or hot pepper. Serve with salsa and chips; it&#39;s also great with roasted chicken and steak. Cook&#39;s Note: I prefer to mince the hot peppers with the seeds. Clearly this makes for a lot more heat. It&#39;s best to add it to the guacamole a little bit at a time to get to desired heat, which is important.

Gently mix, then separate into 4 balls and rest at room temperature for 1 hour. In a shallow dish, add the pineapple rings in one layer, then on each ring, add 4 slices of onion. Brush the tops with the remaining 1/4 cup barbecue sauce. Pour beer in the side of the dish up to the level of the pineapple. Rest at room temperature for 1 hour. Heat an outdoor grill to medium high for direct and indirect heat (to cook on a griddle, see Cook&#39;s Note). Press the burgers into patties slightly larger than the buns. Place the burgers over the direct heat and cook on one side for 6 to 8 minutes. Flip to the indirect heat side of the grill and cook until the internal temperature reads 155 degrees F. Remove from the grill and lightly tent the burgers with loose-fitting aluminum foil for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, shake the excess marinade off the pineapples and onions. Grill the pineapple rings on one side until charred and easily released to be flipped; grill on the other side until grill marked.

Roll out cookie dough to a 1/4-inch thickness and cut with bat cookie cutters. If you can&#39;t find a bat cookie cutter, cut a bat shape out of lightweight cardboard, place it on the rolled out cookie dough and trace around with a sharp knife. Place the cookies on a cookie sheet. Poke a hole on the top of each bat cookie using a drinking straw. Bake for 7 to 11 minutes or until lightly brown. Two minutes before the cookies come out of the oven, re-poke the holes to make sure they are large enough for threading a string. Remove cookies from the cookie sheet and cool on a cooling rack. Thread with 2 to 3-foot lengths of string or fishing line. Frost the cookies and add red hots candy for eyes. String a clothesline across the room (preferably the basement, porch or another room where you don&#39;t mind getting crumbs on the floor). Hang the cookies on the clothesline so they fall to the height of the children&#39;s shoulders. If you&#39;re hosting a party with a variety of ages, be sure to hang the strings at different lengths. To play, instruct the children to keep their hands behind their backs and try to eat the cookies with their mouths only. The first child to eat the whole cookie wins. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 57253,&quot;Hungry Grilled Graceland Special 1 tablespoon reduced-fat peanut butter, room temperature 2 slices light white bread 1/2 medium banana, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon light whipped butter or light buttery spread, room temperature, divided Instructions: Evenly spread peanut butter onto one slice of bread, and top with banana slices.

Spray ramekins lightly with cooking spray. In a small saucepan, heat 1/3 cup sugar over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar melts and forms a medium-brown caramel, about 7 minutes. Working quickly, transfer 2 teaspoons of the caramel to each of the ramekins, swirling as soon as you spoon in the caramel (it will harden quickly). Set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine milk and evaporated milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until warm. Reduce heat to a low simmer and keep milk warm. Meanwhile, bring about 4 cups water to a boil and keep hot. Whisk together eggs, egg yolks, remaining 1/3 cup of sugar, vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon. Fold pumpkin into egg mixture. Then fold into evaporated milk. Divide filling among ramekins, then place baking sheet in oven. Pour hot water into baking pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until flan is just set. Let cool. Place a dessert plate on top of each ramekin and invert; flan should slide out, and syrup should flow onto sides of the dish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 57259,&quot;Brown Butter Cake with Spiced Chocolate Ganache and Dulce de Leche 2 sticks unsalted butter, plus 1 tablespoon (or nonstick cooking spray) for greasing the pans 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for flouring the pans<br> 1 tablespoon baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg<br> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 packed cup light brown sugar<br> 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 3 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1/2 cup sour cream<br> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> 1 1/2 cups whole milk 2 cups of your favorite vanilla frosting 3/4 cup dulce de leche<br> 1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt<br> Spiced Chocolate Ganache, recipe follows 1/2 cup chopped bittersweet chocolate 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 1/4 teaspoon chili powder<br> Instructions: For the cake: Melt the butter in a large shallow saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter starts to brown and smell nutty, 10 to 12 minutes. Scrape the butter and all the browned bits into a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl over an ice bath to solidify and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease three 8-inch cake pans with the 1 tablespoon butter (or spray with nonstick cooking spray) and then lightly dust with flour. Whisk together the 3 3/4 cups flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl until well combined, then set the flour mixture aside. When the brown butter has solidified, scrape it into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and beat on high speed until very light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and reduce the speed to medium, then add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition and scraping the bottom of the bowl to be sure everything is well mixed. Add the sour cream and vanilla and beat just until well mixed, scraping down the bowl again. Add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk, beating just until incorporated. Remove the bowl from the mixer and give the batter a couple of folds with a spatula, scraping the bottom to ensure everything is evenly mixed. Divide the batter among the three prepared cake pans and bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean with some moist crumbs sticking to it, about 25 minutes. Place the pans on a wire rack until cool enough to handle, then invert them onto the rack and unmold the cakes. Carefully turn the cakes right-side up and let cool completely on the rack. For the assembly: Look at your cake layers. If any of them have a dome in the center, cut it off with a serrated knife so the entire top is flat. Place one cake layer on a cake plate or cardboard cake round. Spread vanilla frosting around the outside of one layer and then frost a 1-inch band around the top. Evenly spread half the dulce de leche in the center of the layer until you reach the 1-inch band and then sprinkle with half the sea salt. Add another cake layer and repeat with the frosting and remaining dulce de leche and sea salt. Add the last cake layer and frost the entire cake with a smooth and even layer of frosting. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes until the frosting is set and cold. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and place it on a serving plate or cake stand. Using a spoon, create drips with ganache around the outside of the cake from the top edge. Pour the remaining ganache in the center of the cake and spread it with an offset spatula to cover the top. Let the ganache set completely before serving. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Stir together the cream, cinnamon, vanilla and chili powder in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until it just begins to bubble around the edges, then pour it over the chocolate and let sit for about 10 seconds. Stir until smooth and shiny. Let the ganache sit until it has cooled and thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 57260,&quot;Chicken and Pepper Jack Quesadillas with Cilantro Slaw 1 8-ounce package shredded coleslaw mix (about 4 cups) Kosher salt Juice of 1 lime 1 small clove garlic, finely chopped 1/2 cup packed fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems), chopped 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Freshly ground pepper 4 burrito-size tortillas 8 ounces pepper jack cheese, shredded (about 2 cups) 1 cup chopped rotisserie chicken, skin removed 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 small head iceberg lettuce, shredded (about 4 cups) Mexican crema or sour cream, for topping Instructions: Toss the coleslaw mix with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl and set aside.

Cut the quesadillas into wedges and serve with the bean and escarole salad and salsa. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 57317,&quot;Veal Breast and Turkey Loaf with Crispy Onion Rings 1 breast of veal, boneless and well trimmed, about 2 pounds, cut square for stuffing 1 sweet red pepper, seeds and veins removed, coarsely chopped 1 large vidalia onion, peeled and roughly chopped 3 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped 2 cloves garlic, peeled 1 pound freshly ground turkey 3 eggs 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 cup bread crumbs 1/4 cup pistachio nuts, shelled 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup white wine Instructions: Have your butcher cut a pocket the in the veal breast suitable fro stuffing. If you wish to try this yourself lay the breast flat on a workspace. Insert a knife between the layers of meat at roughly the middle of the breast so that your knife is parallel to the table. There is a natural layer in the middle of the breast that is easily separated and is visible between the layers of meat and thin layer of fat. This is where the pocket is most easily made for stuffing. Take the time to look for it. Leave an opened edge around the veal on three sides about 1 inch wide. After you have made the pocket begin the turkey stuffing. Quickly chop, in a food processor, the red pepper, onion, carrots and garlic, taking care not to over chop. Add the chopped vegetables to the turkey in a large bowl and combine well with the eggs, milk, cheese and bread crumbs. If the mixture is too stiff pour in a few tablespoons of cold water. Fold in the nuts, season with salt and pepper. Spread the veal pocket open and begin to stuff the veal, using your hands, as evenly as possible. The stuffing should fill the cavity in as even a layer as possible. After the veal has been stuffed, fold the opening together, tucking in any excess in order to close the opening. The opening may be sealed closed with skewers, toothpicks, sewn closed or tied in a roll. Heat a large deep stovetop braising pan or casserole over medium heat. Add the olive oil and, when hot, brown the veal well on all sides. After the veal has browned to a dark and rich color, add the wine and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, place a lid on the pan and cook the veal slowly and gently for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. If the pan dries out and the veal begins to stick add a few ounces of water to keep the pan moist. After the veal has cooked, allow to rest for 15 minutes and serve. The veal and turkey loaf may be served either hot with crisp onions or cold with a vinaigrette. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 57318,&quot;Carmel Big Apple Waffle with Salted Caramel Sauce 4 Fuji or local apples, cored and quartered 1 cinnamon stick<br> 1 lemon, juiced<br> 2 tablespoons sugar<br> Pinch salt<br> 1 cup sugar 3/4 cup heavy cream<br> 3 1/2 tablespoons butter<br> 1 teaspoon sea salt<br> 4 to 6 waffles (use your favorite waffle mix) Whipped cream, for serving Apple chips, for garnish Instructions: For the apple compote: Combine the apples, cinnamon, lemon juice, sugar, salt and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the apples start to break down, 30 to 45 minutes. Set aside. For the salted caramel sauce: Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook without stirring, brushing down any sugar crystals from the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Watch carefully, when the sugar turns a dark amber color, remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in cream and butter (it will bubble, so be careful) and then the salt. Serve the waffles topped with some apple compote, a drizzle of caramel sauce and a dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with an apple chip. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57319,&quot;Ham and Cheese Pinwheels 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon crushed garlic 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning 1 (13.8-ounce) tube refrigerated pizza dough (recommended: Pillsbury) 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided 1/3 pound sliced deli ham 1 large egg Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Add the Dumplings and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the Dumplings are lightly browned. Add the Pulled Hen meat, corn, crushed red pepper, celery, carrots and cooked onions. Add the bourbon and light it on fire to cook off the alcohol. Add the Pulled Hen broth and Parmesan Broth and bring to a simmer. Add the Parmesan and cook until melted into the soup. Check for seasoning and adjust as needed. Divide among 4 soup bowls and garnish with some finely chopped chives. In a saucepot, combine the buttermilk, butter, granulated garlic and onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil and whisk in the flour all at once. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until a dough is formed and it pulls away from the sides of the pot. Remove from the heat. Using a sturdy wooden spoon, mix in one egg at a time, making sure each one is fully incorporated before adding the next. Once all the eggs are added, wrap the dough loosely in buttered parchment paper and refrigerate until cool, about 3 hours. Dust a rimmed baking sheet with flour and set aside. Unwrap the dough and cut into 4 equal portions. On a floured surface, roll the portions into equal-shaped logs, about 1- to 1 1/2-inches thick. Cut into 1-inch long pieces and transfer to the floured baking sheet. Refrigerate until ready to use, or at least 10 minutes. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the dumplings and allow them to float to the surface, then cook 1 minute more. Remove from the water and drain well, then toss with some olive oil and spread on a baking sheet lined with a clean kitchen towel. Let sit at least 30 minutes. (Dumplings can be prepared up to this point well in advance.)<br> In a large pot big enough to hold the hen, place the hen, celery, bay leaves, carrots, onions, parsley and 1 tablespoon salt. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer. Skim the broth while it cooks to remove any impurities. Cook until the meat is tender and easily pulled, about 4 hours. Remove the hen and allow to cool until cool enough to handle. Pull all the meat and mix together the white meat and dark meat evenly, then reserve 2 cups of meat. (Reserve the remaining meat for things like chicken salads, rice dishes, soups, etc.) Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve 1 cup. Any excess broth can be used as chicken stock. In a saucepot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until browned. Add the cloves and lightly toast until they are aromatic. Throw in the Parmesan rinds, bay leaves and heavy cream. Bring to a simmer and cook until the Parmesan rinds are very soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 57322,&quot;No-Churn Strawberry Cheesecake Ice Cream 2/3 cup graham cracker crumbs (from 4 crackers), plus graham crackers for garnish 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 4 tablespoons sugar 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1/4 cup heavy cream 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 pound strawberries, trimmed and chopped 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon lemon juice 8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature 1 3/4 cups heavy cream 1 cup sour cream 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest plus 1 tablespoon lemon juice Pinch of salt Instructions: For the cheesecake bites: Toss the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter and 1 tablespoon sugar in a medium bowl. Divide between two 1 1/2-cup bowls or ramekins; press into the bottoms and up the sides. Put the cream cheese in the medium bowl (no need to wipe clean); stir with a spatula. Add the heavy cream, lemon juice, vanilla and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar; mix until smooth. Spoon into the prepared bowls, cover and freeze until firm, about 2 hours. Remove the bowls from the freezer and run a knife around the cheesecakes; turn out onto a cutting board and roughly chop. Transfer to a plate, then cover and keep frozen until ready to use. For the strawberry sauce: Meanwhile, toss the strawberries with the cornstarch and sugar in a medium saucepan, then add the lemon juice and 1 cup water. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thick and shiny, about 30 minutes. (You should have about 1 2/3 cups sauce; cook slightly longer to reduce if necessary.) Transfer to a medium bowl and refrigerate until cold. For the ice cream: Put the cream cheese, heavy cream, sour cream, sugar, vanilla, lemon zest and juice and salt in a food processor; process until very thick and fluffy, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Layer the ice cream mixture, strawberry sauce and cheesecake bites in a shallow 2-quart baking dish, reserving 1/4 cup of the strawberry sauce for serving. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface; freeze until firm, at least 3 hours. Let sit at room temperature 20 minutes before scooping.

Preheat a big, deep pot over medium heat. Add oil, garlic, and crushed pepper. As you chop vegetables (peppers, onion, and celery), add them to the pot. Once vegetables are in there, increase heat a bit. Stir in olives, capers, and raisins. Salt the diced eggplant and stir into the pot. Add tomatoes, diced and crushed, to the pot and stir caponata well to combine. Cover pot and cook caponata 15 to 20 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Stir in parsley and remove pan from heat. Polenta: Bring 3 cups chicken broth to a boil. Add polenta and stir constantly until the cornmeal masses together. Stir in herbs, butter, cheese, salt, and pepper. Spread polenta out over a serving platter. Make a shallow well from the center out and fill with half of the prepared caponata. This stands as a complete dinner on its own, so rich with vitamins and fresh vegetables. Refrigerate the remaining caponata for a later use. If you prepare a salad, keep it simple. Dress mixed greens with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Caponata can also be used as a bruschetta topping. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 57324,&quot;Marbleized Almond Pound Cake Butter and flour for loaf pans 1 1/2 sticks softened unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 2/3 cups sugar 1/2 cup almond paste 5 egg yolks 1 teaspoon vanilla 12 large egg whites Pinch salt 3 cups sifted flour 3 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, melted 1/2 cup almond paste 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest 1 cup whipped cream or sour cream Slices of almond pound cake Liqueur like Kirsch to taste Sugared fruit like berries or kiwi, peaches, plums to taste 1 cup whipped cream 1 cup sifted dark unsweetened cocoa 2/3 cup heavy cream<br> 1/3 cup unsalted butter<br> 1 1/3 cups sugar<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br> Instructions: Butter and flour 2 (9 x 5 x 3-inch) loaf pans and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.<br> With an electric mixer cream the butter with 1/4 cup of the sugar and beat until it looks light and fluffy. Add the almond paste a bit at a time and continue to beat until the mixture looks light and fluffy. Add the yolks, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in the vanilla.<br> Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Add the remaining sugar, a tablespoonful at a time, until the egg whites are stiff but not dry. Fold one quarter of the beaten whites into the butter/almond paste mixture, then fold that lightened mixture back into the remaining egg whites, sprinkling and adding in flour as you fold. Add melted chocolate, cutting through the batter with rubber spatula to marble the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the middle of the cake; the cakes should be golden brown and pull away from sides of the pan. Let them set in the loaf pans for 15 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the edges and loosen the cakes onto a rack to cool completely. Take remaining almond paste from can, stir in the grated orange zest and some whipped cream or even sour cream to make the mixture looser; fold in remaining whipped cream and use as a topping with sliced and sugared strawberries or raspberries. Layer some cake slices in the bottom of a loaf pan; sprinkle with liqueur and top with fruit and whipped cream. Repeat with another layer at least, ending with cake on top. Cover and refrigerate until cake is moistened. Combine cocoa, heavy cream, butter and sugar in a saucepan. Over low heat cook, stirring constantly, until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes.

Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Place the hazelnuts and 3/4 cup of the sugar in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is finely ground. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the flour. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Continue cooking the butter until it colors slightly, swirling the pan to color it evenly. Remove from heat and add the rum and vanilla extract. Set aside to cool slightly. In a clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites with the salt until they form a very soft peak. Add the remaining 3/4 cup sugar in a very slow stream, whipping constantly. Continue whipping the egg whites until they hold a soft peak. Alternately fold the hazelnut and butter mixtures into the egg whites, 1/3 at a time. Begin with the hazelnut mixture and end with the butter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan or pans. Smooth the top and sprinkle with the sliced or chopped hazelnuts. Bake the financier for about 50 minutes until well risen and golden, about 30 minutes for the individual cakes. The center of the cake should feel firm when pressed with the palm of the hand. Cool the financier briefly on a rack and remove pan and paper. If some of the hazelnuts on the surface fall off, replace them on the cake. Dust very lightly with confectioners&#39; sugar. For the compote, rinse, pit and quarter plums. Combine sugar and lemon juice in a small pan and heat until sugar begins to melt. Stir occasionally until sugar turns to a deep amber caramel.

Dust the top of a pizza peel with semolina flour, and lay the pizza dough on top. Combine the olives, capers, tomatoes, garlic and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Season with salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Thinly spread the puttanesca sauce over the pizza dough and top with the taleggio. Place the pizza on the pizza stone or a sheet tray and bake until the crust is brown and crispy and the cheese is melted, 7 to 10 minutes. Towards the end of the cooking time, lightly dress the arugula with olive oil and a pinch salt. Top the finished pizza immediately with the arugula, cut into pieces and serve hot. Pour the warm water into a small bowl (if the water is too hot the yeast will die and if the water is too cold the yeast will not activate). Stir in the sugar and dry yeast to combine and let sit 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and smell very yeasty, this is what you want. Combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the olive oil and yeast water. Gradually stir the flour into the liquid, using a fork. Once most of the flour has been incorporated, turn the dough out onto a smooth, clean work surface dusted with bench flour. Use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency. Place the dough in a lightly oiled mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour 30 minutes. Portion the dough and stretch to the desired size. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 57342,&quot;Linguine with White Clam Sauce 1 pound dry linguine or spaghetti Kosher salt 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes 3/4 cup dry white wine 1/4 cup water 36 little neck clams, scrubbed 3 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley Freshly ground pepper Grilled bread, for serving (optional) Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season generously with salt.

Fill a medium bowl with water and add the lemon juice. Set aside. With a sharp, serrated knife, cut about 1/2 inch off the medium ones. Pull off and discard the tough, green outer leaves to expose the pale green hearts. Trim the dark stem end of each artichoke. Quarter the small artichoke hearts, or cut the medium hearts lengthwise into 8 wedges. With a small spoon or your fingers, scrape out any prickly inner leaves. As you work, drop the artichokes into the lemon water to prevent browning. Spread the bread crumbs in a single layer on a light-colored baking sheet (a dark surface tends to overbrown them). Toast in the oven until lightly browned, stirring once or twice, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside. Set oven temperature to 425 degrees F. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes. Add the toasted bread crumbs and stir well to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat and add the olives, parsley, salt, and pepper, stirring well to combine. Set aside. Brush a shallow 12 X 8-inch baking dish with half the remaining oil. Drain the artichokes and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange one-third of the onion mixture in the prepared dish. Spread half the drained artichokes over the onion mixture. Repeat, ending with the remaining third of the onion mixture. Pour the broth carefully around the edges of the dish. Season the top lightly with salt and pepper, then drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Cover the baking dish tightly with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Cook until artichokes are almost cooked through and tender, about 10 minutes for the small, 15 to 20 minutes for the medium. Uncover the dish and bake for 10 minutes, or until the artichokes are tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife and the top is browned. (If the mixture appears too dry, add more broth as necessary around the edges of the dish.) Let cool slightly.

Let it sit on your counter until it&#39;s frothy, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, sift the flour, salt, remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar and baking powder into a large, deep bowl. Once the yeast is frothy, add the yogurt and the olive oil into the glass, and stir to combine. Pour the yogurt mixture into the dry ingredients and add the kalonji and fennel seeds, if using, and gently mix the ingredients together with a fork. When the dough is about to come together, use your hands to mix. It will feel like there isn&#39;t enough flour at first, but keep going until it transforms into a soft, slightly sticky and pliable dough. As soon as it comes together, stop kneading. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let it sit in a warm, draft-free place for 2 to 4 hours. When you&#39;re ready to roll, make sure you have two bowls on your counter: one with extra flour in it, and one with water. The dough will be extremely soft and sticky-this is good! Separate the dough into 6 equal portions and lightly roll each one in the bowl of extra flour to keep them from sticking to each other. Shape the naan. Using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a teardrop shape, narrower at the top than at the bottom. It should be 8 to 9-inches long, 4-inches wide at its widest point and about 1/4-inch thick. Once you&#39;ve formed the general shape, you can also pick it up by one end and wiggle it; the dough&#39;s own weight will stretch it out a little. Repeat this method with the rest of the dough. (If you&#39;re making the gluten-free version, you&#39;ll have better luck pressing the dough out with your fingertips, than rolling.) Warm a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until it&#39;s nearly smoking. Make sure you have a lid large enough to fit the skillet and have a bowl of melted butter at the ready. Dampen your hands in the bowl of water and pick up one of your naans, flip-flopping it from one hand to the other to lightly dampen it. Gently lay it in the skillet and set your timer for 1 minute. The dough should start to bubble. After about 1 minute, flip the naan. It should be blistered and somewhat blackened, don&#39;t worry - that&#39;s typical of traditional naan! Cover the skillet with the lid and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute more. Remove the naan from the skillet, brush with a bit of butter and sprinkle with a little coarse sea salt. Place the naan in a tea towel-lined dish. Repeat with the rest of the naans and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 57352,&quot;Sparkling Red Sangria 1 bottle sparkling apple/grape or apple/cranberry juice 1 pint blackberries 1 bottle red wine 1 sliced green apple 1 sliced peach 1 sliced blood orange Instructions: Fill an ice cube tray with sparkling fruit juice.

If you find the batter is too thick to press through the slotted spoon, hold the slotted spoon closer to the surface of the boiling water so that the steam softens it a bit. Transfer the sp?tzle to a strainer, toss in a bit of olive oil so they don\\u2019t all stick together, and set aside while you make the sauce. Transfer the spaetzle directly into the cheese sauce. Top with more chives and crispy fried onions and loads of black pepper and serve. Enjoy! To make the sauce: melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook onion with a pinch of salt until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add a few turns of black pepper and the paprika. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add milk a third at a time, stirring continuously and allow to thicken after each addition. Add cheese and stir until melted. Add chives and stir. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 57358,&quot;Salt Crusted Hawaiian Opakapaka Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 each 12 by 12-inch banana leaf* 12 ounces opakapaka fillet, skinless, boneless 3 slices Yukon Gold potatoes, 3/8-inch thick, peeled 2 tablespoons tomato, julienne 4 tablespoons Napa cabbage, chopped 2 tablespoons julienne bell pepper 2 tablespoons julienne carrots 3 slices lemon 1 tablespoon picked herbs, such as cilantro, dill, parsley, or basil 1 tablespoon white wine 1 teaspoon whole butter, cubed 3 pounds kosher salt 3 each egg whites Instructions: Season fish with salt and pepper. On a flat surface lay out the banana leaf. Place fish on leaf laying the potatoes, tomato, cabbage, pepper, carrot, lemon, and herbs on top of fish. Pour wine over and place butter cubes on top.

Add the almonds and cook, stirring regularly, until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the almonds to a blender or food processor. Add half of the onion to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until richly browned, about 10 minutes. Use the slotted spoon to scoop the onions in with the almonds, leaving behind as much oil as possible. (If needed, add a little more oil or lard to the pan, let heat, then continue.) Add the raisins, stir for a minute as they puff, then use the slotted spoon to scoop them in with the almonds. Roast the tomatoes on a baking sheet 4 inches below a very hot broiler until blackened on one side, about 6 minutes, then flip them over and roast the other side. Cool, peel and add to the almond mixture in the blender, along with the cinnamon, chocolate and bread. Add 1 cup of the broth and blend to a smooth puree, scraping and stirring every few seconds.Return the pot to medium-high heat and, if necessary, add a little more oil or lard to coat the bottom lightly. When very hot, add the Ancho mixture and cook, stirring almost constantly, until darker and very thick, about 5 minutes. Add the pureed almond mixture and cook, stirring constantly for another few minutes, until very thick once again. Stir in the remaining 4 1/3 cups of the broth, partially cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, over medium-low for 45 minutes. Taste and season with salt and sugar. (If you have never made mole before, season it until it&#39;s slightly sweet--the sugar balances the strong flavors.) Warming the tortillas: Set up a steamer (with this many tortillas, you&#39;ll need 2 vegetable steamers set up in saucepans or a big Chinese steamer--either choice with 1/2-inch of water under the steamer basket); heat to a boil. Wrap the tortillas in 2 stacks in heavy kitchen towels, lay in the steamer, and cover tightly. Boil 1 minute, turn off the heat and let stand without opening the steamer for 15 minutes. Finishing the enchiladas: Turn on the oven to the lowest setting and warm 6 to 9 plates in it. Toast the sesame seeds in a small skillet, stirring frequently, over medium heat until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. In a medium-size saucepan, combine the chicken with 1 1/2 cups of the mole and warm over medium heat. Bring the remaining mole to a simmer. When you&#39;re ready to serve, quickly make the enchiladas by scooping 2 generous tablespoons of chicken onto a tortilla, rolling it up and placing it on a warm dinner plate. Continue making enchiladas, arranging 2 or 3 per plate, then douse them liberally with the hot mole. Strew with the remaining sliced onion and sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 57362,&quot;Drippy French Dip Sandwiches 2 tablespoons kosher salt<br> 3 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 teaspoon ground oregano<br> 1 teaspoon ground thyme<br> 1 small boneless rib loin roast (4 to 5 pounds)<br> 5 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 large onions, halved and sliced<br> 1 packet French onion soup mix<br> 1 can beef consomme<br> 1 can beef stock<br> 2 tablespoons dry sherry<br> 2 tablespoons Worcestershire<br> 1 tablespoon soy sauce<br> 8 crusty deli rolls<br> Butter, softened, for toasting<br> 8 slices provolone cheese, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Combine the salt, 2 tablespoons of the pepper, the oregano and thyme and rub into the outside of the beef. Place the beef on a rack on a roasting pan and roast it in the oven until medium-rare, 25 to 30 minutes (use a meat thermometer and monitor it till it&#39;s medium-rare). Remove the meat from the oven and place on a cutting board to rest. Place the roasting pan on the burner on medium-high heat. Add the garlic and sliced onions to the drippings, stirring around to cook until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Add the soup mix. Pour in the consomme, stock, 1 cup water, the sherry, Worcestershire, soy sauce and the remaining 1 tablespoon pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour. Pour through a fine mesh strainer and keep warm. Slice the rested beef very, very thinly. Split the rolls and spread with butter. Then grill the rolls on a griddle or in a skillet until golden brown and crisp. To build the sandwiches, pile sliced meat on the bottom half, dip the sliced beef quickly into the jus before putting on the roll, then top with the top half of the roll. Serve with little dishes of au jus.

Set aside.<br> In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and paddle with a rubber spatula. Add the cream and beat for 1 minute.<br> Heat a panini press to 350 degrees F. Lay out half the rolls, the layer with the tops on your left side and the layer with the bottoms of the rolls on your right. Spread half of the cream cheese mixture over the cut sides of the tops, spreading to the edges. Spread about 1/3 cup of the cookie spread on the cut sides of the bottom halves. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of the granola and 1/2 cup blueberries on top of the cookie spread. Place a cube of peach in the middle of each roll. Carefully flip the top of the rolls, cream cheese side down, over the bottom of the rolls. Brush the tops with some coconut oil and sprinkle with some cinnamon sugar. Repeat with the remaining slab of 12 rolls, the remaining cream cheese mixture, cookie spread, granola, blueberries, peaches, coconut oil and cinnamon sugar.<br> Place one set of 12 rolls in the press and heat until the panini are golden brown and caramelized. (If you can adjust the lid, set it on a wider opening; this will still press the sandwich without squeezing the daylights out of it.) Remove from the press and repeat with the other 12 rolls. The paninis can be made up to 4 or 5 hours ahead and warmed up in a low-temperature oven.<br> Separate the panini into mini rolls, carefully cutting each slab into 12 pieces.

Toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight or up to 24 hours. When ready to cook, position the oven racks in the top and bottom levels. Clip 2 medium metal binder clips 12 to 14 inches apart in the center of the top rack of the oven, positioning them so that the clips are facing each other and the handles of the binder clips are hanging downwards. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat a small cast-iron skillet on the stove until searing hot. Add 2 cups dry cherry wood chips to the skillet and let the chips start to smolder and smoke. Remove the baking dish with the chicken from the refrigerator and drizzle the stock and olive oil over the chicken. Leaving the kielbasa connected in links, lightly prick each link with a skewer or the tip of a sharp knife. Drape the kielbasa links over a 16-inch-long, 1/4-inch-thick wooden dowel. Place the baking dish in the center of the bottom rack of the oven, directly underneath the binder clips. On the top rack, carefully slide the ends of the dowel through the handles of the binder clips so that the sausages are hanging above the baking dish. Note: You can also lay the sausages directly on the top oven rack, in the center. Place the skillet with the smoking wood chips on the bottom rack next to the baking dish. Bake until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove the sausage and the chicken from the oven. Use two forks to shred the chicken, and taste for seasoning. Transfer to a large bowl and drizzle with the remaining juices in the baking dish. Slice the kielbasa on the bias into 1-inch-thick pieces and transfer to a bowl.

In a bowl, toss the slices with the salt, then place them in a colander set over a bowl or the sink to drain for about 30 minutes. (It is important to rid the potatoes of any excess moisture that will make the pastry soggy during baking.) In a bowl, mix the potato slices with the onion, thyme, and butter, and set aside.<br> Line a baking pan with parchment paper. Lay the 10 by 8-inch sheet of pastry on a work surface. Spread the potato mixture evenly over the pastry, leaving a 1-inch border all around. (You might think that you have too much potato, but pile it on, as the mixture loses volume during cooking.) Brush the border with egg wash and top with the 11 by 9-inch sheet of pastry, stretching it over the potatoes.<br> Crimp the edges with a fork to prevent the pastry sheets from separating. Trim off any excess pastry and generously brush the top with egg wash. Poke a small vent hole in the center of the pastry to ensure an even rise. Crisscross the top with the back of the knife for decoration.<br> Bake until golden brown, about 60 minutes. Test the potatoes for doneness by inserting a small paring knife into the galette. If they are done, so is the pastry. If there is any sign of resistance, decrease the oven temperature to 300 degrees F and bake, testing frequently, another 15 minutes.<br> To serve, carefully transfer the galette to a large serving platter. Slice horizontally all around to separate the top and bottom crusts. Lift the top crust to expose the potatoes. Spoon creme fraeche evenly over them, reposition the top crust, and serve immediately.

While sausages roast, heat a skillet over medium heat with 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and sliced garlic. Simmer garlic in extra-virgin olive oil 2 to 3 minutes then add peppers and onions. Turn the heat up a notch, and cook until the vegetables are tender but the peppers still hold strong color, 5 to 6 minutes. Add thinned tomato sauce, salt, and pepper and reduce. Turn heat back to low and hold the veggies until the sausage comes out of the oven, a couple of minutes. Toast the split bread, remove from oven, rub with cracked garlic, liberally drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, and cover with cheese and lots of black pepper. Return to the broiler to brown cheese, 1 minute. Scatter parsley over the bread. Cut bread into chunks and pile with peppers and onions then sausages. The bread will soak in the juices as you work through the sausage, peppers and onions. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 57377,&quot;Olive Branch Smoked Beef Tenderloin, Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Chili and Olive Ragout One 3 1/2 to 4-pound trimmed beef tenderloin roast, tied Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons butter<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes, recipe follows Roasted Chili and Olive Ragout, recipe follows 1 bunch watercress 2 pounds large russet potatoes Salt 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons pitted and finely chopped olives 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup olive oil 1 red onion, thinly sliced 1/2 cup olives, pitted and finely chopped 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley<br> 2 jalapeno peppers, roasted, peeled, seeded and finely diced 1 red bell pepper, roasted, peeled, seeded and cut into medium dice 1 poblano pepper, roasted, peeled, seeded and cut into medium dice 1 yellow bell pepper, roasted, peeled, seeded and cut into medium dice Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Prepare a smoker using olive branches.

Grease two 9-inch cake pans with baking spray. Mix together the cake mix, flour, sugar, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. In a mixer with the whisk attachment, mix together the egg whites, vegetable oil, sour cream, vanilla, bananas and instant pudding until well mixed. Add the dry ingredients and then then slowly pour in 1 1/3 cups water. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool on a rack. For the praline: In a medium saucepan, bring the sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil without stirring; occasionally swirl the pan gently to blend the sugar. Once the mixture has turned a light caramel color, remove the pan from the heat and add the vanilla and the candied pecans. Stir with a spatula and immediately pour out onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Allow to dry until brittle. Break into pieces. For the buttercream: Put the sugar and egg whites in a large heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Whisk constantly until hot to the touch; the sugar should be dissolved and look like marshmallow cream. Pour the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on medium speed until the egg whites cool and form a thick, shiny meringue, about 5 minutes. Switch to the paddle attachment and add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until smooth. Once all the butter is in, add the vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until thick and very smooth, 6 to 10 minutes. Refrigerate. To assemble the cake: Mix 1 cup of the crushed praline into 2 cups of the buttercream. Spread the top of one of the cake layers with the praline filling, then stack the second cake layer on top.

Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the water. Mix with a knife, then bring the dough together with your hands. Squidge into a ball, then wrap in plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for 25 minutes.<br> Unwrap the dough ball and use a knife to score a large cross in the middle of it, cutting no more than halfway through. Lift all four corners from the middle of the cross, then pull them up and out to make the cross big enough to put the softened butter into.<br> Add the butter, then fold the corners of the cross back to the center, covering the butter so it is completely enclosed. The corners should overlap in the center so no butter is showing. It is important that the butter is not too hard or too soft, otherwise it will escape through the dough when you roll it out and the resulting pastry will not rise as well. If it&#39;s too hard, let the ball of pastry stand at room temperature until the butter inside has softened; if it is getting too soft, pop it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to firm up a little before rolling.<br> This next process is called \\rolling and folding\\ (or \\turns) and it creates the characteristic flaky layers of puff pastry. Begin by rolling the pastry out away from you on a well-floured counter to a rectangle roughly 3 times as long as it is wide (don&#39;t turn the pastry when rolling). Keep the corners square and edges straight by pressing a spatula or rule against them. Lift the dough occasionally to make sure it isn&#39;t sticking; flour the counter again if necessary and sprinkle with more flour as you go, dusting away any excess with a pastry brush. Take the short edge of the pastry nearest to you and fold it up a third, then fold the top edge down a third to give a rectangular block. Turn the dough 90 degree and then repeat the rolling and folding.<br> You have now given the dough two \\rolls and folds.\\ Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator. Chill for 20 minutes.<br> Remove the dough from the refrigerator, then unwrap and give it two more \\rolls and folds.\\ Wrap and rest in the refrigerator for at least another 20 minutes. The block of puff pastry can at this point be kept in the refrigerator for a day or two, or frozen.<br> Remove from the refrigerator, then unwrap and give the dough a final couple of rolls and folds. Roll it out to the size desired for your chosen recipe. Place on a baking sheet, then cover with oiled plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 57395,&quot;Fish Chowder with Root Vegetables 4 slices bacon 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 stalks celery 4 scallions 1/2 large rutabaga (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and diced 2 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (about 12 ounces), peeled and chopped 4 to 5 sprigs thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 8-ounce bottle clam juice 1 1/4 pounds skinless cod, haddock, hake or pollock fillets 3/4 cup half-and-half or heavy cream 1 1/2 cups oyster crackers or 4 crusty dinner rolls, for serving Instructions: Put the bacon and butter in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot.

Bake the potatoes until cooked through, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Cut the potatoes in half, scoop out the flesh and push the flesh through a tamis, food mill or ricer. Spread the riced potato flesh on a clean work surface. Season with salt and allow it to release its steam for 2 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and a generous pinch of salt. Sift the flour over the potatoes and mix gently with your hands, lifting and letting the potatoes fall through your fingers. Drizzle the egg yolk mixture over the potatoes. Mix the dough and knead briefly until homogeneous. Roll into a log and cut into manageable pieces. Cover with a towel. One piece at a time, roll until approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut into individual pieces about 1 inch long. Shape the gnocchi using a fork or other pasta tool. Lay on a floured tray and reserve. Set aside 2 cups of the gnocchi for this recipe; use the remaining gnocchi immediately or freeze for later use (see Cook&#39;s Note). For the assembly: Fill a pot with water and season with salt; the water should taste like seasoned broth, not salty like the sea. Bring the water to a boil. Add the gnocchi to the boiling water. When they rise to the surface, cook for 1 to 2 more minutes. While the gnocchi are cooking, add the Heirloom Baby Tomato Sauce to a saute pan with some red pepper flakes if using and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add 3 ounces of the pasta water to the saute pan, then add the butter. Remove the gnocchi from the pot using a wire skimmer and add to the saute pan. (Note: You can also use a pasta basket or a perforated pan insert.) Toss the gnocchi in the pan to emulsify the butter and finish with some Parmesan and basil. Plate the gnocchi and finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. In a saute pan, heat the oil slightly. Add the garlic slices and saute for 30 seconds; there should be no color on the garlic. Add the tomatoes to the pan, season with a little salt and saute; the tomatoes will release their juices. Continue cooking until fairly dry. Add the basil and oregano and mix to incorporate. The sauce should be chunky, fresh looking and not too thin. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and red pepper flakes if needed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Barbera]&quot; 57418,&quot;BBQ Beans 1 pound pinto beans, soaked overnight 7 cups water 1 bay leaf 1 onion, diced 3/4 pound ground chuck 1 clove garlic, minced 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 tablespoon chili powder 3/4 cup ketchup 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 1/3 cup yellow mustard 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Quick soak method for beans: Cover beans with water, bring to a boil.

The baked loaves should sound hollow when tapped. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57420,&quot;Olives with Orange and Rosemary 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 cloves garlic, smashed 1 teaspoon coriander seed, crushed 1 large sprig rosemary 2 bay leaves 1/2 orange zest, peeled in long strips with a swivel peeler Pinch red pepper flakes 12 ounces mixed olives, like kalamata, nicoise, or cerignola, drained Instructions: Put the olive oil, garlic, coriander seed, herbs, orange zest, and pepper flakes in a medium skillet. Heat over medium-high heat swirling the pan until the mixture is fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the olives and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden and the zest begins to curl, about 2 minutes more. Serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 57421,&quot;Soupe au Pistou 1/3 cup dry white beans (navy or Great Northern), washed 2 garlic cloves, peeled 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1 bunch fresh basil, leaves only 1 cup (4 ounces) freshly grated Gruyere or Parmesan cheese 2 small red potatoes, with skins 1 large carrot, peeled 1 small onion 1 small zucchini, with skin 1 small yellow crookneck squash, with skin 1 stalk of celery, peeled 1 large tomato, peeled, and seeded 1/4 pound green beans 8 cups chicken stock or canned broth Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Instructions: Place beans in a small saucepan and cover with a generous amount of water. Bring to a boil and cook, covered, until beans are tender, about 1 hour. Drain and reserve. (To test a bean for doneness, choose a small one. Smaller beans take longer to cook because of their dense centers. The bean should taste creamy, rather than powdery, inside.) Make Pesto by pureeing garlic, olive oil, and a few basil leaves in a blender. Gradually add remaining leaves until all are pureed. Transfer to a small bowl, add grated cheese, and stir. Set aside.Cut each vegetable into even 1/2-inch dice and set aside. To avoid discoloration, reserve potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Bring chicken stock to a boil in a large stockpot. Add white beans, potatoes, carrot, and onion. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, uncovered, 15 minutes. Add remaining vegetables and bring back to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook an additional 10 minutes, uncovered. Season to taste. Serve soup with a dollop of pesto in each bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Riesling]&quot; 57422,&quot;Coconut-Peanut Cookies: Galletas Maria (Costa Rica) 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon fine salt 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, slightly softened 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 large egg 1 cup flaked or shredded sweetened coconut 1 cup old fashioned oats 3/4 cup chopped unsalted roasted, skinless peanuts Instructions: Position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.) Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. Melt the butter in medium saucepan over low heat. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the brown sugar with a wooden spoon. (The sugar will get soft and saucy, but there may still be a layer of butter on top; don&#39;t worry, the mixture comes together as you add the rest of the ingredients.) Stir in the egg, then the flour mixture, taking care not to overmix. Stir in the coconut, oats and nuts to make a textured cookie dough. Set aside until it gets to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Using a tablespoon-sized ice cream scoop (#60), scoop balls of the dough onto the prepared pans, arranging them about 2 1/2 inches apart. Bake until the cookies are golden brown with toasted edges, about 12 minutes. Cool cookies in the pans for a couple minutes. Then transfer with a spatula to racks to cool. Serve. Busy baker&#39;s tips: You can store unshaped dough for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. Store the cookies in airtight containers for up to a week. Freeze for 1 month for longer storage.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57423,&quot;Pecan-Caramel Spiders 1 1/2 cups toasted pecans 1 cup heavy cream 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup light corn syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, in pieces 1/4 teaspoon salt 5 ounces thin black licorice strands, cut into 2-inch pieces 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 4 ounces milk chocolate, chopped Chocolate curls or sprinkles, optional Instructions: Line 2 baking sheets with waxed paper and lightly spray with nonstick spray. Mound 30 small clusters of pecans, about 3 or 4 pecans each, spaced a couple inches apart on the pan. Make caramel: Warm the cream over low heat and keep warm while you cook the sugar. Put the sugar and corn syrup and in a deep, heavy-bottomed large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring, raise heat to medium-high, and simmer until the sugar reaches the hard crack stage, or 305 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 7 minutes. Whisk the butter and salt into the sugar mixture. Gradually pour in the cream and vanilla taking care since the mixture will bubble up. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar reaches soft ball stage, 240 degrees F on the thermometer, about 5 minutes more. Immediately remove from the heat and cool for a minute. Ladle a couple tablespoons of warm caramel over some of the nut clusters, to make the spider bodies. Then press 6 pieces of licorice into the warm caramel to make the legs. Repeat with the remaining caramel and licorice. (It&#39;s helpful to have an extra hand here, since the caramel can set quickly. If caramel hardens, warm over very low heat. ) Let spiders cool 15 minutes. Meanwhile, put the chocolates in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with 1-inch or so of water to a very slow simmer; set the bowl over, but not touching, the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, put the chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue heat until completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes more.) Spoon about 1 tablespoon of melted chocolate on top of each spider. Sprinkle with sprinkles or chocolate curls, if desired. Let cool until firm. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel]&quot; 57424,&quot;Blueberry Greek Old-Fashioned Doughnut 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus more if needed 1 cup cake flour 2 teaspoons baking powder Pinch kosher salt 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 2 tablespoons butter 1 whole egg plus 1 egg yolk 2/3 cup plain Greek yogurt 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, thawed and juice reserved 1 1/2 liters canola oil 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/4 cup whole milk Pinch salt Lemon juice Instructions: For the doughnuts: Mix the all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder and salt with a whisk until homogenous. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the sugar and butter until smooth, then add the eggs. Add the yogurt and mix until smooth. Slowly add the dry ingredients, then add the blueberries and juice. Do not over-mix! If the mix is too wet, add a bit of flour. Cover and let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge. Heat the oil until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 350 degrees F (less and you will get greasy doughnuts, more you will get burnt doughnuts). Roll out the dough on a floured surface, roughly 3/4-inch thick, then cut out the doughnuts into any shape you want. Drop the doughnuts into the hot oil a few at a time. Pay attention, this next bit is important; cook them just until they float, about 20 seconds. As soon as they float, flip them over. Once you flip them, do not mess with them!!! Just let them cook. When they are completely done on one side, flip them and cook on the other side. Again, do not mess with the doughnuts! Let them cook until done! Pull the doughnuts out and let them cool on a wire rack. For the glaze: Mix up the confectioners&#39; sugar, milk, salt and lemon juice to taste. When the doughnuts are cool to the touch, glaze them. Then eat and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 57425,&quot;Savory Tuna Burgers 3 (6-ounce) cans light tuna in water, drained 1/3 cup light mayonnaise 3 tablespoons seasoned dry bread crumbs 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon hot sauce 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 hamburger buns or Kaiser rolls 1 beefsteak tomato, sliced 1/4 cup thinly sliced sweet pickles (such as gherkins) Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the tuna, mayonnaise, bread crumbs, parsley, mustard, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix well and shape the mixture into four equal patties, each about 1-inch thick. If you&#39;re stopping here: Wrap the burgers tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months. Thaw completely in the refrigerator or microwave for 3 to 4 minutes on LOW before cooking. When you&#39;re ready to eat: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Unwrap the burgers and cook until golden brown and heated through, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Serve the burgers on buns with sliced tomato and pickles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 57426,&quot;Crawfish Grits and Blackened Shrimp 4 ounces butter 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 1 pound quick grits<br> 1 pound cleaned crawfish tail meat<br> 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan Salt and pepper 2 teaspoons olive oil or butter 8 ounces jumbo shrimp (16/20)<br> 1/4 cup Cajun seasoning<br> Instructions: For the grits: Bring 7 cups water to a boil, then add the butter and heavy cream. Simmer for 2 minutes on medium heat. Stir in the grits while whipping until smooth (not grainy). Add the crawfish, while whipping, then add the Parmesan. Add salt and pepper to taste. For the shrimp: Heat a saute pan on medium-low heat with the olive oil. Lightly dust the shrimp in the Cajun seasoning on both sides. Sear for until tender, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

Transfer the breadcrumbs to a shallow bowl or lipped plate. Put the flour in a shallow bowl or plate. Break the eggs into another shallow bowl and whisk with the milk, and season with salt, and pepper to taste. To bread the meat: Dredge a cutlet in the flour, shaking off the excess; then dip it into the eggs, and finally coat the meat evenly with the breadcrumbs. Set on a piece of waxed paper or baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining cutlet. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a medium non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. While the butter is still foaming add the breaded cutlets and cook, swirling the skillet in a tight circle (this keeps the cutlets moving around the skillet), until golden brown and cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes for the first side. Turn the meat and cook 1 minute on the second side to crisp the breading. Transfer to a plate and cover very loosely with foil while you cook the other cutlet. Serve with the lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 57428,&quot;Loin of Pork with Bay Leaves 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 garlic cloves, bruised and crushed with the flat side of a knife 1 teaspoon salt 6 peppercorns, bruised 16 bay leaves, 6 crumbled, plus more whole leaves for garnish 1 medium onion, finely sliced One 4-pound boneless pork loin, plus the bones 1/2 cup white wine Instructions: In a small bowl mix the olive oil, garlic, salt, peppercorns, and crumbled bay leaves and rub the mixture all over the meat. Put the pork on a large dish or in a large plastic bag and cover the dish or tie up the bag and leave in the refrigerator if you&#39;ve got steeping time; otherwise - if you&#39;re about to start cooking it - just leave it out. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a roasting pan with the onion. Strew over the onion 10 whole bay leaves. Place the pork, including its marinade, on top and the bones all around, if they fit and if you&#39;ve got them. Roast in the oven for about 1 3/4 hours or to an internal temperature of 150 to 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, basting regularly. Remove the pork, scraping burnt bits off, to a plate or carving board and let it sit. On the stove at moderate heat, pour the wine and 1/2 cup boiling water over the bones, bay, garlic, and onion. Let it bubble up and reduce by about a third, and then remove the bones gingerly and strain the liquid contents into a saucepan. Heat, correct the seasoning, and add liquid as you like to make a good, thin, not-quite gravy. Carve the loin, put the slices on a big warmed plate, sprinkle with salt, and pour over a little of the juice-gravy, then tent with foil and leave in the turned-off oven while you eat the starter. It is a bit prinky, I know, but it will look fabulous if, when you take it out, you arrange, Napoleonically, some more bay leaves around the edges of the dish with the bay-scented pork. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 57429,&quot;Zucchini Carpaccio 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 red Fresno cl, finely sliced 1 lemon, zested<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 large zucchini, ends trimmed<br> 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan 3 large fresh basil leaves, cut into chiffonade<br> Flaky sea salt, for garnish, optional<br> Instructions: In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, Fresno cl, lemon zest and a pinch of salt and black pepper until emulsified.

Drop the artichoke hearts in a bowl of water with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to prevent oxidation. Cook the artichoke hearts in the vegetable stock until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Cut the artichokes into bite-size pieces and toss in a bowl with some salt, pepper, a few drizzles of olive oil, the parsley, red pepper flakes, a little lemon juice, a few pinches sugar and a splash of red wine vinegar. Cut the tomatoes and marinate with some salt and pepper, a few drizzles of olive oil and a little red wine vinegar. Heat the balsamic vinegar in a small saucepan and simmer over medium heat until reduced to a syrup. Chill the reduced balsamic vinegar until ready to serve. Alternate the tomatoes, artichokes, basil leaves and mozzarella on each skewer. Drizzle a little balsamic reduction over each skewer and season with salt and pepper.

Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and follow the directions for your machine to freeze the guanabana mix to the consistency of a sorbet. Once the mixture has become somewhat solid, pour the icepop mix into an ice cube tray and insert the cinnamon sticks. They will act as the handles of the icepop. Place in a freezer and freeze until solid, about 8 to 10 hours. To make the martini: Fill a martini shaker with ice. Pour the gin and pineapple juice into the shaker. Cover and shake for 1 minute. Place the icepop into a chilled martini glass and strain the martini over it. &quot;,&quot;[Gin, Pineau des Charentes, C?tes de Provence]</p><p>Given the following recipe, provide the wine types that would pair well with the recipe.

Heat a grill pan over high heat. Lightly brush the grill with oil and cook the squid and shrimp until just cooked through, about 1 minute. Cut the squid into pieces and set aside with the shrimp. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to your preferred shape. I like to pull it out like an elongated oval, but you can make an octagon if you are feeling clever. Place it onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Spread the tomato sauce on the dough working from the center outward. Liberally cover the whole mess with the grated Gruyere. Arrange your seafood as you like it. Stand the clams upright on the pizza so that when they open in the oven, the \\liquor\\ inside stays mainly in the shell. Roughly tear the fresh mozzarella and place that among the sea critters. Drizzle a little of the oil from the anchovies over the whole pizza. Pop the pizza into the oven and cook until the cheese has melted but is not brown, about 6 to 7 minutes. Scatter the bok choy over the pizza and cook until the pizza is brown and crisp and the bok choy is wilted. You don&#39;t want the bok choy to dry out. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Albari?o]</p><p>&quot; 57445,&quot;Miso Cod with Edamame Rice 4 6-ounce cod fillets 2 tablespoons white miso paste 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 4 teaspoons honey 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger 1 cup long-grain white rice, rinsed well Kosher salt 2 carrots, thinly sliced on an angle 1 cup frozen shelled edamame, thawed 2 scallions, sliced 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds Freshly ground pepper Instructions: Preheat the broiler. Place the cod fillets on a foil-lined baking sheet. Stir the miso, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, the honey and ginger in a small bowl until smooth. Rub the cod all over with about 2 tablespoons of the sauce. Arrange flat-side down and spread the remaining sauce over the top of the fillets. Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in the rice and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Return to a boil, then stir and reduce the heat to medium low. Add the carrots on top of the rice, cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle the edamame on top, cover and let stand, 5 minutes. Meanwhile, broil the cod until the sauce is browned and the fish flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness. Fluff the rice to mix in the carrots and edamame. Add half the scallions and sesame seeds and the remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil and stir to combine; season with salt and pepper. Divide the rice among plates. Top with the cod and sprinkle with the remaining scallions and sesame seeds. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 57446,&quot;Seafood cl Rellenos 4 large pasilla or poblano cl peppers 4 ears corn, husks and silk removed 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 onion, sliced 2 garlic cloves, whole 1 pound tomatoes, cut in halves or fourths 1 cup water 1 ounce capers 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 4 large fresh epazote leaves, whole 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 1 pound crab meat 8 ounces Crema Mexicana or sour cream 1 ounce capers Picked cilantro leaves, whole, for garnish Instructions: Roast the peppers over a gas burner or on the grill, turning each cl until it is charred all over. Place in a closed plastic bag, 10 to 15 minutes. Peel the skin and rinse the peppers to clean the surface of excess skin. Cut a slit on the side of each cl lengthwise, being careful not to cut through the cl. Carefully remove the seed sack and the veins.

Hold the pomegranate over a pot and cut into it with a small sharp knife. The juice will come rushing out. Squeeze the pomegranates until 3/4 to 1 cup of juice is produced. Store-bought pomegranate juice can be used when fresh are not in season. Add the vinegar, peppercorns, cloves and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then turn the heat down to a simmer and reduce the liquid by half, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, cover the chicken with plastic wrap on meat safe board and pound to 1/4-inch thickness. Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper, to taste. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil. Heat a second medium-sized skillet over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan. Add the pancetta to the smaller skillet and cook until crisp, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the potatoes and shallots in thin layer and season with a little salt and black pepper, to taste, and the red pepper flakes. Cook, turning occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes. In the larger skillet add the chicken and cook for 8 minutes, turning once. Remove the chicken to serving plates. Strain the reduced pomegranate sauce into the skillet with the chicken and scrape up any bits from the bottom of the pan, then turn off the heat. Add the arugula to a large bowl and drizzle with the lemon and about 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Spoon the pomegranate sauce over the chicken. Top the chicken with the salad and figs and serve the potato hash alongside. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Grenache Blanc, Albari?o]&quot; 57448,&quot;Chilean Suckling Pig BBQ 1 (15 to 20 pound suckling pig 8 cups Marinade, recipe follows 3 cups vegetable oil 4 1/2 cups dry white wine (recommended: Chilean Sauvignon Blanc) 1 1/2 cups chopped onions or scallions 3/4 cup minced fresh Italian parsley leaves 3 teaspoons chopped garlic 6 teaspoons dried thyme 6 teaspoons dried oregano 3 teaspoons black pepper 3 teaspoons ground cumin 6 teaspoons salt Instructions: Break the spine of the pig with a cleaver from head to tail to allow the animal to lie flat on the grill. Marinate the pig for 2 hours before placing it over the coals. Prepare the barbecue pit with coals. The coals are ready when they glow and are covered with a white ash. Have extra coals and oak wood on the side to add to the fire when needed, enough to keep the fire burning for 3 hours. To gauge the temperature of the fire pit, hold your hand 18 inches away from the coals. You should be able to hold your hand over the fire for 4 to 5 seconds before pulling it away. If you can hold your hand longer over the fire it means there is not enough heat, if less the coals are too hot. Remove the pig from the marinade. Place the pig rib cage facing down towards the coals and cook for about 2 1/2 hours. Do not leave the fire unattended. Turn the pig on to its back and cook for another 1/2 to 1 hour, or until the pigs skin is crisp and the internal temperature reaches a minimum of 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Throughout the cooking time, check the fire temperature constantly and move the coals around to create a uniform temperature to prevent burning the pig. Once the pig is done cooking, serve with fresh salads, chimichurri, and plenty of Chilean wine. Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. This marinade can be prepared a day in advance. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Tempranillo]&quot; 57449,&quot;Cookie Cutter Roll Cookies 2/3 cup butter 1 cup granulated sugar 2 eggs 1/4 cup milk 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon vanilla 1/4 teaspoon salt 4 cups all-purpose flour Decorating Frosting, recipe follows 2 cups confectioners sugar, sifted 1 teaspoon butter (melted) 1/2 teaspoon vanilla Milk or cream to moisten Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Butter the bottoms and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans; dust with flour, and tap out the excess. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the butter, sugar and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then the vanilla until combined. Alternate folding the flour mixture and the milk into the batter with a spatula, adding the flour in three additions and the milk in two, starting and ending with the flour, until just smooth. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake the cakes on the same oven rack until golden on top and the centers spring back to the touch, 35 to 40 minutes. Rotate the pans about halfway through if they seem to be browning unevenly. Let cool in the pans about 10 minutes, then turn out onto cooling racks and let cool completely. For the frosting: While the cakes cool, beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Gradually beat in the confectioners&#39; sugar. Once it&#39;s all been added, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat until white and fluffy. Add 2 tablespoons of the milk, and beat to incorporate. Beat in the remaining milk, one tablespoon at a time (the frosting will be spreadable but not runny). To assemble: Place 1 cake layer right-side up on a cake plate or stand, and spread with 1 cup of the frosting. Top with the second cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 57451,&quot;Chicken with Ginger Beet Noodles 1 pound spiralized beets 3 tablespoons rice vinegar 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons grated peeled fresh ginger 2 cloves garlic, grated 1 large serrano cl pepper, thinly sliced (seeded for less heat) 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 8 ounces each) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1/4 cup toasted sesame oil 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed Sliced scallions and fresh mint, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Do not trim any excess fat off the meat; this fat will naturally baste the meat and keep it moist during the long cooking time.<br> Using your hands or a shaker-top jar, sprinkle the brisket liberally with the rub. Let it sit for about 5 minutes and pat the spices into the meat but do not rub-this mixture will form a dark savory crust on the meat, often referred to as the sought after \\burnt-ends.\\ Set aside on a clean tray until ready to cook.<br> If using a charcoal grill, place a drip pan between the 2 piles of white-gray ashed briquettes (on the charcoal grate). Pour the beer into the drip pan. Before placing the meat on the grill, place the soaked wood chips directly on the coals. You will need to add charcoal every hour to maintain the heat. If using a gas grill, place a drip pan with the beer in the upper left corner of the gas grill directly on top of the flavorizer bars or ceramic rock. Place the soaked wood chips in a smoker box.<br> Place the brisket in the center of the cooking grate, fat side up, over indirect medium-low heat. Cover and cook slowly for 4 to 5 hours at 325 degrees to 350 degrees or until an instant read thermometer inserted into the middle of the brisket registers 190 to 200 degrees. The meat should be very tender and falling apart. It will feel like the consistency of butter when you insert it with the probe of the thermometer. Remember: Do not turn the meat during the entire cooking time.<br> Let the meat rest for 20 minutes or until cool enough to handle. The recipe can be made in advance up to this point and, once it is cool, wrapped in 3 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil. To reheat the brisket, leave in foil and heat for about 1 hour at 250 degrees. For a crispier crust, remove the foil at the end and put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes. Slice against the grain and serve with the Texas Vinegar-cl Hot Sauce if desired. In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix well. The rub will keep in an airtight container for up to 6 months.Good for Seasoning: Beef (brisket, beef shoulder); pork; chicken Whisk all the ingredients together in a medium nonreactive bowl. Pour the sauce into a glass bottle with a top.
