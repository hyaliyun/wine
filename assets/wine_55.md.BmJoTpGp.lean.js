We're talking pure velvet, the way the wine glides over the palate with hardly a wrinkle. Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6C8 years with ease. Expensive, yes, and only 344 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.","designation":"Reserve","title":"Chateau St. Jean 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Full, creamy and soft, this is a rich Champagne, very much a food wine.

Put this bottle aside.","designation":"Riserva","title":"Enzo Boglietti 2004 Riserva  (Barolo)"},{"country":"US","description":"This eagerly anticipated Drew Bledsoe/Chris Figgins collaboration is a serious effort, dusty, dense, and dark. To begin are whiffs of cinnamon, smoke, cured meat and bacon; then come tight, dry, stone-soaked flavors of cassis and sweet black fruits.

A dazzling debut.","designation":"","title":"Doubleback 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))"},{"country":"US","description":"This has been one of Etude's best bottlings, and 2007 was a great year. If you enjoy sheer, decadent deliciousness in your Pinot Noirs, this is one for you. The palate first is struck by the rich waves of cherry pie filling, raspberry essence and sweet, vanilla-tinged, smoky oak. Then it discovers the soft silkiness, and finally the firm, fine tannins kick in, providing structure.

The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance.

Notable for the power of fruit, offering a blast of cherries, red currants, red licorice and pomegranates, while oak adds sweet, smoky toastiness. A success of the vintage. Give it until mid-2011 to come around.","designation":"Rancho Santa Rosa Vineyard","title":"Longoria 2008 Rancho Santa Rosa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)"},{"country":"US","description":"A very rich Pinot Noir, filled with delicious cherry, raspberry, cedar and spice flavors, as well as an umami bacon smokiness. Balanced with crisp acidity and very fine tannins. Beautiful now and through 2013.","designation":"Toulouse Vineyard","title":"Baxter 2007 Toulouse Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)"},{"country":"at","description":"Classic honey and lemon flavors are so fresh despite the liquorous texture that this is like drinking an elixir. The botrytis dryness is still developing and now the wine shows the most wonderful primary fruit flavor.","designation":"Kellerberg Trockenbeerenauslese","title":"Dom?ne Wachau 2009 Kellerberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Wachau)"},{"country":"es","description":"Bright, snappy and somewhat high in acidity, but also vibrant and excellent as a whole. The fruit falls squarely into the plum, raspberry and red currant spectrum, while that acidity pushes the wine to run and run. A dynamo with length, character, structure and angularity. Probably not for those who prefer dark, lush RDDs. Drinkable now but could still use another five years of time on its side.","designation":"El Picn","title":"Pago de los Capellanes 2004 El Picn  (Ribera del Duero)"},{"country":"fr","description":"Seriously crisp, this is a wine for acid freaks; don't even think about serving it as an apritif. However, with the right dish (think flavorful fish in a cream sauce), some real magic could happen. The austerity of the palate is softened a bit by easy-to-like flavors of toast, spice and citrus that follow through to the long finish. Give this one a few years in the cellar to show its best.","designation":"Clos Saint Urbain Grand Cru Rangen De Thann","title":"Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2007 Clos Saint Urbain Grand Cru Rangen De Thann Riesling (Alsace)"},{"country":"US","description":"A nice, silky and tasty Pinot Noir.

A Yum Yum type of rich RDD with a finish defined by baked blackberry and molasses. Drink nowC2013.","designation":"Tinus","title":"Garca Figuero 2006 Tinus  (Ribera del Duero)"},{"country":"US","description":"One of the cleaner, brisker and more balanced Viogniers on the market.

Racy and complex, and despite the power, it's delicate.","designation":"","title":"Koehler 2008 Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)"},{"country":"it","description":"Il Palazzone opens with a lean, compact appearance and a bright ruby color. The bouquet delivers a steady aromatic lineup of cherries, wild berries, blue flowers and light shadings of spice.

Tasted by a three-person panel, the wine was unanimously well liked, with one reviewer finding it more hard and \\"clacky\\" than the others.","designation":"Les Bessards","title":"Delas Frres 2007 Les Bessards  (Hermitage)"},{"country":"US","description":"This lovely Petite Sirah preserves the variety's full-bodied richness, but the tannins are so gentle, it's drinkable now. Shows deep, ripe flavors of blackberries and black currants, with meaty notes of grilled beef and a chocolaty, peppery finish.

Really hits the spot and then fades away in no hurry. A smoking-good crianza that hammers home the fact that Ismael Arroyo's wines are still leaders in RDD. Drink nowC2015.","designation":"Crianza","title":"Val Sotillo 2006 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)"},{"country":"es","description":"Butter, toast and resiny aromas tell you immediately that it's barrel fermented, but unlike some of the competition, this wine manages to hold onto its core of green apple, white peach and pear without letting the oak interfere. Excellent with food, and it improves rapidly with each ten-minute interval. A great example of oak-aged Verdejo. Drink now.","designation":"Habis Old Vines","title":"Shaya 2008 Habis Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda)"},{"country":"fr","description":"A wine with seeming universal appeal. It's medium to full, with a finely textured palate full of interesting olive, coffee, spice, herbs and garrigue.

You could serve it now or wait three or four more years.","designation":"","title":"Casanova di Neri 2005  Brunello di Montalcino"},{"country":"fr","description":"Focused, layered nose of pure black berry fruit, forest floor, earthy, gamy notes with strong underlying minerality. Concentrated flavors of jammy plum fruit, smoke, asphalt, cracked black pepper with lifted violet notes.

Ripe, citrusy tropical fruits and green apples, oak, minerals, racy acidity, lees and the byproducts of malolactic fermentation all come together to produce a rich, complex, fruity young Chardonnay. Gets better as it warms in the glass.","designation":"Biagini Vineyard","title":"Clos La Chance 2008 Biagini Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)"},{"country":"au","description":"The rare aun Grenache you might consider cellaring for more than a couple of years, the 2007 Romas features dark, plummy fruit accented with hints of coffee and chocolate.

The silky and smooth mouthfeel would work with meat dishes or hearty pasta.","designation":"Campogiovanni","title":"San Felice 2005 Campogiovanni  (Brunello di Montalcino)"},{"country":"US","description":"Caramelized oak dominates this Pinot Noir. Below that toasty char is an extremely ripe wine that seems to define long hangtime. The cherry flavors approach red currants and have suggestions of shriveled berries that veer into licorice and grilled fruit. It's quite complex, but juvenile, with a youthful impertinence. Best to give it 3C5 years to come around.","designation":"Durell Vineyard","title":"Three Sticks 2007 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)"},{"country":"at","description":"Pineapple and orange zest start this compelling wine.

Rita Hills)"},{"country":"US","description":"Made from Smillon and Sauvignon Blanc, this is a very dry, quite acidic white wine that scrapes and scours the palate with tartness.

The sweetness does not show; this is almost dry, with compact fruit flavors of lemon, orange, candied pineapple, hints of pear and a firm thread through the middle that gives it some phenolic bite.
