bones: nicely structured with firm tannins and good supportive acidity. it's not light and flabby, but it is very drinkable. flavors? think of cola laced with black-cherry juice with a dash of

mourvèdre, 13% syrah and 27% grenache that'll be tricky to ask for by name but is worth the effort to find and share. this blend shows off brooding dark dollops of spicy fruit, herb and tobacco that

finish is full of lemon dryness.","designation":"Alsace"},{"country":"fr","description":"this is a big, bold, powerful white, a blend of 80% chardonnay, 15% viognier and 5% sauvignon blanc. oaky aromas of toast, hazelnut and sweet spice abound throughout, gracing the fruit elements of honeydew, baked apple, peach pit, clove-spiked orange and buttered nuts. the mouthfeel is round and broad, but with ample acidic lift to the palate and through the finish to keep things fresh. a gingered peach-white tea flavor lingers on the close; try after 2017.","designation":"Languedoc-Roussillon"},{"country":"it","description":"aromas of spring wildflower and white stone fruit lead the nose while the foaming, off-dry palate doles out creamy yellow pear and candied citrus peel. bright acidity lifts the rich flavors.","designation":"Veneto"},{"country":"at","description":"freshly cut green apple with a touch of lemon signals great refreshment on

pineapple, lime, golden apple and lemon tea. a bracing minerality underscores gently oaked, finishing notes of melba toast and almond butter.","designation":"Oregon"},{"country":"at","description":"voluptuous notions of orange oil segue into a more earthy notion of lemon-anointed autumn leaves. lots goes on here: the fresh peel of rosy apples, grated lemon zest and wet earth, all combined on a very smooth palate. this is highly drinkable and full of moreish allure.","designation":"Kamptal"},{"country":"es","description":"this rioja reserva hits all the standard checkpoints with aplomb. earthy loamy mossy aromas of plum and berry fruits feature a hint of tobacco and vanilla. in the mouth, this is full, with round but
