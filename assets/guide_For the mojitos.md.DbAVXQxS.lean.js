Pour into a decorative bowl and chill in the refrigerator, about 20 minutes. While the dip is chilling, make fruit \\critters\\ using the fruits for bodies, pretzel sticks for legs, and raisins for eyes. Here are some suggestions, but use your imagination! Quarter and core an apple. Place the flesh side down so the peel is facing up. This will be the shell for a \\beetle. Cut 1 raisin in 1/2, place the inside down towards 1 end of the apple to make \\eyes\\ for your beetle. Break 4 pretzel sticks in half and insert into the bottom for legs. Carefully thread grapes onto a pretzel stick to make a caterpillar. Stick 2 sunflower seeds into one of the end grapes to make eyes. You can also use 2 kinds of grapes to make a multi colored caterpillar. For a fly or bee: Cut off the last 2 inches of a banana, so you have a piece with a slight curve and a tapered end. This will be the body. Carefully stick a pretzel stick into the cut surface so half is in the banana and half is sticking out. Core a strawberry and carefully stick in onto the other half of the pretzel stick to attach the \\head. Cut a raisin in 1/2 and stick the cut side onto either side of the strawberry to make \\eyes. Cut 2 slices of apple and carefully stick into the banana to make wings.

You do this by centering the straw on the bottom pointed end of the fruit, pushing up through the inside to the top and popping off the stem in one smooth motion. Staying centered on the fruit with the straw is the key to quickly hulling and removing the bitter core of strawberries. (You can alternatively cut the stems and white bitter flesh out with a knife.)<br> In a blender, combine the strawberries, blueberries, coconut water and strawberry yogurt and cover with the lid. Press the setting for puree and let it run until the texture is nice and smooth, at least 30 seconds.<br> Pour into two 16-ounce Mason jars (or glasses), or four 8-ounce jars.

Combine the milk and 1 teaspoon of the salt in a 3-quart or larger saucepan over medium-high heat. Watching the pot, bring the milk to a gentle simmer at the edges, and then whisk in the vinegar. The milk will separate into white curds and yellowish whey. Let it sit 10 minutes to allow the curds to gather together, then gently pour the curds through the cheesecloth-lined sieve, saving the whey for another purpose (such as stock for soup making). Drain the curds until you have creamy curds, and set aside. For the spiced butter, combine the butter, black peppercorns, cumin, cloves, bay leaves, ginger root slices and cinnamon in a small saute pan over medium heat and cook until the butter browns at the edges, about 3 minutes. Let the butter steep until just warm to the touch. Pour the contents of the pan through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to remove all of the butter. Discard the spices and ginger. Heat a 12-inch or larger skillet over high heat. When hot, add the spiced butter (holding back the brown deposits at the bottom of the bowl), minced ginger, collard greens, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the ground pepper, stirring to coat the greens with the butter. Cook over high heat, stirring often, until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the brown butter bits at the bottom of the bowl, and stir to combine.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the noodles until pliable but still very al dente, about 3 minutes less than the package cooking time. Drain, but do not rinse. (The starch from the noodles will help them stick to the sides of the pan.) Spread on a baking sheet. Cut 4 of the noodles crosswise into thirds. Toss the breadcrumbs and 2 tablespoons Parmesan together in a small bowl. Spray a 10-inch tube pan with cooking spray. Coat with the Parmesan breadcrumbs, tapping out the excess. Combine the garlic, carrot, celery and onion in a food processor or mini food processor and process to a paste. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Prick each sausage with a fork and cook until browned, 5 to 6 minutes; remove and set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon olive oil to the skillet and crumble in the beef and pork. Cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 4 minutes. Add the aromatic paste from the food processor. Cook, stirring occasionally, until it dries out, about 3 minutes. Make a space in the middle of the pan and add the tomato paste. Cook, stirring the tomato paste until it darkens a shade or two, about 2 minutes, then stir into the meat. Season with the oregano, red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add the white wine and cook until reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup water and simmer rapidly until very thick, 4 to 5 minutes. Combine the ricotta, egg, basil, parsley and 1/2 cup Parmesan in a medium bowl. Line the prepared pan with the whole lasagna noodles, overlapping slightly. Spread about half of the meat sauce in the bottom of the pan on top of the noodles. Nestle the sausages into the meat sauce, pressing down to submerge them about halfway. Top with a third of the sliced mozzarella, breaking the slices to fit. Top with half of the cut noodle pieces and press down gently. Spread the ricotta mixture over the noodles and top with another third of the mozzarella. Top with the remaining cut noodles and press again. Spread over the remaining meat sauce and top with the remaining mozzarella. Fold over the noodles used to line the pan to encase the filling and brush with olive oil. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Cover the timpano with foil and bake until heated through, 30 to 35 minutes. Uncover and bake until the top is crisp and golden-brown, about 30 minutes more. Let rest 45 minutes to 1 hour before unmolding. Run an offset spatula or butter knife around the edges of the pan to ensure it can be removed with ease. Unmold the lasagna by inverting it onto a serving platter. Arrange the basil sprigs in the middle. Slice with a serrated knife and serve with the marinara on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Barbera, Gavi]&quot; 60646,&quot;The Best Sweet Potato Casserole 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for buttering the baking dish 3 to 4 large sweet potatoes (about 1 3/4 pounds), peeled and cubed<br> 1/2 cup milk 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 large eggs 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 3/4 cup chopped pecans Instructions: For the sweet potatoes: Add 1 3/4 pounds peeled and cubed sweet potatoes to a large pot of salted water.

Dissolve the yeast in the water. With the mixer running at low speed, add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Add the eggs and mix well. Add the butter and mix at medium speed until smooth, about 10 minutes. Do not skimp on the mixing time; this is how the dough gets kneaded. Place the dough in a deep container, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and then refrigerate overnight. The next day, turn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Flour your rolling pin and roll the dough into a 12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. Transfer to an ungreased cookie sheet. Loosely drape plastic wrap over the dough and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the custard by combining the milk and vanilla bean in a small saucepan and bring just to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 minutes. Whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan. Pour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Pour into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to use. (The custard can be made up to 2 days in advance and kept refrigerated.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap from the dough and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. After 10 minutes, rotate the pan to ensure even cooking. When baked, immediately remove to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature.

Add the sugar, vanilla bean, and figs to the pot. Cover and bring to a full boil over medium heat. (Don&#39;t worry; it may look dry.) Stir the mixture and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Lower the heat, and cook uncovered at a full simmer for 50 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the little bubbles to be throughout the pot, not just at the edges. After 45 minutes, refrigerate a small amount of the liquid to see if it becomes syrupy. It should be like a soft fruit preserve. Keep cooking just until the liquid starts to gel when cold. If the liquid is too firm, add a little orange juice or water, cook for a minute, and test it again until it&#39;s right. Depending on how ripe the figs are, they will probably keep their shape, but it&#39;s fine if they don&#39;t. Discard the vanilla bean and serve or refrigerate. Before serving, toast or grill the bread and spread with goat cheese. Spoon the fig preserves on, then the grated orange zest if using, and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 60659,&quot;Souper Boule 1/2 cup low-sodium beef broth Pinch of ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon horseradish (do not drain) 4 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 large onions, thinly sliced 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme Kosher salt 1 8-inch round loaf sourdough bread 1 pound gruyere cheese, thinly sliced Chopped fresh parsley, for topping Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Slice the cabbage as thinly as possible, working from crown to stem end. Place shredded cabbage into a large nonreactive bowl. Grate your carrots or other vegetables with a box grater, and add to the cabbage. Add the salt and mustard. Using your hands, toss to combine all ingredients, crushing the mixture until it begins to release liquid, about 5 minutes.<br> Pack the sauerkraut: Place a wide-mouth funnel in the mouth of the jar. Pack the mixture into the jar, pressing down to squeeze out as much air and release more liquid. Tightly packed, there should be just enough to fill the quart jar to the shoulder, and liquid should rise above the cabbage mixture. Fill a smaller jar, like a half-pint or four-ounce jar, with water and seal. Place on top of the cabbage mixture to keep it submerged under the juices.<br> Ferment the sauerkraut: Cover the jar with a clean towel, and allow to stand at room temperature. Check daily to make sure the cabbage is still submerged in liquid. If it is not, give the mixture a good press to release more juices. If the cabbage still does not stay submerged, add just enough water to bring the level up. After two or three days you should see bubbles forming. Eventually you may see scum or even mold on top. This is normal; just skim it away. Begin tasting your kraut after the third day.

Add in the egg and beat until light and fluffy, about 1 more minute. Add in the milk and mix. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together, and then blend into the cream mixture. Divide the dough in half (thirds if you double your recipe), slightly flatten between 2 sheets of waxed paper and refrigerate for 1 hour (or freeze for 20 minutes). Roll out the dough 1/4-inch thick on a lightly floured surface and cut into shapes with a cookie cutter. Transfer the shapes to lightly greased cookie sheets and chill until firm, about 30 minutes. For the egg yolk glaze: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. While the dough is chilling, combine the egg yolk, 1 teaspoon water and food coloring. Paint the cookies (with a soft brush) with the egg yolk glaze. Bake the cookies for 6 to 7 minutes. Do not allow the cookies to brown. The cookies will be slightly puffed and the glaze will look crackled. Bake in 2 batches if you don&#39;t reroll the scraps. For the decorative white icing: While the cookies are baking, mix the powdered sugar, milk and egg whites. Make sure that it is thick and somewhat retains its shape. Remove the cookies from the oven to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Then, using a pastry bag or zip-top bag, pipe the cookies with the white icing to decorate. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 60757,&quot;Sweet and Spicy Plantain Chips 3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 3 tablespoons brown sugar<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika<br> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br> Pinch salt<br> 3 green plantains, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices<br> Instructions: Add the coconut oil to a large skillet.

Next, find a durable thick cloth and fold it over several times to create a square; this will steady the oysters as you shuck them and also protect your hand. Using the towel as a mitt, place the oyster, cup-side down in the palm of your towel-covered hand with the hinge facing you; have a small bowl handy to catch the delicious juice. Insert the tip of an oyster knife or dull butter knife as far into the hinge as it will go; don&#39;t jab it in there or you could break the shell. With gentle force, twist the knife back and forth to pry the shell open. Using the knife, cut the muscle away from the top shell, bend the shell back, and discard it. Run the knife underneath the oyster to detach it completely, but leave it in its shell. Tip out the briny liquor into the bowl and pour it back over the shucked oysters. Nestle the oysters in a bed of crushed ice or rock salt to keep them steady. Spoon the Cucumber Mignonette on top and serve as part of a raw shellfish bar. In a small bowl, combine the rice wine vinegar, shallots, ginger, cucumber, black pepper, and cilantro; mixing with a fork. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or up to the day before you plan to serve, to allow the flavors to come together.

Remove from oven and let cool on the cookie sheet. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Merlot]&quot; 60768,&quot;Edible Ornaments 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 2 teaspoons meringue powder 4 tablespoons water Candy (recommended: peppermints, lifesavers, M and M&#39;s, gum drops, etc.) Instructions: In a large bowl whisk together sugar, meringue powder and water. Using the icing as \\glue,\\ create a circle with candy to create a wreath. Decorate as you like with the candies. Allow to dry. When ready add a ribbon to each ornament. &quot;,&quot;[Sparkling wine, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 60769,&quot;Chocolate Coconut Napoleon 1/3 cup granulated sugar 6 large egg yolks 2 cups heavy cream 2 cups whole milk 13 ounces dark chocolate, finely chopped 1/4 cup Grand Marnier 3 1/4 cups shredded sweetened coconut 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 4 large eggs 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Instructions: CHOCOLATE SAUCE FOR GARNISH: Prepare the chocolate cream: The base of the chocolate cream is a creme anglaise, which is poured over chocolate to make a ganache. Pour half of the sugar into a small mixing bowl and set the remaining sugar aside. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. The mixture should be thick, smooth, and homogenous. Pour the heavy cream, milk, and remaining sugar into a non-reactive 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, place it over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Temper the egg mixture with the hot mixture by carefully pouring about 1/3 of the hot mixture into the egg mixture. Whisk immediately to keep the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan and place over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula. The liquid will begin to thicken. When it reaches 182 degrees on a candy thermometer and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, it is finished and should be removed from the heat. If you do not have a thermometer, you can tell that it is finished by using the following method: In one quick motion, dip the spatula into the creme anglaise and hold it down horizontally in front of you. With the tip of your finger, wipe a clean line down the center of the spatula. If the trail keeps its shape, the creme anglaise is ready. If the trail fills with liquid, cook it for another minute and repeat the test. The objective is to remove the creme anglaise from the heat just before it boils. If the creme anglaise boils, the egg yolks will scramble. If this happens, you can still use it if you mix it with a hand-held immersion blender, food processor, or a blender. You will need a blade to liquefy the scrambled egg pieces. Remove from the heat. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl and make a ganache by pouring the creme anglaise over the chocolate in two or three additions. Use a hand whisk to incorporate fully after each addition. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Whisk in the Grand Marnier. Place in the refrigerator to cool and set. As the cream cools, the cocoa butter in the chocolate will harden and hold everything together. The cream will also become more flavorful as it cools. If you have time, make this a day in advance to give the chocolate flavor time to develop. (The chocolate cream can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered with plastic wrap, for up to 3 days.) Prepare the tuiles: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Combine the coconut, sugar, eggs, and butter in a medium-size mixing bowl and mix with a hand whisk until well combined. Place a silicon mat on a baking sheet. (If you do not have a silicon mat, you can use a nonstick baking sheet.) Use a small offset spatula dipped in water to spread 4-inch circles of the tuile batter on the mat or baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake until evenly light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the tuiles to cool on a wire rack. Assemble the Napoleon: Place one tuile in the center of each plate. Dip a large spoon in hot water and roll it through the chocolate cream to form a quenelle, or egg-shaped scoop, of chocolate cream. Place the chocolate cream in the center of the tuile and repeat for the remaining plates. Top with a second tuile and another quenelle of chocolate cream. Top each with a third tuile. Garnish the plate with the chocolate sauce and creme anglaise. You could also use fresh berries in season or chocolate shavings. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Reds, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 60770,&quot;Kir Royale 1-ounce Cassis 4 ounces Champagne Lemon twist, optional garnish Instructions: Pour Cassis into a chilled champagne flute and top with champagne.

Grease 2 baking sheets and set aside. In a mixer, beat the butter and sour cream until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the flour and salt until the dough comes together and pulls away from the side of the bowl. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Divide dough into 4 even pieces and roll into 9 by 12-inch pieces about 1/4-inch thick. Set aside. For the filling: In a medium bowl, combine all 4 ingredients and mix until smooth. Divide the filling into 4 even portions, and spread even amounts of filling on each piece of rolled out dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll lengthwise and transfer to a cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough, placing 2 rolls on each cookie sheet. Bake until golden at the edges, about 35 to 45 minutes. Slice while still warm into 1 to 2- inch slices.

Gently toss until well combined. Place the lettuce in a large serving bowl. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt; toss to coat. Spoon the avocado salad over the lettuce, top with the goat cheese and season with more sea salt. Serve with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 60774,&quot;Kreplach 2 cups unbleached white flour 2 eggs, beaten 1 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons rendered chicken fat 2 medium onions, chopped 2 firmly packed cups boiled beef cut into slices (cooked flanken is best, but all leftover boiled or potted beef will do) 1/4 teaspoon allspice Salt and pepper to taste Chicken soup, store-bought or homemade Instructions: Mix together the flour, eggs, and salt, as if making pasta. You will probably need to add about 5 to 6 tablespoons of water to reach the desired elasticity in the dough. Work it on a floured board, kneading for about 10 minutes. When it&#39;s smooth and elastic, pull it into something resembling a square. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Place the chicken fat in a heavy saute pan over high heat. Add the onions and saute until the onions are medium-brown, about 10 minutes. Place the onions in the work bowl of a food processor, and add the sliced beef and allspice. Puree until smooth. Taste, and season well with salt and pepper. Roll out the kreplach dough into a large square, about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into smaller squares, about 2-inches each. You should have about 24 squares. Divide the beef mixture among them, placing a tablespoon or so of the beef mixture on the center of each square. Triangular kreplach are traditional; fold each square once to form a triangle, then pinch the edges with your fingers. You could also make square or rectangular kreplach, depending on how you fold and pinch. To cook the kreplach, drop them in a pot of boiling chicken soup. Traditionally, they are cooked for half an hour or so, until the noodle is soft. An alternative, giving the noodle a more AItalian@ bite, is to cook them for 15 minutes. Serve the kreplach in soup, 3 to 4 to each bowl. Note: Though it is traditional to serve these kreplach in chicken soup (3 to 4 per bowl), they can also make a terrific Jewish Apasta@ dish. For authenticity&#39;s sake, you can&#39;t use dairy products in the sauce but a thickened saute of mushrooms (in a vegetable oil, of course) would be a great topping Drink: Seltzer &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 60775,&quot;Lemon Yogurt Pancakes with Blueberry Topping 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 3/4 cup milk, plus more if necessary<br> 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 large eggs<br> 2 teaspoons lemon zest<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> Unsalted butter or nonstick cooking spray, for cooking<br> Blueberry Topping, recipe follows 1 1/2 cup frozen blueberries 1/4 cup sugar<br> 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br> Instructions: Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the milk, yogurt, eggs, lemon zest and vanilla in a separate bowl. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry until just combined. If the mixture is too dry, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk to thin it out. Allow the batter to rest at least 15 minutes. Preheat a griddle or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. Coat with the griddle or skillet with butter or nonstick spray. Ladle the pancake batter on the griddle. Cook until bubbles begin to form and the bottom of the pancake is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 2 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter. Keep the pancakes warm in the oven until ready to serve. Top with Blueberry Topping and serve warm. Combine the blueberries, sugar, lemon juice and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat. Use a fork to gently mash some of the blueberries and release their juices.

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside. Beat the butter and both sugars in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat on low speed until the yellow of the egg disappears, scraping down the bowl as needed. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed just until everything is combined. Set aside a handful of chocolate chunks and chips for topping the cookies, then stir in the remaining semisweet and white chocolate along with the potato chips, cranberries and pretzels. Scoop the dough into golf ball-size balls using a medium-size cookie scoop (2 1/2 ounces each). Arrange the cookie dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Insert the reserved chocolate chunks and chips into the cookie dough balls. Bake until the edges of the cookies are crisp and centers are still soft, 16 to 18 minutes. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if using, while still warm. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 60777,&quot;Brisket Sliders with Ranch 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 3-pound brisket 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 bay leaves 2 onions, cut into large chunks 2 carrots, cut into large chunks 1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes 2 cups cola 12 pretzel slider buns Pickled jalape?os, for topping 1 cup plain Greek yogurt 1/4 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon pickled jalape?o juice (optional) 2 tablespoons each chopped fresh parsley, dill and chives 1 teaspoon onion powder Instructions: Position a rack in the lowest part of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325? F. Make the brisket: Mix together the onion powder, paprika, allspice, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Rub the spice mix all over the brisket. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and then the brisket. Sear on all sides until a deep golden brown, about 7 minutes. Nestle the bay leaves, onions and carrots around the brisket. Pour in the tomatoes and cola and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook until the meat is very tender, about 3 hours. Meanwhile, make the ranch dressing: Mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise and pickled jalape?o juice, if using, in a small bowl. Add the parsley, dill, chives and onion powder and mix until combined. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Uncover the pot; let the meat and vegetables rest in the juices for about 30 minutes. Remove the brisket and slice against the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices.

Cook until the greens of the scallions are wilted and darkened with the oil and the garlic is tender and slightly golden, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, season with salt and cook while stirring until the tomatoes are softened, about 2 minutes. Add the clam juice and lemon juice, bring to a light simmer and stir. Taste, and if the tomatoes and lemon juice are too tart, add sugar and stir. Sprinkle the shrimp with salt and pepper and add to the pan. Cook on 1 side until the shrimp begins to turn opaque and curl slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Then toss and cook until they just begin to turn pink on the other side, 1 to 2 more minutes. (Shrimp cooks fast and there&#39;s a thin line between done and overdone; the best rule is to remove the pan from the heat as they begin to reach the finish line. Continue tossing and the heat of the pan will continue to cook them until done.)

While whisking constantly, slowly drizzle the hot liquid into the egg mixture. Return to the saucepan and, while whisking constantly and scraping the bottom of the pot, cook until tiny bubbles boil up, about 10 seconds. Strain the curd into a bowl and let cool to room temperature. Spread the cooled filling in the pie shell, then refrigerate for 2 hours. Decorate with berries, if you like. Pie Shell: 3 tablespoons solid vegetable shortening 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into pea-size bits 2 to 3 tablespoons ice water Nonstick vegetable spray, for coating pan Between 2 sheets of waxed paper, flatten the shortening out to 1/8-inch thickness. With a butter knife, score it into 1/2-inch squares. Freeze for 30 minutes, until stiff. Put the flour in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, pastry blender, or your fingertips, work in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. In the same manner, mix in the shortening squares. While sprinkling in the ice water, mix with your fingers just until the dough comes together in a ball. Pat it into a 3/4-inch-thick disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat a 9-inch pie pan with nonstick vegetable spray. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into an 11 1/2-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Fit it into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the dough, leaving about a 1-inch overhang, then fold the overhang under itself and decoratively crimp it against the rim of the plate. Prick the dough all over with a fork. Freeze for 20 minutes. Line the pie shell with aluminum foil and weight down with dried beans or pie weights. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil with the weights, lower the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for 8 minutes longer, or until lightly tanned. Set on a rack to cool. When lemons were out of season, or just too expensive, millions of bakers figured out how to make a tart \\curd-style\\ pie filling with vinegar. Cheap and always available, it turned out to be just the right stuff for adding some pucker to a pie. Jerry Lewis (yes, that Jerry Lewis) often reminisced about the wonderful vinegar pie that his grandma used to bake. O.K., this pie may sound a little...er, different, but don&#39;t be deterred. It was a real favorite a hundred years ago and if there ever was a pie that was deserving of re-discovery, this scrumptious old-time favorite is it. Of course Grandma Lewis didn&#39;t know about fancy-pant balsamic vinegar but that won&#39;t stop us from going upscale. Try it and get ready for a new-fangled flavor surprise. On its own, vinegar pie is truly amazing. Topped with fresh berries, it&#39;s the eighth wonder of the world. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 60786,&quot;Cornmeal-Crusted Catfish 1/2 cup whole milk 2 heaping tablespoons Miss Brown\\u2019s House Seasoning, recipe follows 10 catfish filets, about 4 ounces each<br> Vegetable oil, for frying<br> 2 1/2 cups finely ground yellow cornmeal<br> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br> Lemon wedges, for serving 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br> Instructions: Stir together the milk and 1 heaping tablespoon of the House Seasoning. Pour the milk mixture into a shallow baking dish large enough to hold the filets. Spread the filets in an even layer in the dish, turning to coat each side. Let marinate for about 1 hour in a cool place or the refrigerator. Pour enough oil into a large Dutch oven to come 2 inches up the side. Clip a deep-fry thermometer to the pot and heat over medium-high heat until the thermometer reaches 370 degrees F. Meanwhile, stir together the cornmeal, flour and remaining 1 heaping tablespoon House Seasoning in a paper bag. Working with a few filets at a time, remove them from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off. Place them in the paper bag and gently turn the bag over several times until the filets are evenly coated with the cornmeal mixture. Remove the filets and place them on a baking sheet while you repeat the process with the remaining filets. Working in batches, fry the filets until golden brown and crisp on the outside and moist and flaky inside, adjusting the heat to maintain temperature, about 5 minutes.

Set them up vertically, spine up, so that they can be your taco shell molds. For the taco shells: To make the taco shell batter, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Add the melted butter to a separate bowl and whisk in the milk, vanilla extract and almond extract. Then whisk in the egg whites. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix to form a smooth batter. To cook the shells, heat a skillet over medium heat. Grease it with butter and then spoon in 2 1/2 tablespoons of batter. Spread it out gently with the back of a spoon or offset spatula so you have an even circle. Cook until slightly brown on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until slightly brown on the second side, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove it from the skillet and gently fold it over the spine of the book to make a taco shell shape. Let cool on the book. Repeat with the remaining batter. For the fillings and toppings: To make the chocolate topping, place the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second increments, stirring after each, until melted. Let the chocolate cool slightly before topping the tacos. Let the ice cream soften a bit, fill the taco shells, drizzle with as much chocolate as you wish, top with nuts and enjoy! If you&#39;re making these in advance, stick them in the freezer, uncovered, for a few minutes until the chocolate hardens, and then wrap in plastic wrap and freeze until you&#39;re ready to eat them. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 60791,&quot;Chicken with Grapes 5 tablespoons butter 5 tablespoon lard 2 cups plus 1 tablespoon flour Freshly ground salt 4 tablespoons iced water 1 (3 pound) chicken 1/2 pound bacon slices Freshly ground pepper 1 teaspoon allspice 1 teaspoon paprika 1/3 cup dry sherry 1/3 cup sweet sherry 2 sage leaves 12 ounce seedless green grapes 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 egg yolk Instructions: To make pastry: Combine butter and lard with 2 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

These will start to come together into larger balls of dough. Take the dough out and work by hand for 2 minutes or until smooth, silky and elastic. Wrap in plastic and allow to rest in the refrigerator. Prepare the filling by mixing everything except the whole marjoram leaves together, checking the seasoning. Cut off pieces of the pasta and roll out on a lightly floured clean work surface to about 1mm thick, then cut into pieces about 14 by 14cm (6 by 6 inches). Place a good heaped teaspoon of filling on 1 side, then using a clean pastry brush and some water, lightly but evenly brush the pasta. Pinch 1 side of the pasta over the filling so it forms a parcel, then with your thumb or the base of your palm gently pat the pasta down all around the filling. (The most important thing about ravioli is it must be sealed completely, so if there are any rips, chuck them out.) Trim and cut the ravioli into shape with a knife or crinkly cutter. Cook the ravioli in salted, gently boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. Meanwhile, fry the marjoram leaves and sage leaves in the olive oil until crispy, then drain on kitchen paper. Put the cooked ravioli in a warmed small frying pan, add a little of the cooking water and another tablespoon of the grated pecorino, and toss. To serve, spoon the ravioli into a dish, sprinkle some of the crispy herbs on top, and add another grating of Parmesan and some freshly ground black pepper to finish. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Barolo, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]</li></ol><p>&quot; 60880,&quot;Monte Cristo Peanut oil, for frying 1 cup all-purpose flour<br> 1 cup soda water<br> 1 egg<br> 2 slices white pullman bread<br> 1 slice Swiss cheese 2 ounces black forest ham, sliced thin<br> 2 ounces deli turkey, sliced thin<br> 1 slice American cheese Powdered sugar, for dusting<br> Raspberry preserves, for serving Instructions: Fill a Dutch oven 3/4-inch deep with peanut oil and bring to 350 degrees F.

Wash and core the bell peppers, then cut them into 1 by 1-inch pieces.<br> Wash the chicken and pat dry. Cut the chicken into strips or leave the breast whole (add 5 minutes of cooking time to whole/large pieces of chicken).<br> Cut each sausage link on the bias into 4 pieces. In a nonstick 14-inch saute pan over medium-high heat add the olive oil and sausage, and brown the sausage, for about 5 minutes. Once the sausage is browned, add the chicken, and brown it on all sides, about 5 to 10 minutes. Once the chicken is browned, reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, all of the bell peppers, the jalapenos and potatoes. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning and 3 turns of a peppermill, or a good pinch of black pepper. Saute on medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the flour and cook it until the roux is light golden brown, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low. Carefully add the sherry, avoiding the open flame, to deglaze pan. Add 1 can of beef stock and stir to combine. Mixture will thicken, while simmering on low heat for 10 minutes; if you like thinner gravy add more beef stock until the desired thickness is formed. Season with more salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer the chicken pisano to a serving bowl and serve.

Form dough into desired shapes, such as round loaves. Beat remaining egg and paint dough with egg wash. Transfer dough to a pan. Let rise again, covered, until doubled, 1 to 2 hours. Paint again with egg wash. Bake until the loaves are deeply brown and sound hollow when tapped, 25 to 30 minutes. Let fully cool. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 60893,&quot;Zucchini Casserole 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 4 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds (about 2 1/2 pounds) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 yellow bell pepper, diced 1/2 medium onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 cup sour cream 4 large eggs 8 ounces shredded Cheddar (about 2 cups) 1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning 2 cups cornflakes 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Put a large colander inside a large bowl. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add one-third of the zucchini to the skillet, arrange in a single later and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the zucchini begins to soften and is golden brown in spots, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the prepared colander. Repeat to cook remaining zucchini in 2 more batches, using 2 tablespoons of butter and sprinkling with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper for each batch. Transfer each batch to the colander.<br> Add 1 tablespoon of butter to the same skillet along with the bell pepper and onion and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any brown bits with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Let cool for 5 minutes, then fold into the zucchini. Transfer the mixture to a 2-quart casserole dish.<br> Whisk together the sour cream, eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a large bowl. Fold in the Cheddar, parsley and Italian seasoning. Pour over the zucchini mixture, making sure that some of the egg mixture sinks down to the bottom.<br> Microwave the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a medium bowl until melted. Fold in the cornflakes and hot sauce. Sprinkle evenly over the top of the casserole. Bake until the eggs are set and the cornflakes are deeply golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 60894,&quot;Sponge Toffee 1 cup sugar 1 cup corn syrup 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 tablespoon baking soda Instructions: Combine the sugar, syrup, and vanilla in a medium-size saucepan. Stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Continue to cook to 300 degrees F, on a candy thermometer or hard crack stage, about 10 minutes. Cook&#39;s Note: You can use a candy thermometer or a simple trick: take a spoon and drop a tiny drizzle of the mixture into a bowl of water. If it crystallizes, you&#39;ve reached the hard crack stage. Remove from the heat, using a wooden spoon, stir in the baking soda quickly. It will become frothy. Pour into an 8 by 8-inch/20 by 20-cm pan, lined with parchment paper and buttered. Let cool for about 30 minutes and break into pieces. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 60895,&quot;Creamy Polenta with Raisins and Pine Nuts 1 quart chicken broth 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup polenta or yellow cornmeal 1/3 cup heavy cream 4 tablespoons unsalted butter Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/4 cup raisins 1/4 cup pine nuts 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan Instructions: In a large pot, bring the chicken broth and salt to a boil over medium heat. Gradually whisk in the cornmeal in a slow steady stream. The liquid will be absorbed and the cornmeal will lock up; don&#39;t freak, just whisk through it. Lower the heat and continue to whisk until the polenta is thick and smooth, about 20 minutes. Add the cream and 2 tablespoons of the butter; continue to stir until incorporated and creamy, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Remove the polenta from the heat and pour it into a small baking dish. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place a small skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Swirl the pan over the heat and cook the butter until golden and nutty, about 1 minute. Add the raisins and pine nuts, tossing to coat in the brown butter. Pour the raisins and pine nuts over the top of the polenta and sprinkle with the Parmesan. Bake for 25 minutes and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Rioja]&quot; 60896,&quot;Roasted Seafood 1 1/2 pounds white-skinned potatoes (about 3 baking potatoes) 8 cloves garlic, unpeeled 2 small red onions 1 unwaxed lemon 1/4 cup regular olive oil 12 ounces small clams in their shells 6 to 8 baby squid 1 1/4 pounds or 16 unpeeled raw colossal-size shrimp with heads-on 3 tablespoons dry white vermouth or white wine Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 to 3 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Cut the potatoes, without peeling, into thick slices and each slice into quarters. Put them into a large roasting pan with the whole garlic cloves. Quarter the onions, peel them (I find it easier to do it this way around), then halve each quarter horizontally. Quarter the lemon and cut each quarter into 1/2-inch pieces. Add the onion and lemon to the pan with the potatoes and garlic. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil and roast for 1 hour. Meanwhile, soak the clams in a bowl of water - if any are smashed or don&#39;t close after they&#39;ve soaked, throw them away. Slice the squid into rings. After 1 hour, take the pan out of the oven and put it over low heat on the stove top so that the pan doesn&#39;t cool while you add the seafood. Arrange the drained closed clams, baby squid rings, and whole raw shrimp over the potatoes, garlic, lemon pieces, and onions. Splash the seafood with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and the vermouth, then season with salt and pepper, to taste. Put the roasting pan back in the oven for 15 minutes, by which time the clams should have opened and the shrimp have turned pink. Discard any clams that have not opened. Scatter with parsley and serve straight from the pan: it couldn&#39;t look more beautiful. Make Ahead Note: Potatoes can be prepared 1 day ahead. Submerge in a bowl of water and store in the refrigerator. Drain and pat dry before using. Onions and lemons can be cut 1 day ahead and stored in bowls tightly covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 60897,&quot;Pan-Seared Rib-Eye Two 1 1/2-inch-thick bone-in rib-eye steaks 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar<br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon pimenton<br> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Kosher salt Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling 4 tablespoons butter, plus more as needed<br> 1 bunch fresh thyme<br> 1 head garlic, cut in half crosswise<br> 1 Spanish onion, cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch rings<br> 1 large handful arugula<br> 1/2 lemon, juiced<br> Freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Remove the steaks from the fridge at least 15 minutes before cooking. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, garlic powder, pimenton, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt. Drizzle the steaks with olive oil to lightly coat. Coat the steaks with the spice rub on all sides. Heat a large cast-iron pan over high heat. Add the butter and let melt. Add the steaks and cook, turning to cook on all sides, until richly browned, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add the thyme bundle and garlic cut-side down. If the pan seems dry, add more butter. Tilt the pan to spoon the butter over the steaks as they cook. Once the steaks are browned and basted on all sides, place them on a sheet pan fitted with a wire rack. Transfer to the oven and cook through to desired temperature. I like my steaks medium rare! Allow the steaks to rest and the juices to settle at least 10 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, lower the heat to medium-low under the pan and add the onion rings. Allow to char on both sides, flipping once after about 1 minute. Set aside. To a medium bowl, add the arugula, lemon juice and olive oil to lightly coat. Season with salt and pepper. Add the charred onion and toss. Remove the meat from the bone and slice into 1- to 3/4-inch slices. Lay the steak on a serving platter with the bone on top and garnish with the arugula onion salad.

Place in a 1-gallon sealable plastic bag and pour in the buttermilk. Seal the bag and massage it lightly to be sure the chicken is coated with the buttermilk. Place in the refrigerator to marinate. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil in an unheated 12-inch cast-iron skillet and tilt the pan so the oil covers the bottom. Lift the thighs out of the buttermilk, letting any excess buttermilk drip off, and place them in the skillet, skin side up, in one layer. Discard the marinade. In a small bowl, combine the mustard and wine and brush it on the top of the chicken. Sprinkle with the thyme, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Place the skillet in the oven and roast the chicken for 30 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a plate and put the potatoes, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper into the skillet. Toss to coat with the pan juices then spread the potatoes out. Return the chicken to the skillet, placing it on the potatoes. Roast 30 minutes longer, until the chicken registers 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer just the chicken to a plate and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm. Return the skillet to the oven, raise the temperature to 425 degrees F, and roast the potatoes for 15 minutes, until they\\u2019re tender and starting to brown. Return the chicken to the pan and sprinkle with the parsley, chives, and extra salt.

The slurry may look separated but will come together in the next step. Add the brown sugar and 2/3 cup water to a small saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to medium high and whisk in the tapioca slurry until the mixture begins to just tighten and the water fully incorporates, about 30 seconds.<br> Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining 1 cup tapioca starch using a heatproof spatula until it forms a ball of shaggy dough, 1 to 2 minutes.<br> Dust a work surface with tapioca flour. Gather the dough together from the saucepan, transfer it to the surface and let cool, 3 to 4 minutes. Knead the dough until it is smooth, springy to the touch and no longer sticky, adding tapioca starch as needed, about 7 minutes. If the dough feels too dry, wet your hands and knead in water from your hands.<br> Divide the dough into 6 pieces and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Roll out 1 piece of dough to a thickness of about 1/4 inch with a rolling pin. Use a 1/2-inch-wide bubble tea straw with the tip dusted in tapioca starch to cut pieces from the dough, making sure to dust the straw occasionally to prevent sticking. Gather the dough scraps into a ball and repeat the process. Discard any leftover dough after this step as it will be too dry to use again. Repeat with the remaining 5 pieces of dough.<br> Lightly dust a baking sheet with tapioca starch. Roll the boba pieces into pea-sized balls and place on the prepared baking sheet.

Remove the center ring from the grill grate and insert a medium cast-iron skillet. Invert another larger cast-iron skillet over the top. This acts as a pizza oven for your outdoor grill. (If using a gas grill, heat to medium-high heat.) For the pizza dough: Add the flour, honey, salt and yeast to a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Then add 1 3/4 cups room temperature water and the olive oil and pulse again until the dough comes together into a rough ball and rides around the bowl. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead a few times until a smooth elastic ball forms. Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces and place each in a quart-sized deli container or gallon-sized resealable plastic bag with a drizzle of olive oil. Allow to sit at room temperature for 1 hour, then refrigerate overnight and up to 5 days. This makes enough for 3 pizzas. Save the extra dough in the freezer for another time. It will last up to 2 months. When ready to use, remove the dough from the refrigerator and take it out of its storage vessel while still cold. Allow the dough to rest at room temperature for 1 hour before grilling. For the cheese mixture: In the meantime, combine the ricotta, mozzarella, pecorino and herbs in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. To make the pizza: Dust a pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet with flour. Press one dough ball out on to the peel, shaping it into a circle. Slide the pizza onto the inverted cast-iron and dollop the cheese mixture over the surface. Scatter the asparagus, onions and Parmesan evenly over the surface and drizzle with olive oil. Cover the grill and bake until golden brown and crusty, 10 to 15 minutes. Using the peel, remove the pizza from the grill and slide it onto a cutting board. Drizzle with more olive oil, slice and serve with more freshly grated Parmesan over the top. (Alternatively, you can slide the pizza onto an upside-down sheet tray in the oven and cook in a 500 degrees F oven until golden brown and crusty, 10 to 15 minutes.) &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chianti]&quot; 60908,&quot;Mojito Chicken 1 (2 1/2 to 3-pound) chicken 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon onion powder 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon dried oregano 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon paprika Marinade, recipe follows 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil Mojito Glaze, recipe follows Instructions: Remove backbone of chicken with poultry shears; flatten chicken out by pressing firmly on skin part of chicken so it will sit evenly in a pan.

Let the bowl sit 2 minutes, then dump the water. In the warmed bowl, combine the yeast, 1 tablespoon flour, the sugar and 1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees F to 115 degrees F). Let stand about 5 minutes. (The mixture will be creamy and slightly bubbly; if it isn&#39;t, start over with fresh new yeast.) In a large bowl, mix 2 1/2 cups flour and 2 teaspoons salt. Make a well in the center and stir in the yeast mixture, olive oil and 3/4 cup warm water (105 degrees F to 115 degrees F) with a wooden spoon. Mix until the dough starts to come away from the side of the bowl (it will be sticky). Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead with floured hands until soft and elastic, about 8 minutes. Form into a ball. Brush another large bowl with olive oil. Add the dough and roll to coat with the oil. Tightly cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, put a pizza stone on the lowest oven rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Let the stone preheat, about 1 hour. Make the sauce: Combine the olive oil, oregano, minced basil, tomatoes and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat to low and cook until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a food processor and puree until smooth. Return the sauce to the pan and cook over medium heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Season with pepper to taste. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and cut in half. Form each half into a disk and roll out into a 10-inch circle with a lightly floured rolling pin. (I like my pizza paper-thin!) Pinch around the edge to form a crust. Sprinkle a pizza peel with cornmeal and carefully slide one round of dough onto the peel. Jerk the peel in a back-and-forth motion once or twice to make sure the dough does not stick. (If the dough is sticking, add extra cornmeal.) Drizzle the dough with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and top with half of the sauce, leaving a small border. Transfer the dough to the hot stone in the oven, using a jerking motion to slide the dough off the peel. Bake 5 minutes. Using the peel, rotate the pizza for even browning and top with half of the mozzarella. Bake until the cheese melts and the crust is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 more minutes.

Remove the leaves from the cauliflower, then trim the stem flush with the bottom of the head so the cauliflower sits flat and upright. Transfer to a medium ovenproof skillet. Rub the outside of the cauliflower with the olive oil, then sprinkle evenly with the cumin, coriander, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and several grinds of pepper. Pour 1 cup water into the bottom of skillet, then wrap tightly with aluminum foil.<br> Bake until the cauliflower is crisp-tender, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the cauliflower is very tender and golden brown, 30 minutes more. (The core of the cauliflower should be tender but the whole head should hold its shape and not fall apart.)<br> For the tahini sauce: Meanwhile, stir together the tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, cumin, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and several grinds of pepper until combined. Whisk in 3 to 4 tablespoons of water until the sauce is very smooth and creamy. The sauce may look lumpy at first, but will come together once the water is incorporated. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.<br> Transfer the cauliflower to a serving platter, then top with the parsley, pine nuts, pomegranate seeds and a pinch of flaky sea salt. Drizzle with some of the tahini sauce, then cut into wedges and serve with more tahini sauce on the side.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]</p><p>&quot; 60913,&quot;Thai Corn Chowder 4 ears corn 2 cups diced red-skinned potatoes (about 12 ounces) 3/4 cup chopped scallions 2 tablespoons grated peeled fresh ginger 4 cloves garlic, smashed 8 black peppercorns 1 stalk lemongrass, cut into thirds (optional) 4 tablespoons unsalted butter Kosher salt 1 red jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced 1 13 .5-ounce can coconut milk 8 fresh basil leaves 8 fresh mint leaves 4 radishes, thinly sliced 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro Juice of 1/2 lime, plus lime wedges for garnish 1 tomato, seeded and diced Instructions: Cut off the corn kernels; set aside.

Remove the lobster tails from the pot and set aside. Add the paprika, garlic, onions and a nice pinch of salt to the pot and bring to a boil over high heat. When the water begins to boil, turn the heat to medium low. When the bubbles subside, add the lobster tails to the pot. Cover and poach until the tails are bright red and curled, about 6 minutes for smaller tails, 8 minutes for larger. Transfer the tails to a plate until cool enough to handle. Strain and reserve the poaching liquid. Remove the meat from the shells and chop into bite-sized chunks. For the mushrooms: In a large pan with straight sides, heat the butter and olive oil over medium-high heat until the butter melts. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly dehydrated and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate and season with salt and pepper. Reserve the pan. For the sauce: Add 3/4 cup of the strained lobster-poaching liquid to the mushroom pan, bring to a simmer over medium heat and reduce slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the cream and simmer until thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. Taste and add vinegar or lemon juice to brighten. Remove from the heat and add the lobster meat to warm in the ambient heat of the pan. For the toast and serving: Preheat the oven to low broil. Lightly butter one side of each slice of bread and place on a baking sheet or directly on the middle rack, buttered-side up.

Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides. To make the cheesecake layer, put one package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the bowl a couple of times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, scraping down the bowl after each. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining 1 cup sugar, then the vanilla. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after adding each. Beat in the cream just until it&#39;s completely blended. Be careful not to overmix! Gently spoon the batter into the foil-wrapped springform and place it in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the sides of the springform. Bake the cake at 350 degrees F until the edges are light golden brown and the top is slightly golden tan, about 1 1/4 hours. Remove the cake from the water bath, transfer to a wire rack, and cool in the pan for 2 hours, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate (while still in the pan) until it&#39;s completely cold, about 4 hours. Place in the freezer until ready to assemble the cake. Meanwhile, prepare the devil&#39;s food cake layers. Check that the oven is preheated to 350 degrees F and that the water bath has been removed. Generously butter the bottom and sides of three 9-inch round layer cake pans. Very important: Line the bottom of all three pans with parchment or waxed paper (don&#39;t let the paper come up the sides). Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Cream the butter and both sugars together in a large bowl with the mixer on medium until light yellow and creamy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in the melted chocolate and vanilla. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the flour mixture, alternately with the milk, mixing well after each until blended. Put the egg whites and cream of tartar in a clean medium-size bowl and beat with clean, dry beaters on high until stiff (but not dry) peaks form. Fold about one-third of the whites into the chocolate batter until they disappear, then gently fold in the remaining whites. Don&#39;t worry if you still see a few white specks--they&#39;ll disappear during baking. Divide the batter evenly between the three pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out with moist crumbs clinging to it, about 30 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans on a rack for 15 minutes, then remove the cakes from the pans and gently peel off the paper liners. Let cool completely, about 2 hours, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or until ready to assemble the cake. Early on the day you plan to serve the cake, make the chocolate curls and lay them out on the marble or baking sheet to dry. Now make the frosting: In a large bowl, sift the confectioners&#39; sugar, cocoa, and salt together. In another large bowl, cream the butter with a mixer on high until light yellow and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. With the mixer still running, beat in the chocolate, corn syrup, and vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the sugar-cocoa mixture in two additions, beating well after each. Blend in the cream until the frosting is a spreading consistency, adding a little more cream if needed. Whip the frosting on high until light and creamy, about 2 minutes more. To assemble the cake, remove the cheesecake from the freezer and let stand at room temperature about 10 minutes. Place one layer of devil&#39;s food cake, top side down, on a cake plate and spread with some of the frosting. Release and remove the ring of the springform, then remove the frozen cheesecake from the bottom of the pan. Place top side down on the frosted cake layer and spread with some frosting. Top with the second devil&#39;s food layer, top side down. Spread with more frosting and cover with the third devil&#39;s food layer, top side up. Brush away any crumbs from the sides and top of the fudge cake layers. Frost the sides and top of the cake with the remaining frosting, spreading the top with frosting about 1/2 inch deep. Use a long metal spatula that has been warmed under hot running water to smooth out the frosting on the sides and top of the cake. Coat the sides with the chocolate curls, placing them where you want. With a small spatula or table knife, swirl the frosting on top into a decorative design. Or, if you wish, decorate with a crosshatch design: Make about 6 vertical lines, 1 inch apart, then crisscross 6 more horizontal lines the same distance, swirling the icing a little as you go. Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours to allow the cheesecake to thaw enough to easily slice. Use a sharp straight-edge knife, not a serrated one, to cut it. Cover any leftover cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate, or wrap and freeze for up to 1 month. Chocolate Curls: At Junior&#39;s, the bakers often use dark chocolate curls to decorate cheesecakes for a delicious and very professional looking finish. For large chocolate curls: If you have a marble slab, use it. If not, use a baking sheet (place the sheet in the refrigerator to chill first). Melt the chocolate over low heat. Spread it out in a thin sheet on the flat marble surface--but not so thin that you can see the surface through the chocolate. Let the chocolate cool. Using a baker&#39;s bench scraper or a wide, flat metal spatula, scrape up the chocolate into wide curls, lifting them up as you work. The curls will be different widths and lengths, but that&#39;s fine. If the chocolate curls up into one long sheet, let it cool more before scraping again. Carefully place the curls where you want them on the cake. If you are decorating the side of the cake with them, press the curls gently into the frosting with your fingers so they stay, without falling off. For smaller chocolate curls: Buy a thick bar of chocolate and use at room temperature (not straight from the refrigerator). Stand up the chocolate bar vertically, slightly on an angle, against a flat surface, such as a chopping board. Slowly scrape down the bar with a vegetable peeler, allowing the chocolate to fall away into a pile of soft curls. Using a wide, flat metal spatula, carefully place them on the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Grenache]</p><p>These four red wines are excellent choices to pair with the Devil&#39;s Food Cheesecake recipe.

Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and heat until shimmering. Season the chicken with chili powder and salt, to taste. Lay the chicken in the skillet skin side down and cook until brown, about 4 minutes. Turn the chicken, transfer the pan to the oven, and cook until firm, basting occasionally with the pan drippings, 15 to 20 minutes. While the chicken cooks, make the fresh tomato salsa: Toss the tomatoes with the jalapeno, onion, and the 1/2 teaspoon salt. Smash the garlic clove, sprinkle with the remaining salt, and, with the flat side of a large knife, mash and smear the mixture to a coarse paste. Stir the paste into the salsa with the olive oil and 1/4 cup of cilantro. When chicken is cooked through, transfer the pieces to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. In the meantime, add the lime juice to the pan. After 1 minute, add the honey along with the chicken stock to heat through. Remove pan from heat and stir in reserved 1/4 cup cilantro and butter. To serve, divide the chicken among 4 plates, drizzle with pan sauce, and spoon some salsa over and around. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barbera]&quot; 60921,&quot;Red Velvet Cake 3/4 stick butter, room temperature, plus more for pans 1 5/8 cups cake flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/4 cups sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 large eggs, room temperature 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 3/4 cup buttermilk 3/4 teaspoon vinegar 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1-ounce red food coloring Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Line a half-sheet pan with parchment and spray with nonstick spray. Spray a 12-cup Bundt pan. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5 to 10 minutes, stopping a few times to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, salt and baking powder together for 30 seconds to distribute the leavening. With the mixer on low, alternate additions of the flour mixture and the buttermilk. Using a large rubber spatula, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to ensure the batter is well mixed. Transfer a generous one-quarter to one-third of the batter to a mixing bowl. Add the green food coloring and stir until the batter is a uniform color. Spread the green batter in the prepared sheet pan and bake until just baked through and firm but not yet springy, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool, then freeze for 20 to 30 minutes until firm. Put one-third of the undyed batter in the bottom of the prepared Bundt pan. Using a 2-inch \\D-shaped cookie cutter (you can use other shapes as well) cut 14 or 15 letters from the green cake. Stand the letters, upside-down, in the Bundt pan, with the straight edges toward the center of the pan. Don&#39;t press the letters all the way into the batter, just enough to keep them upright. Arrange the letters as close together as you can while still keeping them properly angled. Fill a large pastry bag with the remaining undyed batter and pipe it into the Bundt pan, making sure to fill any hard-to-reach areas and covering the letters completely (see Cook&#39;s Note). Bake until the cake is golden brown and springs back when gently touched, 50 to 60 minutes. Allow to cool completely in the pan. For the Swiss meringue frosting: In a stand mixer bowl, combine the egg whites, sugar and salt. Place over a medium saucepan of simmering water to create a double boiler, making sure the water doesn&#39;t touch the bottom of the bowl (you want the steam to heat the egg whites, not the simmering water). Whisking constantly, heat the egg white mixture until the sugar has completely dissolved and feels hot to the touch. (If you are nervous about uncooked eggs, attach a thermometer the bowl and make sure the mixture reaches 170 degrees F.) Transfer the bowl to the stand mixer and beat the mixture on high with the whisk attachment until very stiff, shiny white peaks form and the meringue is room temperature, about 10 minutes. To assemble the cake: Run a long, thin knife around the edge of the Bundt pan to release the cake. Place a cake platter, face down, on top of the Bundt and flip the pan over. Gently lift away the pan, leaving the cake on the platter. Coat the cake with an even layer of Swiss meringue. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 60941,&quot;Super Thick Hot Chocolate 3 cups milk 1 cup evaporated milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup cocoa powder 1/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons cornstarch Pinch ground cinnamon Instructions: In a saucepan, combine the milk, evaporated milk and vanilla and warm up over a low heat.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil, mustard, smoked paprika and salt. Add the kielbasa, broccoli and onion. Toss well to coat with the seasonings. Tear off six 18-by-12-inch sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil (if you don\\u2019t have heavy-duty foil, use double sheets). Lay a sprig of rosemary in the middle of each. Divide the ingredients among the sheets, keeping them in a snug layer in the center of each piece of foil. Bring the short sides of the foil together at the top and fold down several times, leaving some air space above the food. Fold the other 2 sides in and crimp to seal. The packets should be rectangular in shape and tightly sealed all around, with an air pocket at the top. Place the packets, with space between them, directly on the oven rack in the lower third and bake for 20 minutes. Remove and let rest a few minutes, then carefully open the packets. Dollop with some of the Pesto and serve with lemon wedges. Campfire Variation: You can also cook the foil packs in the coals of a campfire. The flames should be out, with just hot coals remaining. Spread the coals in an even layer. Ideally, you should be able to hold your hand about 6 inches above the coals for 4 or 5 seconds before having to take it away for the right temperature. Add the packets to the coals. You should hear gentle (but not aggressive) sizzling noises within a few minutes. If they\\u2019re sizzling too loudly or not at all, move the packets around occasionally until they\\u2019re sizzling gently again. The packets may take a few minutes less on the coals, about 18 minutes, if your coals are at the right temperature. Combine the basil, pistachios, Parmesan, salt and garlic in a food processor fitted with the blade attachment and pulse to make a coarse paste. With the machine running, add the olive oil in a steady stream to make a smooth pesto. &quot;,&quot;[Chianti, Barbera, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 60945,&quot;Morrocan Chili and 10,000 Grains of Sand 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 pounds ground lamb Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chili powder 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon paprika 1 bay leaf 1 large onion, chopped 1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 lemon, zested and juiced 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, eyeball it 1 (14-ounce) can tomato sauce 2 tablespoons butter 1 1/2 cups chicken stock A handful golden raisins 4 apricots, chopped 1 1/2 cups couscous 3 to 4 tablespoons toasted pine nuts A handful fresh parsley leaves, chopped A handful fresh mint leaves, chopped 3 tablespoons finely chopped chives 8 pita breads, cut into wedgesfor scooping Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Transfer the frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip and pipe onto the cupcakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling Brut]</p><p>&quot; 60949,&quot;Tipsy Elephant Marshmallows Vegetable oil, for the baking dish 3 tablespoons bourbon or other whiskey<br> Four 1/4-ounce packages unflavored gelatin<br> 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br> 1 1/4 cups light corn syrup<br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br> Nonstick cooking spray, for the spatula and cookie cutter 1 cup confectioners&#39; sugar, plus more for packing 1 cup rice flour<br> Instructions: Line a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with parchment paper and lightly brush all over with oil. Put the bourbon and 1/2 cup cold water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Sprinkle the gelatin evenly on top and then stir briefly to moisten it all. Combine the granulated sugar, corn syrup and salt in a medium saucepan with 1/4 cup water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat while stirring, then stop stirring and continue to boil until the mixture reaches 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer (soft-ball stage). Remove from the heat and let the bubbling subside. Turn the mixer to low and slowly add the hot syrup so that it pours down the side of the bowl into the gelatin mixture. When all of the syrup has been added, gradually increase the speed to high and beat until stiff, about 12 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. Spray a rubber spatula with cooking spray and scrape the marshmallow mixture into the prepared baking dish with the spatula. Use oiled fingers to smooth the marshmallow into the dish. Let it air dry for at least 6 hours and preferably overnight. Combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and rice flour in a small bowl. Turn the marshmallow out onto a surface coated with some of the confectioners&#39; sugar mixture. Spray a 3- to 6-inch elephant-shaped cookie cutter with nonstick spray on both sides. Cut out an elephant from the marshmallow and gently toss in the bowl with the remaining confectioners&#39; sugar mixture, coating all of the cut edges. Re-spray the cutter before cutting out each elephant and coat each thoroughly in the mixture. Pack or bag the marshmallows with a little extra confectioners&#39; sugar. &quot;,&quot;[Burgundy, Port, Moscato, Riesling]&quot; 60950,&quot;Everything Roasted Nuts 1 cup whole blanched almonds 1 cup hazelnuts 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon hot sauce, eyeball it 1 tablespoon grill seasoning (recommended: Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick) 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 2 cups smoked almonds (recommended: Diamond Smokehouse Almonds) 1 teaspoon poppy seeds 1 tablespoon sesame seeds Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Pulse to combine. With the machine running, gradually add the oil, and then 1/3 to 1/2 cup water until the mixture forms a dough (the dough should stick together if pinched between your fingers). If necessary, add additional water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the dough is too dry. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Gather the dough into a ball and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Cut the dough into quarters and press flat. Run each piece of pasta dough several times through a pasta-rolling machine, adjusting the setting each time until the pasta is about 1/8 to 1/16 inch thick. Cut the pasta into fettuccine noodles. Coat the cut pasta with cocoa powder to prevent sticking. For the chocolate fettuccine with peas: In a small bowl, combine the mascarpone, Parmesan and vanilla and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the vegetable oil. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pancetta to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until golden and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pancetta and drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. Add the butter and stir over medium heat until melted. Reduce the heat and simmer until frothy. Continue to cook until the butter has a nutty aroma and turns a caramel color, about 3 minutes. Add the sage leaves and cook until they are browned and toasted, about 2 minutes. Remove the fried sage to a paper-towel-lined plate. Keep the pan over low heat, stir in the peas and cook until they are warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until tender but firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the pasta. Add the pasta, pancetta and most of the sage leaves to the skillet and toss gently to coat with the browned butter and peas. To serve, add a dollop of the mascarpone mixture. Gently run a vegetable peeler over the chocolate to create chocolate curls. Sprinkle the curls over the pasta along with a few fried sage leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Tempranillo]&quot; 60952,&quot;Brie-Onion Dip in a French Bread Bowl 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced 6 sprigs thyme Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup low-sodium beef broth 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, plus more for topping 1 loaf French bread (18 to 20 inches) 8 ounces brie cheese, rind removed, thinly sliced<br> Crackers and/or crudites, for serving Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and thyme sprigs, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is caramelized, 15 to 17 minutes (reduce the heat if the onion is getting too dark). Add the Worcestershire sauce and cook until the skillet is dry, about 1 minute. Add the beef broth and cook, stirring, until the mixture is slightly saucy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly; discard the thyme sprigs and stir in the chives. Using a small serrated knife, hollow out the bread loaf, leaving a ?-inch-thick shell; reserve the cut-out bread. Drizzle the inside of the bread with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Fill the loaf with half of the brie, then top with the onion mixture and the remaining brie; transfer to a baking sheet. Bake until the brie melts and the bread is toasted, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the reserved bread into pieces and arrange on a separate baking sheet; drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake until toasted, 5 to 8 minutes. Top the dip with more chives and serve with the toasted bread and crackers and/or crudites. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Gavi]&quot; 60953,&quot;Gravlax 1 pound center-cut wild king salmon fillet, skin removed 2 cups kosher salt 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill 1 tablespoon fennel seeds 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 tablespoon cracked white peppercorns 1 cup packed light brown sugar 2 medium red onions, thinly sliced 1/2 cup fresh lime juice (from about 8 limes) Instructions: Remove the bones. Run the back of a chef&#39;s knife along the surface of the salmon to help reveal any bones. Use tweezers to pull out the bones, dipping the tweezers in water so the bones slip off. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels and set aside. Make the cure. Mix the salt, dill, fennel seeds, coriander, peppercorns and brown sugar in a bowl. Prepare the onions. Toss the onions and lime juice in a medium nonreactive bowl. Cure the salmon. Spread half of the salt mixture on a large sheet of plastic wrap, then top with half of the onions. Place the salmon on top. Spread the remaining onions and salt mixture on the salmon, making sure to put a little extra around the sides so the fish is completely covered. Wrap the salmon tightly in the plastic wrap. Place in a baking dish to catch any liquid that might leak. Refrigerate 24 to 36 hours. Rinse and dry. Carefully remove the plastic wrap and discard it (there will be a lot of liquid). Reserve the onions to serve with the salmon. Rinse the salmon under cold water and pat dry. Slice the gravlax. Use a carving knife to cut the salmon in half lengthwise. Trim off any remaining dark flesh from the skin side of each piece. Slice on the bias as thinly as possible, wiping your knife with a cold damp towel between slices. To store, wrap the gravlax in plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 5 days. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 60954,&quot;Chorizo Breakfast Burrito 24 ounces cooked cl Chorizo, recipe follows 4 tablespoons oil 12 eggs, beaten 4 flour tortillas Red or Green Salsa, store bought, (optional) 2 1/2 pounds pork meat 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic 1 tablespoon salt 1 cup red cl powder 1/2 tablespoon oil Instructions: Fry chorizo in a frying pan with oil in pan until cooked to your liking.

Cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until bubbles start to form around the edges, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking, whisking constantly and getting into the corners of the saucepan, until the mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl; press plastic wrap directly on the surface and refrigerate until cooled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Meanwhile, make the cake: Preheat the oven to 325? F. Butter two 9-inch round cake pans; line the bottoms with parchment paper and butter the paper. Lightly dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess. Combine the flour, baking powder, pie spice and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the milk in two batches; beat until just combined. Divide the batter between the 2 pans. Bake until light golden brown on top and the center springs back when gently pressed, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 10 minutes in the pans, then remove the cakes to the racks to cool completely. Remove and discard the parchment. Put 1 cake layer on a cake stand or platter. Spread the pumpkin filling on top, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with the second cake layer. Make the whipped cream: Combine the heavy cream, confectioners&#39; sugar, milk powder and vanilla in a large metal bowl (for the best results, chill the bowl beforehand). Beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Spread the whipped cream all over the cake and refrigerate until ready to serve, at least 20 minutes. Sprinkle with pumpkin pie spice before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 60956,&quot;Peach Mug Pie 2 tablespoons water 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 (15-ounce) can peach halves, juice reserved and peaches chopped 1/4 cup brown sugar 1 pinch salt 1 cup heavy cream 3 tablespoons confectioners&#39; sugar 4 graham crackers, crumbled 1 pint vanilla ice cream, softened Instructions: In a small bowl whisk together 2 tablespoons water with the cornstarch. In a small pot over medium heat reserved peach juice, cornstarch mixture, brown sugar and salt. Once the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes, stir in the chopped peaches. In a chilled mixing bowl whip heavy cream with confectioners&#39; sugar until soft peaks form. Use 1 cup for mug pies, and reserve the rest for the Caramel Cocktail recipe. Begin assembling peach pies by in clear glass mugs. Place a layer of graham crackers at the bottom, then a big spoonful of the peach pie filling. Sprinkle with another layer of graham crackers.

Rinse the fish and pat dry; season it inside and out with salt and pepper. In a mixing bowl, combine the lemon, shallot, parsley, 2 tablespoons thyme, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, and 1/4-cup olive oil. Place the fish on an oiled baking sheet and stuff the cavity with the lemon mixture. In a clean mixing bowl, whip the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Fold in the salt to make a paste then fold in the remaining thyme leaves. Smear the salt paste over the entire fish and roast for 35 to 45 minutes. The egg whites will form a hard crust. Gently crack the shell with a spoon and lift off the salt crust. Serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 60958,&quot;Lime Ice with Cucumber and Mint 5 to 6 large limes (enough to make 3/4 cup fresh lime juice) 1 cup sugar 1/3 cup corn syrup 1 1/3 cups water 1 medium cucumber, peeled and seeded 2/3 cup mint leaves, loosely packed Fresh mint sprigs, for garnish Instructions: Grate the zest (colored part only) off 2 of the limes and scrape into a large bowl. (If the zest is in large pieces, chop it finely.) Juice the limes, measure 3/4 cup, and pour it in with the zest. Add the sugar, corn syrup, 1 1/3 cups water, cucumber, and mint. Blend until smooth. For the smoothest texture, pass the mixture through a fine strainer. Pour the mixture into the canister of your ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer&#39;s directions. The ice will have the best texture if you scoop it from the ice cream maker into a container and let it firm up for several hours in the freezer. Scoop ice into small dishes and garnish with fresh mint sprigs. The ice is best eaten within 24 hours. &quot;,&quot;[Viognier, Vermentino, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 60959,&quot;Cucumber-Tomato-Avocado Salad with Tequila-Lime Vinaigrette 1 English cucumber, sliced 2 medium tomatoes, diced 1 avocado, diced 2 teaspoons tequila 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon lime juice 1 teaspoon zesty herb salad dressing mix Instructions: To a medium bowl, add chopped cucumber, tomato, and avocado.

Into the largest saucepan or casserole you have that will go into the oven, pour 3 tablespoons of the oil. Brown the meat in batches over high heat and remove with a slotted spoon to a plate nearby. You may need more oil as you do this. The onions will certainly need it, so pour the remaining oil or add more, add the onions, sprinkling a little salt over them and cook then until soft and translucent. Add the garlic, celery, thyme, and oregano. After a couple of minutes or so, when the smell of garlic wafts up, remove half the mixture. Add the meat to the mixture in the pan, cover with the remaining half, add the bay leaves, carrots, tomatoes, stock and wine. I use a big but flattish casserole and this amount of liquid covers the meat, but if you find you need more liquid, add water- you want a lot of liquid, because you will, eventually, be cooking some pasta in it. Bring to a boil, remove scum, and let bubble for about 3 minutes. Then cover, transfer to the oven, and bake for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or cook on a very low heat. The meat should be tender and yielding. Remove the carrots (and eat, cook&#39;s treat) and bay leaves, too, if you want, and season, to taste, with the salt and pepper. Of course you can proceed to the final stage now, but I am presuming you&#39;re not going to. In which case, let the stew cool and keep it in the refrigerator until you want it. Skim the fat off the top, and do remember to take it out of the refrigerator a good 1 to 2 hours before you cook it again. You can reheat this in the oven, but because the pasta will be put in on the stove, I tend to heat it there. Make sure the stew is piping hot. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. When it boils, add the salt and then pasta. Cook this until it&#39;s nearly but not quite cooked; it should have a couple of minutes still to go. Then drain the pasta and add it quickly to the bubbling juices in the casserole, making sure first that there are enough bubbling juices. You don&#39;t want the meat to be drowned, but you want enough for the pasta to be covered. The pasta will absorb some of the liquid as it finishes cooking, of course. In a couple of minutes, the pasta should be cooked. Crumble some feta and put in a bowl with the chopped parsley, oregano, or basil. Stir to combine and then leave the spoon with it, so that people can sprinkle the herb-spiked cheese over the stew as they wish. Ladle the stew into shallow soup bowls. &quot;,&quot;[Rhone Blends, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Barolo]&quot; 60961,&quot;Green Coconut Shrimp and Chicken Curry 12 large shrimp, peeled and deveined 1/2 pound chicken, dark meat cut into 1/2-inch cubes Salt and freshly ground black pepper Cooking oil (palm oil would be best) 1/2 piece golf-ball size ginger, sliced 2 cloves garlic, smashed 1 onion diced 1 small eggplant diced 1 green pepper, julienned 1 red pepper, julienned 1 yellow pepper, julienned 1 orange pepper, julienned 2/3 can coconut milk 2 tablespoons green curry paste Sugar, to taste 4 cups steamed jasmine rice Instructions: Season the shrimp and chicken with salt and pepper 15 minutes before cooking.<br> Heat the wok over high heat, add oil, ginger and garlic and cook for 30 seconds.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop in the noodles and cook them according to the package instructions for al dente, typically about 8 minutes. Drain the noodles in a colander and transfer the cooked noodles to a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Once cool, move the noodles to a cutting board and cut them into chips. To do this, cut a noodle in half shortways to make 2 pieces. Cut each of the 2 pieces in half shortways again to create 4 rectangles. Cut each rectangle diagonally to create 8 triangles. Repeat with the remaining noodles. Place the noodle pieces in a bowl and toss with the Parmesan, olive oil and oregano. Arrange the noodles on 2 baking sheets coated with cooking spray, making sure the noodles are in a single layer and not touching one another. Bake until crisp and golden, 18 to 20 minutes. Set aside. For the dip: Raise the temperature of the oven to 425 degrees F. In a skillet over medium-high heat, cook the beef and sausage until browned, about 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and garlic to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer. Lower the heat and cook on low for 15 minutes to let the flavors meld and the sauce reduce slightly. Meanwhile, mix the cottage cheese, ricotta, Parmesan and all but a pinch each of the basil and parsley in a medium bowl. Set the remaining herbs aside for garnishing the dip. Spread half of the meat and sauce over the bottom of a 2-quart casserole dish. Using a spoon, dollop half of the cottage cheese mixture over the sauce. Sprinkle with half of the mozzarella.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, granulated sugar and salt. Whisk to combine and evenly distribute the leavening. Add the shortening and butter and toss to coat the fat just a bit with the flour. Using your fingertips, gently work the fats into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal with some pea-size chunks of fat. In a small bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and egg, and add this to the flour mixture. Stir together with a wooden spoon. Then, gently work through the mixture with your hands to separate any wet patches and bring the dough together. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface, fold it over a few times and knead gently until it just holds together. Pat the dough into a rough 1/2-inch-tall rectangle. Cut out biscuits with a 3-inch biscuit cutter. Pat the scraps together and cut an additional biscuit. You should have 6 to 8 biscuits. Evenly space the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops with egg wash and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Set aside. For the roasted plums: Pour the butter into a shallow baking dish and tip from side to side to coat the bottom. Add the maple syrup and orange juice, swirling to \\stir\\ the mixture. Line the baking dish with the plums, flesh-side down. Bake both the biscuits and plums for about 20 minutes. Remove the biscuits when golden brown. Continue to cook the plums until the juices have thickened, about another 15 minutes. Cool completely before assembling. For the whipped cream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat together the cream, confectioners&#39; sugar and vanilla until medium peaks form. To assemble: Split four of the biscuits horizontally in half; reserve the remaining biscuits for another use (see Cook&#39;s Note). Place the bottom of each biscuit on a serving plate. Top with a generous dollop of whipped cream, followed by a few plum slices and their juices. Top with the biscuit tops. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 60973,&quot;Shrimp-Stuffed Calamari with Polenta 18 4-inch calamari (about 2 pounds), cleaned, tentacles separated (ask your fishmonger to do this) 1/2 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 1 large egg 1/4 cup sourdough breadcrumbs (about 1 slice, ground) 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon 2 anchovy fillets, rinsed and chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes Kosher salt 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 28-ounce can plum tomatoes 2 or 3 stalks fresh basil, plus chopped leaves for garnish 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt 1 bay leaf 1 cup yellow polenta 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish Instructions: Prepare the calamari: Rinse the bodies and set aside. Dice the tentacles and the shrimp into 1/4-to-1/2-inch pieces. Beat the egg in a large bowl. Add the diced calamari tentacles and shrimp, the breadcrumbs, cheese, parsley, basil, lemon zest and juice, anchovies and garlic. Add 3 tablespoons olive oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste and mix until combined. Using your fingers, stuff each calamari body about two-thirds full with the shrimp-breadcrumb mixture and close with a toothpick. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Sear the calamari in batches until browned and opaque on both sides, 8 to 10 minutes, and transfer to a plate. Make the sauce: Lower the heat, add the garlic and red pepper flakes to the pot and cook, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt, then add the wine and scrape up any browned bits from the pot. Boil until the wine is almost evaporated, then crush the tomatoes into the pot with your hands and add the juices. Add 1 cup water, 3/4 teaspoon salt and the basil stalks. Arrange the calamari in a single layer in the pot. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook until the calamari are tender, about 40 minutes. Uncover and cook until the sauce thickens, 10 to 15 more minutes. Meanwhile, make the polenta: Place 4 1/2 cups cold water in a separate pot over low heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and the bay leaf. Whisk in the polenta in a slow, steady stream, then increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil, whisking frequently. Reduce the heat and cook at a bare simmer, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the polenta is thick and pulls away from the sides of the pot, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and cheese. Divide the polenta among shallow bowls. Discard the toothpicks and place the calamari on top of the polenta. Remove the basil stalks and spoon the sauce over the dish. Garnish with the chopped basil and more parmesan. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 60974,&quot;Steak alla Pizziaola 3 tablespoon oil 6 pounds strip sirloin cut into 6-ounce pieces 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon pepper 1 pound crushed tomatoes 3 potatoes, quartered 2 onions, diced 2 green peppers, cored, seeded, and sliced lengthwise into 1/2-inch pieces 2 teaspoons oregano 1/8 teaspoon red hot pepper flakes Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Add the eggs and just enough milk to make a soft paste with the flour. Mix until smooth and lump free. Gradually mix in the rest of the milk and the oil. The batter should be the consistency of heavy cream. If too thick, thin with a bit of water. If it has lumps, pour the batter through a fine strainer. Let the batter rest for 2 hours before making crepes. Rub an 8-inch crepe pan, or non stick skillet, lightly with oil. Heat over moderate heat until very hot. Remove the pan from the heat and pour in 3 to 4 tablespoons of the batter. Very quickly tilt the pan to cover the bottom of the pan with a thin layer of batter. Immediately dump out any excess batter since the crepe must be very thin. Return the skillet to the heat for 60 to 90 seconds until the bottom of the crepe is lightly brown. Flip the crepe over and lightly brown the other side. Slide the finished crepe onto a plate. Continue making crepes until the batter is finished and stack them on the plate. Cover the finished crepes with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. For the filling, pour ricotta cheese into cheesecloth and tie the cloth in a knot. Put a weight (or filled can) on top of the cheese and place over a colander to drain overnight. Mix the cheese, egg yolks, butter, salt, sugar and cinnamon. Place 2 tablespoons in the center of each crepe and roll. Crepes may be filled in advance and kept in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Just before serving, bake in a 250 degree F oven for 15 minutes. Serve crepes warm, sprinkled with a bit of cinnamon and powdered sugar to garnish the plate. Top with persimmon and apricot marmalade. To make the marmalade, cut apricots in half and reserve. Cut out the leafy base from the persimmon then quarter the fruit lengthwise. Skin each quarter with a knife. Cut the skinned persimmons into small pieces. Combine the fruit into a non aluminum saucepan with the sugar, lemon juice, cloves and apricots. Simmer slowly for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring constantly, not letting the marmalade come to a boil. Reduce this mixture to a jam like consistency and chill. TIP: Cut off a piece of the pointed tip of a hachiya persimmon, then wrap it tightly, first in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil, and freeze for up to 3 months. Partially thaw the persimmon in the refrigerator until it is just spoonable, about 4 hours, do not thaw completely or the fruit will be mushy. For an added nuance, insert the tip of a knife and dribble in a little fruit or nut liquor. Serve whole and let the guests scoop the pulp from the skin &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 60977,&quot;Bluegrass Beercheese Melts with Bourbon BBQ Glaze 12 slices bacon 1 stick butter, softened 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 small yellow onions, sliced thinly into rings 1 poblano pepper, julienne 1 green bell pepper, julienne 1/2 cup ketchup 3 tablespoons barbecue sauce 3 tablespoons bourbon 2 tablespoons yellow mustard 2 tablespoons brown sugar 2 cups grated sharp Cheddar 1 tablespoon spicy steak sauce (recommended: A1 Bold and Spicy Steak Sauce) 1 clove garlic 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon flat beer 2 pounds freshly ground chuck 2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil, for brushing grill 12 slices Texas Toast Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Make the crust: Wrap the outside (bottom and side) of a 9-inch springform pan with foil. Coat the inside of the pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment paper. Pulse the graham crackers, butter, sugar and salt in a food processor until fine moist crumbs form, about 1 minute. Press evenly into the bottom and 1/4 inch up the side of the prepared pan. Bake until set, about 15 minutes; transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Make the topping: Line 2 baking sheets with foil. Spread the coconut on one and the pecans on the other. Bake, stirring the coconut once or twice, until the coconut and pecans are toasted, 12 to 15 minutes; let cool. Pulse the pecans in the food processer until coarsely chopped; transfer to a small bowl. Combine the butter, egg yolks, sugar, evaporated milk, vanilla and salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture reduces and caramelizes slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped pecans and 1 1/2 cups coconut (reserve the remaining coconut for topping). Set aside to cool. Make the cheesecake: Fill a roasting pan halfway with water and set on the lower oven rack. Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until melted; let cool to lukewarm. Wipe out the food processor; add the cream cheese, sugar, eggs, cocoa powder and salt and pulse until smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides. Add the melted chocolate, sour cream and vanilla; pulse until combined. Transfer about half of the batter to the prepared crust; smooth with a spatula. Spoon about two-thirds of the topping evenly over the batter. Top with the remaining batter; smooth the top. Set on the middle oven rack (directly over the pan of water) and bake until set around the edge but the center still jiggles slightly, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until cold and set, at least 8 hours or overnight. Run a thin knife around the edge of the cheesecake and remove the springform ring. Microwave the remaining topping to soften, about 30 seconds (stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons water to loosen, if necessary). Spread on top of the cheesecake; top with the reserved coconut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 60990,&quot;Fried Plantains with Cheese: Plantanos Fritos con Queso 4 tablespoons crema fresca or sour cream, mixed with a little water 1 teaspoon ground cumin Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 cups water 2 pounds yellow sweet plantains, peeled and cut into 3-inch pieces 8 ounces queso blanco 1 1/2 cups corn oil Instructions: In a small bowl, combine the crema fresca and the cumin.

In another medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, paprika, salt and pepper, then pour over the rice mixture and stir to combine. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, fill a large cast-iron skillet with 1/4 inch of oil and heat the oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set it nearby. Scoop 1/4 cup of the rice mixture, pressing it down lightly in the measuring cup, then turn it out into the hot oil and lightly flatten it. (You can cook 3 or 4 at a time, depending on the size of your skillet.) Fry for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, until browned underneath. Take care to not move the fritters around after you first add them to the pan so they stay intact while they cook. Gently flip the fritters and cook for another 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer to the paper towel\\u2013lined baking sheet to drain and sprinkle with a bit of salt while warm. Serve with a dollop of sour cream or with the Green Goddess Dip. In a food processor, combine the parsley, mint, basil, chives, sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon zest, lemon juice, cream cheese, salt and pepper and process for 3 minutes, stopping and scraping down the sides to make sure all the ingredients are fully incorporated. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if needed. Transfer to a bowl. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 61009,&quot;Blueberry Scones with Lemon Glaze 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons sugar 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold, cut in chunks 1 cup fresh blueberries 1 cup heavy cream, plus more for brushing the scones 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 cups confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1 lemon, zest finely grated Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Sift together the dry ingredients; the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Using 2 forks or a pastry blender, cut in the butter to coat the pieces with the flour. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs. Fold the blueberries into the batter. Take care not to mash or bruise the blueberries because their strong color will bleed into the dough. Make a well in the center and pour in the heavy cream. Fold everything together just to incorporate; do not overwork the dough. Press the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 12 by 3 by 1 1/4 inches. Cut the rectangle in 1/2 then cut the pieces in 1/2 again, giving you 4 (3-inch) squares. Cut the squares in 1/2 on a diagonal to give you the classic triangle shape. Place the scones on an ungreased cookie sheet and brush the tops with a little heavy cream. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until beautiful and brown. Let the scones cool a bit before you apply the glaze. You can make the lemon glaze in a double boiler, or for a simpler alternative, you can zap it in the microwave. Mix the lemon juice with the confectioners&#39; until dissolved in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water for the double-boiler method, or in a microwave-safe bowl. Whisk in the butter and lemon zest. Either nuke the glaze for 30 seconds or continue whisking in the double boiler. Whisk the glaze to smooth out any lumps, then drizzle the glaze over the top of the scones. Let it set a minute before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 61010,&quot;Steak-and-Egg Fried Rice bowl 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 2 teaspoons sugar 4 scallions, thinly sliced (white and green parts separated) 2 cloves garlic, finely grated 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil 12 ounces skirt steak, thinly sliced Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 teaspoons vegetable oil 3 cups frozen brown rice, thawed 4 cups baby spinach 1 cup bean sprouts 4 large eggs Sriracha, for topping Instructions: Combine the soy sauce, sugar, scallion whites, garlic and sesame oil in a large bowl; add the steak and let marinate 10 minutes.

Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of salt. Cut the provolone and salami in half. Cover the entire surface of each piece of meat with 1 1/2 pieces of salami, going up to but not beyond the edges; press down on the salami to adhere to the meat. Lay 1 1/2 pieces of provolone over the salami. (If there is any extra salami or provolone, distribute evenly among the braciole.) Mix the panko and parsley together in a small bowl. Scatter 2 rounded tablespoons down the center of the provolone. Tightly roll the meat away from you, pressing gently to make the rolls as even and uniform as possible. Tie each tightly with kitchen twine (2 or 3 pieces per braciola) or seal by inserting a toothpick to close. Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches if necessary, add the braciole and cook, turning, until browned all the way around, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

With the lighter frosting, pipe concentric circles around the 3-inch circle, leaving about a 1-inch margin around the edge of the cake. Using a clean offset spatula, smooth the lighter frosting to the edge of the cake, so the entire top of the cake is covered. Smooth everything with a clean offset spatula. Line the point of a cake comb with the center of the cake and slowly rotate the cake to create concentric tree rings. When the lines of the circle meet, gently lift the comb (if you don&#39;t have a cake comb, this effect can be recreated using the tines of a fork). Make the chocolate bark: Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat and set aside. Separately melt the dark and milk chocolates over a double boiler or in the microwave. Pour the dark chocolate over the prepared baking sheet, using an offset spatula to spread to the width of the baking sheet but not smoothing out the chocolate. Drizzle the melted milk chocolate on top. Using the edge of a small offset spatula or a butter knife, make vertical lines and swirls running through the chocolate to create the look of tree bark. Be sure to apply various levels of pressure as the offset spatula is pulled through the chocolate to create a textured look. Let cool at room temperature until firmly set, at least 30 minutes. Break the chocolate into large vertical pieces of varying heights to form pieces of bark. Use these pieces to cover the sides of the cake. Make the berry mushrooms: Roll 1/2-inch pieces of marzipan between your fingers into stem shapes, making them wider at the base so they can stand upright. Place a stem inside the hollow of each raspberry and strawberry, using a skewer to secure the marzipan to the fruit if needed and to secure them down into the cake. Make mushrooms of various sizes and shapes to give a more natural effect and use the mushrooms to decorate the tops and sides of the cake, pressing gently to adhere the marzipan to the surface. Make the pistachio moss and marshmallow stones: Put the pistachios in a mini food processor and add approximately 8 drops each of the green and yellow food coloring. Pulse the food processor to chop the pistachios to a coarse grind the texture of moss. Adjust the food coloring as needed to achieve the desired color. Spoon the moss around the cake plate alongside the bottom of the cake. Mix the mini marshmallows and cocoa in a small bowl. Rough up the marshmallows between your fingers to create texture, shaking off the excess cocoa powder. Add the stones to the base of the cake on the pistachio moss. Using a fine-mesh strainer, shake confectioners&#39; sugar over the top of the cake, creating a snowy effect. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]&quot; 61028,&quot;Key Lime Lamb Chops with Glazed Carrots 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup fresh key lime juice 1 cup chicken broth Kosher salt 1 pound thin carrots Freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 tablespoon ground coriander 2 racks lamb, frenched (see Cook&#39;s Note) Instructions: Melt the sugar with 1 tablespoon water in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until a golden caramel is formed, about 10 minutes. Add the lime juice, bring to a boil and allow the sugar to melt into the sauce until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the broth and boil until reduced to 2/3 cup, about 3 minutes. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Steam the carrots in a covered rack set over boiling water until tender, about 15 minutes. Stir together 3 tablespoons of the key lime gastrique and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Toss the carrots with 1 tablespoon of the butter, the seasoned gastrique and the parsley. Stir together the coriander with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Rub the spice mixture evenly over the lamb. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a large, heavy, ovenproof skillet over medium heat until hot. Sear the lamb on two sides until browned, about 2 minutes each side. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the lamb is medium, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the lamb stand 10 minutes before serving with the carrots and remaining gastrique. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 61029,&quot;Plums and Peaches in Blueberry Vanilla Syrup 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries, picked over if fresh 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup dry white or red wine 1/2 cup water 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, halved crosswise 1 pound ripe, juicy plums, cut into eighths 2 pounds ripe, juicy peaches or nectarines, pitted and cut into eighths 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons finely chopped mint Instructions: In a small nonreactive saucepan, combine the blueberries, sugar, wine and water.

Butter a 10-inch loaf pan and dust with flour. Cream butter with 1 1/3 cups of the flour until light and fluffy. Beat in Creme de Menthe and black peppercorns until well-incorporated. In a bowl, blend 8 of the egg whites, the salt and the baking powder. Beat until the egg whites hold soft peaks. Continue beating, adding 1 1/3 cups of sugar, a tablespoon at a time, until the egg whites are very stiff. Stir 1/4 of the egg white mixture into the creamed butter-flour mixture, blending thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Pour this mixture back over the remaining egg whites. Start sprinkling in the remaining 1 1/3 cups of flour while gently folding the butter-flour mixture into the egg whites. The less the mixture is manipulated, the lighter the cake will be. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 40 minutes. While baking, mix together the pistachio nuts, the 2 remaining egg whites and the remaining 4 tablespoons of sugar. Remove the loaf from the oven after 30 minutes. Spread the pistachio nut mixture over the top. If the loaf has cracked at all on top, let the pistachio mixture seep into the cracks. If the loaf hasn&#39;t cracked, make a few shallow slits on top to let the pistachio mixture seep in. Continue baking until a cake tester comes out clean, and the loaf is starting to pull away from the pan (about 20-30 minutes). Turn out on a rack and let cool for one hour.

Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Sprinkle them on both sides with 1 1/2 teaspoons each salt and pepper.<br> Heat a large oven-proof skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs to the skillet skin-side down and cook, moving them around once or twice to ensure even browning, until the skin is very golden brown, 11 to 12 minutes.<br> Turn off the heat. Grasp a wad of paper towels with tongs and mop up excess fat in the bottom of the skillet\\u2014this will prevent the grease from spattering all over your oven; carefully discard the paper towel. Repeat several times until there\\u2019s only a thin film of oil over the bottom of the skillet.<br> Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the chicken is almost cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip the thighs so they are skin side up, then continue roasting until no longer pink near the bone, another 6 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the chicken thighs to a plate, skin side up. Wipe out the skillet and set aside.<br> Meanwhile, start your sauce. Combine the vinegar, wine, shallots, lemon juice and bay leaves in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until the mixture is reduced to a wet paste, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the cream and continue to simmer until the mixture is reduced to about 2 tablespoons.<br> Reduce the heat to low and remove the bay leaves. Add a few chunks of the butter and whisk constantly until melted, then add a few more chunks and whisk again until melted. Continue adding and whisking the butter, which should melt into a creamy emulsion, until all the butter is incorporated, about 4 minutes. Do not let the sauce go over 130 degrees F or it will separate. If the sauce starts to break, remove from the heat, add 2 ice cubes and whisk until it cools down and comes back together.<br> Season the sauce with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Transfer it to the cast iron skillet, nestle the chicken on top and sprinkle the whole dish with chives. Serve immediately.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61078,&quot;Scalloped Corn 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 large eggs 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 1 tablespoon sugar Two 14-ounce packages frozen corn (about 5 cups), thawed 1 1/2 cup coarsely crushed buttery crackers, such as Ritz or Toll House 1 cup shredded white Cheddar (about 2 ounces) Kosher salt Instructions: Position a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Grease a 2-quart oval gratin or baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Whisk the eggs and half-and-half together in a large bowl. Add the sugar, corn, 1/2 cup of the crushed crackers, 1/2 cup of the Cheddar and 1 teaspoon salt. Pour the mixture into the baking dish, spreading with a spatula or spoon to make an even layer.

Pulse until finely chopped but not pureed. Heat a large Dutch oven with a couple tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped veggies with a pinch of salt and crushed red pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and stir to combine. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the sausage and break up with a spoon, making sure to push down to the bottom of the pan so it can nicely brown. Brown the sausage for 5 minutes. Add the wine and reduce by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine. Add half of the chicken stock (2 cups), the thyme bundle, bay leaves and kosher salt to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook until the sauce has reduced by half, 10 minutes. Add the remaining chicken stock and cook until the sauce is thickened and holds its shape, 15 to 20 minutes more. For the pasta: Mound the flour on a clean, dry work surface. Make a hole (this is also called a well) in the center of the flour pile that is about 8 inches wide (bigger is definitely better here). Crack all of the eggs and the yolk into the hole and add the olive oil, salt and water. Using a fork beat the eggs together with the olive oil, water and salt. Then begin to incorporate the flour into the egg mixture with the fork; be careful not to break the sides of the well or the egg mixture will run all over your board and you will have a big mess! Also, don&#39;t worry about the lumps. When enough flour has been incorporated into the egg mixture that it will not run all over the place when the sides of the well are broken, begin to use your hands to really get everything well combined. If the mixture is tight and dry, wet your hands and begin kneading with wet hands. When the mixture has really come together to a homogeneous dough, THEN you can start kneading. When kneading it is VERY important to put your body weight into it, get on top of the dough to really stretch it and not to tear the dough. Using the heels of your palms, roll the dough to create a very smooooooth, supple pasta dough. When done the dough should look VERY smooth and feel almost velvety. Kneading will usually take from 8 to 10 minutes for an experienced kneader and 10 to 15 for an inexperienced kneader. Put your body weight into it, you need to knead! This is where the perfect, toothsome texture of your pasta is formed. Get in there and have fun! When the pasta has been kneaded to the perfect consistency, wrap it in plastic and let rest for at least 1 hour. If using immediately after 1 hour, do not refrigerate. Divide the dough in half, then cut off a piece about the size of a tennis ball. (Keep the remaining dough wrapped.) Using your hands, flatten the dough and sprinkle with a little flour. Pass the dough through the pasta machine on the widest setting (#1), then fold each end towards the center like an envelope. Dust with more flour, then pass through the machine again. Repeat this process 3 to 4 times, folding the dough and flouring each time. Decrease the width to #2 and pass through the machine. Fold again and dust with flour. Continue to #3 and repeat, just folding and flouring once until you\\u2019ve reached #5. Sprinkle a sheet tray with semolina flour and set aside. Trim the edges of the dough sheet to make a large rectangle. Divide it in half by cutting down the center, then cut the dough into roughly 2-by-1 1/2-inch rectangles. Roll each rectangle around a wooden garganelli dowel to create a cylinder with a triangular tip on either end, and use a little water to secure the seam. Set onto the sheet tray with semolina flour and repeat the rolling, cutting and shaping process with the remaining fresh pasta dough. To serve: Set up a large pot of boiling water and generously season with kosher salt. It should be as salty as the sea. Add the garganelli and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. (Work in batches if you like.) Meanwhile, add the desired amount of sauce to a saute pan and place over medium heat to warm. Add the cooked garganelli directly from boiling water into the ragu along with a ladle of pasta water. Toss to combine until all the noodles are nicely coated. Add the parmesan cheese and a big drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Toss to combine. Plate, then top with more parmesan and a dollop of fresh ricotta cheese. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Chianti]&quot; 61082,&quot;Tailgator&#39;s Baked Beans 6 pounds bacon 6 onions 1/4 cup ground black pepper Kosher salt 1/4 cup chili powder 6 cup BBQ sauce, your favorite 1 1/2 cups yellow mustard 1 1/2 cups molasses One 10-pound can kidney beans One 10-pound can great Northern beans One 10-pound can pork and beans Instructions: Dice the bacon and the onions.

Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low; beat in half of the flour mixture, then all of the milk, then the remaining flour mixture until just combined. Transfer one-third of the batter to separate medium bowl. Add the pink or blue food coloring and stir until uniform in color. Using an ice cream scoop, add scoops of colored batter back to the bowl with the plain batter in an evenly spaced circle. Run a butter knife or skewer through the batters to create a swirled and marbled look. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups using the same ice cream scoop, filling each three-quarters full. Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer the pan to a rack and let cool for 5 minutes, then remove the cupcakes to the rack to cool completely. For the vanilla American buttercream: Combine the butter, confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer) and beat on low speed until mostly incorporated. Add the vanilla, increase the speed to medium-high and beat until smooth. Adjust the consistency with milk as desired. Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container up to 3 days. (If refrigerated, allow to come to room temperature and then beat on medium-high speed until smooth before using.) For the assembly: Use yellow food coloring to tint the buttercream pale yellow. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip (such as number 866, 867 or 868) with the buttercream. Pipe buttercream in a swirl over the top of each cupcake to cover it completely. Sprinkle a work surface with cornstarch and roll out the skin-tone fondant to roughly 1/8 inch thick. Cut out 4 circles with a 2-inch circle cutter. In the middle of each circle, create eyes by making 2 half-moon indentions with the small end of a straight piping tip (such as number 805 or 806). Roll 4 smalls balls of fondant to make noses, brushing them with water to secure them to the face. Set the faces aside. Roll out the pink and/or blue fondant to about 1/8 inch thick. Use the 2-inch circle cutter to cut out 2 circles. Use a knife to cut the circles in half to form hats. Cut a small strip from the flat end of each semicircle and stack it on the bottom of each hat to make a border, securing with water. Brush additional water onto the back of the hats and secure them to the faces. Cut 4 small circles of pink fondant using the small end of the straight piping tip. Brush with water and attach to the faces as the base of a pacifier. Roll 8 small balls of pink fondant. Use 4 to attach to the hats as pompoms and 4 to attach to the small circles to complete the pacifiers. Lay the fondant faces on top of cupcakes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 61118,&quot;Gluten-Free Cherry Chocolate Chip Cookies 4 cups almond flour 3/4 cup brown rice flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup light brown sugar 1 cup grapeseed oil 1 large egg 1 tablespoon pure vanilla 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk or whole milk 1 1/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips (about 7 1/2 oz.) 1/2 cup dried cherries (about 2 1/4 oz.)

Add the butter; when it begins to foam, add the red onions, marjoram, thyme, bay leaves and sugar, and sprinkle liberally with salt. When the onions begin to caramelize, add the red wine and balsamic vinegar and reduce to dry. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add 1 cup of the beef stock; cook until reduced to a glaze. Repeat until all the beef stock has been used. Turn off the heat and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. For the rib-eye: Heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat; add the oil. Pat the steak dry with paper towels, and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. When the oil is just below smoking, place the steak into the pan. Once a nice sear has developed, flip the steak and add the butter, thyme and garlic. If the garlic or steak begins to burn, reduce the heat. Cook, basting the steak with the bubbling butter, until an internal temperature of 125 degrees F has been reached for medium-rare. Remove the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 7 to 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with the French onion confit.<br> Place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with room temperature water and season liberally with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat.

Cut each mushroom cap in half, then cut the halves into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots, and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Portobello slices, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms have started to soften and wilt, about 4 minutes. Add the shiitakes, thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until the shiitakes have started to soften and wilt, about 3 minutes. Pour in the wine, bring to a simmer and stir until most of the liquid has evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, and let cool completely. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the breadcrumbs. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 400 degrees F. Roll the puff pastry out on a floured sheet of parchment paper to a 13-inch square. Brush the surface of the pastry with the mustard, and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs. Leaving a 1-inch border on the right and left sides of the pastry, pile the mushroom filling onto the center, and pack it into a log about 3 inches wide. Fold the bottom half of the pastry over the filling, then roll it up so the bundle sits seam-side down. If any filling falls out while rolling, just push it back inside. Pinch together the open ends to seal, and crimp with a fork. The log should be about 12 inches long. Transfer the Wellington, on the parchment, to a baking sheet. Brush generously all over with the egg. Cut decorative slits down the length of the Wellington. Sprinkle with sea salt and pepper. Bake until golden brown and bubbly, 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest for a few minutes. For the carrot sauce: While the Wellington is baking, combine 2 cups water, carrots, garlic, bay leaf and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a high simmer, and cook until the carrots are very tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the bay leaf, and transfer all the liquid and solids to a blender. Blend until completely smooth. Add the cream cheese, vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and blend until smooth again. (The sauce can be made, cooled and refrigerated up to 1 day ahead; reheat before serving.) Transfer the sauce to a serving vessel. For the salad: Toss the frisee with the oil and vinegar, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Arrange the Wellington and salad on a platter.

Put the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. When the butter is halfway melted, add the sugar and water and cook over low heat, stirring very gently with a rubber spatula, until completely combined. Clip on a candy thermometer on to the side of the pan, turn the heat up to medium-high, and wait for the mixture to reach 300 degrees F, about 15 minutes. The mixture will start to bubble and turn brown. If the browning seems uneven, swirl the pan during the cooking process, but do not stir. Once the mixture reaches 300 degrees F, remove the pan from the heat and remove the candy thermometer. Stir in the toasted flax seeds and poppy seeds. Pour onto the prepared baking sheet, using an offset spatula to spread evenly. (This will cool quickly.) Chop by hand into small pieces. For the cupcakes: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line mini cupcake pans with 48 mini cupcake liners. Sprinkle each cupcake liner with 2 teaspoons Toasted Flax and Poppy Seed Toffee. In the bowl of a standing mixture fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs 1 at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition. Add the coconut extract and coconut flakes. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Alternate folding the coconut milk and flour mixture into the butter mixture. Fill the cupcake liners three-quarters of the way and bake for 11 minutes. Cool. To assemble: When the cupcakes are cool to the touch, use an apple corer to make a hole in the center of each cupcake (be careful not to go to the bottom of the cupcake and tear the paper). Put the Muscat Raisin Filling in a pastry bag, snip the end, and fill each cupcake to the top of the hole. Pipe the Parsley Icing high on the tops of each cupcake. Decorate the sides of the cupcakes with toasted coconut. Arrange a few rose petals in a circle on the tops of the cupcakes and fill the middle with additional Toasted Flax Seed and Poppy Seed Toffee. Combine the milk and brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat to dissolve the sugar. Add the raisins and continue to cook for 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Pour onto a half sheet tray and place in the refrigerator to cool. Combine the raisin mixture and toasted coconut by hand. For the puree: Rinse and pat dry the parsley. Bloom the gelatin in the warm water. Trim the bottom 2 inches from the parsley and add the remaining parsley to a blender. Add the bloomed gelatin and cold water and blend until smooth. It should hold a slight peak and be bright green (you may need to add a couple extra tablespoons of water). Transfer the mixture to a baking sheet and cool quickly in the refrigerator. For the icing: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and salt on high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners&#39; sugar in 1/2-cup additions until fully mixed. Add the vanilla. Fold in the finely chopped toffee. Remove the parsley puree from the refrigerator and mix into the icing. Transfer the icing to a large pastry bag fitted with a large fluted star tip. Return to the refrigerator to keep firm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61126,&quot;Campfire Salted Caramel and Chocolate Fondue Two 4-ounce good quality semi-sweet chocolate bars One 15.85-ounce jar prepared dulce de leche (about 1 1/3 cups) Kosher salt Marshmallows, for dipping (optional) Graham crackers, for dipping (optional) Fresh fruit, such as berries, pineapple chunks and red and/or green grapes, for dipping (optional) Cookies, shortbread or vanilla wafers, for dipping (optional) Instructions: Build a medium-low campfire that has a grate for cooking. Break the chocolate bar into small pieces using the handle of a wooden spoon (or you can smack it against a picnic bench). Unwrap and add the pieces to a medium saucepan along with the dulce de leche, 1/2 cup and 1 teaspoon salt.<br> Place the saucepan, on the grate and over the fire, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate melts and the sauce is completely smooth, about 5 minutes. If it?s too thick, then add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until desired consistency. Serve with suggested dippers, such as marshmallows, graham crackers, berries, pineapple chunks, red and/or green grapes, shortbread cookies or vanilla wafers (see Cook?s Note). &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Port]&quot; 61127,&quot;Rosemary-Cornmeal Shortbread Nonstick cooking spray or softened butter, for preparing the pan 1 1/2 cups (6 oz./170 g) cake flour, sifted 1/3 cup (1 1/2 oz./42 g) stone-ground cornmeal 2 Tbs. (1/2 oz./15 g) cornstarch 1/2 tsp. table salt 12 Tbs. (6 oz./170 g) unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup (2 oz./57 g) confectioners&#39; sugar, sifted if lumpy 1 1/2 tsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary 1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract Fleur de sel or coarse sanding sugar (optional) Instructions:</p><ol><li>Lightly grease a 9 1/4-inch (23 cm) fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Whisk the flour, cornmeal, cornstarch, and salt in a medium bowl until well blended. 2. Put the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl using an electric handheld mixer fitted with wire beaters). Beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the rosemary and vanilla and beat on medium until blended and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until the dough forms moist clumps. Dump the dough into the prepared pan. Using lightly floured fingertips, press the dough into the pan to form an even layer. Make sure to press the dough into the scalloped edges to form a clean edge. Sprinkle the fleur de sel or sanding sugar, if using, evenly over the top. 3. Using the tip of a knife or a bench scraper, score the dough all the way through, forming 16 wedges. With the tines of a fork, prick each wedge twice all the way through, starting at the widest part of the wedge and spacing them about 1/2 inch (12 mm) apart. Lightly flour the tines of the fork as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. Slide the pan into the freezer or fridge for about 10 minutes while the oven heats. 4. Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C/gas 2). 5. Bake the shortbread until the top looks dry and very pale brown, 39 to 41 minutes. Move the pan to a rack. Using a small paring or serrated knife (I don&#39;t use a bench scraper for this because it compresses the cookies&#39; edges), immediately recut the wedges using the scored lines as a guide. Let the shortbread cool completely before removing them from the pan. 6. Serve the cookies with a dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar. Instead of the rosemary, use one of the following combinations: Double ginger: 2 tsp. finely grated fresh ginger + 1/3 cup (1 3/8 oz./39 g) finely chopped crystallized ginger (add both with the vanilla). Cinnamon toast: 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon added to the flour + 1 Tbs. granulated sugar mixed with 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon sprinkled over the shortbread and pressed lightly into the dough before baking. Espresso chip: 1/2 tsp. instant espresso powder (dissolved in the vanilla extract) + 1/3 cup (2 oz./57 g) finely chopped bittersweet chocolate. To make rectangular cookies: Line the bottom of an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking pan (the straight-sided type makes for a cleaner-looking cookie) with parchment. Prepare the dough as directed. Using lightly floured fingertips, press the dough into the pan to form an even layer. Using the tip of a knife or a bench scraper (my tool of choice), score the dough all the way through, forming 1 x 2-inch (2.5 x 5 cm) bars. With the tines of a fork, prick each bar two or three times all the way through, spacing them evenly and on the diagonal. Lightly flour the tines of the fork as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. Proceed as directed. To make round cookies: Have ready two cookie sheets lined with parchment or nonstick liners. Prepare the dough as directed. Arrange a large piece of parchment on the work surface and scrape the dough onto the center. Cover with another piece of parchment and press down on the dough to flatten. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough between the parchment to a 1/4-inch (6 mm) thickness, turning, lifting, and repositioning the parchment and lightly flouring throughout the rolling. Slide the dough onto a cookie sheet and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. Remove the top piece of parchment from the chilled dough. Using a 2 1/2-inch (6 cm) round cookie cutter, cut out rounds. Using the end of a straw, punch out three holes in the center of each round. Arrange about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Stack the scraps, gently press together, reroll, chill, and cut as directed. Slide the cookie sheets into the fridge while the oven heats (at least 15 minutes). Bake, one sheet at a time, until the tops look dry and very pale brown, 26 to 28 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 61128,&quot;Raspberry French Toast 1 cup high quality raspberry jam 1 loaf brioche bread or other loaf bread, dry and day old, cut into 16 thin slices 1 1/2 cups milk 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup orange liquor 1/4 teaspoon salt 6 eggs 4 tablespoons melted butter Confectioners sugar Warm maple syrup Sour cream Instructions: Preheated oven to 350 degrees. Spread a thin layer of jam on each slice of bread and fold in half to form sandwiches. In a bowl, combine milk, vanilla, liquor, salt and eggs. Dip sandwiches into batter and soak briefly. Over medium heat, heat a non-stick skillet and melt a tablespoon of the butter. Cook the sandwiches in batch, cooking on both sides until golden, adding more butter to the pan for each batch. Place sandwiches on a platter and keep them warm in the oven until all are cooked. Dust with powdered sugar. Serve with syrup and sour cream. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61129,&quot;Burning Bumble Bee One 12-ounce pizza dough ball 4 ounces Red Sauce, recipe follows 20 pieces sliced pepperoni<br> 1 1/2 cups loosely packed shredded mozzarella<br> 4 ounces pepperoni stick, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 4 ounces pepperoncini<br> 2 ounces Ancho-Infused Honey, recipe follows One 20-ounce can tomatoes 4 ounces tomato paste 1 1/2 teaspoons oregano 1 1/4 teaspoons minced garlic 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon basil 1 cup honey 1 to 4 tablespoons ancho cl powder Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Stretch the dough out to form a circle roughly 14 inches in diameter. Ladle the Red Sauce in the middle. Slowly glide the ladle, with no downward pressure, over the sauce, going from the inside to the outside in circles until you reach about 1 inch from the edge of the dough. Spread the pepperoni slices out on the sauce. Sprinkle the mozzarella over the top. Sprinkle the pepperoni cubes over the pizza. (You want these on top so that they will get a little bit of crunch from the cooking process.) Spread the pepperoncini out over the top of the pizza, then place it in the oven. Let cook for 20 minutes, then check on it every 2 minutes until it is where you like it. Slice, then drizzle the Honey over it in a concentric circle from the inside to the out. Stir together the tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, garlic, salt and basil in a bowl until combined. (If you make this a day early, the flavor will be better.) Place the honey in a small pan and warm it on low heat until it is runny. Stir in the ancho cl powder, depending on how spicy you want it. Stir until it is mixed well and there are no pockets of cl powder. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 61130,&quot;Sparkling Sangria 1/4 cup orange flavored liqueur (recommended: Triple Sec or Grand Marnier) 1/4 cup almond liqueur (recommended: Amaretto) 12 strawberries, sliced 1 pint raspberries 1 bottle Spanish sparkling wine (recommended: Frexinet Cordon Negro) 4 seedless grapes Instructions: Combine liqueurs and fruit in the bottom of a medium pitcher and lightly muddle.

Spray a 9 1/2-by-3 1/2-inch bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray. Prepare the quick bread mix according to the package instructions. Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool. For the filling: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the brown sugar, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon and salt and mix until dissolved into the butter. Remove the skillet from the heat (turn off the heat) and stir in the rum. Return the skillet to medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the diced bananas and cook until softened just a little bit but not mushy, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool until warm. For the glaze and garnish: Heat the cream in a medium pot over low heat just to a simmer. Remove from the heat, add the butterscotch chips and let sit until melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the butter and mix until well blended. Let cool completely so that it is thick but still pourable. Place the cake presentation-side up on a large round platter. Using a spoon, remove some of the cake from the hole in the center to make a slightly larger well. Fill the hole with the banana filling; the filling should come up to about 1/4 inch from the top surface of the cake. You should have some of the filling left over, which can be used to top the individual slices of cake or mixed into a milk shake.

Stand 1 orange cut-side down on a cutting board. Working from top to bottom, cut away the peel and pith. Cut the orange into 3 rounds, each about 3/4-inch-thick, transferring the rounds to a medium bowl as you work. Repeat with the remaining oranges. Refrigerate the slices until needed. Squeeze the juice from the reserved orange ends into a small saucepan. Add the orange zest, honey and any remaining juice from your cutting board, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil, swirling the pot occasionally, until syrupy, about 6 minutes. Toward the end, the surface will be covered with big brownish bubbles. You should have about 1/4 cup of syrup. Let cool to room temperature, about 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a small skillet over medium heat, add the pistachios and cook, tossing frequently until fragrant and toasted, about 4 minutes. Let cool, then chop. Whisk together the yogurt, half the syrup and the orange-blossom water in a medium bowl. In each of 4 shallow bowls, layer 3 orange slices with 1 tablespoon of the yogurt mixture, beginning with an orange slice and ending with yogurt.

Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone baking mat. Sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Cut the cold butter into pats, then use a pastry cutter or 2 knives to cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles crumbs. Mix in the chocolate chips. Add the cream to a pitcher, then whisk in the vanilla and egg. Pour the cream mixture into the flour mixture; stir gently with a fork just until it comes together. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle (the mixture will be pretty crumbly). Use a rolling pin to roll it into about a 12-by-7-inch rectangle, 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. Use a knife to trim into a symmetrical rectangle, then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical squares/rectangles. Next, cut each square/rectangle in half diagonally, to form 2 triangles. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the scones are light brown--not golden--about 18 minutes. Allow to cool for 15 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. For the glaze: Add the milk and vanilla to a pitcher and mix together. Mix the confectioners&#39; sugar and salt in a bowl. Add the milk mixture and stir or whisk until completely smooth. Add more confectioners&#39; sugar or milk if necessary to get the consistency the right thickness. One at a time, carefully dunk each cooled scone in the glaze, turning it over if necessary to completely coat. Put on a cooling rack over a baking sheet. Allow the glaze to set completely, about 1 hour. The scones will keep several days if glazed. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61135,&quot;French Beer Mustard One 12-ounce bottle saison beer 2 tablespoons honey<br> 1 cup Dijon mustard<br> 1/2 cup whole-grain mustard<br> 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> Soft or hard pretzels, for serving<br> Instructions: Add the beer and honey to a saucepan, set over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer.

Break in the eggs. They will immediately bubble around the edges, making then crisp. Break their yolks with a fork and swirl them around, so that they are scattered fairly evenly through the whites. This will cook very quickly and the eggs should be tough. Either push them to one side of the pan or remove them, and fry bread in the drippings for each sandwich, two slices an egg. Fry on one side only. Sandwich egg between bread slices. Wrap them in waxed paper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61140,&quot;Pan Roasted Filet Mignon with Green Peppercorns Four 6-ounce filet mignon steaks, at room temperature, lightly pounded Kosher salt 1/4 cup black peppercorns, coarsely ground, such as Butcher Cut<br> 3 tablespoons canola or grapeseed oil<br> 1 shallot, minced<br> 2 tablespoons green peppercorns in brine, drained<br> 2 ounces brandy<br> 3/4 cup beef stock<br> 1/2 cup heavy cream<br> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> Chopped fresh parsley, for sprinkling 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar<br> Instructions: Sprinkle the steaks generously with salt on both sides. Press the top and bottoms of the steaks into the peppercorns to crust on each side. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy saute pan or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the steaks and sear for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Cook until the internal temperature is around 125 degrees F for medium-rare. Remove the steaks from the pan and allow them to rest. In the same pan the steaks were cooked in, add the shallots along with the remaining tablespoon oil and the green peppercorns and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the shallots are softened and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, then add the brandy and return the heat to medium. Cook for 1 minute. Add the beef stock and cream, then reduce the liquid by half until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt as needed. Turn off the heat. Swirl in the butter and melt, stirring often. Return the steaks to the pan and coat with the sauce. Sprinkle with the parsley and a splash of red wine vinegar to balance the richness of the sauce.

Pour the chocolate into the molds, filling them to the top. Set the sticks in place by inserting them just far enough to be secure within the mold you are using. Set the molds aside to allow the chocolate to set. When set, simply pop out the lollipops. If you are using molding compound, roll it into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle on top of a sheet of parchment paper. Using a sharp paring knife, cut out whatever shapes you would like and remove the cutout, leaving the homemade mold. Spray the inside edge of the molding compound with vegetable cooking spray and pour the chocolate into the cut out space. Insert the lollipop sticks and let cool completely before removing the molding compound. When finished, the molding compound can be saved and reused for another day. How to Temper Chocolate (From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 61142,&quot;Original Ranchandreg; Spinach Dip 1 packet (1 ounce) Hidden Valley?

Let cool completely on the baking sheets. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 61156,&quot;Classic Cinnamon Rolls 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pan 1/3 cup granulated sugar 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 batch Basic Sweet-Roll Dough, recipe follows 1 1/4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 3 tablespoons milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Pinch of salt 1/2 cup whole milk 1 1/4 -ounce packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons) 1/4 cup sugar 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled, plus more for brushing 1 large egg yolk 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (optional) Instructions: Make the rolls: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Whisk the sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle. Spread the butter over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on one of the long sides. Top with the cinnamon sugar. Brush the clean border with water. Tightly roll the dough into an 18-inch log, rolling toward the clean border; pinch the seam to seal. Slip a long taut piece of thread or unflavored floss under the roll, about 1 1/2 inches from the end. Lift the ends of the thread and cross over the roll, pulling tightly to cut off a piece. Repeat, cutting every 1 1/2 inches, to make 12 rolls. Place the rolls in the prepared baking dish. Cover the rolls loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour, 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Uncover the rolls and bake until they spring back when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in the pan. (You can freeze the baked rolls for up to 2 weeks. Cool completely before freezing, then thaw, warm up and glaze before serving.) Make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar, melted butter, milk, vanilla and salt in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle over the warm rolls. Warm 1/2 cup water and the milk in a saucepan over low heat until a thermometer registers 100 degrees F to 110 degrees F. Remove from the heat and sprinkle the yeast on top, then sprinkle with a pinch of the sugar; set aside, undisturbed, until foamy, about 5 minutes. Whisk the melted butter, egg yolk and vanilla into the yeast mixture until combined. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, the remaining sugar, the salt and nutmeg. Make a well in the center, then add the yeast mixture and stir with a wooden spoon to make a thick and slightly sticky dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until soft and elastic, about 6 minutes. Shape into a ball. Brush a large bowl with butter. Add the dough, turning to coat lightly with the butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the dough is doubled in size, about 1 hour, 15 minutes. Turn the dough out of the bowl and knead briefly to release excess air; re-form into a ball and return to the bowl. Lightly butter a large piece of plastic wrap and lay it directly on the surface of the dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling wine]&quot; 61157,&quot;Coffee Frappe 3 cups ice 2 cups espresso, chilled 1 cup half-and-half 1/2 cup hazelnut syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Whipped cream, for topping Shaved chocolate, for topping Instructions: To a blender, add the ice, coffee, half-and-half, hazelnut syrup, and vanilla extract and blend until smooth.

In a large pot, bring the water to a rolling boil. Add the salt. Taste the water. It should be salty like sea water. Add the macaroni and stir, with a wooden spoon or large slotted spoon, to ensure the macaroni does not stick to the bottom of the pot as it cooks. Cook until the macaroni is still quite firm, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour the macaroni and water into a strainer placed over the sink. Allow the water to drain out, reserving approximately 1 cup of the liquid. In the same pot, bring the cream, garlic cloves, and the reserved cooking liquid to a simmer. Add the mustard and 3 cups of the Gruyere. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Simmer gently, stirring constantly, until the cheese is melted and has integrated with the cream. Add the Parmesan and Cheddar. Stir with a wooden spoon and simmer again until smooth. Add a splash of Worcestershire and a splash of hot sauce. Stir to blend. Taste for seasoning. Add the macaroni to the cream and stir gently to blend. Allow the macaroni to rest on the stove, 5 to 10 minutes, so the pasta absorbs the flavors. Remove and discard the garlic cloves. Fill a baking dish with the macaroni mixture, top with the bread crumbs, the remaining Gruyere cheese and bake 10 to 12 minutes or until the bread crumbs crust on top.

To make the croutons: Cut the bread into squares. Combine melted butter and olive oil. Toss bread squares in the oil and melted butter combination and season with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet in 1 layer. Bake, tossing several times in the cooking process, until they are golden brown, crispy on the outside and a little soft inside, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool at room temperature and reserve. Do not refrigerate. To make the vinaigrette: In a food processor, add garlic, lemon juice, vinegar, anchovy fillet, Dijon, Worcestershire, hot sauce, salt, pepper, and egg yolk and process for 15 seconds. With the processor running, slowly drizzle in the truffle oil and the olive oil. This recipe will make twice the amount that you need for a salad for 6 people. It is difficult to make a smaller quantity in a food processor. The vinaigrette will keep up to 1 week, well covered, in the refrigerator. The salad is good enough to serve twice in 1 week. Preheat a grill to high. To make the Salad: In a mixing bowl, drizzle the chunks of salmon with enough oil just to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the plank from the water and brush with some oil. Place the plank either on the grill or next to an open fire in a wood oven. Allow it to just catch fire. Put it out, and do the same to the other side of the plank. Place the fish pieces directly onto the plank, about 1-inch apart. Return it to the grill. The plank should be arranged near the fire so that it smolders on the edges, creating smoke that surrounds the fish. Allow this to continue, placing it near the fire in such a way that it smolders but does not catch fire. Cook the fish to medium rare, about 6 minutes. While the salmon is cooking, place the whole, but separated romaine leaves in a large mixing bowl with the croutons. Ladle about 1/2 of the vinaigrette over the whole leaves, season with salt and pepper and toss just to coat the leaves. Sprinkle the grated Parmesan over the salad and give the salad a final gentle toss. Arrange the leaves and the croutons on 6 chilled plates. Flake the salmon on its natural separations and divide evenly over the salads. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 61165,&quot;Parmesan Crusted Salmon 1 (6-ounce) salmon fillet, skin off 1/4 cup Parmesan, finely grated Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 ounces sun dried tomatoes, packed in olive oil 1 clove garlic 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 clove garlic 1/2 cup basil leaves 1/4 cup grated Parmesan Salt and freshly ground white pepper Salt and freshly ground white pepper<br> Parmesan Crisps, recipe follows Sauteed Asparagus, recipe follows Mashed Potatoes, recipe follows 1/4 cup Parmesan, coarsely grated 4 green asparagus 1/2 tablespoon butter Salt and white pepper Salt and white pepper 2 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/8ths 1/2 cup cream<br> 2 tablespoons butter Salt and freshly ground white pepper Salt and freshly ground white pepper Instructions: Lightly season the salmon with salt and pepper. Generously coat 1side of the salmon with the finely grated Parmesan. In a non-stick saute pan, add approximately 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and place over high heat. When the oil is hot, carefully place the salmon in the pan cheese side down. Turn temperature down to medium heat and allow the salmon to cook about 4 minutes before flipping over. The idea is to form a nice crispy, lightly brown crust. Turn salmon and allow to cook another 3 or 4 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside in a warm place until plating.<br> Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Paste:<br> In a blender or food processor, add the sun-dried tomatoes along with their oil, the garlic cloves, and 1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil. Process the mixture on high speed approximately 1 minute until almost smooth. The mixture should be slightly chunky. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.<br> Basil Pesto<br> In a blender or food processor, place the extra-virgin olive oil and garlic clove. Process until smooth. Add the basil leaves, and process for about 1 minute until mixture is relatively smooth. Add the Parmesan and process again until fully incorporated. Season the pesto with salt and pepper, to taste.<br> To plate:<br> Place a small mound of mash potatoes in the center of the plate. Place the asparagus on top of the mashed potatoes at an angle. Then put the salmon nicely on the plate, overlapping the asparagus. Drizzle the plate with both pestos and garnish the plate with the Parmesan crisp by securing it in the bed of mashed potatoes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br> Heavily grease a cookie sheet (parchment paper is optional, but if using parchment, make sure it is heavily greased). In a 5-inch diameter circle, sprinkle the coarsely grated Parmesan. Make sure there is just enough to fill the circle, don&#39;t over do it! Place in oven and bake for approximately 8 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool before lifting from cookie sheet. Be extremely gentle with them they are very brittle when cool. Cut off about 2 inches of the ends of the asparagus, as they tend to be very coarse and tough. Blanch asparagus in boiling, well-salted water until tender. Shock them in ice water to keep them from cooking any further and hold them until you are ready to plate. Right before plating, in a saute pan over a low flame, melt the butter with the asparagus. Once the asparagus are hot, season with salt and white pepper. Place the potatoes in cold, salted water over high heat. Cook thoroughly and strain. In a separate pot, heat heavy cream and butter. Using a potato masher, mash potatoes. Slowly incorporate the cream and butter mixture.

F. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil. Cook half of the octopus, turning with tongs occasionally, until browned on all sides, for 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining octopus. To the pot, add the white onion, cl habanero and half of the garlic and cook, stirring, until browned, for 5 to 6 minutes. Add 2 cups water; bring to a boil. Add the octopus, orange zest and parsley. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Braise until the octopus is tender and a knife pierces the thickest tentacle with little resistance, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Uncover the pot and let the octopus cool in the liquid. Remove the octopus from the pot. Using a paper towel, wipe the skin off the tentacles, leaving the suckers intact. Cut the tentacles into 2-inch pieces, then cut the head into quarters. Discard the braising liquid. In a large bowl, whisk the lime juice, orange juice, chiles de rbol and the remaining garlic and 1/4 cup oil. Transfer 1/4 cup of the mixture to a small bowl; set aside. Whisk the salt into the remaining mixture in the large bowl. Add the octopus, raw shrimp, red onion, tomatoes and bell peppers and toss to coat. Cover the bowl and let marinate for 15 minutes. Thread the octopus and shrimp on metal skewers, alternating with the onion, peppers and tomatoes, and transfer to a baking sheet. Prepare a grill for high heat. Use tongs and an old, clean kitchen towel to brush the grates with oil. Grill the brochetas, turning occasionally, until lightly charred on all sides, for 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer the brochetas to a platter and brush with the reserved lime mixture. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 61179,&quot;Crab Fries Oil, for frying, optional 15 ounces frozen french fries 1 ounce Fry Seasoning, recipe follows 2 ounces Char Grill Butter, recipe follows, melted 4 ounces Char Grill Cheese, recipe follows 2 ounces lump crabmeat 4 ounces Crab Mayo, recipe follows 3/4 cup paprika 3/4 cup kosher salt 1/2 cup chili powder 1/2 cup granulated garlic 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper 2 pounds butter 1/2 cup lemon juice 1/4 cup minced garlic 1/4 cup hot sauce 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated garlic 1 ounce liquid smoke 3 1/2 cups shredded Parmesan 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella 1 tablespoon granulated garlic 1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped 1 bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped 1/2 red onion, small dice 3/4 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup lemon juice 1/4 cup hot sauce 1 tablespoon honey 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay Instructions: Prepare your preferred method for frying french fries, such as oil on a stovetop, countertop fryer or air fryer at 350 degrees F.

Scrape the paste into a small bowl. Add the mayonnaise, buttermilk, vinegar, chives, parsley and scallions and whisk well to make a creamy dressing. Use immediately or refrigerate in a tightly sealed container for up to 3 days. (Makes about 1 1/3 cups.) For the salad: Put the potatoes in a small saucepan with enough cold water to cover and season with salt. Bring to a boil and then simmer, uncovered, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and put in a large bowl. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and salt it generously. Fill a medium bowl with ice water and salt it as well. Add the corn, beans and broccoli to the boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or strainer to scoop out the vegetables and plunge them immediately into the ice water. Drain the vegetables, pat them dry and add to the bowl of potatoes along with the tomatoes and cucumber. Toss the salad with 1/2 cup of the dressing. Taste, and add more salt and pepper if desired. (The salad may be prepared up to this point 2 hours ahead and refrigerated.) When ready to serve, toss the salad with the greens and the sprouts if desired, and with a bit more dressing if you like your salad on the well-dressed side.

Add the minced garlic and shallot and chopped thyme, rosemary and bay leaves and rub all over until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Scrape off as much of the seasoning mixture as possible from the turkey legs and wings and discard. Blot dry with paper towels. Melt the duck fat in a large wide pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Nestle the turkey legs and wings skin-side up in the pot so that they&#39;re submerged in the fat. Bring to a very gentle simmer, cover and cook until the leg meat is extremely tender, but not falling apart, about 2 hours. Turn off the heat and set aside. The recipe can be prepared to this point up to 2 days in advance. Keep the turkey submerged in the fat and refrigerate it.<br> Meanwhile, prepare and roast the turkey breast. Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven, remove the top rack, and preheat to 425 degrees F. Sprinkle the breast generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with the halved garlic and shallots, the remaining thyme, rosemary and bay leaves and the orange. Prop the breast up by placing two balls of aluminum foil under the space where the wings would attach, so that it doesn&#39;t topple over. Brush the skin with some of the rendered duck fat, and roast until just starting to brown, about 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue cooking until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the breast registers 160 degrees F, about 30 minutes more. Remove the turkey from the oven and set aside to rest. While the turkey rests, finish the legs and wings. Carefully remove the legs and wings from the fat and blot dry with paper towels. Put 1/4 cup of the fat in each of 2 large nonstick skillets. Heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the legs and wings skin-side down and cook until deeply browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until browned on the second side and heated through, about 3 minutes more. Transfer the legs and wings to a serving platter. Carve the breast meat and transfer to the platter with the legs and wings. Serve with the Pear Chutney on the side. Combine the pears, shallot, sugar, raisins, 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining tablespoon vinegar. Serve warm or chilled. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 61189,&quot;Chocolate-Covered Maple Brandy Jellies with Nuts 4 envelopes gelatin (about 1 ounce) 1 1/2 cups half-and-half 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup maple syrup 4 envelopes gelatin (about 1 ounce) 1 cup simple syrup 1 cup brandy Five 3.5-ounce bars 64-percent dark chocolate, chopped 1 1/2 cups candied pecans, coarsely ground Instructions: For the maple cream layer: Line a 10-inch square cake pan with plastic wrap so that the plastic falls over the edges of the pan. Then place a square of parchment paper over the plastic in the bottom of the pan. In a small bowl, combine the gelatin with just enough water to cover and mix until incorporated. In a small saucepan bring the half-and-half to a simmer. Add the sugar and maple syrup, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the gelatin. Stir until incorporated. Pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan. Refrigerate until set, about 45 minutes. For the brandy layer: When the maple cream layer is completely set, begin on the brandy layer. In a small bowl, combine the gelatin with just enough water to cover and mix until incorporated. Bring the simple syrup to a simmer, then add the gelatin and whisk until melted together. Remove from the heat and stir in the brandy. Pour the brandy layer over the maple cream layer in the cake pan. Refrigerate until set, another 45 minutes. Using the plastic wrap as handles, carefully lift the layered gelatin from the cake pan. Slice into 1-inch squares. Fill a large saucepan with about 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Fit a large glass or metal mixing bowl into the pot, making sure that the bottom of the bowl doesn&#39;t touch the water. Place the chocolate in the bowl and, using a heat resistant spatula, stir as the chocolate melts. Once fully melted, stir until a candy thermometer inserted in the chocolate reads 120 degrees F. Then pour the chocolate onto a clean, cool surface and push it back and forth with a spatula or bench scraper. You&#39;re looking to push it around to cool it down to 82 degrees F. This is tempering the chocolate. Transfer the chocolate to a clean bowl. Use a fork to dip the gelatin squares into the chocolate, tapping a bit to remove excess chocolate. Then place the squares chocolate-side up on a sheet pan fitted with a cooling rack. Repeat for the remaining gelatin squares. Garnish with the candied pecans while the chocolate is still hot so they stick to the candies. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Chianti, Tempranillo, Grenache Blanc]</p><p>&quot; 61190,&quot;Pinot Noir, Chanterelle, and Fresh Truffle Sauce 1 shallot, finely minced 1 clove garlic, finely minced 8 ounces Chanterelle mushrooms 4 ounces Pinot Noir 8 ounces demi-glace Salt and pepper, to taste 1/2 ounce fresh black truffle Instructions: Saute shallots, garlic, and chanterelle mushrooms in a little butter.

Position a rack in the center of the oven. Arrange the pearl onions and carrots in the bottom of a roasting pan. Drizzle with the wine. Set a roasting rack in the center of the pan on top of the vegetables and brush with the oil so that the chicken doesn&#39;t stick. Place the chicken, breast-side up, on the rack. Sprinkle the chicken all over with salt and pepper. Put the pan in the center of the oven and roast until the juices run clear or an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (avoiding bone) registers 165 degrees F. (I calculate cooking about 15 minutes per pound of bird, so for a 4-pound bird I check the juices and temperature after 1 hour of cooking.) Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest in the pan for at least 10 minutes or up to 20. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board, gently placing it breast-side down so the juices can flow through the breast meat as it rests for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Place the roasting pan with the vegetables on a burner on the stove and add the chicken stock and mustard. Simmer gently, scraping any bits of chicken fat and skin from the bottom. Let the sauce simmer a little with the vegetables, 2 to 3 minutes. Add half the butter and cook, about 1 minute. Remove the vegetables from the pan to a plate. Add the lemon juice, half the tarragon and 1 more tablespoon butter. Allow the butter to melt, then remove the gravy to a serving bowl. Turn the chicken breast-side up on a cutting board and carve. (The cut side will need some seasoning.) Rub the remaining butter onto the carved chicken breast meat and season with salt. Sprinkle with the remaining tarragon.

Season with plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper. The mixture should still be wet enough so the bread crumbs stick to the croquettas. Form into croquettas (makes about 2 dozen, medium-sized) and dip into panko bread crumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper. Pat lightly so the crumbs stick. Lay out on a tray, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before frying. To fry, heat 1-inch of vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or heavy bottomed pot, over medium heat to about 360 degrees F. Fry in small batches, turning once until evenly browned. Each batch should take approximately 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels and season with kosher salt. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with chives and shaved manchego. Serve with Romesco Sauce. Toast almonds in a skillet over medium heat until golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer almonds to a blender. Add roasted red peppers, egg yolk, garlic, zest, and season with salt and pepper. Pulse a few times to combine the ingredients. With the blender on low speed drizzle in the olive oil. Once it begins to emulsify, stop the blender and add the orange juice, and sherry vinegar. Buzz once more to fully emulsify. *RAW EGG WARNING Food Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs. Due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.
