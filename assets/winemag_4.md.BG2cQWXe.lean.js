The granite-dominated soils of these parcels imbue the wine with a pungent, almost powdery minerality that is so prominent as to be almost puzzling (in a wonderful way). The fruit is pure, and very deep, but also extremely bright, displaying a Burgundy-like combination of power and weightlessness. Furthermore, the wine is unmarked by the influence of new oak, as Stphane dislikes those flavors in northern Rhone syrah, ageing instead in four-to-six-year-old casks. His wines are uncanny in their union of clarity and fruit expression with an unmistakable stamp of terroirthis St. Joseph could come from nowhere else in the world, and displays all the bramble, pepper, and bacon fat you want and expect in a wine from this region.

A late-season frost in 2009 prevented normal bud formation in the spring, resulting in lower yields. January and February saw unseasonably warm weather throughout the region, and consequently, veraison occurred earlier than normal in most areas. Sugar accumulation arrest in the berry was delayed and led to lower potential alcohol levels in the fruit than in 2009. Throughout the summer, the weather remained both hot and dry, resulting in generally thick skinned fruit with very concentrated flavors. The fruit also maintained excellent levels of natural acidity, lending freshness and vibrancy to the grapes. Overall, the dry season combined with lower yields resulted in fruit with intense color, exceptional levels of concentration and complexity."},{"name":"Don Miguel Gascon Malbec 2018","region":"Mendoza, ar","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Opens with intense aromas of blackberry, plum and a hint of mocha.

In this case only we de-stemmed 65% leaving the rest whole cluster.

Crushing is achieved via pigeage  pied (foot stomping). We do not make wine in plastic. All of our reds are fermented in open top wood vats and here we used our 4 ton vat for the first time on this wine which resulted in less temperature extremes and longer mid-range temps (in the high 70's to low 80's). Wild yeasts are employed without nutrients or other enhancers. We punch down by hand up to 3x daily which is an extreme work out in a 4 ton tank with 35% whole cluster! The cooperage was a mix of 1-3 yr old French oak barrels. Malolactic fermentation was natural and completed by early summer.

The dry early spring and long, cool fall meant an extremely long growing season in 2007. Such a year give an extra level of richness to the Dutton Ranch Chardonnay. In addition to the usual core of lime and tangerine fruit that the old vines always offer, rich pear and ripe apple come more to the fore. Aromas of pear, citrus and butterscotch promise the richness of this wine, and the overtones of gardenia and sandalwood foretell its complexity. In the mouth, the typical solid structure of Dutton Ranch Chardonnay carries the unctuous citrus and candied pear fruit. It is this balance of bright acidity, fresh fruit, and lushness that make Chardonnay from Dutton Ranch so special. Great as an aperitif, try it also with your favorite fowl dishes, or any grilled fish."},{"name":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Chardonnay 2008","region":"Russian River, Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The early spring of 2008 was marked by over 20 days of frost, resulting in extremely small chardonnay yields, even on our hillside vineyards. Between these tiny crops, the warm harvest season and our old vines, 2008 gave us particularly focused and structured Dutton Ranch Chardonnay. The classic lemon cream character of the Old Wente selection is amped up with particular brightness, concentration and a core of minerality. In the nose, aromas of lemon zest and tangerine are balanced by buttercream, pear and a hint of caramel. In the mouth it's all about the lively citrus fruit at first sip, but with time it's the overtones of pear and ginger, along with the lush mouthfeel and phenolic edge that make the wine truly special. The bright acidity and moderate alcohol carry a finish of energetic fruit and cleansing minerality, leaving you ready for another sip. Great as an aperitif, try it also with your favorite fowl dishes, or any grilled fish."},{"name":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Chardonnay 2011","region":"Russian River, Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"The wine shows the crystalline citrus fruit and freshness so quintessential to the neighborhood. In the nose, it leads with lemon curd, buttercream and a touch of tangerine - fantastic concentration and focus. The mouth is refreshing and luscious at the same time. Meyer lemon, a hint of toffee, and mandarin orange fill out the middle, while the creamy tropical overtones round out the edges. The finish combines fresh citrus, sweet buttercream, bright acidity and a cleansing minerality that leaves you wanting more."},{"name":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Chardonnay 2013","region":"Russian River, Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"2013 was another stellar growing season in the Russian River Valley; warm spring, great flowering weather, and a long moderate ripening season. Our blocks for the Dutton Ranch blend were harvested between September 9 and October 11; the fruit was beautifully clean and ripe, and gave us wines with the acid backbone and luscious citrus and stone fruit flavors we so love from our neighborhood. This wine is about freshness and balance: in the nose it leads with Meyer lemon, pear and mineral notes, with tropical and ginger overtones. In the mouth, the lusciousness of this season is balanced by solid acidity and an evolving fruit core that keeps you coming back. Lemon sourball, ripe pear and a touch of green apple fill out the fruit profile, while the steely minerality and sweet cream add a complexity that we love in this wine. Moderate alcohol and the signature juicy acidity of Green Valley facilitate the fresh, lingering citrus/ginger finish. This is a wine that evolves in the glass and will easily reward 5 years of cellar aging, but both will be a challenge with its immediate allure."},{"name":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Chardonnay 2014","region":"Russian River, Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"This wine is about freshness and balance: in the nose it leads with Meyer lemon, pear and mineral notes, with tropical and ginger overtones.

The wine leads with brambles tinged by floral notes, like walking through the blackberry patch in late spring before all the blossoms have faded. Further notes of violets and rose petals chime in to the berry basket, while a layer of baking spices lays underneath. The mouth is juicy and rich raspberry and blackberry fruit, like a summer pie just waiting on the windowsill, with a lift of acidity keeping it bright. The wine is remarkably balanced, with the fruit and spice, sweetness and acidity, richness and freshness creating a perfect harmony together."},{"name":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir 2007","region":"Russian River, Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2007 vintage was about a good as it gets for growing Pinot. Ample early winter rains provided excellent subsoil moisture, while the dry, warm spring and early summer stimulated balanced vine growth, good set, and early conversion to ripening metabolism. The year turned cool in late summer and fall, preserving acidity and providing us with extended hang time for superb flavor and tannin development. The resulting wine is everything we want in the Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir: opulent and bright on the nose, focused and lush in the mouth, and fresh and lingering on the finish. The nose bursts with ripe black cherry, Asian spice and cinnamon. The mouth is striking for its combination of plush cherry and blackberry fruit, bright acidity and supple tannins, all carried through the persistent, spicy finish. A very versatile food match, try it with roasted fowl, salmon on the barbeque, chanterelle risotto, or your favorite fresh cheeses."},{"name":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir 2009","region":"Russian River, Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2009 offering is exactly what we're looking for in the Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir: the luscious berry fruit so indicative of the Russian River Valley, unctuous tannins, and an almost candied richness, all on a palate that's fresh, bright and balanced. In the nose, it shows blackberry, black cherry and a touch of sandalwood; it's a bit darker than many years due to the long growing season, and the maturing of our spectacular Marty's vineyard. It delivers as promised in the mouth, with dark blackberry and cranberry fruit, a touch of nutmeg spice, and wonderfully plush tannins. The combination of solidity and suppleness is striking, and the structure and acid freshness carries an almost sweet boysenberry finish for minutes in the mouth. Try this wine with sharp cheeses as an aperitif, or with almost any food you love--that's the nature of great Pinot: don't sweat it, just drink it."},{"name":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir 2011","region":"Russian River, Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"The 2011 vintage provided an extraordinarily fresh and sleek Dutton Ranch Pinot. Though the fundamental bright berry core and silky Green Valley tannins are always part and parcel of this wine, there is a particularly vivid aromatic freshness this year, which carries through in its bright acid and low alcohol in the mouth. Red berries combined with black cherry fruit in the nose is underlain with candied rhubarb and a hint of sandalwood and cinnamon. In the mouth, the cherry flavors are carried through on the wonderfully fine tannins--like warm cherry vanilla ice cream in a glass. The finish is exceptionally lengthy, and serves up the accompanying sweet berry cream pie."},{"name":"Dutton-Goldfield Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir 2012","region":"Russian River, Sonoma County, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"With its friendly ripening season, 2012 gave us a Dutton Ranch Pinot that showcases the deeper cherry fruit, thick tannins and opulence we get in fully ripe years. The core of the aromatics is red and black cherry fruit, but nuances of strawberry, raspberry, nutmeg and toffee are quite evident with time in the glass. In the mouth, the first impression is bright, luscious berry fruit, but it's the soft, broad tannins that carry the complex flavors across your palate and open up tones of cranberry, nutmeg and coriander. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.

With less than 2 tons an acre to ripen, it had no trouble doing so in spectacular fashion. Freestone is once again a standout for the vintage, showing gorgeous black cherry, black plum, thyme and clove on the nose, with the candied blackberry character likening to what Frambois is to raspberry. In the mouth, the wine is broody and dark spice with a lift of creamy red fruit.

The bad news is that the vineyard yield was the most pitiful we've seen since the almost nonexistent 2003 harvest, so only 240 total cases were produced. The sparse set and warm, dry harvest season gave the Sanchietti fruit thick skins and a tiny juice yield. The resulting wine is unusually extracted for this vineyard, but the tannins are still silky and the fresh blueberry fruit is still at the core. In the nose, the wine is blueberries and black cherry compote, along with coriander and toffee overtones. In the mouth, the thickness of the 2008 vintage is immediately apparent, supporting a sweet core of blackberry and blueberry fruit and carried by wonderfully fine but substantial tannin core.

The cooler coastal vineyard sites in normal years allow for slow maturation, but the 1999 growing season was colder than usual. Luckily, the crop size was small. This fact was the vintage's salvation. Even an average size crop would not have ripened.

In a curious reversal of the usual pattern, some of the highest quality red wines were from some of the warmer regions in 1999. The art of blending played a significant role this year.

With the generous harvest of 2013 preceding it, we were delighted that the 2014 growing season pushed all the limits in the growing season but stayed on track to the finish.  Across the board, the 2014 red wines from our estate were remarkable in their abundant yet fine tannins, bright fruit on the nose, and tremendous length in the finish."},{"name":"Farella La Luce Estate Sauvignon Blanc 2017","region":"Coombsville, Napa Valley, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Sauvignon Blanc is one of our favorite refreshments -- crisp, fresh and lively. We have subscribed to this style for 30 years from the same block on our vineyard estate. We keep 15 C 20% of our Sauvignon Blanc grapes, the remainder going to Lail Vineyards, Realm Cellars and Tournesol. Our estate-bottled Sauvignon Blanc bears the name La Luce, an homage to this wine and our Italian heritage, but in particular to our founder, Frank Farella (alive and well!) and his passion for our vineyard and the spectacular sunsets, we enjoy from our west-facing site on an almost daily basis. He produced the first Sauvignon Blanc from our vineyard in 1985. Many Napa Valley Sauvignon Blancs are made with an attempt at richness and complexity but, too often, resulting in wines that are better compared to their Chardonnay cousins. The key to a lively Sauvignon Blanc is harvesting at the lowest sugar level in the ripeness window and a cold fermentation with Champagne yeast below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. We also ferment in a stainless steel tank and minimize the handling of the wine, again to maintain freshness. In the end, our Sauvignon Blanc is best compared to the light, fresh, relatively low alcohol white wines commonly found in Northern it. We have been amazed at the ability of those wines to refresh and not dull the senses due to their low alcohol and high acidity. It is difficult to find wines made domestically in this category with any varietal. Since our first vintage, we have produced Sauvignon Blancs that play off of the citrus and light tropical fruit characteristics that are so often overblown in the wide range of styles produced in California. We have sought to enhance the delicacy and refreshment that can make Sauvignon Blanc such a wonderful aperitif to enhance your appetite and enliven your palate."},{"name":"Farella Sauvignon Blanc La Luce 2009","region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"White Wine","notes":"Light and fresh with crisp acidity.

The weight and texture of the wine is particularly striking as flavors of black cherry, Bing cherry, kirsch, and Mission Fig explode in the mouth. Always among the most age-worthy of Anderson Valley Pinot Noirs, this Savoy will develop gracefully for many years to come."},{"name":"FEL Savoy Vineyard Pinot Noir 2013","region":"Anderson Valley, Mendocino, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Of all the vineyards FEL works with in Anderson Valley, Savoy is consistently the most savory. The aromatics are an intriguing blend of black tea, cedar, and sage all wrapped around an intense core of black cherry.

A delicate balance of silky tannins and fresh acidity support a rich palate, long on dark fruit flavors of blackcurrant and plum, with layers of allspice and crushed mint. This is a slow developing wine that will benefit greatly from a few years of bottle aging and continue to develop for at least a decade."},{"name":"FEL Savoy Vineyard Pinot Noir 2015","region":"Anderson Valley, Mendocino, California","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Aromatic waves of black cherry, pomegranate, and boysenberry fill the glass of this elegantly concentrated wine. Subtle notes of anise, black tea leaves, and redwood needles add further depth and complexity to the nose. The weight and concentration of this heady wine is immediately apparent in the mouth, with dense layers of black fruit, pencil shavings, and hints of cocoa. The velvet-like tannins provide structure that is punctuated by a refreshingly acidic finish that lingers in the mouth for several minutes. This wine will age gracefully for a full decade or more."},{"name":"Felipe Staiti Euforia Malbec 2014","region":"Uco Valley, Mendoza, ar","variety":"Red Wine","notes":"Intense red colour.

This slow, steady duration gives the fruit a chance to fully mature their flavors and tannins without losing their natural acidity and balance. Sudden warm spells or heat spikes can force a winemaker to pick before full flavor development, fearing an elevated alcohol level. Wines with hang-time possess, subtly, more depth and complexity in aromas and more richness and finesse in flavors.
