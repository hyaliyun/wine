The nose deals blueberry but also a thin, floral note that teeters on the edge of piercing.

It's appealing, broadly accessible, fairly simplistic, but certainly delicious.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Plenty of wood to the nose, leaving aromas of smoke, cedar, leather and lemon. That tangy, barrique-based lemon character lasts through the cherry-dominated palate and onto the juicy finish. With a bit less citrus and more harmony it would be right up there with the best.","designation":"San Leonino Riserva"},{"country":"it","description":"The bouquet blends darker notes of mocha and chocolate with red-fruit aromas. The palate is fine and crisp, with no added weight whatsoever. Acidity is its calling card, so labeling it lean and precise would be accurate. For some, however, its freshness could be construed as gritty and closed.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"This wine, from Wahluke Slope (warm site) vineyards, nonetheless retains a distinct herbal flavor, married to very hard, tough, green tannins.

Good stuff, solid and very clean, with plump berry flavors.","designation":"Winemakers Select"},{"country":"it","description":"Smooth and minty, with aromas of cedar, cherry and milk chocolate.

Inordinately zesty on the tongue, with fiery tannins and live-wire acidity churning away. A little jagged and rough in terms of texture, but very much alive and kicking.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"it","description":"Roasted as if Starbucks got a hold of the grapes, and that charred character lasts from the deep nose, to the chewy palate, and finally through the smoky finish.

We liked the coffee and black-fruit characteristics but were less fond of the lemon-pushing wood.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"fr","description":"A dry wine with spicy aromas.

Not currently available in the U.S.","designation":"Black Pepper Sparkling"},{"country":"it","description":"A lush, medium-weight wine that shows some barrique influence in its aromas of vanilla, tobacco, smoke and bacon. Soft and chewy on the finish, this is approachable now, but should be more food-friendly in a year or two.","designation":"Misciano Riserva"},{"country":"es","description":"With color akin to crude oil with a violet tint, this is one tank of a wine. The nose is massively roasted, with espresso, bacon fat and blackberry melding in monster fashion.

Heady for sure, but lacking that extra nuance or two that the great ones have.","designation":"Culmen"},{"country":"US","description":"Manages to feel both soft and tannic at the same time, which means it's fine now but should age for a few years. The blackcurrant and smoky oak flavors are harmonious, with sweet fruit lasting through a long finish.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"A blend of Shiraz (70%), Cabernet Franc (20%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (10%).

Well-behaved, and a successful if unusual blend.","designation":"JSM"},{"country":"it","description":"Nicely concentrated, with a depth of fruit and richness of texture uncommon to Dolcetto.

Pair with foie gras or cheeses.","designation":"S lection de Grains Nobles"},{"country":"fr","description":"An exotic, perfumed wine, with aromas of violets and rosewater.

Cellar Candidate (6 C 10 years).","designation":"Twelve Row Block"},{"country":"US","description":"Quite a different wine from Laetitia's Colline bottling, although it's not fair to say one's better. This is chunkier, with berry and stone fruit flavors intrigued by a meaty, leathery note.

Intense and interwoven.","designation":"Rocca Rubia Riserva"},{"country":"US","description":"Say hello to this marvelously ripe, cheerful Zin. It totally turns you on.

The greatest Esprit Blanc ever. Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Viognier.","designation":"Esprit de Beaucastel Blanc"},{"country":"US","description":"This flamboyant wine is drenched in new oak the way Hollywood stars used to wrap themselves in mink.

Thank goodness for the acids. Deliriously addictive. Mostly Semillon, with Sauvignon Blanc.","designation":"Late Harvest Wine"},{"country":"US","description":"Classic Napa Cab, right up there with the greats.

Clean and quaffable.","designation":"(McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills)"},{"country":"au","description":"Smells like a blended fruit-box juice, and gives a similar impression on the palate. Distinct red raspberry, plum, apple and grape flavors rides some rough wood on the palate. A straightforward Shiraz, but one that has not smoothed out yet. Give it six months or a year; maybe the wood will settle down.","designation":"The Footbolt"},{"country":"au","description":"Though more expensive than d'Arenberg's The Custodian Grenache, I liked this one less. Brown sugar and maple syrup aromas dominate; the palate is mercifully not as sweet as the nose would suggest, showing mostly black plum and berry notes. Wooly tannins on the finish have staying power, but the feel on the palate is pretty straighforward. 500 cases produced.","designation":"The Derelict Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"Light in color and in body, a silky wine, but with good acids.

An interesting blend, too, particularly for the price.","designation":"Scrubby Rise SZ-CS-PV"},{"country":"pt","description":"A sweet, delicate wine that has a fine balance between ripe fruit and tannins, produced by one of the main houses owned by the Symington group.

A by-the-glass winner.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"Roughly three quarters Cab Sauvignon and one quarter Petit Verdot, with a smidge of Merlot for good measure.

On the palate, the smoke and black cherry continue, on a rather slight, feminine frame. A wine that will complement, not overpower, food.","designation":"Basket Pressed"},{"country":"US","description":"The most important things about this wine are its upfront oak and full-bodied character.

Likable and easy to grasp.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"US","description":"A little light in body and fruit, but achieves complexity with the rich acids and myriad of flavors. They include cherries, leather, root beer, spices and oaky smoke and vanilla. Good acids, and a silky texture.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"The straw brown color suggests a wine that is already slightly oxidized, and the palate confirms that the fruit is dropping out, leaving a creamy, yeasty, still  flavorful wine that is ready to go.

Smoke, cola and earth aromas give way to black cherries and vanilla, finishing with a subtle note of dried spice and tea leaves.","designation":"Terraces Estate"},{"country":"US","description":"Made in the exotic style, with loads of ripe tropical fruit and spice flavors, but the crisp acidity and well-defined structure lend it elegance and style. Notable for the creamy texture.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"Firm on the nose, with mineral and underripe peach aromas. The palate is more plump, with riper peach flavors accenting cantaloupe. Shows good verve, but remains tame on the palate. Very dry and food-friendly.","designation":"Gran Cuvee Brut Rose"},{"country":"de","description":"Smoky and minerally on the nose, gradually opening up to reveal candied pineapple and pink grapefruit notes. It's sweet yet light-bodied on the palate, with flavors of red berries and quince that are refreshing on the finish.","designation":" rziger W rzgarten Riesling Auslese *"},{"country":"au","description":"A perennial favorite in the aun sparklers arena, this wine balances pretty bread-flour and golden apple aromas and flavors with a crisp citrus cleanness. Blessedly dry on the palate; citrus, pear and biscuit flavors bring it to a clean close.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a ripe Chard that detonates the palate with tangerine, pineapple, peach and green apple, and a spicy seasoning of oak. It has a creamy texture and a sweet, fruity intensity that finishes with a scour of orange peel. Delicious.","designation":"Foppoli Ranch"},{"country":"US","description":"Starts with wonderfully complex scents of dough, char, butterscotchy smoke, lemon chiffon pie and vanilla. The flavors are equally complex. Would score higher if not for a certain roughness of texture.","designation":"Brut"},{"country":"US","description":"A carbon copy of the winery's brut, except with a little darker, a fuller body and hints of cherries and strawberries. Dry, with a round, creamy texture. Try this polished wine with sushi.","designation":"Brut Rose"},{"country":"au","description":"Aromas are of cherry and ginger; salmon-copper in color. What you get on the palate follows suit: light cherry and peach flavors, packaged in a medium-bodied sparkler that is soft on palate entry and grows crisper and more tangy toward the finish. Pleasantly perplexing in that it manages to feel both fragile and forceful.","designation":"Joy"},{"country":"US","description":"Run, don't walk, to stock up on this by the case. If you have a hankering for a fruity, spicy dry white wine, balanced with crisp acidity and with plenty of finesse, this is it. Tropical fruits, wildflowers, peaches, vanilla, you name it.","designation":""},{"country":"de","description":"A mild disappointment, given the strong showing of so many of Von Schubert's other bottlings, the 2003 Auslese 155 is pleasantly light-bodied and nicely balances sugar and acidity. But unless I missed it, it doesn't show the same compelling complexity and minerality, instead relying on fruity-sweet flavors of ripe apples and pears. Hold 5C10 years, hoping for more detail to emerge with time.","designation":"Abtsberg Riesling Auslese 155"},{"country":"US","description":"Full-bodied and rich, yet delicately structured, this bubbly shows raspberry, vanilla, smoke and bread dough flavors, and is dry. Turns rich in red berry fruit on the finish.","designation":"Blanc de Noir"},{"country":"it","description":"Very ripe Sauvignon for Collio, with only a hint of grassiness gracing a full-bodied, well-fruited wine. Bold notes of pink grapefruit and fig wrap around a sturdy melon core, and is that a hint of warmth on the finish?","designation":"Sauvignon"},{"country":"US","description":"Argyle vintage dates its brut, a mark of extra care and quality. This is still green apple young; at first sip it could almost be hard cider. Tart, bracing and concentrated, it tastes of fresh cut apples, pears and yeast.","designation":"Brut"},{"country":"at","description":"There's a hint of apricot, maybe some tangerine on the nose, but this is a dry Riesling, filled with similar hints to its flavors and culminating in a long, spicy flourish. Shows some intriguing chalky-minerally notes on the finish.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"de","description":"Nice Gew rz, for those consumers looking for something outside of Alsace. Exaggerated floral aromas are typical, so are the lychee and spice flavors. There's a modest sweetness to this wine, so it should work well with spicy Asian foods.","designation":"Sp?tlese"},{"country":"au","description":"Has rich coffee or capuccino notes on the nose, and reined-in mixed-berry fruit flavors that are juicy but blessedly not too sweet. Slim in body, this is the kind of Cab that will show best at the dinner table, with gravied meats and spaghetti alike.","designation":"Offspring"},{"country":"US","description":"A bit sweeter than Iron Horse's drier bruts, and very polished, with subtle raspberry, lime, yeast and smoky-vanilla flavors and good acidity. Easy and delicious to drink, but complex and nuanced in all the right ways.","designation":"Russian Cuvee"},{"country":"at","description":"This medium-weight GV carries plenty of almost fat, ripe peach flavors, but also a hard stony edge that sets it apart. Faint peppery notes chime in on the nose and palate, while the finish is long and minerally.","designation":"Hohenberg"},{"country":"US","description":"A leaner but still classy style for this winery. Tannins are a tad rustic, framing a layered core of black cherry, blackberry, herb, spice and tobacco notes, finishing with moderate length.","designation":"Block 28"},{"country":"US","description":"A winning wine. It's polished enough to enjoy with almost anything that calls for a dry red wine, but Syrah aficionados will appreciate the intricate interplay of cherry, leather, pepper and oak flavors and soft tannins.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Tart, unyielding, and slightly herbal, this young wine needs some air time. The vineyard sources Champoux and Conner-Lee are excellent, but the black cherry fruit seems to be hidden behind a wall of earthy tannins. Tight, with accents of coffee and earth, this could merit a higher score with more bottle age.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"au","description":"Has deep, pleasing aromas of eucalyptus, earth and cream. It's a big wine in the mouth, not blowsy but pretty enthusiastic with oak red cherry and raspberry flavors are trimmed with caramel and oak flavors that widen to a creamy-vanilla close.","designation":"Old Vine"},{"country":"de","description":"Schloss Saarstein has made trocken wines a bit of a specialty, and this 2003 is one of their best efforts. Ripe pear scents cannot overtake an intense graphite or slate minerality on the nose, while on the palate, green apple and pear flavors are enlivened by lime-like acidity. Light and refreshing.","designation":"Riesling QbA Trocken"},{"country":"de","description":"Limes, minerals and green apples dance on the nose of this lithe yet flavorful kabinett. Flavors lean heavily toward green apples and citrus, yet the acids are ripe on the finish, giving an impression of softness and early approachability.","designation":"Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett"},{"country":"es","description":"For a well-made sparkling wine with balance, flavor and a bit of sweetness, look no further. This one features pretty apple, lemon and yeast aromas prior to honey, melon and apple flavors. Finishes smooth and stylish, proving that a cava can be slightly sweet yet rock solid.","designation":"Cordon Negro Extra Dry"},{"country":"US","description":"Brimming with zesty, citrusy acidity, this Chard is bright and a bit earthy. The underlying flavors of limes and apples are sweetened with toasty oak. Finishes spicy and long.","designation":"Sangiacomo Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"The best Magnolia in recent memory. Rich and sophisticated in gooseberry, fig and vanilla flavors, totally dry, and with crisp acidity, this wine is clean and refreshing. Cries out for oysters, or just about anything.","designation":"Magnolia Lane"},{"country":"US","description":"What a treat, with its gobs of juicy fruit, spicy mango and papaya flavors and the excellent spine of acidity that makes it drink crisp and clean. Exotically flamboyant, but manages to be dry and balanced.","designation":"Westside"},{"country":"US","description":"The nose jumps right out with new oak scents of toast and coffee, along with some varietal black pepper. The wine is powerful and oaky, showing plenty of roasted, smoky, burnt toast and coffee ground flavors. The fruit is tangy, spicy and tight; the tannins still hard and rough.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Picked a little earlier than most? Yes, to judge by the healthy dose of herb and tannin that accompanies the berry and cherry fruit. Great bones, though, and great structure, a versatile food Cab.","designation":"Oakville Ranch Vineyard"},{"country":"US","description":"A well-ripened Syrah with lots of plump fruit. Although it's dry, the plummy coffee and chocolate flavors are sweet in fruity essence. Feels plush and soft in the mouth, with a long, berry-and-spice finish.","designation":"Ty Caton Vineyards"},{"country":"au","description":"The nose is this wine's strongest suit. It evolves nicely, first showing eucalyptus and earth, and then mocha, anise and dense, sweet fruit. The wine's feel and flavors are also very good it's feminine in size, focused on plum fruit. Finishes a little flat, but still very good overall.","designation":""},{"country":"es","description":"Monstrously ripe, bordering on syrupy. Seems like it wants to be one part nuevo and one part Port. While soft and lush, it still has some tannic middle ground. Finishes with huge, creamy chocolate notes. Seemingly not a food wine, unless you're talking chocolate.","designation":"El Albar Barricas"},{"country":"US","description":"Lush, ripe and delicious, this is a Cab that everyone will like. It's nicely ripe in sweet blackcurrants, dusted with an edge of herbs and cocoa, and is easy, with fine tannins and a rich overlay of oak.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"After the sulfur blows off, you'll find a clean, crisp wine of great structure and balance. Firmly acidic, with well-ripened flavors of lime, fig and spicy melon. Picks up rich subtleties through the finish.","designation":"Estate Dry"},{"country":"it","description":"Attains a level of intensity not matched by the other Da Vinci wines, with bold aromas of tobacco, earth and cedar matched on the palate by flavors of cherry, plum and dried spices. This 100% Sangiovese possesses a long finish and supple tannins; it should drink well for 4C7 years.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Dry, dense and deeply flavored, this powerful wine might improve with a few years of age. It's tannic now, and laced with cool climate acids, but those black plum, coffee and Provencal herb flavors are  there, waiting to get out.","designation":"Arroyo Loma Vineyard"},{"country":"za","description":"Clean and fresh, with lime-herb aromas and flavors. Taut mineral and sour grass elements here are on a par with solid Loire or nz Sauvignon Blanc. A firm acid backbone sits over lurking ripe tropical fruit notes. This begs for grilled seafood or pork in a lime marinade.","designation":""},{"country":"it","description":"A delightful sparkling wine that is generous with its aromas of toasted almond, nuts and freshly baked sourdough bread. There is the tiniest hint of lavender at the very back. It glides down with buttery charm and a long, frothy finish.","designation":"Brut"},{"country":"za","description":"A dark fruit-oak-spice profile and supple feel offer lots to like in this mid-weight red. Shows solid fruit and surprising underlying structure.","designation":"Pegleg"},{"country":"au","description":"I like this wine's chewy grip on the palate, and its red plum, berry and wheat-flour flavors. Well-made, it's just the ticket for a potluck dinner with friends it would probably stand up equally well to spicy sauces and roasted fowl or meats.","designation":""},{"country":"US","description":"Here's a great food Chard. It's not one of those overblown, oaky wines, but has apple and white peach flavors with overtones of stony minerals and dried herbs. Finishes with a scour of tart acidity.","designation":""},{"country":"au","description":"A conservative, buttoned-up wine: It has a rigid core of black fruit, with graham cracker and oak accents. It has a nice fatness in midpalate, and smooths out into a juicy finish. A very good wine, and one that won't break the bank.","designation":"Sarnia Farm"},{"country":"it","description":"The Antinori daughters have teamed up to make wine in Franciacorta, it's most exciting sparkling wine zone. This 100% Chardonnay offers aromas of citrus, peaches, some raspberry and freshly cut grass. In the mouth it follows up with roasted nuts.","designation":"Montenisa Brut Sat n"},{"country":"it","description":"This extra dry offering is very nice. The bouquet is warm and full of apple, cinnamon and a distant whiff of anise/black licorice. The palate offers sweet stone fruits and some zest. A bit of lemony citrus on the finish is rock solid.","designation":"Cuv e Tenuta Val de Brun Extra Dry"},{"country":"US","description":"Tight and slightly rubbery when first opened, but soon the spicy notes of chocolate, coffee and cinnamon come through over tasty cherry fruit. Styled more like a Merlot than a Syrah, it's a smooth, nicely balanced and really tasty effort.","designation":""},{"country":"at","description":"This blend of Scheurebe and Welchsriesling boasts peppery notes atop sweet, concentrated fruit flavors. Apricot and dried citrus flavors lead the way, finishing with pepper and orange notes.","designation":"Eiswein"},{"country":"it","description":"A blanc de blancs (Chardonnay and Pinot Bianco) that boasts a slightly greenish tint with servings of apple and peach on the nose. The most mature grape clusters are selected to go into this beautifully rich wine.","designation":"Sat n"},{"country":"US","description":"Containing a little Barbera, this wine is tremendous in mocha and blackberry flavors. Wines just don't get much more flavorful than this. It's as rich as a fine Port, except that it's dry, without excessive alcohol or stewed fruit.
