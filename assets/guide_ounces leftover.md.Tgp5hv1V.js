To score the ham, use a serrated knife to make parallel cuts about an inch apart, across and through the skin into the fat. Cut diagonally across these first cuts to make a diamond pattern. In a food processor combine the parsley, sage, garlic, mustard, red pepper, salt, and pepper. Add 1/4 cup of the oil and pulse to a make a coarse paste. Rub the paste all over the ham, pressing it into the cuts. Cover the ham with plastic wrap, put on a pan, and refrigerate overnight. Remove ham from the refrigerator about 1 1/2 hours before cooking so the meat can come to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In a large roasting pan toss the onion wedges with the remaining oil. Place the ham on top of the onions and add 1 cup of the cider. Roast the meat for 30 minutes, reduce the oven temperature 300 degrees F. Cook the ham until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 150 degrees F.

Let the cooked ham rest, loosely covered with foil, at room temperature for 30 minutes before carving. Reserve the onions and pan juices, skimming off any excess fat. Carve the ham and serve with the onion and pan juices. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14317,&quot;Pumpkin Meatballs with Cinnamon-Sage Tomato Sauce 1 1/3 pounds 93 percent lean ground turkey breast 1 cup canned 100 percent pumpkin puree 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 1 egg, slightly beaten Cinnamon-Sage Tomato Sauce, recipe follows Spaghetti Squash Pasta, recipe follows, for serving 3 cups reduced-sodium chicken or vegetable broth One 24-ounce jar of your favorite tomato or marinara sauce One 15-ounce can 100 percent pumpkin puree 2 teaspoons dried basil 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 6 fresh sage leaves, minced Salt and black pepper Crushed red pepper, optional 1 large spaghetti squash Instructions: Using a fork, mix together the turkey, pumpkin puree, sage, sugar, cinnamon, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, ginger, garlic powder and egg in a large bowl.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. Whisk together the flour, salt and baking powder in a medium mixing bowl. Add the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla and almond extracts and beat until light and smooth, 1 minute more. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture. Beat until just combined. Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large open star tip. Pipe the dough onto the prepared baking sheets in 2-inch lines, spaced 1-inch apart (you should be able to fit 12 cookies per tray). Bake in the oven until the cookies are set on top and golden around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool completely on the sheet trays. Once the cookies are set, transfer all onto one tray, leaving 1 cooled tray to bake the remaining dough (you\\u2019ll have enough for about 12 more cookies). Melt the chocolate and coconut oil in a double boiler or in the microwave on 50-percent power in 15 second increments. Pipe or spread the flat sides of half of the cookies with about 1 teaspoon jam each, going almost to the edges. Sandwich with the remaining cookies (you should have about 18 sandwiches). Allow the jam to set for 2 hours or overnight, if you have time. Otherwise, it\\u2019s okay to go ahead and start dipping your sandwich cookies into the chocolate (it just might be a little slippery.). Dip the lower third of the cookies in the chocolate letting the excess drip back into the bowl. Sprinkle with the sprinkles on both sides. Lay back on a parchment lined baking sheet and pop the cookies in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to let the chocolate set. Tip: To make uniformly sized cookies, use a ruler and a marker or pen to draw 2-inch lines on 2 sheets of parchment paper in a 3-by-4-inch grid. Flip the parchment over and place on 2 baking sheets so the marker side is down but you can still see the lines. Using the lines as a template, pipe the dough in 2-inch lines on the baking sheets, using a paring knife or shears, if needed, to cut the dough from the piping bag in straight edges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14330,&quot;Carrot and Almond Couscous 1 cup couscous 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon paprika 2 cups vegetable stock 2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley leaves 4 tablespoons roughly chopped cilantro leaves 1 large carrot, grated 1/2 cup roughly chopped dried apricots 1 1/2 cups slivered almonds 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 lemon, zest grated and juiced 1 orange, zested and juiced Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Place the couscous in a large heatproof bowl and stir in the salt, cumin, ginger and paprika.

For the honey-citrus simple syrup: Whisk together the sugar, honey, water and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to low, add the orange peel and continue to boil without stirring, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat to cool while you assemble the baklava. The syrup will thicken as it cools. For the nut filling: Add the pistachios and walnuts to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment and pulse until coarsely chopped. Transfer the nuts to a large bowl along with the graham cracker crumbs, cinnamon and salt and mix until combined. Set aside. To assemble: Brush a 9-by-13-inch pan with some of the melted butter. Unroll the whole package of phyllo and cut it in half to fit the pan or trim to fit flat. (As you work, cover the unused phyllo sheets with wax paper underneath a damp clean kitchen towel.) Lay 1 sheet of phyllo in the bottom of the pan. Brush with butter, covering the entire surface, then lay another sheet of phyllo on top. Repeat this process until you have 10 layers of phyllo, with butter brushed on top. Add half of the nut mixture, spreading it evenly over the buttered surface, then gently press in with your hands. Begin layering the phyllo and melted butter until you have 10 more layers of phyllo, with butter brushed on top. Add the remaining nut mixture, then layer 10 more sheets of phyllo, brushing with butter in between layers. Brush the top with melted butter, then score the phyllo dough into diamonds, cutting about 1/4-inch deep. (Cut 4 strips lengthwise, then diagonal cuts for a diamond shape). Bake until puffed and golden brown on top, about 1 hour. Ladle the cooled syrup over the top, allowing it to absorb in between pours. Allow the baklava to sit until the syrup is completely absorbed, at least 30 minutes. Separate into bars and serve. The baklava freezes very well. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]</p><p>&quot; 14349,&quot;Crispy Parmesan Butternut Squash Chips 1 medium butternut squash Vegetable oil, for deep-frying 2 sprigs rosemary 2 sprigs sage Kosher salt 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano Instructions: Remove the top cylinder portion of the butternut squash and peel with a vegetable peeler.

The foil-enveloped fish will need some room to puff and expand as it cooks. Better to rearrange the oven racks while the oven is not yet hot. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br> Bake the potato until tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.<br> Spread about a 2-foot sheet of foil on a flat surface with 1/2 of it hanging off the counter in front of you. Put the fish, skin side down, horizontally, onto the foil near the end of the counter leaving about 1 1/2-inches of foil on both sides. Season the flesh side of the fish with salt and pepper, to taste, and sprinkle with some dill, parsley and a few lemon slices. Drizzle about 2 tablespoons oil on top of the fish. Fold the foil back over the fish and fold in the sides of the foil twice. Leaving some air in the package, roll the top of the foil down twice gathering the top to make a window , leaving about 6 to 8 inches between the fish and the top. It should look like a small package, with all the sides sealed. There should be enough room left around the fish to allow for the steam to build up as it cooks, creating an inflated envelope around the fish. Repeat with remaining 3 pieces of fish.<br> Put the garlic cloves in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the garlic is finely chopped. Add the egg yolks and pulse to blend. When the potato is completely cooked and still warm, put it on a flat surface and split it open lengthwise. Use a tablespoon to scoop out the flesh, totaling about 3 to 4 tablespoons, and add it to the processor. Pulse to combine. With the processor running, slowly add the 1/2 cup of olive oil, through the opening at the top, in a steady stream. Add the sugar and the lime juice and pulse to incorporate. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Using 2 baking sheets, put 2 of the foil envelopes on each sheet and add a little water to the bottom of the sheet pan. This water will create additional steam in the oven as the fish cooks. Put the baking sheets on 2 shelves of the oven and bake, undisturbed, until the envelopes begin to puff, about 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately transfer to 4 dinner plates. To serve, break open the foil and drizzle with the aioli. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 14362,&quot;Oven Baked Pepper Bacon 1 1/2 pounds sliced lean bacon 2 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Spread the hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes. Let cool, then chop. Butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan; set aside. Toss the hazelnuts and cookies in a large bowl. Combine the butter, golden syrup and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring, until the butter is melted (do not boil). Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate, cocoa powder and vanilla until smooth, then whisk in the chocolate-hazelnut spread. Pour the chocolate mixture over the cookie mixture and stir to coat. Transfer to the prepared pan and press down evenly until tightly packed. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface and refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours or overnight. Make the ganache: Put the chocolate in a small bowl. Heat the heavy cream and golden syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the syrup dissolves and the mixture is just bubbling around the edges. Pour over the chocolate and let stand 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Let sit at room temperature until thickened but still pourable, 30 minutes to 1 hour. (It should look like a soft pudding.) Remove the cake from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature, 45 minutes. Remove the springform ring and invert the cake onto a cake stand or serving plate; remove the bottom of the pan. Pour about one-third of the cooled ganache over the top of the cake and gently spread with a small offset spatula, allowing the excess to drip down the sides. Repeat with the remaining ganache in two more batches until the top and sides of the cake are covered. Sprinkle mini chocolate chips around the top edge of the cake. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Barolo, Tempranillo, GSM Blend]</p><p>&quot; 14365,&quot;Classic Baguette 1 cup spring water 1/2 teaspoon moist yeast or 1/4 teaspoon dry yeast 1 1/2 cups organic all-purpose white flour 1 cup spring water 1/2 teaspoon moist yeast or 1/4 teaspoon dry yeast 4 1/4 to 5 1/4 cups organic all-purpose white flour Fine sea salt Instructions: Make and ferment the poolish: Combine the water and yeast in a medium bowl. Let stand 1 minute, then stir with a wooden spoon until yeast is dissolved. Add the flour and stir until the consistency of a thick batter. Continue stirring for about 100 strokes or until the strands of gluten come off the spoon when you press the back of the spoon against the bowl. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm, draft-free place until it doubles in volume. Mix and knead the final dough: Measure the remaining ingredients. Measure and transfer 1 cup (9 ounces) of the poolish into a 6-quart bowl. (Discard remaining poolish) Add the water and yeast. Break the poolish up well with a wooden spoon and stir until it loosens and the mixture foams slightly. Add 1 cup of the flour and stir until well combined. Add the salt and only enough of the remaining flour to make a thick mass that is difficult to stir. Turn out onto a well-floured surface. Knead, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is soft and smooth, 15 to 17 minutes total. The dough is ready when a little dough pulled from the mass springs back quickly. Ferment the dough: Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest on a lightly floured surface while you scrape, clean, and lightly oil the large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn once to coat with oil. Take the dough&#39;s temperature: the ideal is 78 degrees. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees) draft-free place until doubled in volume, and a slight indentation remains after pressing a finger into the dough. Divide the dough and rest: Deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling up on the sides. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly. Cut into 4 equal pieces. Flatten each with the heel of your hand and shape into a tight ball. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm draft-free place for 30 minutes. Shape the dough into loaves: Flatten each with the heel of your hand on an unfloured board. Shape each into a 14-inch loaf. Proof the loaves: Place the loaves seam side up in a well-floured couche. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm draft-free place until increased in volume about 1 1/2 times, or until a slight indentation remains when the dough is pressed with a fingertip. Bake the loaves: 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking, preheat the oven and homemade hearth or baking stone on the center rack of the oven to 450 degrees. The oven rack must be in the center of the oven. Gently roll the loaf onto a lightly floured peel, seam side down. Score the loaf with a sharp razor blade or serrated knife making quick shallow cuts. Using the peel, slide the loaves onto the hearth. Quickly repeat with the next 2 loaves. Quickly spray the inner walls and floor of the oven with cold water until steam has filled the oven. Quickly close the door to trap the steam and bake 3 minutes. Spray again, closing the door quickly so that the steam doesn&#39;t escape. Bake until the loaves are a rich caramel color and the crusts are firm, 15 to 20 minutes. To test the loaves for doneness, remove from the pans and hold them upside down. Strike the bottom firmly with your finger. If the sound is hollow, the breads are done. If not, bake 5 minutes longer.

Add salt, garlic, rosemary, olive oil, potato, cheese, and 3 cups flour. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl. Turn dough onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Place dough into an oiled bowl. Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Turn dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half. Shape each half into a ball and place onto a well-greased baking sheet. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. About 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place a shallow pan on the bottom shelf of the oven. Just before baking, brush each loaf liberally with extra olive oil and cut a cross about 1/4-inch deep into the top. Place the bread in the oven and put 5 ice cubes into the pan on the bottom shelf. Close the door quickly to prevent steam from escaping. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the loaves reaches 190 degrees.

Break up the graham crackers; place in a food processor and process to crumbs. If you don&#39;t have a food processor, place the crackers in a large plastic bag; seal and then crush the crackers with a rolling pin. Add the melted butter and sugar and pulse or stir until combined. Press the mixture into the bottom and side of a pie pan, forming a neat border around the edge. Bake the crust until set and golden, 8 minutes. Set aside on a wire rack; leave the oven on. For the filling: Meanwhile, in an electric mixer with the wire whisk attachment, beat the egg yolks and lime zest at high speed until very fluffy, about 5 minutes. Gradually add the condensed milk and continue to beat until thick, 3 or 4 minutes longer. Lower the mixer speed and slowly add the lime juice, mixing just until combined, no longer. Pour the mixture into the crust. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the filling has just set. Cool on a wire rack, then refrigerate. Freeze for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. For the topping: Whip the cream and the confectioners&#39; sugar until nearly stiff.

Make a fountain in the center and add the eggs, olive oil and some salt. Mix with your hands, adding just enough water for the dough to bind. You want to have a ball of dough that is fairly hard and a little dry, so add very little water. Cover with a towel and let set for an hour or so. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the butternut in half lengthwise and lay the squash on a baking sheet. Take 100g of the butter and divide it among each cavity of the squash. Sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake until it starts to brown and the squash are soft to the tip of a knife, about 45 minutes. With a large spoon, scrape the squash off the skin into a bowl and set aside. Dice the onion about 1/8 inch; chop the garlic and thinly cut the sage. In a large saucepan on medium heat, heat up the olive oil. Add the onion and saute until golden brown. Then add the garlic and sage and sweat a little longer. Add the squash, season with salt and pepper and cook on medium heat until it has the consistency of a puree. Move to a food processor and pulse briefly to remove the large chunks. In a bowl, add the ricotta, season with salt and pepper and add to the squash puree. Fill a piping bag with the filling. Roll the dough with your pasta machine. Using a ravioli mold, fill each ravioli with the butternut squash filling. Cook the ravioli in a large saucepot with plenty of boiling salted water. Then saute in the remaining butter.

With the food processor running, slowly add the olive oil; the final product should be smooth but still have a bit of texture to it. For the rice and black beans: Heat the grapeseed oil in a pot over high heat. Add the rice and coriander and cook, stirring, to toast the rice, about 2 minutes. Add the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, until the liquid is absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and fluff with a fork. Mix in the black beans, cilantro, lime juice, salt and pepper. For the smoked tomato salsa: Prepare a smoker with soaked wood chips (cherry or apple wood preferred) and heat to 350 degrees F. Place the tomato halves, onion quarters, garlic and jalapeno in a pan. Transfer to the smoker and cook until the onions are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Dice half of the onions and half of the tomatoes. In a food processor, puree the remaining onions and tomatoes along with the jalapeno, garlic and the lime juice. In a bowl, mix the pureed sauce with the diced onions and tomatoes and the chopped cilantro. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the lemon aioli: In a food processor (or using an immersion blender) combine the lemon juice, mustard, egg, egg yolk and garlic; puree until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil to emulsify the aioli. Season to taste with salt and pepper. For the flank steak: Cut the flank steak into six equal portions, slicing against the grain and on an extreme bias. With the back of a knife, tenderize the steaks by pounding them out on both sides. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until smoking. Add just enough grapeseed oil to coat the pan. Working in batches, sear the steaks on both sides, about 2 minutes. Remove the steaks to a plate to rest before plating. To plate: Divide the rice and beans between six plates, mounding it in the center of each plate. Spoon about 2 ounces of the salsa over the top and then lay a steak over the rice. Drizzle some chimichurri over the steak. In a bowl, dress the watercress with lemon aioli. Top the steaks with the dressed watercress.

Heat the oil in a cast iron Dutch oven and, when hot, add the chicken thighs, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn the chicken thighs over and add the chopped onion, carrot and celery and cook until the thighs are lightly browned on the second side, about 3 minutes. Add the thyme, bay leaf, and chicken broth. Cover the pan and cook on medium heat until the thighs are tender and the meat pulls away from the bone easily, 25 to 30 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, combine the butter and flour in a small heatproof bowl and, using your fingers or a pastry blender, blend until smooth. Set aside. Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken thighs and chopped vegetables from the cooking liquid and transfer to a plate to cool. Ladle 1 cup of the hot cooking liquid into the bowl with the butter-flour mixture and whisk to combine. Add this mixture to the pan along with the onion chunks, sliced carrot and sliced celery and stir to combine. Cover and cook for 10 minutes over medium heat, or until the vegetables are just tender. While the veggies are cooking, make the dumplings by combining the flour, baking powder and salt in a small mixing bowl. Heat the milk and butter until warm and the butter is melted. Add the warm milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just combined. Transfer to a floured work surface and knead lightly once or twice. Using a floured rolling pin, roll to a thickness of 1/8-inch. Using a knife, cut the rolled out dumpling batter into 1 1/2-inch strips. When the chicken has cooled enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and discard the bones, chicken skin and cooked vegetables. Reserve the meat separately. When the veggies are crisp-tender, uncover the pan and add the reserved chicken meat, peas, and parsley to the cooking liquid. Stir to combine, increase the heat to medium-high and, when the mixture comes to a boil, add the dumplings, 1 strip at a time, to the pan, using a spoon to gently submerge the dumplings in the hot mixture. Cook, uncovered and undisturbed, until the dumplings are cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes.

Add the eggs, milk, club soda and 3 tablespoons of melted butter into the center of the well and whisk together until just combined. The mixture should be like VERY loose pancake batter. If the mixture is a little thick, whisk in a little more milk. Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes before using.<br> Crepes:<br> Melt about a 1/2 teaspoon of butter in a small nonstick saute pan.

Fill a 2-ounce ladle, almost to the top, with batter and pour it into the preheated pan, tipping and rolling the pan, as you ladle the batter, to evenly cover the bottom.

Accept it and move on.<br> When the edges of the crepe begin to pull away from the edges of the pan and the bottom begins to brown a little, turn the crepe over and cook it for about 1 minute on the other side. Remove the crepe from the pan to a plate and let cool. Stack the crepes as they are cooked between parchment paper squares. Repeat this process, until all the batter is used, wiping the pan with your paper towel or melting a little more butter to the pan, as needed.<br> YAY!<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14410,&quot;Don&#39;t Throw that Out: Fruitcake Pops Leftover fruitcake, cut into cubes 2 3/4 cup white chocolate chips 1/4 cup coconut<br> Instructions: Step 1: Take 2 cups cubed leftover fruit cake and grind to fine crumbs in a food processor.

Combine the salt, coriander, dill, garlic powder, juniper berries and pepper in a small bowl and mix evenly. Rub this mixture on the flesh side of the duck breasts, making sure all of the mixture adheres to the duck. Wrap each breast in plastic wrap (or use a vacuum sealing machine), leaving as little air as possible. Keep refrigerated for 5 days (10 days if you are using a vacuum sealer). Preheat a smoker to 200 degrees F. Unwrap the duck and sear fat-side down in a hot pan at medium-high heat until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip on the meat side and cook 1 more minute. Transfer the duck to the smoker and cook until the internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F, 1 hour 30 minutes. Set aside or keep in the refrigerator. For the cabbage slaw: Cut the bacon into 1/4-inch pieces and slice the onion thin. Sweat (slowly cook without coloring) the onion, bacon and 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet on medium-low heat, about about 8 minutes. Add the wine and stock and turn the heat up to medium; let reduce by half, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the chopped cabbage and the remaining tablespoon butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage has started to soften, about 12 minutes. Season to taste (sometimes you won&#39;t need to add salt, as the bacon might already be salty enough). To serve: Put mayonnaise on both sides of the buns. Take a big spoonful of bacon and cabbage slaw and place it a the bottom half. Thinly slice the duck on its longer side (which is against the grain for a softer result) and heat up in a skillet, then add it on top of the cabbage slaw. Close the sandwich and enjoy!

Heat 1/8 cup of the canola oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Dredge the steaks in flour, and shake to remove excess. Sear the steaks on both sides, remove from pan, and set aside on a utility platter. Add the other 1/8 cup of canola oil to the same pan and saute the onions and mushrooms until the onions become translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken or beef broth, porter beer, molasses, thyme, hot sauce and bay leaves to the onion/mushroom mixture. Reduce the heat to low and return the steaks to the pan. Simmer covered for at least 2 hours. Rump steaks are a tough meat and will require slow cooking (braising). You may wish transfer the ingredients to a crock-pot for this process. When the steaks are fork tender, remove them to a platter in a warm place. The liquid in the pan should have evaporated to a large degree, intensifying the flavor. If necessary, increase the heat to reduce and thicken into a sauce. Whisk in the butter and creme fraiche or sour cream to finish the sauce, and spoon sauce over the steaks. Garnish with the fresh chopped chives. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Tempranillo]&quot; 14455,&quot;Three Potato Gratin 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 2 heads garlic, halved 1 quart cream 1 pound peeled white potatoes, 1/4-inch slices 1 pound peeled sweet potatoes, 1/4-inch slices 1 pound red potatoes, 1/4-inch slices 2 cups grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus 2 tablespoons for garnish Salt and white pepper Essence, recipe follows 2 tablespoons chopped chives Essence (Emeril&#39;s Creole Seasoning): 2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

Simmer the cream for 15 minutes, or until the cream has reduced by 1/4 and has slightly thickened. Season the potatoes with salt and white pepper. Alternate layering the white potatoes, sweet potatoes, red potatoes, and cheese in the prepared dish. You should have a total of six layers. Remove the garlic from the cream and pour over the potatoes. Cover the souffle dish with aluminum foil. Place in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the foil and continue cooking for 10 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Cool the gratin for 10 minutes before serving. Place a piece of the gratin on a plate and garnish with Essence, cheese, and chives. Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or container.

Dust a work surface with flour and roll the puff pastry into a 12-inch square. Spoon small dollops of the almond filling all over the surface of the pastry and then use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread it out into an even layer. Cut the pastry into three 4-inch wide pieces. Sprinkle each with chocolate. Starting at the long side of one of the pastry pieces, roll it up into a long cylindrical log. Holding one end of the log in each hand, gently snap the dough towards the counter, slapping it down if necessary, so that it stretches to about 15 inches. Repeat with the remaining 2 strips of dough and refrigerate until the dough is firm, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust 2 oven racks to the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Cut each log, lengthwise, right down the middle so that you have 6 long strips. Arrange them cut-side up on the counter. Now cut each strip in half, crosswise, giving you 12 pieces about 7 1/2 inches long. Gently pull on one piece, just to lengthen it slightly, and then tie into a tight knot with the cut-sides up and long tails on each side. Repeat with the remaining strips of dough and arrange on the 2 prepared baking sheets. Chill for 15 minutes. Beat the remaining egg to make an egg wash. Brush each knot with some of the egg wash and then sprinkle generously first with some of the chopped almonds and then with sugar. Bake, rotating the baking sheets about halfway through, until the knots have puffed and are golden brown on top and deeply golden brown on the bottom, 22 to 25 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets, then remove to a rack to cool completely. Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 2 days. &quot;,&quot;[Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]&quot; 14463,&quot;Blueberry, Thyme and Sweet Cream Ice Pops 2 1/2 cups frozen Maine blueberries 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk 2 tablespoons sugar 4 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped (about 2 tablespoons chopped) Kosher salt 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Instructions: Take the berries out of the freezer to thaw. Bring the milk, 1/4 cup water, sugar, thyme and a pinch of salt to a simmer in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Let cool completely at room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Put 2 cups of the blueberries and the lemon juice in a blender. Strain the cooled milk mixture into the blender, pressing on it with a wooden spoon to extract as much flavor from the thyme as possible; discard the thyme. Puree the blueberry mixture until completely smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender partway through if needed. Transfer the mixture to a large liquid measuring cup with a pouring spout. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup blueberries. Pour the mixture into the ice-pop molds, leaving at least 1/4 inch of space at the top (the mixture will expand). Insert the sticks. Freeze until solid, 5 hours to overnight. Unmold, and enjoy immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Sauvignon Blanc]&quot; 14464,&quot;Oatmeal Raisin Skillet Cookie with Honey Cream 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup all-purpose flour (see Cook&#39;s Note) 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon apple pie spice 1/2 teaspoon fine salt 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 cup packed light brown sugar 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 3/4 cups rolled oats 3/4 cup raisins 2/3 cup heavy cream 1/3 cup sour cream 1 tablespoon honey Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Grease the bottom and sides of a 10-inch cast iron skillet with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt and apple pie spice together in a large bowl. Beat the remaining butter and granulated sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until just incorporated. Increase speed to high and mix until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the brown sugar and beat until incorporated, then add the eggs one at a time, beating in between additions, then mix in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture, mixing until a smooth dough forms, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Stir in the oats and raisins.<br> Use a rubber spatula to scrape the batter into the prepared skillet, gently spreading it to the edges and smoothing the top. Bake until the top is golden, the sides are beginning to brown and the center is still soft, about 40 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, beat the heavy cream in a medium mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Add the sour cream and honey and continue beating to form medium peaks. Keep the whipped cream refrigerated until ready to use.

In a bowl combine beef, garlic, hot sauce, salt and pepper, to taste, being careful not to over mix. Warm a skillet over medium heat and fry bacon until crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Keep heat on skillet and fry a pinch of the beef in the bacon fat to test seasoning. Adjust seasoning, if needed, then form 8 even thin patties, about 1/2-inch thick and set aside. Saute onions in bacon fat in skillet until tender, 5 minutes. Place onions and bacon in a bowl with cheese. Form a spoonful of bacon-cheese mixture into a ball, then place in the center of 4 patties. Top each with another patty and seal the edges. Grill burgers over medium-high heat, flipping once until desired doneness is reached, approximately 4 minutes each side for medium. Serve in buns with garnishes. Alternative: In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, sear the burgers 4 minutes on each side. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Syrah, Zinfandel]&quot; 14467,&quot;Beef Tenderloin with Costa Rican Coffee Balsamic Fig Glaze 4 cups dark Modena balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 cup brewed strong Costa Rican dark roast coffee 1/4 cup fresh figs 2 1/2 to 3 pounds beef tenderloin, Chateaubriand cut Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: In heavy-bottomed sauce pot, over low heat, add the vinegar and reduce it by half, stirring constantly. Add the sugar, coffee and figs and further reduce by 1/3 volume, continue to stir throughout this step. Remove from the heat when you have 3/4 cup liquid remaining. Pour the glaze through a strainer into a small bowl, discarding the solids. Preheat the grill to 300 degrees F. Season the beef tenderloin with salt and pepper, to taste, and put on the preheated grill. Cook on each side until desired temperature is reached, about 7 to 8 minutes for medium-rare. Remove from the grill and evenly brush the tenderloin with the balsamic glaze. Return the beef to the grill for 5 minutes, allowing the glaze to coat the meat. Remove the tenderloin from the grill to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice, arrange on a serving platter and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 14468,&quot;Grilled Mushroom Skewers 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce<br> 36 cremini mushrooms with 2-inch caps, tough stem ends trimmed (about 1 1/2 pounds)<br> 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped<br> Kosher salt Instructions: Preheat a charcoal or gas grill to medium high. Swirl the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until melted. Add the garlic and soften about 2 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce. Put the mushrooms in a medium bowl, add the soy-garlic butter and toss until well coated. Thread the mushrooms on the skewers, putting 7 to 8 on each and leaving 3-inch handles at the ends. Put the skewers on the grill with the handles resting on or just off the edge of the grill (for easier handling, since they will get very hot) and cover. Cook, turning the skewers every 2 minutes or so and brushing with the butter after every turn, until the mushrooms are slightly charred all over and softened, 8 to 9 minutes. Sprinkle with the thyme and parsley or lemon zest if using and season with salt. Alternatively, melt a little extra butter and add the thyme, parsley and/or lemon zest if using and drizzle over the mushrooms. The sixth ingredient: Chopped fresh parsley or grated lemon zest, sprinkled over with the thyme; or you could melt a little extra butter at the end, add the thyme, parsley and or lemon zest and drizzle over. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14469,&quot;Gingerbread Cookies 1 1/2 sticks lightly salted butter, softened 1 2/3 cups sugar 1 orange, zested 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus 1/2 cup additional for rolling, if needed 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 tablespoon ground dry ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 2 eggs 1/2 cup dark molasses 1 lemon, juiced Easy Orange Frosting, recipe follows 1 cup powdered sugar Finely grated zest of 1 orange 1 to 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice 1/2 teaspoon orange liqueur 1/4 teaspoon light corn syrup Instructions: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, add the butter, sugar and orange zest and beat until smooth, 5 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, dry ginger, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, cloves and salt. Whisk to blend. Set aside. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, molasses and lemon juice. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When the butter and sugar are integrated, lower the speed of the mixer and add the dry ingredients. Add the egg mixture and when blended, remove the bowl from the machine. Divide the cookie dough in half. Press the first half of the dough in between 2 sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap and chill for 15 minutes. Repeat with the second half. This step will make it easier to finish rolling out the dough when it has chilled. It will also mean you only have half of the dough getting warm as you roll it. Lightly flour a flat surface. Use a floured rolling pin to gently roll the first half of the dough about 1/2-inch thick. Lightly flour the cookie cutter(s) and cut the shapes, making as few scraps as possible. Use a metal spatula to gently transfer them, cookie by cookie, (the cookies should be similar size) to a baking sheet. Repeat with the other half of the dough and transfer them to another baking sheet. A note about crowding the tray(s): these particular cookies can spread a little. Leave room between the cookies. Better to use 3 baking sheets with fewer cookies than to crowd them on 2 trays. Bake until brown around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.<br> Got scraps? Form the scraps into a ball, press it flat and chill in the refrigerator. These cookies may be a little more \\tough\\ because the dough will have been worked a little more than the others. Why not have a little frosting on your gingerbread? In a medium bowl add all of the ingredients and whisk together to combine. If too thick in consistency, add a touch more orange juice or water to thin out. Use a pastry bag fitted with a star tip to pipe the frosting between 2 of the gingerbread cookies. Press the 2 cookies halves gently together. Variation: I love springerle, the German anise-flavored cookies, for the delicate molds (and carved rolling pins) used to make them. I have made this recipe with springerle molds with stunning results. The kind of cookies that make people marvel at how great they look before they eat a half a plate of them! Simply dust the decorative molds (or rolling pin) with flour, shaking lightly to remove any excess. Roll the dough very thin (between 1/2 and 1/4-inch thick). Press or roll the dough into the molds and trace the shapes with a sharp knife to extract the cookies. Arrange them on a greased baking sheet (with some space between them) and bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Not using molds? Scoop the batter in teaspoons and roll them into balls. Press the balls onto a greased baking sheet or press with the tines of a fork to make ridges. Bake until brown around the edges, about 10 to 12 minutes. These cookies are so beautiful, they can stand alone.

Slowly add the flour, mixing with a hand blender, until the mixture is the consistency of a light runny batter. (Add a little more flour if needed.) Heat the oil in a large, heavy frying pan until hot. Dip each slice of eggplant into the batter and then put directly into the hot oil. Fry until light brown on each side, about 30 seconds. Remove to a colander to drain any excess oil. Beat the remaining 8 eggs in a medium bowl. In a disposable aluminum pan or a cake pan, begin a lasagna-like assembly process. Add a very thin layer of tomato sauce to the bottom of the pan. Add one layer of eggplant, a little Parmesan and a drizzle of the beaten egg. Begin again with the tomato sauce, and repeat for as thick as you want, with no less than three layers. (Reserve a little of the tomato sauce and beaten egg for the baking.) It&#39;s best to refrigerate overnight before baking. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add a thin layer of tomato sauce on top of the eggplant, followed by some beaten egg. Cover with plastic wrap and foil, and bake for 1 hour. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Tempranillo]&quot; 14472,&quot;Cod in a Sack with Fennel and Onion 1 bulb fennel, cored and thinly sliced 1 large onion, thinly sliced 4 large cloves garlic, chopped 1/2 cup pitted and chopped good quality black and green olives 2 pounds cod fillets, cut into 4 portions (get thick pieces from the center cuts rather than tail-end pieces) Salt and pepper 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, a generous handful, chopped Extra-virgin olive oil, for generous drizzling 1 lemon Crusty bread, to pass at table Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rip off 4 sheets of parchment paper, each a little over a foot long. Make layered stacks dividing the fennel, onions, garlic, olives, and cod among the parchment pieces, working in the center of each piece of paper. Season the cod with salt and pepper and top with parsley. Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil liberally over the fish portions. Fold the top and bottom edges together and crease several times then crease up the ends of the packets. Arrange the packets on the baking sheet and place in the center of the hot oven. Bake packets 20 minutes. Serve a packet per dinner plate and cut open at table. Cut lemon into wedges and serve to squeeze down over the hot fish.

Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Whisk the flour, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, egg yolk and vanilla until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the sour cream in two batches. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat until well combined, about 30 seconds. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan; set aside. Make the topping: Combine the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in a medium bowl. Work in the butter with your fingers until clumpy. Scatter the topping over the cake batter. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool 20 minutes, then remove the springform ring and let cool completely. Make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners&#39; sugar with 3 tablespoons eggnog in a medium bowl until smooth. If the glaze is too thick, gradually whisk in the remaining 1 tablespoon eggnog as needed.

Mayonnaise, as needed 1 English cucumber, sliced thinly on the bias 1 bunch fresh cilantro 1 bunch fresh mint 4 Fresno chiles, or jalapeno peppers, sliced thinly 2 limes, each cut into 4 wedges 1/4 cup green cardamom pods, shelled, husks discarded (about 2 tablespoons of seeds) 3 tablespoons whole cloves 4 large black cardamom pods, shelled, husks discarded (about 1 tablespoon of seeds), optional 3 large cinnamon sticks (if you have the kind you get at Indian stores, it&#39;s about 3 tablespoons of cinnamon bark bits) Instructions: For the pickled carrots: In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, vinegar, and salt until dissolved. Add the carrots, toss to coat and allow to pickle for about 2 hours. For the pork: Combine the soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, five-spice powder, garam masala, black pepper, garlic and shallots in a re-sealable plastic bag. Seal and shake until well dissolved. Add the pork to the bag, massage the marinade into the pork and marinate for 1 hour. When you&#39;re ready to cook the pork, grab a large cast-iron skillet. Place the pan over high heat until it is smoking. Using a pair of tongs, pull each pork chop out of the marinade, shake off the excess and place it in the pan. Don&#39;t crowd the pan - no meat should be touching! You want the meat to sear, not steam. After about 2 minutes, flip each chop; it should be a caramel brown color. Cook another minute on the other side and remove from the pan. If you&#39;re cooking in batches, cook the remaining chops. Slice the chops into thin strips. For the sandwiches: Warm the tortillas up over an open flame so they become soft and pliable. I also like to char them a little! If you don&#39;t have a gas stove, warm them in a pan over medium heat, or pop them in a microwave for 10 to 15 seconds. Smear a little mayo down the middle of the tortilla. Then, pile a little layer of pickled carrots, some cucumber slices, a few sprigs of cilantro, some mint leaves, pork chop strips, a few slices of chiles a and squeeze of fresh lime juice over the top. Wrap, and secure with toothpick. Wrap in parchment paper if you&#39;re taking them to the beach, or just eat right away if you&#39;re not!; Add the green cardamom seeds, cloves, black cardamom seeds and cinnamon sticks to a spice/coffee grinder and grind until fine.

Slowly add the melted butter and whisk until combined. Sift in the flour and salt and stir until combined. Slowly add in the milk. The batter should be runny. Strain the batter and let it rest, refrigerated, for at least 1 hour. When you are ready to cook, put a little melted butter into a nonstick pan and put it over medium heat. Ladle the crepe batter into the pan tilting the pan while adding the batter to completely and evenly coat the bottom of the pan. This will take a little practice; usually the first crepe gets scrapped. Once the edge of the crepe begins to pull away from the pan, after about 1 to 2 minutes, use a spatula to get under the crepe and use your fingers to turn it over. The crepe should be golden brown. Cook for 1 minute on the other side, remove it from the pan, and put it onto a plate. Repeat making and stacking crepes, adding more butter to the pan as needed, until all the batter has been used. Make the bechamel: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Stir in the flour and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to cook out the raw flour flavor, but do not let it brown. Pour in the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Season with salt, lower the heat to medium, and cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cheese. Keep warm. For the filling: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the asparagus and blanch for about 1 minute, just enough time to set the color but not to overcook it. Immediately plunge the asparagus into a bowl of salted ice water to stop the cooking. When the asparagus is cool, drain and cut it into 1-inch pieces, keeping the tips aside. Heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and shallots and cook until the shallots are soft, about 5 minutes. Pour in the wine and let it reduce by half. Add the chicken, tomatoes and chopped basil and cook until they are warmed through, about 3 minutes. Add the asparagus and 1 cup of the reserved bechamel. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Lay a crepe on your work surface. Spoon a couple of tablespoons of the chicken mixture down the center of the crepe. Roll up the crepe like a cigar. Repeat with remaining crepes and filling. (Alternately, spoon the filling mixture over 1 half of the crepe, fold the crepe in half, then in half again to form a triangle). To serve, put 2 crepes onto each serving plate. Spoon some of the bechamel sauce over the crepes and garnish with the reserved asparagus tips and some basil leaves. Serve immediately. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 14490,&quot;Grilled Corn on the Cob with Cilantro Pesto 4 ears corn on the cob, husks removed 1/2 cup Cilantro Pesto, recipe follows 1/4 cup grated Cotija cheese (feta or Parmesan may be substituted) 1 bunch cilantro, leaves washed and drained 3/4 cup canola oil 1/4 cup Roasted Green Pumpkin seeds, recipe follows 1/2 cup grated Cotija cheese (can substitute feta or Parmesan) 2 cloves garlic, chopped, optional 1/2 cup green pumpkin seeds 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 teaspoons chili powder Salt Instructions: Heat the grill to medium-high. Once hot, lay the corn across the grill. Rotate corn every 3 minutes until all sides are evenly golden and slightly charred, about 15 minutes. Put the corn on a platter. While corn is still hot brush the corn with cilantro pesto and then sprinkle with the Cotija cheese. Serve. In a food processor add the cilantro, canola oil, pumpkin seeds, Cotija cheese, and garlic. Puree until smooth but not liquid. Taste for seasoning. Cooks Note: Usually you do not need salt because of the salt in the roasted pumpkin seeds and the cheese. Set aside. Yield: 3/4 cup Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Add the pumpkin seeds, canola oil, chili powder and salt, to taste, in a small bowl. Mix well to combine.

After you have rolled the pasta out into sheets, cut the sheet into an even amount of squares. Using a teaspoon fill the center of half with the filling. Brush around the filling with the egg wash and place the remaining squares on top. Press down around the seal to push out any air bubbles. In half a gallon of rapidly boiling salted water add the ravioli in batches. Remove to a strainer. In a separate pan over medium heat place the butter until it just starts to brown. Toss in 10 ravioli until coated. Sprinkle in the sage and toss again to evenly distribute. In a food processor bowl, combine croutons, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and thyme. Pulse until the mixture is of a fine texture. Place this mixture into a large bowl. Combine the onion, carrot, garlic, and red pepper in the food processor bowl. Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped, but not pureed. Combine the vegetable mixture, ground sirloin, and ground chuck with the bread crumb mixture. Season the meat mixture with the kosher salt. Add the egg and combine thoroughly, but avoid squeezing the meat. By Hand:<br> On a clean surface make a well with the flour. In a measuring cup mix the eggs, water and oil and salt. Pour the wet mixture slowly into the flour and mix with your 2 fingers until all of the wet is incorporated. Do not force the dough to take all of the flour. If you are going to use a pasta machine to roll out the dough you may at this point form the dough into a disk and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to rest. If you going to roll this by hand you should knead the dough on a floured work surface for 8 to 10 minutes. By Food Processor: In the bowl of your food processor combine the flour and salt and pulse 2 to 3 times. In a liquid measuring cup whisk the eggs, water and oil. While pulsing the machine pour this mixture in a continuous stream and continue running the machine until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Follow directions above for hand rolling or machine. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Barbera]&quot; 14492,&quot;Crispy Garbanzo Beans Two 15-ounce cans garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed 4 strips bacon<br> Salt<br> 1 sprig fresh rosemary<br> Instructions: Spread out the garbanzos on a baking sheet and let them dry, uncovered, in the refrigerator overnight. (If you forget to let them dry overnight, it&#39;s okay; you&#39;ll just need to cook them longer.) Place the bacon in a large skillet over medium-low heat and cook until browned and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Drain on a paper-towel-lined plate; reserve the fat in the pan. Eat the bacon as snack while you cook. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Add the dried garbanzos to the pan with the rendered bacon fat. Season with a generous pinch of salt and add the rosemary. Cook over medium-low heat for about 2 minutes, then remove the rosemary sprig. Transfer the garbanzos to a baking sheet and bake until crispy, 35 to 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.

When the water boils, add the tea and remove the pan from the heat. The tea will float to the top until you stir gently to coax it into the water. When all of the tea leaves are wet, let it steep for 3 minutes. Pour the contents of the saucepan into the pitcher, and don&#39;t worry if the dregs are left behind. Pour the tea back and forth between the pitcher and the saucepan 7 times as it becomes darker and stronger, ending up with the tea in the saucepan. Rinse out the pitcher and strain the tea through a coffee filter back into the pitcher. Add the syrup and stir to dissolve. Cool to room temperature, cover and chill until serving time. To serve, fill tall glasses with crushed iced. Add 3/4 cup of the chilled Thai tea per glass. Top off each glass with 3 to 4 tablespoons evaporated milk. Serve as the milk cascades over the ice and swirls into the tea. Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain an active simmer and cook until liquid has thickened and colored slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Pour the cooled syrup into a jar with a tight-fitting lid, cover, and store at room temperature for 1 week, or in the refrigerator for several weeks. &quot;,&quot;[Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gewrztraminer, Riesling]&quot; 14540,&quot;Sherry Tea Cakes and Glaze 3/4 cup vegetable oil 4 eggs 3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg Sherry Glaze, recipe follows 24 Sugared Pink Rose Petals, recipe follows 1 (18.25-ounce) box yellow cake mix 1 (3.4-ounce) box vanilla instant pudding and pie filling 3/4 cup cream sherry<br> 4 cups confectioners&#39; sugar 1/2 cup cream sherry 24 fresh rose petals 2 egg whites 1/2 cup granulated sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Whisk the juices together in another bowl. Let cool slightly, then whisk half the syrup into the juices and taste. Slowly add more syrup, tasting frequently. The mixture should taste definitely tart and sweet; you might not use all the syrup. Freeze in an ice cream machine, then transfer to the frozen bowl and keep frozen. Ice Cream: Combine the milk with 1/3 cup of the sugar in a saucepan and heat just to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat. Whisk the egg yolks with the remaining 1/3 cup sugar until well combined. Whisk a few tablespoons of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, then pour back into the saucepan with the remaining milk mixture. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees F it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. Test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat. Strain the mixture into a bowl and place it in the ice bath to cool. Let cool, stirring often. When cold, whisk in the sour cream and freeze in an ice cream machine. When frozen, use a small ice cream scoop to make walnut-sized balls and freeze solid again. To assemble, let the sorbet soften slightly. With a larger ice cream scoop, dig out flat globs of sorbet and pack it around the ice cream balls, covering completely. Freeze for 30 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]&quot; 14556,&quot;Honey-Rosemary Wings with Greek Yogurt and Lemon Garlic Dipping Sauce Canola oil, for frying 1 dozen chicken wings split at the joint, wing tips removed and discarded 1/2 cup Greek yogurt 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives 1 clove garlic, smashed and minced Juice of 1/2 lemon Pinch celery salt 2 to 3 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons cl-infused honey, such as Mike&#39;s Hot Honey 2 cloves garlic, smashed and minced 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves finely chopped 1 lemon, zested and juiced Crushed red pepper Instructions: For the wings: Heat 3 to 4 inches of oil in a large, high-sided pan until it reaches 375 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer.

Do not move the chops for 2 to 3 minutes to allow lovely grill marks to form. Rotate the chops 90 degrees to create cross-hatch grill marks, and grill for another 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the chops and repeat the process. Remove the chops from the grill to a platter and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. For the salad: Toss the arugula with the lemon juice, big fat finishing oil, and salt. Adjust the seasoning, if necessary, and sprinkle with the crumbled feta. Divide the salad among 4 serving plates and top with a lamb chop. This will slightly wilt the salad. Drizzle with big fat finishing oil and top with a dollop of tzatziki. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Grenache, Tempranillo, Barbera]&quot; 14559,&quot;Apple Toddy 1/2 orange, halved 4 cloves 3 cups apple cider 2 cinnamon sticks Brandy, to taste 1 cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks Instructions: Stud the orange halves with cloves.

Add the sugar and a pinch of salt and whisk until smooth. Add the cream and vanilla and whisk just until medium-soft peaks form. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Line a 1 1/2-quart loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving at least a 2-inch overhang on all sides. On the bottom of the loaf pan, lay 6 cookies face-down, overlapping slightly. Spread 3/4 cup of the whipped cream evenly over the cookies. Top with 3 heaping tablespoons of the chocolate. Repeat the layering two more times with 6 to 7 cookies. Place the last 6 to 7 cookies on the shaved chocolate. Fold the plastic wrap over the top of the loaf pan so the entire top layer is covered. Refrigerate overnight. To serve, turn back the plastic wrap, flip the icebox cake out onto a platter and remove the plastic. Top with the reserved chocolate and serve immediately. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and 1/8 teaspoon salt into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer) on medium speed just until combined. Beat in the egg yolk just until combined. Beat in the food coloring and vanilla until the color is evenly distributed, scraping down the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture. Beat just until the dough comes together. Form the dough into two 1-inch-thick disks, wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour. Unwrap one disk, place it on the paper and cover with a large sheet of plastic wrap. Roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thick. Peel off the plastic wrap and, using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut the dough into rounds. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart (about 12 cookies per sheet). Gather the scraps, chill until firm, roll again and cut. Repeat with the remaining disk. Bake the cookies until brick-red and set, 8 to 10 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Let the cookies cool on the sheets for 3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14568,&quot;Black Bean Stoup and Southwestern Monte Cristo Sandwiches 2 tablespoons extra- virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan 1 large onion, chopped 3 ribs celery with greens, chopped 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped 1 fresh bay leaf or 1 large dried bay leaf 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 3 (15-ounce) cans black beans 2 tablespoons ground cumin, a couple of palm fulls 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander, 1/3 palm full Salt and pepper 2 to 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons hot sauce, divided 1 quart chicken or vegetable stock 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes, diced tomatoes with peppers and onions, or stewed tomatoes 8 slices white sandwich bread 1/2 cup hot pepper jelly or chili sauce, tomatillo or tomato salsa, taco sauce - whichever you have on hand 1/2 lime, juiced 8 slices baked honey ham, from the deli counter 8 slices pepper jack cheese, from the deli counter 8 slices smoked turkey, from the deli counter 2 eggs, beaten Splash of milk 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 cup sour cream 2 to 3 scallions, chopped Instructions: Heat a medium soup pot over medium high heat.

Set aside. Put a pasta sheet on work surface with long side facing you and put a packed teaspoon of filling 2 inches apart lengthwise along half of the pasta sheet (you should have 10 to 12 mounds). Around each mound of filling brush dough very lightly with water. Fold dough lengthwise in half over mounds of filling, gently pressing around mounds to force out any air, and seal edges well. With a fluted pastry wheel trim edges and cut between mounds of filling to separate ravioli. Line a large tray with a dry kitchen towel and arrange ravioli in 1 layer. Make more ravioli with remaining 2 pieces of dough and remaining filling in same manner, transferring to kitchen-towel-lined tray and arranging in 1 layer. Ravioli may be made 8 hours ahead and chilled on towel-lined tray, covered loosely with plastic wrap. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the walnuts and cook, stirring, until brown and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove nuts from the pan. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, shallots and garlic, and saute for 1 minute. Add the wine and cream, and bring to a boil. Cook over medium-high until the liquid has thickened and reduced by nearly 50 percent in volume, about 4 minutes. Stir in the basil, salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli until they are tender and rise to the surface, carefully stirring to keep them from sticking together, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain in a colander. Transfer the cooked ravioli to the pan with the sauce, and gently toss to coat and heat through. Divide the ravioli among 6 serving plates or shallow bowls, and sprinkle each serving with grated cheese.

Put all the ingredients in a large pot and attach a candy thermometer to the side. You need to be sure the thermometer goes deep into the mixture. Turn the heat to medium high. Fill a bowl that&#39;s larger than the pot halfway with ice water and set it aside. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon. When everything has melted together, start checking the temperature. When the thermometer reaches exactly 236 degrees F, remove the pot from the heat and stick it in the bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. Stir for 45 seconds while the pot is in the ice bath to evenly cool the entire mixture. With a large spoon, start dropping puddles of the mixture onto the parchment. Make sure you&#39;re getting some pecans in every spoonful. If you feel like it, sprinkle just a bit of salt on top. Let them cool all the way. If you&#39;re in a humid environment, they might stay sticky, but put them in front of a fan and they should get dry.

Allow marinade to sit for at least 1 hour before use or 24 hours for more flavor. Place chicken in a sealable container and pour the marinade over, turning to coat the meat with the sauce. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. On the SolaReflex 900, use a low black 3 quart pan with a clear glass lid that has a removable knob. You can also use a toaster oven size grill with drip pan inside our optional Clear box oven. Always wear sunglasses when solar cooking. Consider the focal point hot spot the same as an open flame, so use the same common sense and caution. When in direct alignment with the sun, it will reach over 900 degrees F, but normal cooking temperature with the diffused hot spot directed on your pan will heat in the 350 to 500 degree F range, depending on sun angle and sky conditions. Center the cooking container on the support stand, then standing behind your cooking reflector, turn the SolaReflex 900 towards the sun and direct the reflected bright hot spot down to the support stand and center it on right 2/3 of the meat. The hot spot will track right to left as sun moves, so realign the 900 to the same starting position in 25 to 30 minutes, or when the hot spot falls on the left 2/3&#39;s of your meat. Reduce heating levels by moving the pot closer to the reflector, which makes a larger hot spot. The smaller the hot spot, the higher the heat level. Push a probe thermometer through the hole left by the vacant knob, into the bottom of the thickest part of the meat. Normal cooking time on sunny days will be about 45 to 60 minutes, depending how done you prefer. Bright sunny days provide the fastest cooking between 9 am and 2 pm. Partial clouds will slow cooking times and lower temps, so confirm doneness with the thermometer. If the meat starts browning too much on top, open the lid and turn the meat only once to brown the other side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 14592,&quot;Exotic Mushrooms and Tarragon Cream Reserved chicken cooking liquid 3 carrots sliced, about 3/4 cup 2 stalks celery, diced, about 1/2 cup 1 tablespoon sweet butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots 1 pound mixed exotic mushrooms, sliced and broken by hand 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper Reserved chicken meat 1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon leaves Instructions: Place the chicken broth in a 4 quart casserole and bring to the boil.

In a medium saucepan, heat remaining milk with the lemon peel, vanilla bean and seeds, and cinnamon stick, stirring. Just before milk comes to a boil, turn off the heat, cover pan and set aside. In a large, heavy saucepan whisk together the eggs, sugar and reserved cornstarch mixture. Remove lemon peel from the milk, and slowly add the milk (and cinnamon stick) to the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Place pan over low heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick and discard. Strain the custard into a large measuring cup or bowl with a pouring spout, then pour the strained custard into 6 ovenproof ramekins. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Just before serving, heat a flat metal spatula over a hot gas flame. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of sugar over each custard, and then touch the surface of the sugar with the hot spatula just long enough to caramelize it. (Alternative methods for caramelizing are to place ramekins under a broiler, or use a small blow-torch). &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14603,&quot;Coconut Chutney 1 cup grated unsweetened coconut 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 1 teaspoon minced ginger 1 teaspoon minced green cl, serrano, Thai or jalapeno 1/4 plain low fat yogurt 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup water, as needed 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds 2 dried red peppers 8 curry leaves or 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Instructions: In a food processor or blender grind coconut, onion, ginger, green cl, yogurt, lemon juice, and salt with as little water as needed for a moderately thick (not watery) consistency. Set aside. In a covered medium frying pan, heat the mustard seeds, dried red peppers, and curry leaves in oil over medium high heat until the seeds begin to pop.

Let stand 1 minute, then stir with a wooden spoon until yeast is dissolved. Add flours and stir until the consistency of a thick batter. Continue stirring for about 100 strokes or until the strands of gluten come off the spoon when you press the back of the spoon against the bowl. There will be lively bubbles on the surface. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm, draft-free place until it is bubbly and has increased in volume. Prepare the sesame seeds: Place the sesame seeds in a small dry skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer immediately to a plate, place in the refrigerator, and cool completely. Mix and knead the final dough: Measure the remaining ingredients. Bring the bowl with the poolish to your work space. The poolish should be soupy, bubbly and puffy and it should have a wheaty aroma. Scrape the poolish into a 6-quart bowl. Add the water and yeast. Break the poolish up well with a wooden spoon and stir until it loosens and the mixture foams slightly. Add the whole wheat flour and cooled sesame seeds; stir until well combined. Add the salt and enough bran flour to make a thick mass that is difficult to stir. Turn out onto a well-floured surface. Knead, adding more flour as needed, for 10 minutes. Gradually knead in the raisins and continue kneading until the dough is soft and smooth, 15 to 17 minutes total. The dough is ready when a little dough pulled from the mass springs back quickly. Ferment the dough: Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest on a lightly floured surface while you scrape, clean, and lightly oil the large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn once to coat with oil. Take the dough&#39;s temperature: the ideal is 78 degrees. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm (74 to 80 degrees) draft-free place until doubled in volume. The dough has risen enough when a finger poked 1/2-inch into the dough leaves an indentation. Divide and shape the dough: Deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling up on the sides. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly. Cut into 2 equal pieces. Flatten each with the heel of your hand using firm, direct strokes. Shape each piece into a 9-inch-long log, sealing firmly and pinching closed. Proof the loaves: Place the loaves seam side down in lightly buttered 9 by 5 by 3-inch baking pans. Cover with a clean damp towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm draft-free place until dough rises just to the rim of the pan. Bake the loaves: 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking, preheat the oven and homemade hearth or baking stone on the center rack of the oven to 450 degrees. The oven rack must be in the center of the oven. Gently roll the loaf onto a lightly floured peel, seam side down. Score the loaf with a sharp razor blade or serrated knife making quick shallow cuts. Place the pans on the hearth and bake 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 400 degrees and bake until loaves are a rich caramel color and the crusts are firm, another 15 to 20 minutes. To test the loaves for doneness, remove from the pans and hold them upside down. Strike the bottom firmly with your finger. If the sound is hollow, the breads are done. If not, bake 5 minutes longer. Cool completely on a wire rack. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Barbera]&quot; 14605,&quot;Beurre Blanc 1/3 cup/75 ml white wine vinegar 1/3 cup/75 ml dry white wine 1 shallot, minced 1 cup/225 g butter, cut into pieces Salt and freshly ground pepper Instructions: Boil the vinegar, wine and shallots until reduced to 3 tablespoons.

Using your hands, coat each rack with the spice rub. Set aside. For the sauce: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and 2 teaspoons salt and cook until translucent and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and chiles and cook for 2 minutes. Add the apple cider vinegar, and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, for 3 minutes. Add the mustard and preserves. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook to allow the flavors to marry, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and carefully pour half the sauce over the ribs. Pour 1/2 cup of the chicken stock into the bottom of each dish. Cover the baking dishes with foil and place into the oven on the middle rack. Bake until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, cook the remaining sauce over medium-high heat until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Heat a grill pan or a gas or charcoal grill over medium-high heat. Using a pastry brush, glaze the baked ribs with the reduced sauce. Place the ribs meat-side down onto the hot grill and cook until slightly charred, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the ribs over and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Flip one final time, allowing the ribs to cook until perfectly charred, 3 to 5 minutes more.

Turn it over, and cut eight X&#39;s about 2 inches apart with a sharp knife. Open up each X with your fingers so it will securely hold an ice cream cone upright. Cook the chocolate, coconut oil and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until melted, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl. Pour about 1 tablespoon of melted chocolate into a sugar cone, and swirl to completely coat the inside. Pour any excess chocolate back into the bowl. Place the cone in the cone holder. Repeat with the 7 remaining cones. Freeze the cones to set the chocolate, about 10 minutes. Fill each cone to the top with ice cream, and top with an additional 1/3-cup scoop. Return the cones to the cone holder, and freeze to harden the ice cream, about 30 minutes. Dip the cones: Put your desired topping in a small bowl. If the remaining chocolate starts to solidify, heat it in the microwave in 10-second increments, stirring in between, until it is fluid again. Dip each top scoop of ice cream in the chocolate to mostly cover it, leaving a little bit exposed. Let any excess chocolate drip off, then immediately dip the top scoop in the topping. Work quickly, as the chocolate shell sets in seconds. Serve the cones immediately, or put them in the freezer until ready to serve. To freeze individually (for up to 2 weeks), roll the cone up in a large triangle of wax paper and tape closed. &quot;,&quot;[Riesling, Moscato, Vinho Verde, Prosecco]&quot; 14628,&quot;Braised Beef Short Ribs 1 cup grapeseed oil 4 pounds beef short ribs (1-inch thick, 3 bone racks) Salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 cups beef stock 2 cups mirepoix, small dice carrots, celery and onions 1 cup tomato paste 1/2 cup merlot or other red wine 1 tablespoon minced garlic 3 tablespoons fresh parsley and thyme leaves, minced 3 pounds peeled potatoes, medium dice 8 ounces unsalted butter 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon white pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cut off a very small corner. Pipe small solid triangles onto a sheet of parchment paper. They don&#39;t need to be even and can even vary a little in size. You&#39;ll need about 12 per jar, for a total of 72. Refrigerate to set. In a bowl, combine the cookie crumbs and butter and mix well. Place 2 tablespoons loosely into the bottom of each jar. Take the set triangles and place 3 per side around the outside of the cookie crumbs with the flat sides pressed up against the inside of the jar (this is Frankenstein?s ?hair?) Once the triangles are in place, compact the cookie crumb mixture using the back of a spoon; it will help to hold the chocolate shards firmly in place. Refrigerate. In a mixer bowl, beat the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla until whipped. Add the food color paste and mix thoroughly, tinting the mixture a little darker than you want the final product to be. Fold in the whipped cream, which will lighten the color of the mixture. Spoon the cheesecake mixture into a piping bag and cut the end to make a 3/4-inch opening. Pipe the mixture into the jars, starting in the center and finishing 1/2 inch above the top of the jar. Tap the jar gently on the counter and, if need be, use a spoon to compact the cheesecake mixture into the corners of the jar so no air pockets are visible, then use an offset spatula to smooth the top of the cheesecake so it&#39;s flush with the jar rim. Add the lids and allow to set in the fridge for 2 hours. Once set, turn the jar over so the lid is now the base. Dry off any condensation from the jar and use a black marker to draw on Frankenstein&#39;s face and scars. Place a small dab of melted candy on the back of 2 M&amp;M?s and use it as a glue to attach them to opposite sides of the jar to make the bolts in Frankenstein&#39;s neck. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14636,&quot;DOVER SOLE A LA MEUNIERE 1 fresh Dover sole, cleaned 1 cup flour 1 1/2 ounces olive oil Salt and pepper (to season flour) 2 ounces whole butter 1/2-ounce white wine 1/2 lemon, juiced 1 tablespoon chopped parsley Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Dissolve the yeast in the milk and then mix in the flour. The dough will be quite thick. Cover the bowl with plastic and let it sit in at room temperature for about an hour. For the dough: Scrape the starter dough in the bowl of a mixer. Add the eggs, butter, sugar, salt and flour and mix with your hands or spatula until the ingredients are loosely incorporated. This is messy and again the dough will be rather thick. Mix on low with the paddle attachment until the dough is silky and shiny. This will take at least 5 to 7 minutes and you will need to scrape down the bowl several times at first. Scrape the dough off the paddle attachment and form into a rough ball inside the mixer bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic and let sit for an hour, or until the dough has doubled in size. Punch down the dough. For the bombolino: With slightly floured fingers, using about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the dough, flatten the dough into a small disk about 1/4-inch thick. Place about 1 teaspoon of the cheese in the center and wrap the dough around the cheese. Pinch the dough together so that it sticks together and then roll the dough into a small ball. It is very important to make sure the dough is seamless, so that when it cooks no melted cheese escapes. Repeat until you have as many bombolino as you have salads. You will have excess dough. Heat a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F, or heat up 2 inches of oil in a high-sided heavy-bottomed pan. Make sure the oil does not come up past the half way point of the pan. Frying bombolino, only a few at a time for about 2 to 4 minutes, until golden brown all the way around. You might have to turn them over as they do tend to float. Drain on a paper towel and eat while warm. For the almond butter: Place almonds and garlic in a food processor and puree until smooth, scrape down the sides of the processor as necessary. Add 1 teaspoon of the oil as needed. Be very careful about how much oil to add as the almonds will get smoother the more they are processed. Use only as much as needed to achieve a smooth but thick almond paste. Season with cayenne pepper and salt, to taste. Place in a container. Will last refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reseason as needed. For the beet salad: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Trim tops and tails of beets and wash. Place in roasting pan and add enough water to pan so that it reaches half up the side of the beets. Cover with aluminum foil and place in preheated oven. Check doneness after about 45 minutes. If a pairing knife is able to penetrate the beet very easily, the beets are cooked. Check a few to make sure. If they not ready, recover with foil and place back in oven. Check in 15 minute increments. Remove from oven and remove foil. Let them sit until they reach room temperature. Do not discard the water. Using a kitchen towel (that you are not afraid to get really messy), peel the skin off the beets. The skin should wipe off very easily. To get off any little pieces of skin you might have missed, rinse in the water they were cooked in. Once all the beets are peeled, discard skins and the water they were cooked in. Cut beets in quarters or thirds, depending on their size and your preference. Mix gingerly with shallots, chives, oil and vinegar. To plate: Smooth about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the almond butter on the plate. Place about 1/2 cup of the beet salad onto the almond butter. Place a freshly fried bombolino on top of the beets and season with a touch of fleur de sel. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Grner Veltliner]&quot; 14640,&quot;Blinchiki 3 eggs 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 soup spoon sugar 1 cup milk 2 cups all-purpose flour Splash vegetable oil Instructions: Mix the eggs, salt and sugar until thoroughly blended.

For charcoal grills, bank one chimney starter-full of lit and ashed-over charcoal briquettes to one side of the grill. Set up a drip pan on the other side to avoid flare-ups. (Be sure to consult the grill manufacturer&#39;s guide for best results.) Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet on direct heat and add the bacon; cook, stirring often, until crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel lined plate; set aside.<br> Add the potatoes and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir to coat with the bacon fat, then move to indirect heat and cover the grill. Cook, uncovering the grill and stirring every 5 minutes, until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.<br> Sprinkle with the Cheddar and move back to direct heat. Cook, uncovered, until the potato bottoms are golden and the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes, depending on the heat of your grill.

Make the dough: Pulse the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the butter; pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon ice water in a bowl, then add to the processor and pulse once or twice. (Stop before the dough gathers into a ball.) Turn out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and pat into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Toast the walnuts on a baking sheet on the middle oven rack until golden, 7 to 8 minutes; let cool. Process the nuts, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, the egg, 1 tablespoon butter, the vanilla and salt in a clean food processor to make a creamy paste. Line a flat baking sheet (or an upside-down rimmed one) with parchment paper. Roll the dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface. Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, then unroll onto the parchment. Spread the walnut filling over the dough, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border around the edges. Chill while you prepare the apples. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Peel, core and halve the apples, then cut each half into 8 wedges. Arrange over the filling in a circular pattern, slightly overlapping. Fold the edges of the dough inward, pleating it. Sprinkle the apples with the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons butter. Bake the galette on the middle oven rack until golden, 40 to 45 minutes. (Put a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any drips.) Cool on a rack. Whisk 1 tablespoon water and the preserves in a bowl. Strain, then brush over the apples.

Put the stock, shallot, garlic, lime leaves, and ginger in a saucepan, cover and let it bubble away at a moderate to high heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until you have a thickish, softish mess at the bottom of the pan. Check to make sure it isn&#39;t either burning or just getting too dry for comfort, and add a bit of boiling water if it is. Meanwhile, put the mussels in a sink filled with ice-cold water. Chuck away any that don&#39;t sink and then, as you remove them, make doubly sure by chucking away any that don&#39;t shut when you tap then sharply. I wouldn&#39;t expect you to have to throw many away, so don&#39;t worry unduly. Add the cl pepper to the mixture in the pan. After about 30 seconds, or just long enough to get them out of the sink, add the mussels and then throw over them 1/2 cup boiling water, and then the lime juice, mirin, and fish sauce mixed together. Cover, give the pan a shake, and leave on a high heat for about 3 minutes, by which time the mussels should have steamed open. Add half the coriander, shake again, and pour into a noodle bowl.

Set aside. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and saute the onion until slightly golden. Add the tomatoes and let cook until the liquid has evaporated. Add the pickles and the chopped meats. Mix well, cover, and cook over low heat for 10 minutes to blend flavors. Add reserved juices and enough water to barely cover meats. Place potatoes over meats, cover, and cook until potatoes are done (about 20 minutes). While O Diablo is cooking, peel the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. Mash the whites with a fork and add to the pot. Mash the yolks and mix with the sugar and the powdered mustard. Add enough of the vinegar from the pickle jar to form a paste (about 1/2 cup). When the potatoes are done, thicken sauce in pot with the egg yolk mixture. Cook 5 minutes more. Add white wine; increase the heat and bring to a boil. Cook another 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let it set, covered, until dinner is served. Cook rice according to package directions. When ready, reheat O Diablo and serve with rice. Some prefer this dish with bread instead of rice to sop up the juices; either way, it is delicious. Prepare this dish in the morning so that the flavors will have melded by dinnertime. The leftovers of this dish will keep up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14685,&quot;Vanilla, Almond and Cocoa Latte 4 ounces milk 1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder 1 1/2 ounces amaretto liqueur<br> 1 1/2 ounces chocolate liqueur<br> 1 1/2 ounces vanilla vodka<br> 1 teaspoon chocolate shavings<br> Instructions: Combine the milk and espresso powder in a cocktail shaker and stir until dissolved.

Put the corn on a rimmed baking sheet; broil, turning, until lightly charred on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes. (Alternatively, char the corn directly over a gas burner or on a grill over medium-high heat.) Transfer to a cutting board; let cool slightly, then cut off the kernels and transfer to a bowl. Working over the bowl, run the back of a chef&#39;s knife down the cobs to extract the juices; discard the cobs. Melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add all but 2 tablespoons of the scallions, the celery, sweet potato, thyme, cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 3 minutes. Sprinkle in the cornmeal; cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, 1 minute. Add the corn, its juices and 5 cups water. Increase the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sweet potato is tender and the soup has thickened slightly, 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium low and stir in the chicken and milk. Cook until the chicken is warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes (do not boil). Season with salt and black pepper.

Saute until the onions are translucent. In the same skillet, add the sausage meat and cook until all the sausage has changed color and is cooked, about 5 minutes. Add the cornbread and fresh herbs and continue to cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to rest until cool. When cool add the whipped egg whites, heavy cream and melted butter and stir to combine. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. Make a cut 1/4-inch from the top of the loin down the full length and roll the pork cutting at the same time, this will give you a flat piece of meat ( if you were to roll it back up it would look like it did before you cut it). Evenly spread the stuffing over the flattened pork loin and then re-roll it back to the original form. Tie together with butcher&#39;s twine, so the loin is tied every 1 to 2 inches. Refrigerate for about 1 hour to rest and firm up a bit. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Using a large skillet over high heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil and sear the whole pork loin until golden brown all over, then transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 15 to 17 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. Check the pork temperature after 10 minutes, as some ovens cook faster than others, and we don&#39;t want the meat to overcook. The loin should be removed from the oven when it reaches an internal temperature of 135 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer the loin to a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil, to rest for 5 minutes. It will continue to cook and reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. Slice the pork and arrange on a serving platter to serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Garnacha]</p><p>&quot; 14688,&quot;Country Sloppy Joes with Fried Onions 2 tablespoons olive oil One 2-pound beef brisket, fat cap trimmed, sinew removed 1 tablespoon Miss Brown&#39;s House Seasoning, recipe follows 1 medium onion, diced 1 red bell pepper, diced 2 cups beef broth 1 bay leaf Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 4 hamburger buns Dill pickle chips, for serving One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, undrained 2 cups ketchup 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar 1/3 cup molasses 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 1 tablespoon sweet paprika 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper Vegetable oil, for frying 1/2 medium red onion, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rings 1 cup buttermilk 1 cup all-purpose flour Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon Miss Brown\\u2019s House Seasoning, recipe follows 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Start the brisket: Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the brisket with the House Seasoning. Place the brisket, fat-side down, in the hot Dutch oven and brown until a deep golden crust forms, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn the brisket over and brown on the other side, another 5 minutes. Remove the brisket from the Dutch oven. Add the onions and bell pepper to the drippings in the Dutch oven and stir until well coated in oil. Add the beef broth and bay leaf and bring to a boil. Return the brisket to the Dutch oven. Cover and place in the oven. Bake for 3 hours. Meanwhile, make the sloppy joe sauce. Combine the diced tomatoes, ketchup, brown sugar, molasses, apple cider vinegar, garlic powder, mustard, paprika and cayenne pepper in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer over medium-low until slightly thickened and reduced by one-fourth, about 30 minutes. After the brisket has baked for 3 hours, pour 2 cups of the sauce over the brisket. Cover the Dutch oven and continue baking the brisket until tender, 30 minutes longer. (Use a knife to test the tenderness of the brisket. It should pierce the brisket very smoothly, with no pushback.) Shred the meat using two forks and stir in 1 more cup of sauce. Season with salt and pepper. During the last 30 minutes, make the fried onions: Pour oil halfway up the sides of a large cast-iron skillet and heat to 350 degrees F. Place the onion in the buttermilk in a small bowl. Place the flour in a shallow baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Working with a few onions at a time, dredge them in the flour, shaking to remove any excess flour. Add to the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes. Remove the onions to a baking sheet with a wire rack and sprinkle with the House Seasoning while still hot. Repeat with the remaining onions and set aside. To assemble the sandwiches, spoon some of the brisket on the hamburger bun bottoms. Top with the fried onions, pickles and bun tops. Stir together the garlic and onion powders, paprika, salt and pepper in a small bowl.

Reduce by 3/4. Have all ingredients measured and close by, as you will need to stir with one hand and add cheese with the other. When wine starts to show small, tiny bubbles, but is not yet boiling , gradually add cheese while stirring constantly. When you start to feel a slight resistance to the spoon, add heavy cream to desired consistency, and the Balsamic vinegar. Continue to cook until the fondue begins to thicken. Add to taste nutmeg, paprika, and red pepper flakes. Quickly transfer to a fondue pot. Classically, fondue is served with fresh fruit, nuts, and crusty French bread. For the Italian Fondue, it might be fun to serve an antipasto dish, breadsticks wrapped with proscuitto, sun-dried tomatoes, or even left over vegetables like asparagus and broccoli. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 14692,&quot;Enchiladas de Pollo en Mole Coloradito 8 ancho chiles, seeds removed 8 pasilla chiles, seeds removed 4 dried guajillo chiles, seeds removed 1/4 cup raisins 5 large tomatoes, cut into quarters through the stem 2 tomatillos, husks removed, cut into quarters through the stem 1 large yellow onion, diced 6 unpeeled garlic cloves Sunflower oil, for cooking Kosher salt 1 cup 1-inch cubes sourdough bread 4 whole cloves 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 cinnamon stick, broken into pieces 4 tablespoons sesame seeds 3 cups chicken broth 12 corn tortillas Meat picked from 1 rotisserie chicken Instructions: Combine the ancho, pasilla and guajillo chiles and raisins in a medium bowl. Add enough hot water to cover, cover the bowl and soak until the chiles are softened and the raisins plump, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain. Remove and discard the stems from the chiles. Set the raisins and chiles aside. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the tomatoes, tomatillos, onion and garlic on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with enough oil to coat and sprinkle with salt. Roast until the vegetables are soft and slightly charred, about 25 minutes. Place the sourdough on a small rimmed baking sheet, drizzle lightly with oil and season with salt. Spread out in an even layer and toast until golden brown, 6 to 9 minutes. Place the cloves, cumin and cinnamon stick in a small heavy skillet. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until toasted and fragrant, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a small plate. Add 3 tablespoons of the sesame seeds to the same skillet over medium heat and toast, stirring often, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the toasted spices. Drain the chiles and raisins. Working in 2 batches, combine the chiles and raisins, roasted vegetables, toasted sesame seeds, cinnamon stick, cloves, cumin, sourdough and broth in a blender. Puree until smooth, return to the bowl and set aside. To refry the sauce, pour enough oil into a 6-quart saucepan to cover the bottom. Place over high heat. Once the oil just begins to smoke, partially cover the pot to protect from the sauce splattering and carefully pour in the blended ingredients (see Cook&#39;s Note). Immediately cover the pot, lower the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes; this will allow the flavors to marry and intensify. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. To assemble the enchiladas, add about 1 tablespoon oil to a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Fry the tortillas one at a time, turning them once, just until soft and pliable; this will make them easier to roll and prevent them from cracking. Set them aside in a stack on a plate, covered, to keep warm. When ready to assemble, flip the stack of tortillas to use the ones on the bottom first, fill each tortilla with chicken, roll to enclose and place side-by-side in a row in a large baking dish. Once the dish is full, cover the enchiladas completely with the mole and bake until the chicken is warmed through, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 tablespoon sesame seeds in a small heavy skillet set over medium heat. Toast, stirring constantly, until just lightly browned, about 2 minutes.

Make sure the tubes are cleaned out and split them open lengthwise so they look like a flat triangle. Using a matte knife, lightly score the squid in a crosshatch pattern. Cut each tube into four pieces of roughly equal size. In a bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of soy sauce with 1 teaspoon of cornstarch and toss the squid in it to coat. Marinate while preparing for the rest of the dish. Combine the miso broth and balsamic vinegar with the remaining cornstarch. In a hot pan or wok, add the sesame oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the squid and cook for 30 to 40 seconds. It will curl up naturally and brown. Working quickly, add the garlic, ginger, and chiles. Allow them to fry for 10 to 15 seconds stirring constantly (they can burn fast). Add the onion, mushrooms, and bell pepper and saute for another minute. Pour in the stock mixture and simmer until the sauce begins to thicken. Season with white pepper and additional soy sauce, if necessary.

Garnish with lemon zest. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Gris]&quot; 14720,&quot;Nectarine-Raspberry Slab Pie 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 sticks (1 1/2 cups) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch dice and kept very cold 1 tablespoon white or cider vinegar 1/3 cup ice water, plus more if needed 1 3/4 pounds ripe nectarines (about 6), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch wedges 2/3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar Juice of 1 lemon 2 tablespoons cornstarch 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 cup raspberries 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 large egg, beaten Instructions: For the dough: Combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a food processor and pulse until mixed. Add about one third of the chilled butter and process until thoroughly combined (the mixture will be slightly yellow). Add the remaining chilled butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a very coarse meal with pea-size bits of butter. Add the vinegar in a single pulse. Gradually add the ice water through the feed tube, pulsing just until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together, it should just hold its shape and be a little crumbly. If still very powdery, pulse again, adding up to 2 tablespoons ice water. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and press it together by hand. Divide the dough in half; wrap each piece in a large piece of plastic wrap, pressing each firmly into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. Adjust an oven rack to the bottom position of the oven and put a pizza stone or large baking sheet on it. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. For the filling: Toss together the nectarines, brown sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, vanilla and salt in a large bowl until the cornstarch dissolves. Add the raspberries and gently toss to combine. To assemble the pie: Let the dough stand at room temperature for a few minutes until slightly softened to make rolling easier. Place one piece of dough between two large pieces of floured parchment. Roll into a rough 14-by-12 inch rectangle (if the dough gets too soft, pop it in the fridge to firm up, then continue rolling). Repeat rolling with the second piece of dough. Pile the nectarine-raspberry filling into the center of one piece of dough and spread evenly, leaving at least a 1-inch border. Dot the filling with the butter. With a 1-inch star-shaped cookie cutter, cut out 4 to 5 stars from the second piece of dough (reserve the cut-outs for decorating). To transport the dough to the pie, roll it up onto the rolling pin and then unroll it over the filling, lining up the edges with the bottom piece of dough as best you can. Pinch the edges together, then fold and crimp to create a tight seal. Brush the top and edges of the crust with the egg; decorate the top crust with the star cut-outs and brush them with egg too. Generously sprinkle the pie with granulated sugar. Using the bottom piece of parchment paper, slide the pie onto another rimmed baking sheet (trim the parchment if there&#39;s any overhang). Put the baking sheet with the pie directly on the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet (this helps make the bottom crust crisp and flaky). Bake the pie until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 45 to 50 minutes. (If the crust browns too quickly during baking, cover the pie loosely with foil. Some of the filling may bubble from the vents onto the parchment paper; don&#39;t fret-just embrace the rustic charm.) Let cool. Slice into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14721,&quot;Ancho-Marinated Whole Roast Fish, Oaxaca-Style A scant 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, preferably freshly ground A pinch cumin seeds, preferably freshly ground A pinch cloves, preferably freshly ground 1 cup fish (or chicken) broth, plus a little more if needed Salt, about 3/4 teaspoon, plus a little more if needed About 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 1 tablespoon sugar Two 1- to 1 1/4-pound whole fish (such as snapper, bass or pompano), gutted and scaled 1 small white onion, sliced 3/8-inch thick and separated into rings 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, plus a few sprigs for garnish 3 radishes, thinly sliced Instructions: Making 3/4 cup Essential Sweet-and-Spicy Ancho Seasoning Paste: Roast the unpeeled garlic directly on an ungreased griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until soft (they will blacken in spots), about 15 minutes; cool and peel. While the garlic is roasting, toast the chiles on another side of the griddle or skillet: 1 or 2 at a time, open them flat and press down firmly on the hot surface with a spatula; in a few seconds, when they crackle, even send up a wisp of smoke, flip them and press down to toast the other side. In a small bowl, cover the chiles with hot water and let rehydrate 30 minutes, stirring frequently to ensure even soaking. Drain and discard the water. Combine the oregano, black pepper, cumin and cloves in a food processor or blender, along with the chiles, garlic and 1/2-cup of the broth. Blend to a smooth puree, scraping and stirring every few seconds. (If the mixture won&#39;t go through the blender blades, add a little more liquid.) Press through a medium-mesh strainer into a bowl. Taste and season with salt, usually about a generous 3/4 teaspoon (it should taste a little salty). Marinating the fish: Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a small (1- to 1 1/2-quart) saucepan over medium-high. When hot enough to make a drop of the puree really sizzle, add it all at once, and cook, stirring constantly, until very thick, about 5 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and sugar and cool to tepid. With sharp scissors, trim off all fins and cut out gills from both fish, then make 3 diagonal slashes on each side of the fish, penetrating to the bone. Place the fish in an oiled 13 x 9-inch baking dish, then smear all but 2 tablespoons of the cl paste (reserve the remainder) over both sides of each fish. Cover and refrigerate an hour or two (but not more than 6). Baking the fish: Turn on the oven to 400 degrees. With a brush, daub 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil over the fish. Bake uncovered until the flesh comes away from the bone near the top of the head, 12 to 14 minutes. Finishing and serving the dish: While the fish is baking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a medium-size (8- to 9-inch) skillet over medium-high. Add the onion rings and stir-fry until browned but still crunchy, about 5 minutes. Add the reserved 2 tablespoons cl mixture and the remaining 1/2 cup of the broth to the onions. Boil quickly until reduced to a light saucy consistency. Taste and season with salt if necessary; keep warm. Use 2 metal spatulas to transfer the fish to a large, warm, serving platter. Add any baking dish juices to the sauce, return to a boil, then spoon over the fish. Sprinkle on the chopped cilantro and radishes. Garnish with sprigs of cilantro, and carry confidently to the table. &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Pinot Noir, Barbera, Tempranillo]&quot; 14722,&quot;Grilled Cabbage Caesar 4 cloves garlic 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan (from about 2 ounces), plus more shaved Parmesan for serving 1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for the grill grates 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons anchovy paste, optional 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 medium head red cabbage (about 1 3/4 pounds) 4 ounces crusty sourdough bread, cut into 1-inch-thick slices Instructions: Preheat a grill for medium-high heat. Combine the garlic, Parmesan, 1/4 cup of the olive oil, lemon juice, mayonnaise, Dijon, anchovy paste if using, white wine vinegar, Worcestershire, 1/4 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper in a blender. Blend on high speed until smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides of the blender carafe with a rubber spatula as necessary. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper. Transfer the Caesar dressing to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 1 day.<br> Cut the cabbage through the core into 8 long wedges (each wedge should be 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick). Make sure to keep the core intact, as this will hold the wedges together as they cook. Brush the cabbage wedges and sliced bread with the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil and season with a pinch each of salt and pepper.<br> Lightly oil the hot grill grates. Place the cabbage on the grill and cook, covered, until the first side is nicely charred, about 5 minutes. Flip the cabbage, then continue to cook, covered, until crisp-tender and nicely charred all over, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to a serving platter. Place the bread on the grill and cook uncovered until toasted and golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side.<br> Tear or cut the bread into 1-inch cubes, then sprinkle over the grilled cabbage. Drizzle with most of the Caesar dressing, then top with some shaved Parmesan and more pepper.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, red pepper and garlic and saute until soft, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add 2/3 of the black-eyed peas and mash all the ingredients together with a potato masher. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Add the flour, egg, green onion, oregano, lemon zest, cayenne, and 1/4 to 1/2 cup breadcrumbs to the pea mixture. Fold in the cheese and remaining black-eyed peas. Season with salt and pepper. Place the remaining breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl. Divide the batter into 12 portions using a 1 1/2-ounce portion scoop. Press into flat 1/2-inch-thick discs and coat in the remaining breadcrumbs. Wipe out the skillet. Heat the remaining oil and, in batches, sear the fritters until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Place on a baking sheet and finish cooking in the oven until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Top with the onion jam and garnish with the green onions. Melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onions, lemon zest, ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook until the onions start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes Add the coriander, 1/4 cup of the brown sugar and half the lemon juice and turn the heat to low. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions start to cook down and the liquid is evaporated, about 15 minutes. Add 1/3 cup water every 10 minutes and continue to cook until the onions are thick and golden brown, about 55 minutes.

With the tip of a paring knife, make ten 3/4-inch-deep slits on each side of the roast. Insert a garlic clove half into each slit. Season the meat all over with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Gently set the roast in it and sear all over, turning with tongs, until well browned, about 14 minutes. Remove the meat from the pan to a plate. Add the carrots, onions and bay leaves to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring up the crispy bits at the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, until the wine is reduced by half. Return the roast to the pot, laying it on top of the vegetables. Add enough chicken stock to cover the roast by three-quarters. Cover and roast for 1 hour 30 minutes. Flip the meat over and add the potatoes. Cover and continue cooking until the potatoes are tender but not mushy and the meat is fall-apart tender, 45 minutes more, depending on the thickness of the roast. Remove the roast and vegetables to a platter. Season the meat with additional salt. Pour the sauce into a gravy boat and pass with the meat and vegetables. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Barbera]&quot; 14727,&quot;Creamy Roasted Beet Soup 1 pound (about 3) beets, roasted, peeled and sliced 1 cup minced onion 3 tablespoons butter 4 cups chicken broth 1 fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried 1 bay leaf Salt and pepper 1/2 cup heavy cream 2 to 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar Lightly whipped cream and dill sprigs for garnish (optional) Instructions: In a large saucepan set over moderate heat cook beets and onion in butter, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.

Use the lid to press against the tomatoes to extract as much juice as possible. Squeeze the tomatoes to a pulp using your hands. Reserve the juice and pulp separately and set the empty can aside.<br> Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until hot. If using the jalapeno, tilt the pan to collect the oil in a little pool against the side and drop the jalapeno into the oil. Cook until light brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the jalapeno and reserve.<br> Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook briefly until light gold. Add the bay leaf. Add the tomato juice and bring to a boil. Simmer rapidly for several minutes. Add the crushed tomato pulp. Then rinse the remaining pulp out of the can by filling it halfway with water and add that to the pan. Add the jalapeno, and salt and pepper, to taste, and return to a boil. Add the dried tomatoes and stir. Lower the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, until the mixture thickens and the tomatoes have turned an orange-red versus the pale blue-red they were straight from the can, about 30 minutes. Add the oregano halfway through the cooking. Discard the bay leaf. Peel, seed, and mash the jalapeno with a spoonful of the sauce and pass at the table so diners can add as much heat as they like to their plates. Variation for quick tomato sauce: Substitute 2 pounds vine-ripened tomatoes for the canned tomatoes. Peel the tomatoes, cut in half crosswise, and squeeze out the juice and seeds over a sieve suspended over a bowl to collect the juice. Chop the tomatoes. Proceed as directed, omitting the dried tomatoes and using jalapeno, if desired. You should have about 2 1/4 cups sauce.

Line a 12-x-15 1/2-x-1/2-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang at each short end. Batter: Pour the cream, corn syrup, and sugar into a 1 1/2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir to combine, then add the butter. Stir over medium-low heat until the butter melts. Then raise the heat to medium, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon--especially toward the end of cooking--to prevent scorching. Cook until the mixture reaches 238 degrees F, the soft-ball stage, on a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes; the mixture will appear between ivory- and straw-colored. Remove from heat, and stir in almonds. Pour the mixture onto the center of the foil-lined baking sheet, and spread it in as thin a layer as possible. A pool about 8 inches in diameter is fine. Bake for 3 minutes; then spread the more liquid mixture evenly over the baking sheet. If the mixture still does not completely cover the baking sheet, bake another minute, then tilt the baking sheet to allow the mixture to spread evenly. Bake for about 5 to 6 minutes total, or until golden but not dark brown. Though the mixture bubbles while baking, the bubbles form more slowly toward the end of baking time than at the beginning. Place the baking sheet on a wire rack and cool for 2 to 3 minutes. While the mixture is still warm but no longer liquid, cut 1 1/2-inch squares using a ruler and a pastry wheel. If the mixture is too warm, it will not cut cleanly. If it is too cool, it will splinter or not cut; in that case return it to the oven for a few seconds to soften it a bit. Decoration: When the squares are completely cool, place the chocolate in a bowl over water at about 120 degrees F. When about two-thirds of the chocolate has melted, remove the bowl from the water. With a dry rubber spatula, stir until the liquid chocolate melts the soft or unmelted chocolate that remains. Fill a small handmade paper cone with the chocolate and snip off the tip. Pipe thin lines of chocolate back and forth over the squares&#39; surface. Refrigerate the squares briefly, just to set the chocolate. Remove from the refrigerator and set aside in a cool, dry place. To store, remove squares from the foil and place them in layers, separated by strips of aluminum, in an airtight metal or plastic container in a cool place up to 1 week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14732,&quot;Grilled Mushroom and Malanga Salad 1 pound large shiitake mushroom caps 3 portobello mushrooms 1 pound button mushrooms 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon minced garlic 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves 1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots 1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and green parts Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 1/2 pounds malanga, peeled and sliced 1/2-inch thick 11 ounces fresh goat cheese, crumbled 1/2 cup white truffle oil 2 cups vegetable oil, for frying 12 slices ripe, red beefsteak tomatoes Instructions: In a large bowl, combine the mushrooms. Add the vinegar, olive oil, garlic, thyme, rosemary, shallots, scallions, salt, and pepper. Marinate for 1 hour. Prepare a hot fire in the grill. Remove the mushrooms from the marinade and reserve the marinade for later. Place a vegetable/fish grill rack on the grate. Place the mushrooms on the rack and grill for 2 to 3 minutes per side. The portobellos may require a bit more time on the grill. When the mushrooms are cooked, transfer to a plate and let cool. Cut them into 1/2-inch pieces and transfer them with any accumulated juices to the reserved balsamic marinade. Toss to coat. To prepare malanga, cube 2 pounds and set the remaining 1/2 pound aside. Add the 2 pounds cubed malanga to a large pot of boiling salted water and boil for 8 to 10 minutes, until the malanga is tender but still holds its shape. Drain, plunge into ice water to stop the cooking, and drain again. Transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms. Add the goat cheese and truffle oil and gently toss to mix all ingredients. To prepare the remaining 1/2 pound malanga, slice very thin using a mandoline, any vegetable slicer, or box grater. Cut the slices crosswise into fine strips with a sharp knife. In a medium-size saute pan, heat the oil to 350 degrees and fry the malanga until golden brown and crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain. To serve, spoon the mushroom salad over the tomato slices and sprinkle with the fried malanga. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 14733,&quot;Grilled Flank Steak with Savory Secret Sauce 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> 4 anchovy fillets<br> 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br> 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br> 4 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 teaspoons lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 1 piece flank steak (1 1/2 to 2 pounds)<br> 1 tablespoon canola oil<br> Instructions: Place a medium saute pan over medium-low heat.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, pepper, and salt. Add the buttermilk and butter and mix just until incorporated. Don&#39;t overmix. Add 2 cups of the Cheddar (leave the rest of the cheese out to come to room temperature) and the green onions and quickly mix to combine. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 15 minutes in the refrigerator. When you are ready to bake, spray 2 baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray. Tear off pieces of dough and roll into balls about the size of a golf ball. Arrange them on the baking sheets, brush them with a little buttermilk, and bake them until golden brown, about 10 to 14 minutes. In a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, whip the remaining room temperature cheese until it is smooth. Slice each biscuit in half and spread a teaspoon of whipped Cheddar onto the bottom. Cut a piece of ham to fit and put it on top of the Cheddar. Dollop with 1/2 teaspoon Red Pepper Jelly and cover with the top of the biscuit.

Sprinkle in the pudding mix and whisk until blended and slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Pour into six 6-ounce ramekins and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Sprinkle the surface of each individual pudding with 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar. Gently shake each ramekin to evenly distribute the sugar over the surface of the pudding. Using a kitchen blowtorch, melt and caramelize the sugar so a thin shell forms over the surface. It&#39;s best to hold the torch a few inches away from the surface so the tip of the flame just touches the sugar. Let sit a few minutes before serving If you don&#39;t have a blowtorch, you can use a broiler. Preheat the broiler to high. Put the ramekins with the sugared puddings on a baking sheet about 6 inches under the broiler and broil--with the oven door slightly open so you can watch--until the sugar is melted and caramelized. This should take only 1 to 2 minutes, so don&#39;t walk away. Let sit a few minutes before serving. You can also caramelize the tops by heating the bottom of a metal flat-bottomed 1/2-cup measuring cup on the stove so it gets very hot. Carefully and gently press the bottom of the cup onto the sugared surface of each pudding for a few seconds to melt the sugar. Repeat, reheating the measuring cup once or twice in between if necessary. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14749,&quot;Sausage, Spinach and Potato Tart 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br> 12 tablespoons butter (1 1/2 sticks), cold and sliced into chunks<br> 1 large egg, lightly beaten<br> 1 tablespoon cold water<br> 1 small Yukon gold potato, finely diced Kosher salt 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 8 ounces bulk mild or sweet Italian pork sausage<br> 3 cups fresh baby spinach<br> Freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 green onions, sliced<br> 3 large eggs<br> 1/2 cup milk<br> 1 cup grated gruyere cheese<br> Instructions: For the dough: Add flour and salt to the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter to the bowl and pulse until the mixture looks like crumbly sand. Add the egg and water and pulse again until the dough comes together. Very lightly flour the work surface. Dump the dough onto the floured surface and knead a few times until it comes together. Shape the dough into a disc and roll out to a 13-inch circle. Press the dough into the bottom and sides of an 11-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Level the edges with your fingers. Prick the bottom of the tart with a fork. Freeze until firm, 25 minutes. For the filling: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. While the tart is in the freezer, add the potatoes to a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Add a big pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook the potatoes until tender but still with a bit of resistance, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and cool. Lightly drizzle the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, and cook, breaking up with the back of a wooden spoon until crumbly and browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the spinach by the handful and stir until it just wilts down. Season the mixture with salt and pepper and stir in the green onions. Remove to a bowl to cool. Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and stir in the milk. Whisk together until combined and then add some salt and pepper. Remove the tart from the freezer. Cover the top with parchment paper and add pie weights or dried beans. Place on a sheet tray and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the pie weights and parchment paper and continue baking for 10 minutes more. Turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees F. Evenly sprinkle the par-baked tart shell with half of the grated cheese, then the cooked potatoes, and finally top with the sausage and spinach mixture. Pour the eggs over the top and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 45 minutes. Cool the tart for 10 minutes before serving.

Grease two 8-inch baking dishes with the nonstick cooking spray and line them with parchment paper, allowing 1-inch wings to hang over the edges; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, salt and baking powder. In a medium bowl, whisk together the butter, vanilla, eggs and 3/4 cup peanut butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula to combine. Divide the mixture between the prepared baking dishes and spread out evenly with a spatula or your hands. Bake until the centers are just set, begin checking for doneness at 23 minutes. Cool in the pans completely. While the blondies cool, allow the ice cream to soften at room temperature to a spreadable consistency. Using an offset spatula, spread the ice cream evenly over one pan of the blondies while it&#39;s still in the pan. Drizzle on the remaining 1/2 cup peanut butter and use the spatula to swirl it into the ice cream.

As soon as the bay leaves turn brown, add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 30 seconds or until it is golden. Add the onions, bell pepper, and allspice and saute, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes, until the onions and peppers are softened but not brown. Add the potatoes and stock; if the stock doesn&#39;t cover the potatoes, add just enough water to cover them. Turn up the heat, bring to a boil, cover, and cook the potatoes vigorously for about 10 minutes, until they are soft on the outside but still firm in the center. Reduce the heat to medium, add the tomatoes and sausage, and simmer for 5 minutes. Season the mixture assertively with salt and pepper (you want to almost overseason the chowder at this point, to avoid having to stir it much once the fish is added). Add the whole fillets and cook for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat, gently stir in the cilantro, and allow the chowder to sit for 10 minutes. (The fish will finish cooking during this time.) If you are not serving the chowder within the hour, let it cool a bit, then refrigerate; cover the chowder after it has chilled completely. Otherwise, let it sit for up to an hour at room temperature, allowing the flavors to meld. When ready to serve, reheat the chowder over low heat; don&#39;t let it boil.

Pulse to the consistency of a smooth, loose paste. With a sharp knife, score the fat-side of meat 1/4-inch deep, making in a diamond pattern. Place the pork fat-side up in a roasting pan. Rub the marinade into the pork, making sure to get into all the crevices. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, for best results, overnight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. One hour prior to cooking, remove the pork from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature. Remove the plastic wrap and set the meat fat-side up on a rack in a deep roasting pan. Cook uncovered for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 300 degrees F and cook another 3 1/2 to 4 hours, until the internal temperature registers 180 to 185 degrees F and the skin is crispy. (If the pork begins to brown too much on top, cover it loosely with foil.) Cut away the pork skin (the chicharron), chop it finely, and set aside 1/2 cup for the mofongo. Let the meat rest 20 to 30 minutes before shredding. For the sopa de pollo: Set a medium saucepan over medium heat and add enough canola oil to coat the pan. Add the onions, peppers and garlic and sweat until translucent and fragrant, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle with salt. Add the chicken and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the chicken broth.

Slice off the top of the garlic head, cutting away just enough to expose the cloves. Set the garlic on a double layer of aluminum foil and drizzle with the olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Close the foil tightly to create a pouch, and transfer it to a baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the cloves turn golden brown. Let rest until cool enough to handle. Working over a bowl, squeeze the bottom of the garlic head to release the cloves. Set aside. Set a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crispy and well browned. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. In a deep pot or Dutch oven, heat 3 inches of oil to 325 degrees F. Working in batches, fry the plantains in the oil until golden and soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. When cool enough to handle, smash the plantains with a spatula or the side of a knife, then return them to the oil. Fry a second time, until they&#39;re just starting to brown. Drain on paper towels and season with salt as the plantains come out of the oil. To assemble: In a large, heavy metal mixing bowl, combine the fried plantains, the roasted garlic, the bacon, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and the reserved 1/2 cup pork skin, as well as the cilantro, scallions and lime juice.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a cutting board and let stand until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Shred the meat into 2-inch-long pieces. Return the shredded meat to the slow cooker, stir to combine, and let stand until the meat is hot, about 10 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if necessary. The warm braised meat can be used to fill burritos, tacos, tostadas or sandwiches. Leftover meat can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days or frozen in plastic freezer bags or containers for up to 1 month. For the tostadas: Spread about 1/3 cup of the warm meat over each of the crisp shells. Top each tostada with about 2 tablespoons lettuce, some diced avocado and 2 tablespoons salsa. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon crema over the top and garnish with crumbled queso fresco. Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the top. &quot;,&quot;[Malbec, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Zinfandel]&quot; 14807,&quot;Spatchcocked Turkey One 15- to 20-pound turkey Neutral oil, like canola, for rubbing the turkey<br> Kosher salt<br> 4 medium carrots, roughly chopped<br> 1 Spanish onion, roughly chopped<br> 1/2 head celery, roughly chopped<br> 3/4 cup to 1 cup chicken reduction or demi-glace Instructions: With the turkey breast-side down, use poultry shears to cut along both sides of the backbone. Open up the turkey and use the tip of a knife to score alongside the keel bone (the dark oblong bone in the middle of the breast). This makes it easier to flatten the bird. Turn the turkey breast-side up and press down strongly with the heel of your hand on the center of the breast. You should hear a crack and feel the bones give way. Allow your turkey to air-dry at room temperature for 2 hours, skin-side up. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Rub the turkey with oil, then sprinkle all over with salt. Put the carrots, onion and celery in the bottom of a roasting pan, tossing to combine. Create a level bed of the vegetables and place a rack on top. Place the turkey, breast-side up, on the rack. Bake for 10 minutes to sear, then turn the oven down to 350 degrees F and cook for 20 minutes per pound (5 hours to 6 hours 40 minutes). 20 minutes before complete, brush the turkey skin with the chicken reduction. Return to the oven and finish cooking. Allow the turkey to rest for 45 minutes to 1 hour before slicing and serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14808,&quot;Scallion Pancakes 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting Kosher salt 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, at room temperature 5 scallions, finely chopped Vegetable oil, for frying Instructions: Sift the flour and 3/4 teaspoon salt into a large bowl.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking sheets; smooth into an even layer using an offset spatula. Bake until golden on top and the edges pull away from the baking sheets, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely on the baking sheets, then freeze until firm, about 30 minutes. For the frosting: Meanwhile, bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a heatproof stand mixer bowl above the water without the bottom of the bowl touching the water. Add the sugar, lemon juice, salt and egg whites to the mixing bowl and whisk together by hand. Set the bowl above the simmering water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar is completely dissolved. Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat at medium-high speed until cool and the whites hold stiff peaks, 10 to 15 minutes. Toss in a couple of chunks of butter at a time and continue beating, making sure the pieces are incorporated before adding more. After all the butter is added, continue beating on medium-high speed. The mixture will deflate and appear curdled. Continue beating until the frosting comes back together in a smooth and spreadable consistency. Slowly drizzle in the vanilla and leaf green food coloring while beating; beat until smooth and a vibrant green. (If the frosting is very soft or begins to break, refrigerate until set but still spreadable; beat until lightened before using.) To assemble the cake: Transfer the first cake to a cutting board and trim the edges with a serrated knife. Use a ruler to divide the cake into two 8-inch squares, two 3-inch squares and three 2-inch squares. Hold in the freezer while you cut the other cakes. Transfer the second cake to a cutting board and trim the edges with a serrated knife. Use a ruler to divide the cake into one 9-inch square, one 7-inch square, one 4-inch square and one 1-inch square. Hold in the freezer while you cut the other cake. Transfer the third cake to a cutting board and trim the edges with a serrated knife. Use a ruler to divide the cake into two 6-inch squares, three 5-inch squares and one 4-inch square. Reserve the scraps for another use. Spread a small amount of frosting onto a large cake board or cutting board to secure the cake. With a large offset spatula, carefully lift the 9-inch square onto the frosting. Spread a layer of frosting in the center of the cake, avoiding the corners. Place one 8-inch cake square on top of the first square, offsetting it slightly so that the corners of the 2 cakes do not line up. Spread some frosting in the middle of the second cake, avoiding the corners. Place the second 8-inch cake square on top, offsetting it so that the corners do not line up with either cake underneath it. Repeat this process with the remaining cake squares, working with progressively smaller squares and continuing to stack them in offset layers with frosting in between. Trim a wooden skewer to 10 inches and insert it through the cake from the top down to add support. Transfer the remaining frosting to a piping bag fitted with a small fluted tip. Pipe rows of separate leaves in a downward motion to cover the exposed tops of all the cakes, creating the illusion of pine needles; leave the sides bare. For the decorations: Dust the cake with the desiccated coconut and white nonpareils to give the appearance of snow. To make lights: Cut the gumdrops in half widthwise. Press the cut side of each gumdrop half into the bottom of a candy-coated chocolate to adhere. Press into the freshly piped frosting to make retro Christmas lights. For the star topper: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Lightly spray a 2 1/2-inch metal, star cookie cutter and a parchment-lined baking sheet with nonstick spray.<br> Put the cookie cutter on the baking sheet and fill with a single layer of the crushed mint candies. Bake until the candies have melted and filled the cutter, 4 to 6 minutes. Cool for 3 minutes, then unmold.<br> Before serving, place a birthday candle at the top of the cake with the star topper in front. Light the candle.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14831,&quot;No Fuss Fruit Pie 1 package (17.3 ounces) Pepperidge Farm?

Pour in only enough cold water to cover (about 3 quarts); too much will make the broth taste weak. Toss in the thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns, and allow it to slowly come to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 1 to 1? hours, partially covered, until the chicken is done. As it cooks, skim any impurities that rise to the surface; add a little more water if necessary to keep the chicken covered while simmering. Carefully remove the chicken to a cutting board. When its cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones; hand-shred the meat into a storage container. Carefully strain the stock through a fine sieve into another pot to remove the vegetable solids. Use the stock immediately or if you plan on storing it, place the pot in a sink full of ice water and stir to cool down the stock. Cover and refrigerate for up to one week or freeze. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 14833,&quot;Fried Zucchini 4 cups canola oil 1 cup toasted Italian breadcrumbs 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan 3 eggs 1 splash cold water 4 medium zucchini, washed, dried, ends trimmed, cut, lengthwise, into 10 wedges like pickles 2 cups flour, for dredging Kosher salt 1 tablespoon paprika, for dusting 1 lemon, cut into wedges Instructions: Pour the oil into a deep, heavy bottomed pot and heat to 350 degrees F. Make the breading mixture by combining the breadcrumbs, and Parmesan in a medium bowl. Mix to blend. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and the splash of water. Place the zucchini in a large bowl and season with salt. Toss to blend. Sprinkle lightly with flour (use a sieve) to dredge then toss to coat evenly - this will help the breading to stick. Submerge the zucchini in the eggs. Remove the pieces, 1 by 1, shaking off excess egg and them roll them in the breadcrumb mixture until they are coated on all sides. Transfer to a platter or baking sheet. When the oil comes up to temperature, test the oil by dropping in one piece of zucchini. It should rise to the surface fairly quickly, begin the bubble and fry gradually. Prepare a baking sheet fitted with a kitchen towel and a slotted spoon (or, alternatively, a spider) to remove the zucchini from the oil. Drop a few pieces of zucchini into the oil and gently swirl the oil as they fry. This swirling will allow the zucchini to move around a lot, assuring they fry more evenly on all sides. When they are light to medium brown, remove them with the spoon and lay them out on the kitchen towel to cool. Sprinkle with a touch of salt and paprika. Repeat. Serve immediately with lemon wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]&quot; 14834,&quot;Vegan Sweet Potato Casserole 2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and roughly chopped (about 5 medium potatoes) Kosher salt 1 cup canned unsweetened coconut milk 3 tablespoons packed vegan light brown sugar 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon Pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1/3 cup raw walnut halves and pieces 1/3 cup raw pecan halves 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup packed vegan light brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Kosher salt 3 tablespoons unrefined coconut oil, melted and cooled slightly Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. For the sweet potatoes: Put the sweet potatoes in a large pot and fill with enough water to cover by 2 inches.

Cover with water and a small microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high until the water is boiling, about 5 minutes (or add the onions to a small pot of water on the stove, bring to a boil, then turn off the heat). Let stand for 5 minutes, then drain. Stir in the vinegar and sugar. Chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to 3 hours. Combine the coriander, onion powder, and crushed peppercorns on a plate. Press the steak into the spices, turning to coat. Add the oil to a nonstick skillet and heat over medium heat. Sear the steak until it reaches the desired doneness, about 4 to 7 minutes on each side. Transfer to a cutting board. (The charred bits on the bottom of the pan add to this dish, but if the pan is burned heavily, it can be wiped out carefully, off the heat, with a triple layer of paper towels.) Add the beef stock and Worcestershire sauce to the pan (carefully, because it can splatter) and cook until it is reduced to a quarter of its original volume, about 2 tablespoons, after 3 to 4 minutes. Thinly slice the steak, return to the sauce, and toss. Remove from heat. To assemble: Brush one side of each pita with a little oil. Heat the pita, one at a time, oiled side down, in a hot skillet until slightly crisp but not brittle, about 1 minute each. Lay each pita on a 12-inch square of foil, crisp side down.

Spread onion, asparagus, zucchini, and cauliflower on a baking sheet lined with heavy duty aluminum foil (for easy cleanup) pour olive oil over and toss to coat (using your hands is easiest). Season with salt and pepper and roast until tender and slightly browned, about 25 to 35 minutes, checking periodically to make sure nothing burns. While the vegetables are roasting, make the sun-dried tomato dressing. Through the feed opening of a running blender, add scallions, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, and the fresh basil leaves. Add the vinegar and blend. Scrape down the sides and blend again until a paste is formed. Then, leaving the blender running, add the olive oil in a slow steady stream allowing the mixture to emulsify. Season the dressing with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the vegetables from the oven and transfer to a mixing bowl. Stir the cheese into the vegetables to allow it to melt slightly. Fold in peas and grape tomatoes. Mix with enough dressing to coat. (Do not feel compelled to use all of the dressing). Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with basil sprigs. Serve extra dressing on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 14875,&quot;Puffy Shrimp 16 to 20 large shrimp 1 cup whole milk 1 cup all-purpose flour 5 eggs 5 tablespoons Old Bay seasoning 1/2 cup hot pepper sauce 2 cups Japanese bread crumbs Vegetable oil for deep frying Instructions: Shell, devein, wash, and butterfly shrimp.

Also the hops, yeast, and Irish moss need to be kept refrigerated until use. Begin by sterilizing your equipment that you will use to boil the mash; the pot, metal spoon, probe of the probe thermometer, colander and strainer, including the fermenter. To sterilize everything put 2 ounces of non-scented household bleach and 3 to 4 gallons of water into the fermenter. Place other smaller items in the solution to soak. The items that are too large to fit into the fermenter can be sterilized by pouring the solution in the fermenter into and over these items and then thoroughly rinsing all equipment, including the fermenter. After sterilization is complete you can begin brewing beer by adding 2 gallons of spring water as well as the 1/2 pound milled grain to your pot and turn the burner on to medium high. Place the probe thermometer into the pot and set the temperature to 155 degrees, once the liquid reaches 155 degrees set a timer for 30 minutes. In the meantime soak the container of liquid malt extract in warm water; it will aid in removing it from the container. After the grain has cooked for 30 minutes add 1 gallon of water and the liquid malt extract and bring to a boil stirring so that the extract does not burn on the bottom until dissolved. The liquid will foam up to the top; when it does this, turn the heat off and let it settle then turn the heat back on and bring to a boil. Let it foam again and turn the heat off, let it settle and turn the heat back on and add the hops. Add 1-ounce of the Cascade hops and 3/4-ounce of Kent goldings hops and boil for 10 minutes. Next add 1/2 teaspoon Irish moss and boil for 5 minutes. Now add the last hops, 1-ounce Kent Goldings, cover, turn off the heat and let sit for 5 minutes. Meanwhile put the last gallon and 1 pint of water as well as the bag of ice into the fermenter and fit the top with the colander and mesh strainer. Strain the mash into the fementer and allow to cool to 80 degrees before pitching the yeast. Once the mash is cooled to 80 degrees it is now safe to add the yeast, shake the vial until the liquid is well mixed and then add to the fermenter. Cover with the lid and put airlock in place. Put into cool dark place to ferment for 7 to 10 days. Attach the siphon on the spigot and transfer beer from one fermenter to the second one. Add the sugar/water mixture. Bottle using the wand. Cap and place into a cool dark place for another 10 to 14 days. Open and enjoy. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 14877,&quot;Cheesy Asparagus Tart 4 tablespoons salted butter 2 large leeks, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper One 14-ounce package refrigerated rolled pie dough (2 crusts)<br> 2 cups grated fontina cheese 1 cup ricotta<br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 12 ounces asparagus, trimmed and chopped into 1-inch pieces<br> 1 large egg<br> Instructions: Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the leeks, then sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Unroll the two pie crusts and lay on a sheet pan so that the pieces overlap slightly. Trim the edges of the pastry where it rides up the sides of the sheet pan and press these trimmings into the bare areas so that you are left with a 10-by-16-inch pastry rectangle. Sprinkle over the fontina, leaving a 1-inch border, then top with the leeks. Dollop on the ricotta. Scatter the thyme and asparagus pieces over the ricotta and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Fold the uncovered pastry edge inwards to make a 1/2-inch border all the way around the tart, in the style of a galette. Whisk the egg with a splash of water in a small bowl. Brush it all around the pastry edge. Bake the tart until it is a deep golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. (If the crust is browning too fast, reduce the heat to 425 degrees F.) Remove the tart from the oven, then allow it to sit for 5 minutes.

Place half the spinach in a larger clean kitchen towel and wring out any excess moisture. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining spinach and transfer to the bowl. Melt 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) of the butter in a large high-sided skillet over medium heat. Add the scallions and garlic and cook, stirring, until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the flour and stir until smooth and lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Pour in the milk and add a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the spinach, remove from the heat and stir to combine. Transfer the spinach mixture back into the bowl. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Fold the feta, parsley and dill into the spinach mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the eggs.<br> Line the Bundt pan with phyllo: Melt the remaining 3 sticks butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Brush the inside of 10-cup metal Bundt pan with some of the butter.<br> Unfold the phyllo dough and cover with a large damp cloth. Working with 1 sheet at a time, line the Bundt pan with half of the phyllo, brushing each sheet with melted butter after placing it in the pan. Cover the entire bottom and up the sides of the pan with the sheets; they will overlap and hang over the edge of the pan. The hole in the middle of the pan will be covered. Fill the phyllo-lined pan with the spinach mixture and fold over the overhanging pieces of phyllo so they lie flat on top of the filling. Cover the filling with phyllo: Working with 1 sheet at a time, cover the filling with the remaining phyllo sheets, brushing each sheet with melted butter after placing it in the Bundt pan. The phyllo will hang over the edge of the pan and cover the hole in the center. Push any of the overhang down and along the inside of the pan. Cut away the phyllo covering the hole with a small paring knife. Put the Bundt pan on a baking sheet and bake until the pastry becomes slightly domed and deep golden brown, about 1 hour 15 minutes.

In the large bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter at medium-low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in the sugar at medium speed until well combined and slightly fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Lower mixer sped, gradually add the dry ingredients, and mix just until the mixture is thoroughly combined. Divide the dough in thirds. Roll out each portion of dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper to form a circle 11 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick. Leaving the dough circles between the sheets of waxed paper, stack them on a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm, for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days; or freeze, well wrapped, up to 1 month. Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line two large cool baking sheets with parchment paper. Remove one dough package at a time from refrigerator. Peel off top sheet of waxed paper, replace it loosely on top, and flip the entire package over. Peel off and discard the second sheet of waxed paper. Using a 1 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out circles in the dough. Using the narrow end of a 3/8-inch plain pastry tip (such as Ateco #3) as a cutter, cut out three small holes in each circle. Space the cookies 1/2 inch apart on a baking sheet. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until the cookies are pale golden, no longer appear raw or shiny, and feel slightly firm (lightly touch a few). Place baking sheet on wire rack to cool 5 minutes. Lift the cookies from the parchment with a metal spatula to a rack to cool. Repeat with the other two portions of dough, cutting out holes in only one-quarter of these circle in order to sandwich the cookies later. Keep in mind that when there is a mixture of cookies with and without holes, the cookies with holes bake faster. Remove them from the oven with a metal spatula to a wire rack. Return the baking sheet to the oven until the remaining cookies are done. Decoration: Using a sieve, dust the powdered sugar just over the tops of the cookies with holes. In a small saucepan, boil the currant jelly for 2 minutes to evaporate some of its liquid. Cool just until warm. Spoon about 1/4 teaspoon jelly on each plain circle, baked-bottom side up. Center a sugared circle on top of a jellied bottom, and gently press so the jelly fills in the three holes. Repeat with the remaining cookies. Stack undecorated cookies in an airtight metal contained and store at room temperature up to 10 days.

Press the potatoes through a ricer into the bowl. Add the Parmesan, butter, chives, parsley, nutmeg, cayenne, salt, and black pepper, to taste. Mix gently with a rubber spatula until evenly combined. Using your hands, form the potato mixture into ovals a bit smaller than the size of an egg, and then flatten slightly. Press a cube of Gorgonzola into the center of the oval and pack the potato mixture around the cheese until it forms a smooth, egg-shaped ball. Continue until all the potato mixture is used up. Beat the remaining egg in a shallow plate. Put the breadcrumbs in another shallow dish and set it next to the egg. Roll a croquette in the egg until coated, then in the breadcrumbs, and place it on a clean plate. Repeat with the remaining croquettes. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Pour enough vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed skillet to reach a depth of 1/4 inch. Heat the oil over medium heat, and fry the croquettes a few at a time, turning, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and salt to taste. Repeat with the remaining croquettes.

Heat the milk, butter, and salt over medium heat until scalded. When the butter is melted, add the flour all at once and beat it with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together and forms a dough. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat for 2 minutes. The flour will begin to coat the bottom of the pan. Dump the hot mixture into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Add the eggs and pulse until the eggs are incorporated into the dough and the mixture is thick. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large plain round tip. Pipe in mounds 1 1/2 inches wide and 1-inch high onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. You should have about 18 puffs. With a wet finger, lightly press down the swirl at the top of each puff. (You can also use 2 spoons to scoop out the mixture and shape the puffs with damp fingers.) Bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly browned, then turn off the oven and allow them to sit for another 10 minutes, until they sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Make a small slit in the side of each puff to allow the steam to escape. Set aside to cool. For the chocolate sauce, place the cream and chocolate chips in a bowl set over simmering water and stir just until the chocolate melts. Add the honey and coffee and stir until smooth. Set aside.

Wrap a piece of thin masking tape horizontally around the watermelon about 1/2 inch above where the stem was. Wrap 2 more pieces over the top at the center to make a band/handle for the basket that is 1 1/2 inches wide. Using the tape as a guide, cut out the wedges that remain on either side of the handle to make a basket shape, down to the horizontal tape. Scoop out 4 cups of watermelon balls using a melon baller and reserve. Remove the remaining watermelon flesh and save for another use. Use a paring knife to trim the flesh from the handle to create a small, neat strip of melon. Use a spoon to do the same for the inside of the basket. Freeze the basket for at least 3 hours. Refrigerate the watermelon balls. Put 3 cups of the watermelon balls in the bottom of the basket. Scoop balls of sorbet and arrange on top of the watermelon.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the bacon slices in a single layer on top. Bake until the bacon is golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping once halfway through. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate to absorb any excess fat and let cool. Crumble cooled bacon. Discard the parchment and pour off the remaining excess bacon drippings from the baking sheet, leaving only a thin coating of fat on the baking sheet. Reserve the poured-off drippings. Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F. Toss the fingerling potatoes with 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place the potatoes cut-side-down on the baking sheet in a crowded single layer. Bake until the potatoes just start to brown, 15 minutes, then flip and continue to bake until cooked through, golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes more. Remove the potatoes from the oven and place the baking sheet on a heat-safe surface. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to push the potatoes together so that they are all touching but remain in a single layer. Sprinkle the potatoes with the cheese and bacon, return to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to a platter with a large spatula. Top with dollops of sour cream and the scallions. Finish by squeezing the lemon over the top.

Bring the mixture to a boil over low heat and season generously with salt. Take the seasoning to the edge of too salty. To do this you must taste as you go. Polenta acts as a salt eraser, if you don&#39;t season abundantly here you will never recover from it. Once the liquid is at a boil and is seasoned appropriately, sprinkle in the polenta, whisking constantly. Once the polenta is combined, switch over to a wooden spoon and stir frequently until the polenta has become thick. Taste the polenta to see if it has cooked through. If it still feels mealy and grainy, add some more milk or water and cook it to a thick consistency. Repeat this process, as needed, until the polenta feels smooth on your tongue, about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and stir in the sage and mascarpone. Line a 7 by 7-inch square pan with plastic wrap. Pour the polenta into the prepared pan. Cover the top with more plastic wrap smoothed onto the surface of the polenta. Chill in the refrigerator until needed. (All of this can totally be done ahead of time, like yesterday! Cool!) For the sauce: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the sausage in the oven and roast for 15 minutes. In a food processor, puree the onions, fennel, celery, and garlic until it becomes a coarse paste. Season with salt and give a sprinkle of crushed red pepper. When the sausage is roasted, remove it from the oven and coarsely chop. Coat a wide, deep pot with olive oil and add the pureed veggies. Cook the veggies until they start to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the white wine and reduce by half. Toss in the chopped sausage and the tomato puree. Taste and season with salt, if needed. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove the polenta from the pan and cut into desired shapes. Coat a nonstick saute pan with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot and starting to smoke just a little, add the polenta shapes. Cook the polenta on both sides and finish by sprinkling with the Parmigiano. Transfer a few polenta cakes to a plate and top with the sausage sauce. Sprinkle with more grated Parmigiano. Place the pork shoulder in a bowl and keep cold until ready to use. Fill a large bowl with ice and place the bowl with the pork shoulder on top. Season the pork with garlic, salt, fennel seed, crushed red pepper, and coriander. Mix to combine well. Grind the pork shoulder twice through a grinding disk with large holes. Grind the meat into the bowl sitting on ice. Cook a small amount of the meat mixture to test for seasoning. Add more spices and salt, if needed. Thoroughly mix in a splash of cold water. Allow the seasoned pork to chill on ice or in the fridge before stuffing into the casing. Replace the grinder attachment with the horn. (Be sure to thoroughly clean the attachment area before proceeding.) Rub oil onto the horn, and then put the casing on, leaving a few inches of slack at the end. Stuff the casing, tie off the ends, and prick the sausage with a pin or the tip of a knife. Refrigerate the sausage until ready to cook. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Dolcetto]&quot; 14931,&quot;Curried Chicken Salad 3 whole (6 split) chicken breasts, bone-in, skin-on Olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups good mayonnaise (recommended: Hellman&#39;s) 1/3 cup dry white wine 1/4 cup chutney (recommended: Major Grey&#39;s) 3 tablespoons curry powder 1 cup medium-diced celery (2 large stalks) 1/4 cup chopped scallions, white and green parts (2 scallions) 1/4 cup raisins 1 cup whole roasted, salted cashews Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the chicken breasts on a sheet pan and rub the skin with olive oil. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the meat from the bones, discard the skin, and dice the chicken into large bite-size pieces. For the dressing, combine the mayonnaise, wine, chutney, curry powder, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Process until smooth. Combine the chicken with enough dressing to moisten well. Add the celery, scallions, and raisins, and mix well. Refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend.
