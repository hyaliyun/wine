The wine is exceptionally pure and delicious, rich in black currant, chocolate, black cherry and lots of toasty new French oak. The all-important tannins are exquisitely ripe and as fine as velvet. Nowhere near ready, this wine wants a good eight years in the cellar, and will gradually evolve through the mid-2020s, at the very least.","designation":"Bone Ash Vineyard"},{"country":"es","description":"Among bone-dry Cavas, this is one of the best in es.

Tangerine and bell pepper flavors on the finish are fitting.","designation":"Castillo de Molina Reserva"},{"country":"it","description":"Syrah from central Tuscany? Sure. The '98 version of Colvecchio, an offering from a hot year, is leaner than might be expected and short on dimension.

The effort is there and the fruit seems sound, but tartness is the overriding impression it leaves.","designation":"Colvecchio"},{"country":"za","description":"Plum and rose on the nose introduces this beautiful blend from De Toren, and on the palate, it shows ample structure and firm tannins with a shock of acidity that brings freshness to the overall flavor profile.

Good length; should pair well with oysters on the half-shell.","designation":"Scuttlehole"},{"country":"cl","description":"Harmonious aromas of cassis, vanilla and mocha are inviting. The palate, however, seems narrow and high in acidity; it's grinding and choppy, with herbal, tangy flavors of berry and cassis mixed with tobacco and herbs.

A very good wine but not the best Le Dix by any means.","designation":"Le Dix de Los Vascos"},{"country":"us","description":"The melon, apple and pear aromas aren't as distinctively Viognier as one might expect, but the wine itself is solid and satisfying. The flavor profile is spicy and melony, and feel-wise there's lots of size. (This whopper weighs in at 14.9%, so it should seem big.)  A large, chewy yet mildly buttery finish seals the package as full bodied and rich.","designation":"Del Rio"},{"country":"us","description":"Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice.

It's a deceptive wine, so rich and flamboyant in sweet, jammy blackberries and cherries, chocolate and licorice, you want to drink the whole bottle.

That fruity appeal carries on right across the palate where it is supported by a lemony wave of frothy enlivening fizz. A tinge of autolysis adds seriousness and depth.

The acidity is perfectly balanced against the wine's soft fruit.","designation":"Riserva"},{"country":"de","description":"Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Fr√ºhburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir.

The light yet grippy texture is stunning.","designation":"Los Alamos Vineyard"},{"country":"es","description":"Lustau calls it dry but Los Arcos definitely has some aromatic and palate sweetness. The nose settles on brown sugar, peach, mixed nuts and honey. It's not super tight or acidic, and thus the palate drips maple and molasses. Medium-bodied and balanced, but with that shot of sugar offset by honest but mellow acids.","designation":"Dry Amontillado Los Arcos"},{"country":"es","description":"Right from the start, this is all about oak and not about quality fruit, balance or subtlety.

Year after year, Fagus smells and tastes like this: it's time for a reboot.","designation":"Fagus Selecci√≥n Especial"},{"country":"cl","description":"Hickory and other resiny aromas dominate the nose, and oak is the major player from start to finish. If you like a thick Chardonnay weighted down with cinnamon, resin and extract, then this is it. But to us it's overoaked and borderline cloying. It just doesn't have that natural fresh-fruit touch; seems overmanipulated. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.","designation":"Reserva de Familia"},{"country":"us","description":"Herb and clove wrap around strong, structured tannin in this pretty wine from a cool region of the Napa Valley.

Flavors of white pepper, citrus and celery are modest on the finish, which tastes briny.","designation":"Reserve"},{"country":"us","description":"The Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest is consistently the most broadly fruity, round and oaky wine in the lineup (outside of the much pricier reserve).

Hold for up to six years.","designation":"Ledbetter Family Vineyard"},{"country":"it","description":"Aromas recall yellow pear and tropical fruit together with a touch of vanilla. The palate offers pineapple, citrus zest and Golden Delicious apple alongside bright acidity.","designation":"Ritratti Del Diaol"},{"country":"fr","description":"From 100% grand cru Chardonnay vineyards in the C√¥te des Blancs, this is a rich but almost bone-dry wine.

Impressive, this would benefit from six months' aging.","designation":"R√©serve Blanc de Blancs Brut"},{"country":"es","description":"Toffee and almond aromas are a touch aggressive and hot.

This carries a slight chemical flavor as it moves along, while honey and brown-sugar notes sweeten things up. A chunky, obtuse finish feels sticky due to mild acidity.","designation":"Vendimia Tardia Single Vineyard"},{"country":"us","description":"A consistent bottling from an iconic Virginia producer, this vintage is refined in fruit character yet powerful in its focus. Aromas of citrus, sea spray and white button mushroom seem to have been shot through a diffuser‚Äîpenetrating, broad and refreshing. The medium weight of the palate carries from start to finish along a river of driving acidity, with Meyer lemon, tangy almond cream and lightly toasted praline filling in the midpalate. A resounding note of sea salt lingers on the finish.","designation":"Hardscrabble"},{"country":"us","description":"While five years from harvest, this bold, penetrating Merlot is still a baby, with a long, promising future ahead. Subtle whiffs of crisp red cherry and mushroom seem quiet on the nose, but the palate is deeply concentrated.
