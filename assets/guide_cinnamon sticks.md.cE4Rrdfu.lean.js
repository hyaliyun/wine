Grill the hot dogs until nice and charred on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Butter the cut sides of the hoagie roll halves and grill, cut side-down, until charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Using a skewer or the tip of a small paring knife, poke about 10 holes in the bottom of a TK pan. Spray the entire pan with nonstick cooking spray (this is an important step). Now, layer in this order: one-third each of the charred hot dogs, Cheddar, provolone and salami. Repeat the layers 2 more times, making sure to finish with a layer of salami. Make sure that every layer is a snug fit, like you would a lasagna. Put the pan on the grill and close the lid. Grill until the cheese has melted, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the grill and let rest for about 5 minutes. Run a paring knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the loaf. Turn the pan out onto a cutting board, unveiling the hot dog loaf. Slice the loaf crosswise into 6 pieces, just as you would a meatloaf. To build your sandwich: start with your hot dog loaf on the bottom bun, then top with mustard, lettuce, tomato and a sprinkling of celery salt.

Pour the melted chocolate out onto the prepared cookie sheet. Spread evenly into an 1/8-inch-thick rectangle. Sprinkle with the cookies and drizzle the Sorghum Caramel over the top. Sprinkle with salt. Gently pick up the pan and drop it on the counter a couple of times. This will help the ingredients settle into themselves. Leave the bar to cool at room temperature, about 1 hour. Break into irregular 3-inch pieces. Fill a glass with ice water and set aside. Combine the sugar, sorghum and butter in a saucepan and heat over medium until the butter melts, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk, bring to a simmer and cook about 1 minute. Lower the heat and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until a soft ball forms when the caramel is dropped in the glass of ice water or the temperature reads 240 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 20 minutes. Let the mixture stand for 5 minutes before using. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]</li></ol><p>&quot; 67531,&quot;Chicken Fried Lamb with White Wine Pan Gravy 2 pounds boneless leg of lamb (or shoulder), trimmed of excess fat 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 whole egg, plus more if needed, for dredging 1/4 cup vegetable oil, for cooking 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1/2 cup dry white wine 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 2 cups vegetable stock 1/2 cup whole milk 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves (3 to 4 sprigs) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. For the lamb: Cut the meat with the grain into 1/2-thick slices. Season each piece on both sides with the salt and pepper. Place the flour in a pie pan and mix in the garlic powder and cayenne pepper. Place the eggs in a separate pie pan and beat. Dredge the meat on both sides in the egg, and then the flour. Repeat with all the meat pieces. (Reserve the remaining flour for the pan gravy.) Place the meat on a plate and allow it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes before cooking. Place enough of the vegetable oil to cover the bottom of a 12-inch skillet and set over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the meat in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Cook each piece on both sides until golden brown, approximately 4 minutes on each side. Remove the lamb to a wire rack set in a half sheet pan and place in the oven to stay warm while the other pieces are being prepared. Repeat until all the meat is browned. For the gravy: Add the vegetable oil to the pan. Add the white wine to deglaze the pan and reduce by half. Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the reserved flour. Then whisk in the Dijon mustard and the vegetable stock. Continue to whisk until the gravy comes to a boil and begins to thicken. Add the milk and thyme and whisk until the gravy coats the back of a wooden spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, if needed. Serve over the lamb steaks. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Gavi]&quot; 67532,&quot;Low Carb Cannoli Parfaits 1-ounce unsweetened chocolate, chopped 1/2 cup sugar substitute (recommended: Splenda) 1 tablespoon hot water 1 tablespoon heavy cream 1 cup heavy cream 1/3 cup sugar substitute (recommended: Splenda) 1/4 teaspoon real almond extract 1 teaspoon no sugar added vanilla extract 1/3 cup whole milk ricotta cheese Instructions: Place the unsweetened chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt over a saucepan of simmering water. Whisk in sugar substitute and thin with the hot water and heavy cream. Whisk to blend thoroughly. Remove from heat, spread on a plate, and place in the freezer for about 10 minutes. Cut into small chunks after chilling. While the chocolate is chilling, make the cannoli cream. With an electric mixer on high, whip heavy cream just until frothy, and then add sugar substitute and almond and vanilla extracts. Continue to whip on high until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over-whip, or cream will break. Gently fold in the ricotta cheese and almost all of the chilled chocolate chunks, saving a few chips for garnish. Spoon cannoli cream into parfait glasses, top with remaining chocolate chips, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Prosecco, Moscato, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67533,&quot;Corned Beef and Cabbage Grilled Cheese 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more if needed 1 small onion, thinly sliced 1 tablespoon sugar Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br> 3/4 cup dark beer (preferably porter) 2 ounces deli-sliced corned beef, cut into strips 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard 1 1/2 cups grated jarlsberg cheese (about 6 ounces) 4 slices marble rye bread 1/2 cup sauerkraut, drained and rinsed Instructions: Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sprinkle with the sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden, about 10 minutes. Add the beer and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender and the liquid is slightly syrupy, about 8 more minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the corned beef, Worcestershire sauce and mustard.<br> Divide half of the cheese between 2 bread slices; top with the corned beef mixture, and the remaining cheese. Close the sandwiches with the remaining 2 bread slices. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sandwiches and cook, pressing occasionally with a spatula, until the bread is toasted and the cheese melts, about 4 minutes per side, adding more butter to the pan if needed.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Gouda]&quot; 67534,&quot;Pan-Grilled Lamb Shoulder Chops 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Four 8- to 12-ounce lamb shoulder chops Instructions: To make the marinade: whisk the lemon juice, mustard, rosemary, garlic, and 1 teaspoon of the salt together in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in the oil and season with pepper. Transfer the marinade to a large sealable plastic bag. Put the lamb chops in the bag, seal, and shake vigorously to evenly coat the meat. Marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours and up to 12. Remove the chops from the marinade and transfer them to a plate. Discard the marinade. Using a spoon, lightly scrape the remaining marinade off the chops and pat them dry. Preheat a large cast-iron grill pan over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high. Season the chops with salt. Place 2 chops on the grill pan, and cook until the chops have distinctive grill marks, about 3 minutes. To make crosshatched grill marks, re-position the chops, moving them about 45 degrees on the ridged pan, and continue to cook about 3 minutes more. (The chops will have only cooked on one side at this point.) Set the chops aside and repeat with the remaining 2 chops. Return the first set of chops to the pan to cook them on the other side. Reduce the heat to medium low, and cook the chops until medium-rare, about 2 minutes. Repeat with the other chops. Let the chops rest for about 5 minutes and serve.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo]&quot; 67535,&quot;Red Grape Gazpacho 2 cups red seedless grapes 1 1/2 cups chopped peeled seedless cucumbers (from 3 Persian cucumbers) 1 1/2 cups cubed baguette or rustic country bread, crust removed 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar 1/2 small clove garlic Kosher salt Crushed pink peppercorns, for topping Instructions: Puree the grapes, cucumber, bread, olive oil, 2 tablespoons water, the vinegar, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt in a blender until very smooth, at least 1 minute. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. Season the gazpacho with salt. Divide among small bowls.

Place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator. To make the molds, place the cup in the center of a piece of cellophane and bring the cellophane up the walls of the glass. Fold it over the rim, stuffing the excess inside the glass. This will make loose pleats around the glass. Adjust the cellophane so the pleats are not too tight, otherwise the chocolate may break when you try to peel the cellophane from it. Make extra molds in case you have breakage.<br> Hold the rim of the cello wrapped glass and dip it in the melted chocolate as deep in as you want the chocolate cup to be. Remove it from the chocolate, turn it upside down, and place it on a sheet pan in the refrigerator. Allow to chill and harden for 1 hour or more.<br> Remove the glasses from the refrigerator one at a time. Use a sharp scissors to trim around cellophane just below the rim. Try to avoid touching the chocolate with your fingers, as it will melt instantly. Pull the cellophane towards and against the glass to support the chocolate while you remove it from the glass. Hold the cup at the base with your left hand (if your hands are warm hold the cup with a piece of waxed paper) and with your right hand pull the cellophane down and away from the chocolate and into the center of the cup. Snip off the excess cellophane.<br> Place the cup back in the refrigerator for now while you trim the rest of the cups. Once they&#39;re all trimmed, remove them one at a time. Keep in a covered container to avoid condensation until ready to use. Fill with mousse, pudding, fruit, ice cream, or any cold item you desire. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67537,&quot;Grilled Ham, Cheese and Mushroom Sandwiches 2 to 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 10-ounce package white mushrooms, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley and/or chives Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 8 slices crusty bread Dijon or whole-grain mustard, for spreading 1/3 pound white cheddar cheese (about 8 slices) 1/2 pound deli-sliced ham (8 to 12 slices) 1/3 pound muenster cheese (about 8 slices) Instructions: Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When very hot, add 1/2 tablespoon butter and half of the mushrooms; cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with 1/2 tablespoon more butter and the remaining mushrooms; transfer to the bowl. Add the herbs to the bowl and toss; season with salt and pepper. Wipe out the skillet. Build the sandwiches: Spread each slice of bread with mustard and sandwich with the cheddar, ham, mushroom mixture and muenster. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over low heat.

Remove the sauce from the heat and place into a food processor or blender and puree. Strain the sauce and set aside. Preheat grill over medium-high heat. Place the ribs onto the grill and brush with sauce. This will glaze the ribs while they cook. The blueberries add a subtle sweetness to the sauce to play off the heat of the chiles and the acid of the vinegar. &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Zinfandel, Tempranillo]&quot; 67539,&quot;Chiles Rellenos 6 poblano chiles 8 ounces Oaxacan-style string cheese, mozzarella, or Monterey Jack 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dredging 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon fine salt, plus more for sprinkling 1 (12-ounce) bottle or can lager-style beer Vegetable oil, for deep-frying Mexican Tomato Sauce, warm, recipe follows 2 pounds ripe tomatoes, cored and roughly chopped 1/4 medium yellow onion 6 cloves garlic 5 sprigs fresh coriander (cilantro) 1 serrano cl (with seeds) 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (preferably Mexican) Instructions: To prepare the chiles:<br> Position a rack on the upper most shelf of the broiler element and preheat. Put the chiles on a foil-lined broiler pan and broil, turning occasionally with tongs, until the skin is charred, about 10 minutes. Transfer the chiles to a bowl, cover, and cool for 10 minutes.<br> Carefully rub the charred skin off the chiles. Using a small knife, make a lengthwise slit along the side of each cl to form a pocket. Carefully cut out and discard the seeds.<br> Cut the cheese into 6 (1/4-inch-thick) slabs, about 3/4 the length of each cl (your chiles probably vary in length, so tailor the cheese to the chiles). Slip the cheese pieces into the pocket of each cl so they&#39;re 2/3 full. (If the cheese protrudes from the chiles, just cut a little off.) \\Sew\\ each cl shut with a wooden skewer or long toothpick. (The skewers should be longer than the chiles, so they can be easily pulled out after frying.)<br> Whisk the flour, baking powder, cumin, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the beer to a make a smooth batter.<br> In a large, wide, heavy-bottomed pot, pour in the oil to a depth of about 3 inches. Heat over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 365 degrees F.<br> Put the flour for dredging on a plate. Working in 2 batches, dredge the chiles in the flour (the dampness of the chiles creates a light paste with the flour that seals over any tears), dip in the batter, and carefully add to the oil. Fry, turning the chiles once, until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per batch. Using tongs, transfer the chiles rellenos to a dry paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Sprinkle with salt, to taste. Gently pull out and discard the skewers.<br> Heat the sauce. Spoon some of the sauce on a plate and set 1 cl relleno on top. Repeat with the remaining sauce and chiles.

Reduce the heat to low and keep the cream warm. In a large high-sided saucepan over medium-high heat, dissolve the sugar with 2 tablespoons of water. As the sugar mixture begins to bubble, watch for crystals developing on the inside of the pan just above the liquid. Using a pastry brush dipped in water, brush the inside of the pan right above the crystals so the water drips down and dissolves the crystals back into the liquid. When the sugar begins to brown, occasionally move the pan to swirl the liquid gently and cook it evenly. Continue to cook until the mixture is dark golden brown. The total cooking time will be 8 to 9 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Very carefully add the hot cream to the sugar mixture a few tablespoons at a time. The liquid will bubble up dramatically. Stir the sauce and cook for 1 minute. Add the vinegar, lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt, mix well. Pour into a heatproof bowl. You should have about 1 1/4 cups of sauce. The sauce can be made several weeks ahead, covered with plastic, and stored either at room temperature or in the refrigerator. If refrigerated, warm in a microwave oven before using.

Toss the parsnips with the oil and 1 teaspoon of salt and drizzle with 3 tablespoons honey. Place on a baking sheet and put into the top half of the oven. Roast 30 minutes, or until the parsnips are a deep golden brown; they tend to burn easily so make sure to toss often while roasting. Meanwhile, put the water into a large pot and place over high heat. Lay a double layer of cheesecloth on a flat surface and place the carrot, onion, parsley, bay leaves and peppercorns in the center. Tie the cheesecloth up and around the vegetable and herb mix and drop it into the water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the parsnips from the oven and place them immediately into the stock. Add the remaining honey and salt and white pepper; simmer for about 20 minutes. Puree with an immersion blender, or in batches in a blender. Add the cream and cook for another 10 minutes or until thick. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Gris]&quot; 67554,&quot;Yorkshire Popovers 2 eggs 1 cup milk 1 cup flour 1/2 teaspoon salt Fresh cracked pepper 1/4 cup reserved beef drippings or melted butter Instructions: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, uncover and let cool completely. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Gently add the eggs and cook for 7 minutes. Remove the eggs and transfer to a bowl of ice water; let stand until cool to the touch. Once the eggs have cooled, lightly crack the shells all over. The goal here is to make enough cracks to allow the flavor of the soy sauce mixture to steep into the egg. (You can also put them on a kitchen towel and roll gently.) Add the cracked eggs to the soy sauce mixture, making sure they are completely submerged. Refrigerate for 24 hours. Peel the eggs. Cut a small piece off the wide bottom of each egg so it will sit flat, then cut off the top. Scoop out the egg yolks into a small bowl and mash them up with a fork. Stir in the mayonnaise, mustard, Sriracha, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Tint orange with food coloring. Pipe or scoop the filling into the egg whites. Sprinkle with black sesame seeds.

Add the curry paste and cook, stirring, just until a fond forms on the bottom of the pan, about 2 minutes, being careful not to burn the aromatics. When the curry paste is a crimson red, stir in the roasted red peppers and tomatoes. Add the coconut milk, bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce is reduced, pale orange and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the lime leaves. Carefully transfer the sauce to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and season with salt to taste. (For a thicker sauce, cook a few minutes more to further reduce.) Make the hotdish: Preheat the oven to 425? F. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork, season with salt and pepper and cook, breaking up the meat, until no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, toss the onion and root vegetables with the olive oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast until just tender but still with a little bite, 12 to 15 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375? F. In a large bowl, combine the pork, roasted vegetables and 2 cups of the curry sauce; the mixture should have the consistency of a stew. Transfer to a 3-quart casserole dish, packing the mixture down, then scatter the tater tots evenly on top.<br> Bake until the tater tots are golden and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Once out of the oven, top the hotdish with cilantro, scallions and lime wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67561,&quot;Gingerbread Birdhouse 2 cups shortening 4 sticks (1 pound) unsalted butter 14 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 2 cups sugar 1/3 cup ground ginger 3 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon fine salt 3 cups dark corn syrup 2 1/2 tablespoons pure vanilla extract All-purpose flour, for rolling out the dough One recipe Royal Icing Cornstarch and vinegar or confectioners&#39; sugar, to thicken Royal Icing Candy for decorating, optional Instructions: Make the basic gingerbread house cookie dough Melt the shortening and butter together in a medium saucepan. Let cool. Sift the flour, sugar, ginger, cinnamon and salt into a large bowl. Mix the melted butter into the flour mixture with an electric mixer until sandy. Add the corn syrup and vanilla, and mix until evenly incorporated, but still crumbly in texture. Press the dough together by hand and divide into 8 equal parts. Press into rough squares about 1 inch thick. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. Place the dough on top of a flour-dusted sheet of parchment. Roll a square of dough about 1/4-inch thick and into an 8- by 11-inch rectangle. Repeat with all the remaining squares. Stack them up and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Cut the pieces: Meanwhile, click here to e-mail a link of the template to your desktop or laptop computer for printing. Print the file at 100% on letter size paper and cut out the pieces. Remove the top sheet of parchment from the dough. Lay the templates on the rolled dough slabs and cut out all the pieces with a long, sharp knife or pizza cutter. (You will have a total of 8 cut panels plus 3 extra sheets for cookies. Cut out the remaining dough with cookie cutters of your choice.) Use a 1 1/2-inch circle cookie cutter to cut the hole for the door opening into one of the tall walls. Stack panels on a cookie sheet and chill 45 minutes to set. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and position the oven racks evenly. Bake the gingerbread shapes until they are a rich tawny brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack. With a fine kitchen rasp, file the panels to make all the edges straight. Thicken some royal icing: Thicken about 2 cups of the Royal Icing with either cornstarch and a couple of drops of vinegar, or extra confectioners&#39; sugar, to get the consistency of caulk. Fit a pastry bag with a medium round tip and fill it with the thickened icing. Put up a wall: Pipe a generous amount of royal icing along the bottom and the sides of a short wall. Center the wall 3/4 inch from one edge, directly onto the base. Use a box or can to help support the walls while they dry. Put up other walls: Pipe royal icing along the bottom of a tall wall, and stick it to the base with an edge pressed against the icing on the first wall. Repeat with the remaining two walls in the same manner until the four walls are up, making an open box with a 3/4-inch border all around the base. (The two tall walls will face each other.) Allow the icing to dry completely, about 24 hours, before attaching the roof. Attach the roof: Ice the sloped edges on one side of the house and attach the big roof piece. (Line up the top of the roof with the peaks of the tall walls.) Use a box or can to prop up the overhang of the roof while it dries in place. Attach the smaller roof piece on the other side of the slope (prop it up with a box or can) leaving the same amount of overhang. Leave the top open for now. The last roof panel is the lid and will go there when all is dry. Pipe royal icing neatly on the outside of the seams to secure them, and allow the house to dry for 24 hours. Decorate: Fit tips into piping bags. Divide the remaining royal icing into batches and color as desired. Fill bags with frosting and decorate the house and roof with icing and candies if using. Allow to dry. Fill the house with cookies. Rest the remaining roof slab on the house to make a lid.

Whip egg whites in an electric mixer until soft peaks form, then slowly add the remaining sugar and whip until stiff peaks form. Fold yolks and whites together. Sift flour over the egg mixture and fold in. Do not overmix. Line a 9 by 9-inch baking pan with greaseproof paper, then grease the sides and the paper. Pour batter into the pan and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove cake from oven. Allow to cool slightly and turn cake out onto a cooling rack. Cool completely. Cut the cake using a 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter into 4 circles. Place them in the empty 9 by 9-inch pan until the syrup and vanilla custard are ready. Make the custard: Combine the vanilla bean and milk in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. In a stainless steel bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Pour boiling milk over egg yolks. Whisk together. Return to the sauce pan and simmer until thickened. Be careful not to overcook the mixture. While custard is still warm, pour over the biscuit circles. Make the syrup: Bring sugar and water to the boil. Add kirsch. Pour half over the biscuit circles. Reserve the other half. Make the meringue: Prepare a medium saucepan with water and the milk. Bring to the boil then reduce to a simmer. Whip egg whites in an electric mixer to soft peaks. Slowly add the sugar and continue whipping until stiff peaks are formed. Take two tablespoons and form spoonfuls of meringue into balls. Drop into the simmering liquid and poach the meringue for 4 minutes. Do not let mixture boil. Allow to cool on a paper towel. Make a total of 12 meringue balls. Make raspberry sauce: Puree the raspberries, sugar and liqueur. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons reserved sugar syrup if necessary to correct consistency. Strain sauce. Assemble dessert: Place soaked biscuit in the center of a serving plate. Arrange beautifully the raspberries into a pyramid-like shape. Arrange 3 pieces poached meringue on the top of the raspberries. Drizzle the raspberries around the edge of the plate. Optional: bake biscuit in 4 individual savarin molds and fill with ice cream or sorbet and build raspberries around the outside. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscato]</li></ol><p>&quot; 67576,&quot;Melting Chocolate Glass Dessert Butter, for the cake pan 100 grams (1/2 cup) superfine sugar<br> 3 tablespoons golden syrup<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 50 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) superfine sugar 50 grams (1/2 cup) ground almonds<br> 30 grams (3 tablespoons) all-purpose flour 20 grams (2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons) cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 35 grams (2 1/2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted and cooled 135 grams (4.8 ounces) 70% dark chocolate 2 scoops vanilla ice cream 4 to 5 fresh raspberries<br> 1/2 cup salted caramel sauce, heated (or chocolate sauce, if you prefer) Instructions: For the salted honeycomb: Butter a 7-inch round cake pan. Heat the sugar and golden syrup in a pan over medium heat until the sugar melts and the mixture reaches a deep amber color, about 2 minutes. Immediately remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the baking soda and salt. The mixture will bubble up vigorously, but once it settles, pour it immediately into the buttered cake pan. Allow the mixture to set for 1 hour, then break into small chunks. For the chocolate soil: Preheat the oven to 160 degrees C/320 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone mat. Sieve the sugar, almonds, flour, cocoa powder and salt into a large bowl. Pour in the melted butter and beat together with a wooden spoon. Transfer the mixture to the lined baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Allow to cool, then use your hands to break the mixture into a fine crumb. For the chocolate disc: Finely chop about 3 1/4 ounces of the chocolate, leaving the remaining chocolate in one piece. Over a double boiler on low heat, melt the finely chopped chocolate until it reaches 47 degrees C/116 degrees F on a digital thermometer. Immediately remove the bowl from the heat and add the remaining chocolate piece (it acts as an ice cube to cool the chocolate down). Stir the mixture together until it cools to 31 degrees C/87 degrees F, then remove any remaining lumps of chocolate. Spread the mixture onto a silicone mat or piece of parchment paper and allow to cool for 2 minutes. Use a 3-inch cookie cutter (or any cookie cutter that is slightly bigger than the rim of your clear serving glasses) and cut out 2 circles. Allow the chocolate to set in the fridge for 5 minutes. For serving: To assemble, in the bottom of each of 2 clear serving glasses, place 3 to 4 tablespoons of chocolate soil. Add 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream, some fresh raspberries and shards of honeycomb to each. Place a chocolate disc on top of each and pour some caramel sauce over the discs to reveal the dessert underneath! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 67577,&quot;Apricot Glazed Lamb 1 rack of lamb 1/4 cup olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper 3 tablespoons canola oil, plus 3 teaspoons 1 cup apricot preserves 2 tablespoons stone-ground mustard 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs 1 tablespoon freshly chopped tarragon leaves 1 tablespoon freshly chopped rosemary leaves 1 tablespoon freshly chopped thyme leaves Instructions: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Remove from the liquid with a slotted spoon before using. Coat a large, wide, deep pan with olive oil and bring to a high heat. Pat the chicken skin dry with paper towels and season generously with salt. Add the chicken, skin side down, to the pan?you should hear a big sizzle as the thighs hit the pan. Do not try to move the chicken; the skin will stick itself to the bottom of the pan and will unstick itself when it is ready. If the pan is smoking excessively, turn the burner down and continue cooking. When the skin is brown and crispy, turn the chicken over and brown it on the other side. Remove the chicken from the pan and reserve. Lower the heat if you have not already done so and ditch most of the excess fat from the pan. Add the pancetta, and brown. When the pancetta has started to get brown and crispy, add the onions. Sprinkle with salt and crushed red pepper, and sweat over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Add the assorted mushrooms, including the porcinis, season with salt and saute until they release their juices, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the white wine and reduce by half. Return the chicken to the pan. Add the chicken stock to almost cover the chicken. Add the thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the chicken for 30 to 35 minutes, adding more chicken stock if needed. While the chicken is cooking, puree the almonds in a food processor. With the motor running, drizzle in a little olive oil to make a loose paste. Season with salt and reserve. Once the chicken has cooked for 30 to 35 minutes, remove it from the pan and reserve. Taste the sauce for seasoning and stir in the almond puree. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer to thicken the sauce if needed; the almond puree will help to thicken the sauce and will make it very rich. Serve the chicken over sauteed haricots verts. Spoon the mushroom-almond sauce over the top and garnish with chopped chives. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of well-salted ice water for shocking. Add the haricots verts to the boiling water and cook until tender but still toothsome, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the boiling water and immediately plunge into the salted ice water. Once the beans are cool, remove them from the water and set aside until ready to use. Coat a large saute pan with olive oil. Add the garlic and the crushed red pepper and bring to a medium-high heat. When the garlic has become golden and very aromatic, remove and discard it?it has fulfilled its garlic destiny. Add the beans to the pan and saute until hot and coated with oil.

In the center of the plastic, lay the bacon slices vertically, slightly overlapping one another, working from left to right. Sprinkle the tenderloin with the salt and pepper. Place the beef tenderloin horizontally across the strips of bacon (along the bottom of the rectangle of bacon). Roll up the plastic and bacon around the beef so it is wrapped tightly and evenly. Twist the ends of plastic to tighten and form the meat into an even log shape. Place in the refrigerator to firm up for 1 hour so the bacon sticks to the beef and the roast retains its nice even shape.<br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> Set a large cast-iron pan (or roaster) over high heat and coat lightly with canola oil. Remove the beef from the fridge and discard the plastic. Place the roast seam-side down in the pan and brown on all four sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. When completely browned, place the whole pan in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes (an instant-read thermometer should register 135 degrees F for medium-rare). When done, remove from the oven and transfer the roast to a platter to rest before slicing into 1/2-inch-thick slices.<br> For the peppercorn sauce: Set the pan used for the beef over medium heat. Discard all but 2 to 3 tablespoons of fat from the pan, and then add the garlic and shallots. Season with some salt and saute until caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes. Then add the green peppercorns. Mix well, and then remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the whiskey (you can flambe if you like here by igniting the alcohol in the pan). Return the pan to the heat and cook down until just about all the liquid has reduced before adding the beef stock and heavy cream. Bring to a simmer and cook to allow flavors to meld, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the cold butter cubes, swirling as they dissolve. Taste and, if needed, season with more salt.

Place the ground beef in a large bowl and add the mustard, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mix gently with a fork to combine, taking care not to compress the ingredients. Shape the meat into 6 (3 1/2-inch) patties of equal size and thickness. When the grill is medium-hot, brush the grill grate with oil to keep the burgers from sticking. Place the burgers on the grill and cook for 4 minutes. Using a big spatula, turn the burgers and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until medium-rare or more, or cook longer if you prefer hamburgers more well done. Meanwhile, break apart the English muffins and toast the 6 halves cut side down on the grill. Spread each half with mayonnaise and top with a burger and then with a heaping tablespoon of caramelized onions. Serve hot. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large shallow pot, add the onions and thyme, and toss with the oil. Place the lid on top and cook over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes to sweat the onions.

Fold in the parsley and chives; set aside.<br> Stack two 18-inch pieces of foil on a work surface. Pile the potatoes in the middle, dot with 1 tablespoon butter and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Bring the foil up and over the potatoes and seal tightly. Put the potatoes on the grill, cover the grill and cook for 10 minutes.<br> After the potatoes have cooked for 10 minutes, remove the steak from the marinade, letting the excess drip off, and put it on the grill next to the potatoes; leave the other half of the grill empty for the spinach. Grill the steak, flipping every 4 to 5 minutes, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 130 degrees F, 16 to 20 minutes for medium rare. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before thinly slicing. Let the potatoes continue to cook until tender throughout, about 25 minutes total. (They should be ready about when the steak is.)<br> Meanwhile, put a large cast-iron skillet on the empty side of the grill. Chop the remaining 3 cloves garlic and add to the skillet with the remaining shallots and 1 tablespoon butter. Heat until the butter is melted and the shallots and garlic are softened, about 3 minutes. Add the spinach and cook, tossing with tongs, until wilted and most of the moisture has evaporated, about 8 minutes.<br> Push the spinach to one side of the skillet. Being careful of the steam, open the packet of potatoes and dump them into the other side of the skillet. Remove the skillet from the grill. Spread the herb butter over the steak and potatoes before serving.<br> &quot;,&quot;[Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Malbec, Zinfandel]&quot; 67622,&quot;Crispy Onion Salmon Burgers with Easy Herb Sauce 1 (12.8-oz) package of SeaPak Salmon Burgers ? cup plain yogurt 2 tbsp mayonnaise 2 tsp prepared horseradish 2 tbsp chopped fresh herbs (whatever you have on hand: chives, parsley,basil, etc) 1 (6-oz) can French fried onions (we used French&#39;s brand) 2 hamburger buns, split and toasted Instructions: Prepare salmon burgers according to package directions and keep warm.

Sift flour, cinnamon, baking powder and salt together twice. Cream butter and sugar in a stand mixer until light and fluffy. Combine egg, vanilla and almond extract and add to creamed mixture. Mix on medium speed until combined. Add sifted ingredients and mix only until combined; dough should be stiff. Roll dough out between 2 sheets of parchment paper to a 12 by 9-inch rectangle, using 1 long sheet of parchment paper that is folded in half. Make sure that you roll out the dough evenly. Cut the edges off neatly with a bench scraper to even them. Place dough in the freezer until firm, about 15 minutes. Mix together the canned pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, and 1/4 cup brown sugar for filling. Remove dough from freezer and peel back the top parchment paper. Thinly spread the pumpkin filling evenly over the dough. Don&#39;t spread too thickly; you should still be able to see the dough through the pumpkin slightly. If you don&#39;t use all of the filling, it is okay. Starting at 1 end, roll up the ends in the same manner as a cake roll. Make sure that you keep it tight and even. If the dough cracks slightly, simply rub it together with your fingers. Wrap the roll in the parchment paper, seam side down, and place back in the freezer until firm, about 1 hour. Slice cookies 1/4-inch thick and place onto a cookie sheet at least 1-inch apart. Sprinkle brown sugar on the tops of the cookies and rub it in with your fingers. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, just until the edges are turning brown. Serve cookies on a platter with a small bowl of whipped cream and nutmeg so that guests can make pumpkin pie pinwheel sandwiches. This makes it taste even more like pumpkin pie! &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 67628,&quot;Spice Rubbed Bahamian Lobster Tail with Red cl-Coconut Sauce 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 red onion, coarsely chopped 2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 2-inch piece fresh garlic, coarsely chopped 6 whole cl de arbol, stems removed 4 cups lobster or shrimp stock or fish stock 1 roasted red pepper, pureed 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk Juice of 1 lime 1 tablespoon honey 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon ground ginger 1 tablespoon light brown sugar 2 teaspoons onion powder 2 teaspoons garlic powder 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon habanero powder 1 teaspoon dry thyme 1 teaspoon coarse black pepper 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon allspice 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 4 spiny lobster (Bahamian lobster) Canola oil Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish Instructions: For the sauce: Heat oil in a medium saucepan over high heat.

Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Using the paddle attachment on low speed, mix in the butter until is the size of small peas. With the mixer on low speed, add the egg mixture. Mix the dough just until it is no longer dry-looking. It will still be loose and crumbly at this point. Place the dough on the work surface. With your hands, combine and form the dough into a single ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm but still malleable. Rolling and forming the shells: On a lightly floured work surface roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thick. Yield: 6 4-inch tartlets When lining tart, be sure to press the dough carefully around the bottom edges of the pans. Prebaking shells: To prebake a frozen or chilled shell line it with parchment paper. Fill the shell with uncooked rice, beans, or pie weights. (This helps the shell retain its shape.) Bake the shell in a preheated 350 degree oven until the edges are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and the rice, beans, or weights and continue to bake the shell until it is golden brown all over. Unbaked shells can be stored for a day in the refrigerator or for several weeks in the freezer. Once a shell is baked, it should be eaten that day for maximum freshness and flakiness of the crust. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 67630,&quot;Tipsy Triple-Chocolate Shakes and Strawberries 8 shots chocolate cream liqueur (recommended: Bailey&#39;s) 12 scoops chocolate ice cream 4 cups chocolate milk Whipped cream, canister 1 dark chocolate bar, for garnishing 8 large stem strawberries, rinsed and dried Instructions: Working in 2 batches, blend the chocolate liqueur with ice cream and chocolate milk until thick but smooth. Pour shakes into tall glasses and garnish with whipped cream. Use a vegetable peeler to shave dark chocolate on top.

Add the vegetable shortening and salted butter. Work the butter into the flour using a dough cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. Add the egg, 5 tablespoons cold water and the white vinegar. Stir until just combined. Divide the dough in half and chill until needed. (You will only need one half for this recipe, reserve the other half for another use.) Next make the filling: Mix the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, butter, vanilla and eggs together in a bowl. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Roll out one dough half on a lightly floured surface to fit your pie pan. Pour the pecans in the bottom of the unbaked pie shell. Pour the syrup mixture over the top. Cover the top and crust lightly/gently with foil. Bake the pie for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, and then continue baking for 20 minutes, being careful not to burn the crust or pecans. The pie should not be overly jiggly when you remove it from the oven (though it will jiggle a bit). If it shakes a lot, cover with foil and bake for an additional 20 minute or until set. Required baking time seems to vary widely with this recipe. Sometimes it takes 50 minutes, sometimes it takes 75! Allow to cool for several hours or overnight.

Process until the crumbs are very fine, about 1 minute. Dump the crumbs into a medium bowl, then dust out the bowl of the food processor with a paper towel, and place the bowl and blade back on the machine.<br> In a small heatproof bowl, combine the butter, 2 teaspoons water and the vanilla extract. Heat in the microwave on high power until the butter melts, about 45 seconds. Stir to blend, and then pour into the crumbs. Use a fork to toss the mixture until its evenly moistened; when you grab a fistful of crumbs and squeeze, it should hold together like damp sand (if not, add a bit more water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until you get there). Turn the crust mixture into the tart pan, and pat into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Use a flat-bottomed measuring cup to press the crust firmly into place. Bake until lightly golden, fragrant and firm, about 8 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while you prepare the filling.<br> For the filling: Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F. In the bowl of the food processor, grind 6 tablespoons of the sugar until noticeably finer, about 1 minute (you&#39;ll notice a bit of sweet smoke rising up into the air from the processor-this is the sign that the sugar is breaking down). Add the yogurt, vanilla extract, orange zest, salt, eggs and cream cheese. Blend until perfectly smooth. Pour the filling into the prepared crust.<br> Bake until the filling is set at the edges but still quite wobbly towards the center, about 30 minutes.<br> Cool the tart on a wire rack for about 15 minutes.

Pour the milk into a medium saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of the sugar, the cardamom and bananas, mashing them a bit into the milk. Turn the heat to medium-high and when it comes to a boil, turn the heat off and cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Leave to infuse for 15 to 20 minutes. In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks with 1 tablespoon of the sugar until thick and pale. Strain the hot milk, and then slowly pour it into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the mixture into 4 shallow creme brulee dishes or ramekins, place in a baking pan large enough to accommodate them and pour enough water into the pan to come halfway up the dishes. Bake until set but still slightly jiggly, about 30 minutes. If they aren&#39;t done at this point, continue to check them every 5 minutes until they are set. Remove from the water bath and let cool slightly on the counter top. Put them in the refrigerator to finish cooling for about an hour. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the sugar evenly on top of each creme brulee. Melt the sugar with a blowtorch, or alternatively place under a broiler until it has caramelized.

Divide into 4 equal pieces and roll into small balls. Use a skewer to make wrinkles in the top and drill a small hole in each. For the carrots: Knead the orange fruit chews in your hands until soft and pliable. Divide into 4 equal pieces and form each piece into a carrot shape. Drill a hole in the top of each with a skewer. For the eggplant: Knead the purple fruit chews together in your hands until soft and pliable. Divide into 4 equal pieces and form each piece into an eggplant shape. Knead the green fruit chews in your hands until soft and pliable. Divide into 4 equal pieces, form each piece into a stem shape and place one on each eggplant. For the lettuce: Knead the green and yellow fruit chews together in your hands until soft, pliable and evenly mixed. Divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll out each piece into a 4-inch-long rope and lightly press to flatten. Roll up each rope to form concentric circles like a head of lettuce, flaring out the outer layer to form leaves. For the bunny butt and feet: Place the regular marshmallow on the end of a skewer and frost it entirely with the frosting. Roll the marshmallow in the coconut to completely coat. Remove from the skewer. Dab a small dollop of the white frosting on the flat side of the regular marshmallow to use as glue, towards the top in the 12-o&#39;clock position. Glue on the mini marshmallow to create a bunny tail. To make bunny feet, use the pink icing to pipe paw pads onto each almond. Dab 2 small dollops of the white frosting on the flat side of the regular marshmallow to use as glue, towards the bottom in the 4- and 8-o&#39;clock positions. Glue on the bunny feet. For the sunflowers: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine the almonds, yellow food coloring and 1/2 teaspoon water and mix until the almonds are yellow. Spread out on the lined baking sheet to dry. Insert the almond slices into the frosting around the edge of the mini cupcakes in 2 rows to mimic the petals of a sunflower. Carefully sprinkle the center of each cupcake with the chocolate sprinkles to mimic sunflower seeds. For the cake assembly: If using a 1/2 sheet cake, use a toothpick to draw a 12-by-8-inch rectangle in the center of the cake, 1 1/2 inches from the edges. This rectangle will be the dirt garden plot. Cut about 58 of the rolled wafer cookies in half and set aside. If using a 1/4 sheet cake, draw a 10-by-6-1/2-inch rectangle in the center of the cake, 1 inch from the edges, to form the dirt garden plot. Cut about 36 of the rolled wafer cookies in half and set aside. Fill a large resealable plastic bag with the green frosting. Using a toothpick, punch 8 to 10 holes in one of the corners along the bottom of the bag. Squeeze the bag and pipe grass in the border around the garden plot. Carefully spread an even layer of the ground cookies inside the rectangle to create dirt for the garden plot. Using the remaining ground cookies, make 4 evenly spaced long dirt mounds in the plot. Press the rolled wafer cookie halves around the outside of the cake to form a fence. Place the eggplants along one of the dirt mounds. Place the carrots along the second dirt mound and plant some into the dirt. Insert mint sprigs into the top of the carrots to create carrot tops. Place the lettuce heads along the third dirt mound. Place the tomatoes along the fourth with mint sprigs to mimic vines. Place a sunflower mini cupcake in each corner of the garden and place 2 mint sprigs around each to mimic leaves. Place the bunny butt in the garden plot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67651,&quot;Corn on Corn Bread 2 cups all purpose flour 2 cups yellow cornmeal 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons sugar 2 large eggs 2 cups buttermilk or 1 cup yogurt mixed with 1 cup milk 1 cup thawed frozen corn kernels 1/2 cup corn oil Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer and poach the chicken until cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Use tongs to remove the chicken pieces and set aside to cool; discard the backbones. Once the chicken cools enough to handle, pull the meat from the bones, shred and roughly chop; set aside. Strain the chicken broth and keep warm. In a medium pot, melt the butter over medium heat, and stir in the carrots, garlic, celery, leeks, onions and poultry seasoning. Cook the vegetables until they begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes, then stir in the flour. Add the reserved chicken broth, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the soup thickens slightly and vegetables soften, about 25 minutes. Stir in the shredded chicken and bring the soup back to a low simmer. For the dumplings: In a medium bowl, add the flour. Use two butter knives to cut in the milk, butter, baking powder, salt and eggs. Add additional milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, if necessary. The dough should be moist but not too wet. Pull the dough into 1/4-cup pieces and place directly in the simmering soup; cover and cook for 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67665,&quot;Pulled Pork Arepas 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon yellow mustard Juice of 1 lime 16 pickled jalapeno slices, plus 2 tablespoons brine Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups thinly sliced green cabbage 1 1/2 cups thinly sliced red cabbage 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped 3 scallions, thinly sliced 2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal, such as P.A.N. 4 ounces part-skim mozzarella, sliced 1/4-inch thick and cut into eight 2 1/2-inch squares 1/4 cup vegetable oil 8 ounces warm pulled pork Instructions: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, lime juice, jalapeno brine, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Add the cabbages, cilantro and scallions and toss. Let sit for 15 minutes. Stir together 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl. Gradually add the cornmeal to the water, using your fingers to stir and combine, until a soft and moist dough forms. Divide the dough into 8 balls and pat each into a patty about 5 inches wide and 1/4-inch-thick. Put a cube of mozzarella in the center of each patty. Fold the dough over the cheese, making sure the cheese is completely covered and sealed. Pat it back down until 3 1/2 inches wide and 3/4 inch thick. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat until shimmering. Working in batches, cook the corn patties until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side; make sure the oil is hot for each batch. Transfer to a cooling rack set on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the edges are crisp and golden, about 10 minutes. When the arepas are cool enough to handle, use a thin serrated knife to slice a third of the way through each. Then use the knife tip to cut open the center of each to form a pocket, taking care to keep the sides intact. Wipe down the knife between cuts to remove any sticky cornmeal. Stuff each arepa with some pulled pork, jalapenos and coleslaw. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Tempranillo]&quot; 67666,&quot;Cinnamon Spice Cake with Fig Buttercream, White Chocolate Ganache and Buttermilk Caramel 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for buttering the pans 1 cup shortening<br> 1 cup lightly packed dark brown sugar 1 cup granulated sugar<br> 4 large eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups buttermilk<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br> 2 cups all-purpose flour<br> 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg<br> 1/2 teaspoon allspice<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 pound confectioners&#39; sugar<br> 3 tablespoons fig butter (see Cook&#39;s Note) 2 to 3 teaspoons buttermilk, optional, for thinning the frosting if needed 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 3/4 cup buttermilk<br> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 2 tablespoons corn syrup<br> 1 teaspoon baking soda<br> 1 teaspoon vanilla<br> 24 ounces good-quality white chocolate, chopped or chips 1 cup heavy cream<br> Instructions: For the cinnamon spice cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Butter 6 (4 to 5-inch) ramekins and sprinkle lightly with sugar to coat. In a medium nonreactive saucepan, combine the teas, cream, milk, and vanilla beans and heat over low heat. Simmer to flavor, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to steep for an hour or so. Strain the mixture, return it to the saucepan, and add the honey. Scald over medium heat. Meanwhile, in a nonreactive bowl, combine the egg yolks, cornstarch, and 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar and mix well. Add a ladleful of the tea mixture to the yolks, stir to temper, and stir the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens to the consistency of thick custard, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a shallow baking pan, cover the surface of the mixture with plastic film, and refrigerate to cool. The mixture can be held overnight. Place a heavy cookie sheet in the oven. Using a mixer, beat the egg whites at low speed with 1 tablespoon of the sugar until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar, increase the speed to high, and whip the egg whites in 2 (3-second) burst. Transfer the cooled tea mixture to a large nonreactive bowl and whisk until smooth. You should have an equal volume of the tea mixture and the egg whites; if not, discard enough of whichever is in excess to make the quantities equal. Add the whites to the tea mixture and, using a spatual, fold until completely blended. Fill the ramekins to the top with the mixture and tap them on a work surface to disperse any air bubbles. Wipe away any mixture that spatters on the sides of the molds. Place the ramekins on the heated sheet and bake until the sides of the souffles, which have risen above the edges of the ramekins, are golden brown, about 12 minutes. After 6 minutes check to make sure that the souffles have not adhered to the sides of the ramekins, which will cause uneven rising; use the tip of a sharp paring knife to free any stuck portions Sprinkle the souffles with the confectioners&#39; sugar and serve. Scoop the ice cream into the souffles at table. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 67669,&quot;Grain Stuffing with Sausage 3/4 cup farro, rinsed 3/4 cup rye berries, rinsed 5 cups low-sodium chicken broth 5 sprigs thyme, plus 1 tablespoon chopped leaves 2 bay leaves 3/4 cup millet, rinsed 1 medium-large celery root, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 3 red onions, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 4 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the baking dish 1 pound turkey or chicken sausage, casings removed, meat crumbled 1 cup shredded whole-milk mozzarella cheese (about 4 ounces) 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese Instructions: Combine the farro, rye berries, 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups water, the thyme sprigs and bay leaves in a large pot.

Put the flour mixture in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the butter and Crisco and pulse about 10 times until the butter is in small bits. Add the ice water and process until the dough comes together. Dump on a well-floured board and form into a disk. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out the dough and fit into a 9-inch tart pan with removable sides. Don&#39;t stretch the dough when placing it in the pan or it will shrink during baking. Cut off the excess by rolling the pin across the top of the pan. Line the tart shell with a piece of buttered aluminum foil, butter side down, and fill it with dried beans or rice. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the beans and foil and prick the bottom of the shell all over with a fork to allow the steam to escape. Bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Set aside to cool. Raise the oven temperature to 425 degrees F. For the meringue, whip the egg whites, cream of tartar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed until frothy. With the mixer still running, slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and beat until the meringue is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Immediately spread the lime filling in the cooled tart shell and pipe the meringue over it with a large star tip. Be sure the meringue covers the entire top and touches the edges of the shell, to prevent it from shrinking. Bake for 3 to 5 minutes, until the meringue is lightly browned. Cool to room temperature. Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment for 1 minute. On low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, and then add the lime zest, lime juice, and salt. Don&#39;t worry; it will look curdled.

For the brine: Put the onion, salt, garlic, rosemary, lemons and 4 cups water in a large resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Heat a grill pan, griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry. Drizzle or brush the chicken with EVOO, then cook, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, gently warm the glaze. Baste the chicken with the glaze during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Serve the chicken with the Puttanesca-Style Panzanella. Cook&#39;s Note: Make 6 pieces of chicken breast and you&#39;ll have extra meat to slice for sandwiches or chicken salad the next day. Combine the tomatoes, parsley, onions and bell peppers. Whisk together the EVOO, vinegar, anchovy paste, garlic, cl pepper and lemon juice in a bowl. Pour water over the bread, then wring out the loaf and tear it into bite-size pieces. Toss the bread, vegetable mixture and olives with the dressing. Serve. Cook&#39;s Note: Wrap the bread loosely in foil overnight so it becomes stale and a little hard (if it goes too far, place it in a plastic bag overnight). If you are making the salad ahead of time, you can combine the vegetables and parsley in a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate them. Pit and chop the olives and return them to their container in the refrigerator. Store the dressing in the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature before using. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Montepulciano]&quot; 67679,&quot;TBL Panzanella 4 cups French bread cut into 1-inch cubes and dried overnight 6 slices bacon, cooked, chopped, drippings reserved 2 cups halved grape tomatoes 2 tablespoons oil, for searing 2 cups halved yellow pear tomatoes or roughly chopped heirloom tomatoes 2 cups chopped romaine lettuce 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon chiffonade mint 1 tablespoon chiffonade basil Instructions: Toss bread cubes in the bacon drippings.

Remove any large stems from the greens and wash them thoroughly; do so in a sink with at least 5 inches of water. Moving the leaves around in the water and allowing them to sit for a few minutes to allow the sand or dirt to fall to the bottom of the sink. Once clean, roughly chop the greens. You should have 1 pound finished greens once they are stemmed. (Weigh the greens after stemming, but before washing.) After washing the greens, place them in a salad spinner to thoroughly dry them. Butter a 9 by 11-inch or 2 1/2-quart baking dish and set aside. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the eggs, ricotta, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Set aside. In a large, 13 by 11-inch roasting pan set over 2 burners on medium heat, melt the butter in 1 corner of the pan. Add the garlic, mushrooms, and a pinch of salt and cook until the mushrooms give up their liquid, approximately 5 to 6 minutes. Add the greens and cook until they are wilted, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. The greens will reduce to less than 1/4 of their original volume and begin to look like thawed, frozen spinach. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the greens to the egg and cheese mixture and stir to thoroughly combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish, top with the crackers, place on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67681,&quot;Aluminum Foil-Shaped Holiday Cupcakes One 15.25-ounce box yellow cake mix, plus required ingredients 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature One 16-ounce package confectioners\\u2019 sugar 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract Pinch kosher salt 1 to 2 tablespoons milk Brown, red and yellow gel food coloring 14 brown, 6 red, 2 green and 2 orange mini candy-coated chocolates, such as mini M&amp;M\\u2019s 2 red candy-coated chocolates, such as M&amp;M\\u2019s 3 thin pretzels White sugar pearl sprinkles White sparkling sugar Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line two 6-cup jumbo muffin pans with cupcake liners. Cut some aluminum foil into fifty 1-by 2-inch rectangles; roll each into a small ball. Cut more foil into four 2-by-4-inch rectangles; fold each into a 1-inch square. Set aside. Prepare the cake mix according to the package directions and divide the batter in the prepared muffin pans (about 1/3 cup batter in each liner). Tuck the foil balls between the liner and cup in one muffin pan to make each shape for the cupcake using the following clock configurations: Reindeer: 1 foil ball at 12 o\\u2019clock, then 1 foil ball each at 2 and 10 o\\u2019clock, to shape the ears. Gingerbread man: 1 foil ball each at 1, 4, 6, 8 and 11 o\\u2019clock, to shape the head, arms and legs. Mitten: 1 foil ball on each side of 3 o\\u2019clock to shape the thumb, then a 3rd foil ball at 7 o\\u2019clock to complete shaping the cuff. Snowman: 1 foil ball each at 2, 4, 8 and 10 o\\u2019clock, to shape the head, torso and base. Slide 1 of the foil squares on each side of the torso to press it in slightly. Angel: 1 foil ball each at 1, 4, 8 and 11 o\\u2019clock, to shape the head, wings and skirt. Snowflake: 1 foil ball each at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o\\u2019clock. Repeat shaping the cupcakes in the second muffin pan. Bake until golden brown and the cupcakes spring back when lightly pressed, 21 to 24 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. For the frosting: Meanwhile, mix the butter in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the confectioners\\u2019 sugar, mixing on low speed, until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and salt, increase the speed to medium high and mix until smooth, fluffy and lightened in color, about 3 minutes. Adjust the consistency with milk as needed. Transfer 3/4 cup of the frosting to a small bowl and tint with the brown food coloring for the reindeer and gingerbread men; 1/2 cup of the remaining frosting to a second small bowl and tint red for the mittens; and 1/3 cup of the remaining frosting to a third small bowl and tint yellow for the angel wings and halos. Combine 2 tablespoons of the remaining white frosting with 1 tablespoon each of the brown, red and yellow frosting in a small bowl, adjusting the color as desired, for the angels\\u2019 skin tone. Transfer each color of frosting to its own piping bag and fit with a tip as follows: Brown frosting: large round tip (such as 805) Red frosting: small fluted tip (such as 821) Yellow frosting: small fluted tip (such as 15) Skin-tone frosting: small round tip (such as 801) 1/2 cup of the white frosting: large round tip (such as 806) Remaining white frosting: small round tip (such as 5) For decorating each pair of cupcake shapes: Reindeer: Following the shape of the cupcake, pipe the brown frosting in 1 large mound for the center of the face and 2 smaller mounds for the cheeks. Pipe 2 brown ears. Pipe the white frosting with the larger tip in 2 large mounds between the cheeks, creating a snout. Pipe 2 smaller mounds above the snout for the eyes. Place 2 brown mini candy-coated chocolates in the center of the eyes for pupils, 2 red mini candy-coated chocolates each set on its edge to create the center of the ears, and 1 red (full-size) candy-coated chocolate in the center of the snout for the nose. Carefully break apart a pretzel to create 2 antlers and insert them next to the ears. Repeat with the second reindeer. Gingerbread men: Following the shape of the cupcake, pipe the brown frosting in 6 large mounds for the head, limbs and body. Use an offset spatula to smooth the surface (you may need to carefully clean up the sides). Pipe the white frosting with the smaller tip to outline the gingerbread man just inside the perimeter of the brown frosting, then pipe eyes, a smile and a zig-zag cuff for each limb. Place 2 red or green mini candy-coated chocolates in the center of the body to make a column of buttons. Repeat with the second gingerbread man. Mittens: Following the shape of the cupcake, pipe the red frosting in a basketweave pattern across the top of the mitten, leaving the cuff empty. Pipe the white frosting with the smaller tip in lines across the cuff, then in a dashed line to outline the mitten. Decorate with some white sugar pearl sprinkles. Repeat with the second mitten. Snowmen: Following the shape of the cupcake, pipe the white frosting in 3 large mounds to create the body of a snowman. Place 3 brown mini candy-coated chocolates in the center of the body, to create a column of buttons and 2 more on the head for the eyes. Set an orange mini candy-coated chocolate on its edge between the eyes to create a carrot nose. Carefully break apart a pretzel to create 2 arms and press them into the sides of the torso. Repeat with the second snowman. Angels: Following the shape of the cupcake, pipe the yellow frosting in small downward swipes, across in rows, to create feathers for the two wings. Pipe the white frosting with the smaller tip in vertical lines to create a skirt, then three rows of small mounds to make the torso. Pipe a line, separating the two, to create a waistband. Pipe 1 line down from each shoulder to create arms. Pipe the skin-tone frosting in a mound for the head, then 2 smaller mounds for the hands. Pipe the yellow frosting in a ring over the head for the halo. Repeat with the second angel. Snowflakes: Following the shape of the cupcake, pipe the white frosting with the smaller tip in double lines to draw an asterisk in the center. Pipe a small downward arrow on each pair of lines, then between the pairs of lines to connect them in a snowflake pattern. Pipe small dots to decorate the empty space and top with white sparkling sugar. Repeat with the second snowflake. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67682,&quot;Lemon and Chive Risotto 8 sprigs fresh thyme Zest of 3 lemons, removed with a vegetable peeler<br> 3 large rinds Parmesan cheese<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 4 tablespoons olive oil 1 shallot, chopped<br> 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt<br> 1 cup dry white wine<br> 1/4 cup chopped chives<br> 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, optional<br> Instructions: For the lemon Parmesan broth: Add the thyme, lemon zest, Parmesan rinds and bay leaf to a medium sauce pan.

While the machine is running, add the oil in a slow, steady stream until the mixture is emulsified. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the chopped hazelnuts for a garnish and process the rest briefly with the mayonnaise. Remove the mayonnaise to a small bowl. Fire up the grill. Brush the asparagus with olive oil and lay horizontally across the grill grates. This prevents them from falling through the grates. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roll the asparagus with tongs to grill them evenly, and don&#39;t be afraid to char them a little bit. Cooking time depends on the thickness of the asparagus and the heat of the grill. Medium-thick asparagus takes about 6 minutes. On the plate: Arrange the asparagus in bundles on plates. Drape some of the mayonnaise over each bundle. Sprinkle the remaining chopped toasted hazelnuts over the mayonnaise and garnish with orange slices or wedges. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Gavi]</p><p>&quot; 67688,&quot;Sweet Potato Pie Cocktail 4 ounces Sweet Potato-Pear-Cinnamon Juice, recipe follows 2 ounces tequila Cinnamon stick, for garnish 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled 1 pear, peeled and cored 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions: Combine the Sweet Potato-Pear-Cinnamon Juice and tequila in a cocktail shaker filled with ice.

Prepare 4 (8-ounce) ramekins or a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish by greasing with softened butter and coating with granulated sugar, pour out any excess. The butter and sugar will keep the souffles from sticking to the sides and will allow them to rise evenly. The sugar will also give the souffle a crunchy crust, which is a great contrast to the soft interior. To make the fruit puree base, heat the raspberry puree, 3/4 cup sugar and butter in a saucepan and place over medium heat. Cook for 10 minutes to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat, cool slightly, then strain to remove the raspberry seeds. Whisk in the egg yolks 1 at a time. In a separate clean bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar just until they hold soft peaks. Fold 1/3 of the beaten whites into the raspberry mixture to lighten it. Then gently fold in the rest. Spoon into the prepared ramekins or souffle dish and place on a cookie sheet. Bake on the middle rack for about 20 minutes. The souffle is done when it has puffed over the rim, the outside is golden and the center giggles slightly. Take care not to over bake. Dust with powdered sugar before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67699,&quot;Fried Ipswich Clams with Fried Lemons 3 lemons, cut into 1/8-inch thick slices 1 tablespoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 48 Ipswich or other soft-shell clams (also known as steamers) Peanut oil, for frying 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper or to taste 2 cups buttermilk 1 recipe Tartar Sauce, recipe follows 1 large egg yolk 1 small egg<br> 1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar<br> 1/2 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 1/2 teaspoon sugar<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> 1 cup peanut oil<br> 6 cornichons, finely diced<br> 1 tablespoon drained capers, finely diced<br> 1/2 small onion, minced (1/4 cup)<br> 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh chives Instructions: Put the lemon slices on a tray and sprinkle both sides with salt and sugar.

Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat the egg yolk and ice water in a small bowl to blend, add it to the pastry. Work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Form the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour. Roll the dough out into a 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch springform pan. Press the dough firmly into the bottom and sides so it fits tightly; trim the excess dough around the rim. Place the pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easier to move in and out of the oven, this quiche is pretty heavy. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To make the filling: Heat a skillet over medium-low heat, coat the pan with oil, and add the onions. Slowly cook the onions, stirring, until they caramelize and release their natural sugars. Add a couple of tablespoons of water to help the onions break down, if needed. Toss in the ham, cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes to get some color on it. Remove from heat. In a large bowl, beat the eggs until frothy, pour in the cream; season with salt and pepper. Arrange the caramelized onions and ham over the bottom of the crust and carefully pour in the cream and egg mixture; the filling should be about 1-inch from the top of the pan. Cover loosely with foil and bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake for 15 minutes or until the quiche is set, puffy, and jiggles slightly. Remove to a wire rack and let cool for 30 minutes. In the meantime make the asparagus salad. To make the asparagus salad: In a large pot of boiling salted water, blanch the asparagus for 4 minutes, or until they are just crisp-tender. Drain the asparagus, transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, and drain well. Slice the asparagus into 1/2-inch pieces and put them in a mixing bowl. Add the Parmesan and herbs, drizzle the herb and asparagus salad with olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, season with salt and pepper. Toss gently to combine. Loosen the quiche from the sides of the pan by running a thin metal spatula around the inside rim. Carefully unmold the ring, and transfer the quiche (with the bottom base) to a serving plate. Cut it into wedges, drizzle with a little olive oil, and a few turns of freshly ground black pepper. Garnish with the asparagus salad on top. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67708,&quot;Chocolate-Hazelnut Sandwich Cookies 8 homemade or store bought cookies 4 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread Instructions: Top half of the cookies with chocolate-hazelnut spread.

Place 1/2 cup warm water in a large bowl, stir in sugar, then sprinkle on yeast and stir to dissolve. Place yogurt and one cup water in a saucepan, stir to mix, then place over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until lukewarm. Add the yogurt mixture to the yeast and water mixture and stir. Add the whole wheat flour one cup at a time, stirring in one direction only as you add the flour. Then stir one hundred times (for about one minute) in the same direction to activate the gluten. Let this sponge stand, covered, for 10 minutes or for as long as 2 hours. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt over the sponge, then stir in unbleached flour one cup at a time until dough is too stiff to stir. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic, incorporating more unbleached flour as necessary to prevent dough from sticking. Rinse out, wipe and lightly oil your bread bowl. Add the dough, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in volume, approximately 1 1/2 hours. Position a rack in the top third of your oven. Arrange unglazed quarry tiles on it, leaving a 1-inch gap between tiles and the oven walls (to allow air to circulate). Alternatively place a baking stone or baking sheets on the rack. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Gently punch down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. If you have time, let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Place shallots and remaining salt beside your work surface, together with a bowl of lukewarm water. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Using lightly floured hands, press each piece into a 3 to 4-inch round. Work with one round at a time, leaving the others covered at the back of your work surface. Working on a lightly floured surface, roll out to a 6-inch round. With a fork or bread stamp, or the edge of a wire whisk, stamp a 1 1/2-inch diameter circle at the center of the bread thoroughly, to flatten and pierce it (to prevent it from rising). Sprinkle onto the center approximately 1/2 teaspoon chopped shallot, a pinch of salt, and a sprinkle of water. Quickly roll out and prepare one, two, or three more breads (depending on the size of your oven), then transfer prepared breads to the hot tiles, stone, or baking sheets. Begin shaping your next breads as the first batch is baking. Let bake for approximately 5 minutes, or until lightly golden; you can also let breads brown to a deeper hue by leaving them in for 7 to 8 minutes. Use a long-handled spatula to remove from the oven. Place on a rack to cool, then stack and wrap loosely in a cotton cloth to keep soft and warm. Shape and bake remaining breads in the same way. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 67726,&quot;Teriyaki Chicken with Sesame Noodles 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs 1 cup low-sodium soy sauce<br> 1/2 cup packed brown sugar<br> 1/2 cup honey<br> 1/4 cup seasoned rice wine vinegar<br> 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br> 2 tablespoons Asian chili sauce<br> 2 tablespoons lime juice<br> 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil<br> 1 tablespoon hot chili oil<br> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 4 scallions, sliced, whites and greens separated 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> One 12-ounce package soba noodles 6 mini bell peppers, thinly sliced into strips<br> 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves<br> 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds<br> Instructions: Add the chicken thighs to a large resealable freezer bag.

Increase speed to high and beat for 4 minutes or until mixture is cool to the touch and doubled in volume. Reduce speed to low and add the softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition, until all of the butter has been added. Continue to beat until mixture looks smooth. Fold in the melted chocolate and the hazelnut extract and beat until fluffy. To assemble the cake, split each cake layer horizontally in half to make 4 separate layers. Spread equal amounts of the hazelnut filling between each layer and frost top and sides of cake with the buttercream. To garnish, press chopped hazelnuts onto the sides of the cake. Using a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, pipe rosettes around the top rim using remaining frosting. Place whole hazelnuts and chocolate curls on the top of the cake. Tip: To make this cake an easier undertaking, take the time to search out hazelnuts that have already been peeled. If peeled nuts are unavailable, working in batches, boil nuts in 2 cups water along with 2 tablespoons baking soda for 1 to 2 minutes. Run nuts under water and slip off skins. Dry the nuts well and toast on a baking sheet in a 350 degree F oven for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool and finely chop and proceed with recipe. If you purchase the nuts already peeled, toast in a 350 degree F oven for only 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67744,&quot;Chocolate-Covered Strawberry Cheesecake Nonstick cooking spray One 15.25-ounce box chocolate cake mix (plus required ingredients) Two 1-pound containers long stem strawberries 1/2 cup granulated sugar One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature 3 1/2 cups heavy cream Two 1/4-ounce packets unflavored powdered gelatin 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped 1 tablespoon unsalted butter Instructions: For the cheesecake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray. Line a baking sheet with parchment and set aside. Cut a 10-inch-by-5 1/2-inch strip of parchment. Prepare and bake the cake batter in the prepared pan according to the package directions for a 9-inch pan. Let cool completely on a rack, about 1 hour. Open the pan clasp, loosen the collar and slip in the parchment strip so it encircles the cake; it will come up about 2 inches higher than the edge. Close the clasp. Meanwhile, chop enough strawberries to make 2 cups. Toss with the sugar in a medium bowl and let sit until softened slightly, about 5 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash the strawberries and sugar to a pulp (the mixture should be mostly smooth with a few chunks). Beat the cream cheese and 2 cups cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and stiff peaks form, 4 to 5 minutes. Bring 1/2 cup cream to a boil in a small saucepan then whisk in the gelatin, stirring continuously, until dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold the cream-gelatin mixture into the strawberry mixture until combined. Fold the cream cheese mixture into the strawberry-gelatin mixture until combined. Pour on top of the cake and smooth out the top with an offset spatula. Chill until set, 2 hours and up to overnight. For the ganache: Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the butter and the remaining 1 cup heavy cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Pour the cream mixture over the chocolate and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir until melted and smooth. Dip each of the remaining strawberries into the chocolate halfway, twisting to let any excess chocolate drip back into the bowl. Place on the prepared baking sheet and let harden, about 30 minutes. Reserve the remaining chocolate. Open the pan clasp and remove the collar and parchment. Transfer the cake to a serving platter or cake stand. Reheat the reserved ganache in the microwave until it is pourable. Pour the ganache around the edge of the cake, smoothing it with an offset spatula and letting some drip down the sides. Place the chocolate-covered strawberries around the rim with the stems facing inward. Let stand until hardened, about 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 67745,&quot;United States of Meatloaf 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 small Spanish onion, cut into small dice<br> Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper<br> 3 cloves garlic, minced<br> 1/2 cup whole milk<br> 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco<br> 2 large eggs<br> 1 pound ground chuck<br> 8 ounces ground pork<br> 8 ounces ground veal<br> 1 cup coarsely crushed saltine crackers (about 24)<br> 1/3 cup minced fresh parsley<br> 1/2 cup barbecue sauce 1/4 cup brown sugar<br> 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br> 2 tablespoons sriracha sauce<br> Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Tap out the excess flour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl and set aside. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the butter and milk and heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Alternatively, in a microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter and milk and microwave on high at 10-second intervals, stirring between each, until the butter is melted. Pour the milk mixture into a large bowl. Set aside and let cool to slightly above room temperature; an instant-read thermometer should register between 80 and 85 degrees F. You want the milk and butter to remain incorporated, so whisk the mixture occasionally and vigorously while it is cooling and up until you add it to the batter. In the top pan of a double boiler or in a bowl for a bain-marie, whisk together the sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Fit the top pan or bowl over (but not touching) simmering water in the bottom pan or a saucepan and gently warm the mixture, stirring, just until the sugar is dissolved and the thermometer registers 110 degrees F, about 10 minutes. Pour the egg mixture through a medium-mesh sieve into the bowl of a stand mixer. Fit the mixer with the whisk attachment and whisk on high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy and has cooled to slightly above room temperature (between 80 and 85 degrees F), about 10 minutes. (Note: The batter becomes more stable as the mixture cools; this is an important factor in creating a cake with good structure.) Stop the mixer. Add the sifted dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated, preferably by hand, lifting and folding in from the bottom center. Or, use the mixer set on low and whisk just until incorporated, about 5 seconds. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix again just briefly by hand or machine. The batter should be smooth. Check the milk mixture to make sure it is fully cooled, then slowly pour it into the batter, whisking on low speed. Stop mixing as soon as the batter is well blended and smooth. Remove the bowl from the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl again, and fold by hand a few times with the spatula. Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are golden brown and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool in the pans for about 20 minutes. When the cakes are cooled enough to handle the pans but still a tad warm to the touch, carefully run an offset spatula around the edges of the pans to loosen them, then invert the cakes onto the racks and remove the pans. Let cool for about 30 minutes longer. Wrap the cakes tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate to ensure that the interiors are completely cooled before decorating, at least 1 hour or for up to 3 days. To freeze, wrap tightly in a second layer of plastic wrap and store in the freezer for up to 2 months. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67765,&quot;Foie Gras Doufu 8 ounces foie gras 3 eggs 1 1/2 cups chicken stock Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 duck breast Cornstarch 7 ounces dashi broth, recipe follows 1 ounce mirin 1/2 ounce light soy sauce 1/2 ounce regular soy sauce 1/2 ounce sugar 2 to 3 ounces cornstarch, mixed with water to make a slurry 2 teaspoons fresh wasabi 1 (1 1/2-inch) piece kombu (dried kelp) 4 cups water 1/4 cup katsuo (dried bonito flake) Instructions: Combine foie gras, eggs, chicken stock, and salt and pepper in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.

Add the Parmesan rind and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated away and the mixture resembles sloppy joes, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. There shouldn&#39;t be any rapid bubbles while cooking. Instead, the sauce should release occasional small bubbles. If you have a small burner you should use it; the larger burners even at their lowest setting might cook the sauce too quickly. If the sauce reduces too quickly, add 1/2 cup of stock or water and continue cooking; repeat if necessary. The sauce needs the full 2 to 2 1/2 hour cook time to develop the flavors.<br> Discard the bay leaf and Parmesan rind.

Add the onions and cook, stirring, until softened and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the carrots, peppers and zucchini and cook, stirring, until softened, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Continue to cook, stirring, until the vegetables are lightly browned, for 10 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes. Add 1 cup water to the empty tomato can and pour into the pot. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer until the vegetables are very soft, the sauce has thickened slightly and the rawness from the canned tomatoes has mellowed, about 20 minutes. Puree the vegetables with a hand blender or transfer to a blender and puree until smooth, holding down the lid with a kitchen towel to prevent the hot sauce from spraying. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed and cool. You will have about 5 cups of sauce. While the sauce simmers, lay the English muffin halves in a single layer on a baking sheet and lightly toast in a toaster oven set to broil or under an oven broiler, 2 to 3 minutes. Spread the top of each muffin with 1 to 2 tablespoons of sauce. Combine the 2 cheeses and sprinkle over the sauce. To serve as a snack right away, add your desired toppings and place the assembled pizzas under the broiler in the oven or toaster oven until the cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. To make ahead: Place the entire tray of mini pizzas in the freezer and freeze until hard, about 1 hour. Stack in a plastic freezer bag until ready to eat. To reheat, place the frozen pizzas on a piece of heavy-duty foil, add any toppings you like and bake in a toaster oven at 400 degrees F until golden, hot and the cheese is melted, 13 to 15 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]&quot; 67786,&quot;Lime Pie 2 cups all purpose flour 1/2 cup lard, chilled 2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup ice water 3/4 cup fresh lime juice Drop of green food coloring 1 pound cream cheese, room temperature 1 can sweetened condensed milk Grated zest of 1 lime 1 cup crema or creme fraiche 1/4 cup powdered sugar 1 lime, thinly sliced, for garnish Instructions: Prepare the pie crust: In a bowl, combine the flour, lard, butter and salt. Mix lightly with your fingers until the mixture forms peasized pieces. Using a fork, stir in the ice water, a little at a time, until a dough forms, and then knead lightly until it comes together in a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a round about 12-inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Drape the round over the rolling pin and transfer to a 9 inch or 10 inch glass or ceramic pie plate. Ease the pastry into the pie plate, pressing it gently against the bottom and sides. Trim the edges, leaving a generous 1/2 inch overhang. Fold the overhang under, then crimp the edges. Cover and chill for 30 to 60 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prick the bottom and sides of the pastry with a fork. Line the pastry with parchment paper or waxed paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and remove the weights and paper. Transfer the pie shell to a rack and cool completely. Filling: In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine the lime juice, green food coloring, cream cheese and condensed milk. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides of the work bowl often. Add the lime zest and process to mix thoroughly. Pour into the pie shell and place in the refrigerator. In a bowl, using a whisk, beat the crema and powdered sugar until soft peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, spread the mixture over the top of the pie, creating peaks evenly over the surface. Garnish with the lime slices.

Split the vanilla bean and scrape the seeds into the milk and add the bean as well. Heat the milk over medium heat and bring to a boil. While the milk is heating, combine the egg yolks, sugar, and honey in a mixing bowl. Add the cornstarch and mix until smooth. Once the milk is boiling, remove the vanilla bean and add 1/4 of the milk to the egg mixture, whisking continuously making sure the eggs do not scramble. Once the yolks are tempered, return the egg mixture to the milk in the saucepan and continue whisking over medium heat until the mixture bubbles and thickens. This should take 1 to 2 minutes. Once the cream has thickened, place it in a bowl over an ice bath and cover with plastic wrap. Allow the cream to cool thoroughly. Sopaipillas: Using a large mixing bowl, blend the flour, salt and baking powder. In another bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water to activate and add to the flour mixture. Incorporate the milk slowly to form a single ball of dough. Knead the dough until smooth, cover and allow to rise until doubled in size. In a large pot or fryer, heat the oil to 360 to 375 degrees F. On a floured work surface, roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thickness. Using a cutter or knife cut the dough into desired serving size portions. Drop the sopaipillas, 2 or 3 at a time, into the oil and fry, turning them often until browned. Remove with a skimmer and place on paper towels to drain. Sprinkle the warm sopaipillas with cinnamon and powdered sugar. To make the fruit compote, place the ingredients in a mixing bowl and toss until the fruits are evenly coated. Allow the fruit to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Strain fruit from liquid before serving. To make the glaze, place the vinegar in a saucepan and over medium heat reduce by half. Dissolve the honey in the warm vinegar and allow to cool. Set aside. To serve, split the sopaipillas open and pipe in a portion of the pastry cream. Fill the remainder of the sopaipillas with fruit compote. Place the sopaipillas on each plate, drizzle the glaze around the sopaipillas and dust with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Finish with a dash of vinegar on the fruit compote. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67793,&quot;BBQ Yellow Bean Chicken with Grilled Chinese Long Beans 4 heaping tablespoons yellow bean sauce 4 heaping tablespoons honey 4 tablespoons Shaohsing rice wine or dry sherry 4 tablespoons light soy sauce Peanut oil 1 heaping tablespoon light brown sugar 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped 2-inch piece ginger, peeled and freshly grated 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 to 2-inch pieces 12 ounces Chinese long beans, trimmed and cut into thirds 1 Fresno chili, seeded and chopped for garnish<br> Instructions: Put the bean sauce, honey, rice wine, light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon peanut oil, brown sugar, dark soy sauce garlic and ginger into a bowl and stir to combine.

Use the tenderizer side for a few whacks at the end. Sprinkle both sides of the pork chop with salt and pepper. Finely crush the butter crackers in a large plastic resealable bag. In a small baking dish, combine the flour and cayenne. In a second dish combine the buttermilk and hot sauce. Add the crushed crackers to a third dish. Dredge a pork chop through the flour mixture, dusting off any excess, then through the buttermilk, letting excess drip off, and then through the crushed crackers, making sure to coat on each side. Set on a sheet tray and continue with the remaining chops. Rest the chops for 10 minutes in the refrigerator. This will help the breading stick to the chops. Fill a large high-sided skillet halfway with vegetable oil and heat until a deep-frying thermometer inserted into the oil reaches 375 degrees F. Using tongs, carefully place the pork chops in batches, into the hot oil. Fry, flipping once halfway through cooking (only if the chops are not submerged), until golden brown and fully cooked, about 8 minutes.

Line 2 muffin pans with 18 to 19 cupcake liners. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Place the strawberries in a food processor and process until pureed. Measure out 1/2 cup of the puree, and reserve the extra for the frosting. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix the strawberry puree, eggs, Champagne, butter, and vegetable oil on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed, and add the dry ingredients a little bit at a time, making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary. Mix until just combined. Fill the cupcake liners 3/4 of the way full, and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. For the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy whipping cream on high speed until soft peaks form, about 4 minutes. (While whipping the cream, place a washcloth over the mixer to prevent splatters on countertop.) While the cream is whipping, melt the marshmallows in a heat-proof bowl in the microwave on high for 15 seconds. Stir with a rubber spatula, and plop the melted marshmallows into the whipping cream once the soft peaks are reached. Continue to whip until stiff peaks are formed. Turn the speed to medium and add the sugar and 1/4 cup reserved strawberry puree. Whip until all the ingredients are incorporated, about 30 seconds. To assemble: With a pastry brush, brush the tops of the cooled cupcakes with the Champagne Simple Syrup. Place the frosting in a piping bag with a tip of your choice, and pipe a large dollop or multiple swirls on the tops of the cupcakes. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stir the Champagne and sugar together with a wooden spoon until the sugar has completely dissolved. Reduce the heat to medium, and continue to cook until the mixture has reduced to about half and can line the back of the spoon, about 5 minutes.

Place the lobsters into the boiling water, making sure you leave the rubber bands on the claws (to avoid being pinched). Boil covered for about 15 minutes, then remove to a tray. (If using lobster tails only, the cooking time will be less. Boil until the meat is no longer translucent.) To shell the lobster, separate the tail from the body by lightly twisting. Remove the claws, and using a lobster cracker or nut cracker, extract the lobster meat and place on a serving platter. Put the melted butter in appropriately sized bowls for dipping the lobster pieces and enjoy! Note: You can keep the stock from the pot for when you need stock (for soups or other recipes) in the future.

Simmer it for about 5 minutes, or until the froth subsides and the butter looks clear. Don&#39;t let it burn. Strain the butter through a fine-mesh strainer, a triple layer of cheesecloth, or a coffee filter. Let the butter cool for 5 minutes, if the butter is too hot it will curdle the egg yolks. Combine 3 egg yolks and 3 tablespoons butter in a bowl, and whisk off heat for 1 minute, until frothy. Place yolks on stovetop over medium-low heat and beat until thick. Meanwhile drain cooked asparagus, and toss with 1 tablespoon of butter. Remove yolks from heat, if they have not been removed already and whisk in remaining butter. Stir in the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Plate the asparagus and sauce. Bring about 6 quarts of water to a rapid boil in a covered pot large enough to hold the asparagus. Cut the bottom section- usually about 1 to 2 inches off the asparagus stalks with a sharp knife. Peel the asparagus by laying them flat, one at a time, on a cutting board. If the asparagus are thinner than 1/2-inch, use a vegetable peeler and peel the asparagus starting at the base of the tip and peeling them all the way down to the base, eliminating the fibrous peel and revealing the pale green flesh. If the asparagus are very thick or woody, use a paring knife and start peeling from the base. When ready to cook, toss the salt into the boiling water and carefully lower in the asparagus. Turn the heat to low and simmer the asparagus, uncovered, until the spears are easily penetrated with a knife, usually after about 5 minutes but from 1 minute for very thin asparagus to 12 minutes for the very thickest. If serving cold asparagus, plunge the hot cooked asparagus into ice water or rinse under cold water in a colander. Pat dry. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 67833,&quot;Blackened Catfish with Harissa Mayo 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon ground coriander 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder 1/2 teaspoon cayenne Kosher salt and finely ground black pepper Four 10- to- 12-ounce skinless catfish fillets 1/2 cup mayonnaise 2 teaspoons harissa 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons olive oil Cilantro leaves and lemon wedges, for serving Instructions: Stir the coriander, cumin, five-spice, cayenne, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper together in a small bowl.

Prepare the tomatoes. In a large bowl, mix the tomatoes, 1/4 cup of the oil, the vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper, to taste. Spread the tomatoes out on a non-reactive baking sheet. Roast the tomatoes in the oven until very dark in spots, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove and allow to cool a bit. Prepare the bruschetta. Cut the bread crosswise into slices about 1-inch thick (you will need 8 slices). Lightly brush the slices on both sides with oil and season with salt. Place the slices on a baking sheet and toast in the oven until the bruschetta are golden brown and just beginning to crisp, about 6 minutes. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine remaining 1/4 cup oil, the onions, and a pinch of salt. Cook until the onions are very soft, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the 2 cups basil leaves and saute with the onions for about 1 minute. Add the roasted tomatoes and water to the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Puree the tomato mixture in a blender. Start the motor at a slow speed and increase gradually. Alternatively you can use an immersion blender right in the pot.

Heat a pot just wide enough to comfortably fit all 4 pieces of goat over medium-high. (You don?t want to cram the pieces together, but you don?t want too much extra room either.) Add 1/4 cup of the canola oil to the bottom of the empty pot when hot and heat until smoking. (You are looking for a nice white puffy smoke to appear; that&#39;s when you know it&#39;s hot enough for searing.) Carefully lay the goat into the hot pan. Sear the goat on each side until golden brown and a crust forms, about 2 minutes per side. Add the peppercorns, thyme, garlic, bay leaves, carrot and onion to the pot. Cover with the stock and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a gentle simmer and cook until the meat is tender and falling off the bone, about 3 hours. Let the meat cool to room temperature in the liquid. Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a small pot and cover with water. Season the water with salt. Bring just to a boil, immediately turn down to just below a simmer and cook gently until the potatoes are tender. Cool the potatoes in the liquid to retain flavor and moisture. When cool, remove the potatoes from the liquid and store in the refrigerator. Repeat the process for the potatoes with the baby carrots in a separate pot. Remove the goat meat from the liquid using a slotted spoon and place it in a clean empty pan. Gently pull apart and shred the meat. If the meat is too hot to handle, use a fork. Take care while shredding to remove any extra fat, sinew or vegetables. You want just clean shredded goat meat. Using a mesh strainer, pour just enough of the cooking liquid over the shredded meat to cover. Remove excess fat from the top of the liquid by skimming with a small spoon or ladle. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of canola oil in a small saute pan until smoking. Add the potatoes and carrots, season with salt and pepper, and saute until a little golden brown, about 4 minutes. In a small saucepan, warm the goat in its liquid. Stir in the sour cream. Check for seasoning, adding a little salt and pepper if needed. In a flat bowl or large plate, arrange the carrots and potatoes in the center in a ring, leaving a little room in the middle. Spoon the goat meat in the middle, allowing it to gently cover a little of the vegetables, but not all. Top with the Potato Straws and dill sprigs. Preheat the oil in a deep fryer to 250 degrees F. Slice the potato using a Japanese mandoline with the medium julienne attachment into a container with cold water. Rinse the sliced potatoes under running water until the water runs clear. Remove from the water, pat dry, and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove from the oil onto a tray lined with paper towels to absorb any excess grease. . Season with a little salt and reserve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67856,&quot;Biscuit Love Banana Jam 2 cups granulated sugar 3 cups sliced bananas 1/2 teaspoon salt<br> 1 tablespoon lime juice<br> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract Warm biscuits, for serving Instructions: Mix the sugar and 1/4 cup water in a heavy-bottomed large saucepan. Heat the sugar mixture on high heat until the mixture caramelizes; the water will need to evaporate before the sugar will caramelize. Once the caramel reaches a deep brown color, turn the heat to low and carefully add the bananas. Stir with a wooden or heat-resistant spoon until the bananas begin to break down, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the salt and remove from the heat. Stir in the lime juice and vanilla. Serve with warm biscuits. The jam will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Sparkling wine]&quot; 67857,&quot;Pan-Grilled Scallops on Green Gazpacho 4 Lebanese cucumbers or 1/2 English cucumber, peeled and small diced 3 canned tomatillos, peels removed and, quartered, or 3 fresh tomatillos, peeled and diced 3 green onions, finely diced 1 clove garlic, peeled and minced 1/4 cup olive oil Coarse or kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 5 sea scallops, shells reserved Canola Oil, for frying Olive oil, for drizzling Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: To make the gazpacho: Add the diced cucumbers, tomatillos, onions, and garlic to a mixing bowl.

To make the scallops: Score the scallops with a small knife in a checkerboard pattern.<br> In a hot pan, add enough canola oil to line the bottom and sear the scallops on both sides until barely cooked through, about 30 seconds per side. Once cooked, they should just lose their translucent color. Serve the scallops by arranging the scallop shells on a platter. Place a dollop of the gazpacho onto each shell, and then top with a single seared scallop. Add a drizzle of olive oil and, lastly, a dusting of salt, and pepper. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 67858,&quot;Tomato Choka 8 to 10 plum tomatoes, washed Salt, to taste 4 cloves garlic 1/2 jalapeno or Scotch bonnet pepper 2 sprigs cilantro/culantro 1/3 cup corn oil 1 small sliced onion Instructions: Insert skewers in tomatoes and lay on open flame or cut in half.

Pile the kielbasa mixture on one side of each foil sheet. Fold the foil over and crimp the edges to seal well. Grill the packets, rotating them occasionally so they don&#39;t burn, until the vegetables are tender, 18 to 22 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the vinegar with the remaining 1 cup orange juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 thyme sprigs in a medium skillet; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil and cook until syrupy and reduced to about 3 tablespoons, 5 to 7 minutes. Discard the thyme. Open the foil packets, drizzle with the sauce and sprinkle with celery leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67868,&quot;Shrimp and Zucchini Skewers 24 large shrimp, peeled and tailed 24 thin zucchini ribbons* 1/4 cup/60 ml olive oil 1/2 teaspoon cl pepper flakes 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint or basil Salt Instructions: Preheat a grill.

There should be no crust left. Slice the block in half lengthwise, making 2 planks. In a large bowl, whisk the heavy cream, chili powder, sriracha, eggs, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Pour the mixture into a wide flat dish, large enough to dunk the bread. Carefully dip each plank in the egg mixture, coating all sides. Heat a griddle over medium-high heat and melt the butter. Add the bread planks and cook on all sides until the batter is set and the bread is light golden, 4 to 5 minutes on each large side, and another 2 minutes for each edge. For the filling: While still on the griddle, spread the raspberry jam on the entire top of one plank. Top with 4 slices of Gruyere, then all of the ham and turkey, shredding the meat as you go. Then cover with the remaining 4 slices of Gruyere. Like Jeff Mauro says, \\crust to crust is a must!\\ In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise and mustard together. Spread this mixture on the top of the remaining plank and lay it, mayonnaise-side down, on the other topped plank. Put an overturned metal bowl over the sandwich and cook a few minutes more to melt the cheese. For the finish: Carefully remove to a baking sheet and allow to cool slightly. Dust with powdered sugar and use a serrated knife to cut 1 1/2-inch finger planks along the length. Serve with maple syrup to drizzle or dunk. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 67870,&quot;Basic Brown Sauce 1 veal shank 2 veal knuckle bones Salt and pepper, to taste 2 tablespoons olive oil 5 tablespoons tomato paste, divided 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 onion, cut in half 1 garlic bulb, cut in half 2 celery ribs, cut in chunks 2 carrots, cut in chunks 1 bunch fresh thyme 1 bottle dry red wine 1 quart water 1 quart beef broth, low sodium Bouquet Garni, (thyme, parsley, bay leaves, peppercorns) Instructions: Place the veal shank and knucklebones in a roasting pan, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil.

Work the butter pieces into the flour with your fingers until the mixture becomes coarse and sandy. Add the egg yolk and the white wine and mix until it becomes a smooth dough. Spread a piece of plastic wrap on a flat surface and place the dough in the center. Wrap the plastic loosely around it and press the dough to fill the gap. Flattening the dough will mean less rolling later. Let it rest in the fridge for a few minutes while you make the filling. For the filling: In a medium bowl, whisk the ricotta until smooth. Sift in the powdered sugar, cinnamon and allspice. Mix to blend. In a separate bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), beat the heavy cream until fairly stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the cream into the ricotta mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips. Lightly zest the exterior of the lemon and stir it into the ricotta. Refrigerate for a half hour to an hour. To roll and fry the shells: In a medium pot with a heavy bottom, heat the canola oil to 360 degrees F. Meanwhile, sift an even layer of flour on a flat surface. Flour a rolling pin. Roll the dough until it is very thin (about 1/8-inch thick). Cut the dough into fourths and work in small batches. Use any glass or small bowl that has a 3-to-4-inch diameter. Cut rounds, tracing around each one to assure the dough has been fully cut. You should have about 24 circles. Wrap each circle around a cannoli mold. Use a little of the egg wash on the edge of each round to seal it shut and to assure it won&#39;t slide or fall off the mold before pressing it closed over the mold. Flare the edges out slightly from the mold. Flaring will allow the oil to penetrate each cannoli shell as they fry. Use a pair of tongs to hold the edge of the mold as you submerge and fry the shell in the oil until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oil, and holding the mold in one had with your tongs, gently grip the shell in your other hand with a kitchen towel and carefully slide it off the mold. Set aside to cool. Repeat with all of the circles. To fill the cannolis: Just before serving, use a pastry bag without a tip to pipe the ricotta into the cannoli molds. Fill the cannoli shells from both ends so the cream runs through the whole shell. Dust with powdered sugar. Powdered sugar gives that little extra sweetness and added texture to the exterior. It also makes me feel like I have a professional bakery touch in my own home.

Grease four 8-inch round cake pans and two 5-inch round cake pans with flour-based baking spray Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. Beat the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. With the mixer running, gradually add the granulated sugar and beat until the mixture turns pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture. Stir in the vanilla. Beat until just combined. Do not over-mix. Beat the egg whites in a clean mixer bowl on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter in 3 additions. Place 2 cups of cake batter in 4 separate bowls. Tint the first bowl with the green food color, the second bowl with 1 tablespoon of the purple food color and the third bowl with the orange food color. Combine the cocoa and water in a small bowl, stirring well to create a paste, then add it to the fourth bowl of batter. Fold in the black food color and stir together well until the batter is dark and no streaks of white batter remain. Pour one color of batter into each of the prepared 8-inch pans.<br> Tint the leftover batter with the remaining 1 tablespoon purple food color and place 1 cup of batter in each of the prepared 5-inch pans.<br> Bake until the cakes spring back when pressed in the center, about 25 minutes for the 5-inch cake layers and 30 to 35 minutes for the 8-inch cake layers. Run a knife around the edges of the cakes and the pans and turn them out on wire racks to cool. For the frosting: In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, mix together the confectioners&#39; sugar and butter. Begin on low speed until crumbly, then increase to high and beat for 3 minutes until smooth and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and beat again for another minute.

Then stack cut pieces of potatoes and cut them into 3/8-inch square pieces. Submerge the potatoes in a large bowl of water and let sit for 30 minutes. This will help leach the excess starch from the potatoes and keep them from oxidizing. While potatoes are soaking, prepare the sauce: Combine all ingredients in a nonreactive pan and heat over medium-high. Adjust heat to a simmer and reduce by half. Heat a heavy stock pot with the oil to 325 degrees F over medium heat. (Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature.) Remove potatoes from the water and pat dry. Carefully add 2 handfuls of potatoes to the hot oil. There should be at least 1-inch of oil above the potatoes. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until potatoes are light brown. Remove potatoes, with a slotted spoon, shake off excess oil and place on a rack to cool. Repeat until all of the potatoes are par-cooked. After all the potatoes have been par-cooked, heat oil up to 350 degrees F over medium heat. Add 2 handfuls of par-cooked potatoes, and cook for 2 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oil, with a slotted spoon, shake off excess oil. Transfer potatoes to a serving bowl and season lightly with salt and pepper. Repeat this method until all potatoes are fried.

Coat a large saute pan with olive oil, toss in 2 of the garlic cloves and a pinch of crushed red pepper and bring the pan to a medium-high heat. When the garlic is golden and very aromatic, remove it and toss it in the \\thank you for coming bowl. Add half of the mushrooms to the pan, season with salt and cook until they are soft and wilted. Remove from the pan and reserve. Repeat this whole process--starting with the oil and garlic--with the remaining mushrooms, followed by the spinach in 2 batches. Drain and cool the cooked spinach in a colander or mesh strainer. In a large bowl combine the ricotta and parsley. To assemble: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place a ladleful of the pork ragu in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and spread it around to LIGHTLY cover the bottom of the dish. Arrange an even layer of the roasted squash on top of the ragu; be sure the squash completely covers the surface of the baking dish--this acts as the \\pasta. Cover the squash layer generously with more ragu. Spoon 1-tablespoon scoops of the ricotta mixture over the ragu. Arrange an even layer of spinach and mushrooms over the ricotta. Sprinkle with the grated Parmesan. Lay another layer of squash over the Parmesan and repeat the process until the baking dish is full, ending with a top layer of squash topped with a little ragu and Parmesan. Cover the baking dish with foil, place on a sheet tray and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Dolcetto, Valpolicella]&quot; 67909,&quot;Pasta with Beans, Crispy Lunch Meat, Greens and Garlic Salt One 1-pound box pasta (I&#39;m using gemelli) 1/4 cup oil (I&#39;m using olive oil) 8 ounces lunch meat, sliced thin (I&#39;m using salami) 2 cloves garlic, sliced One 15-ounce can beans, rinsed (I&#39;m using chickpeas) 2 cups fresh greens (I&#39;m using spinach) 2 tablespoons grated hard cheese (I&#39;m using Parmesan) 1 teaspoon cl flakes, optional Instructions: Bring a pot of water to a boil and salt liberally.

For the couscous: Set up a small pot of boiling water and season liberally with salt. Add the couscous and cook until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat a large saute pan with some oil over medium-high heat. Add the sliced fennel and onions and season with salt. Cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the zucchini and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chickpeas, saffron, chicken stock and cooked couscous. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the chicken stock has reduced, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and toss in the chopped fennel fronds. For the lamb: Add the parsley, panko, pistachios, oil, rosemary and salt to taste to a bowl. Mix well to combine then set aside. Cut the rack of lamb in half so you have two pieces with four bones each. Sprinkle liberally with salt on all sides. Heat a large saute pan with some oil over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers. Sear the lamb, fat side down, until golden brown and a crust begins to form, about 5 minutes. Flip the lamb and sear on the underside as well as each side until golden brown, another few minutes each. Remove the lamb from the pan, place onto a sheet tray and discard the excess fat in the pan. Reserve the pan for the sauce. Place the rack of lamb into the oven and bake until the internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer when inserted into the center of the meat, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the top side of the racks evenly with the mustard. Press the pistachio herb crust onto the rack, ensuring the crust adheres to the mustard. Place the crusted rack of lamb back into the oven until the crust is golden and the lamb reaches 135 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest before slicing. Once rested, slice each lamb rack into double chops. To the same pan that the lamb was cooked in, add some oil, the fennel, onions, crushed red pepper and salt to taste. Saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, garlic and harissa and stir to combine. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and cook until the sauce reduces by half and has slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve the sliced lamb alongside the couscous. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Tempranillo]&quot; 67913,&quot;Hunter&#39;s Hero 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 red onion, diced to equal 1 cup 1/2 red bell pepper, minced to equal 1/2 cup 5 cloves garlic, minced to equal 2 tablespoons 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup 2 percent milk 2 slices sourdough bread, crust removed, cut into 1/2-inch pieces to equal 1 cup 1 pound ground beef (80/20 fat content) 1 pound ground pork sausage, casings removed 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil leaves 2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano leaves 2 tablespoons minced Italian parsley leaves 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons red chili flakes 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan plus 2 tablespoons shredded, for garnish 1 egg, beaten 4 hoagie rolls 1 cup Marinara Sauce, recipe follows 12 slices mozzarella, about 3/4 pound 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 yellow onion, minced 4 medium garlic cloves, smashed 6 cups canned San Marzano tomatoes 1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh basil leaves 1/2 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh oregano leaves Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat broiler.<br> In a large saute pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon oil and saute onions, bell peppers and garlic.

Whisk the eggs in a bowl. When cream mixture reaches 130 degrees F on a thermometer, quickly whisk in the eggs. Cook, stirring constantly, until the thermometer registers 170 degrees F. Remove from the heat and pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve. Whisk the blackberry puree into the custard, then cool over an ice bath. Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Meanwhile, combine the raspberry puree and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced by one-third. Let cool. When the ice cream is done churning, transfer it to a rectangular container. Drop spoonfuls of the raspberry mixture on top of the ice cream and swirl in with a butter knife. Freeze. For the lemon-rosemary olive oil cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch springform pan (or 8 individual springform pans) with vegetable spray. Combine the sugar and eggs in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment; mix just to combine. With the mixer on low speed, slowly drizzle in the olive oil, making sure the oil is well incorporated and emulsified. Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a bowl. In a second bowl or a measuring cup, combine the milk, lemon juice, lemon zest and rosemary. Add the flour to the stand mixer in three additions, alternating with the milk mixture (2 additions). Begin and end with the flour, and be sure to whisk well after each addition--the batter will be runny. Pour the batter in the prepared springform pan. Bake until the cake is a deep golden brown and bounces back when lightly pressed, 45 to 55 minutes (20 to 25 minutes for individual pans). Cool to room temperature on a rack, then remove the cake from the pan. For the lemon-rosemary glaze: In a bowl, whisk together the confectioners&#39; sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and rosemary until a glaze consistency similar to heavy cream is achieved. Adjust the consistency with more lemon juice or powdered sugar as needed. For the candied lemon peel: Combine the sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then turn off heat. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the zest from the lemons; slice thinly. Blanch the lemon zest twice in boiling water, changing the water in between. After the second blanching, strain and add the lemon zest to the simple syrup. Bring the simple syrup to a boil, then turn off the heat and let the lemon zest sit in the simple syrup until translucent and cooled. For the black salt sugar cookies: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and confectioners&#39; sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and egg and mix until combined. Add the salt and flour and mix until a dough forms. Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 to 45 minutes. Roll out the dough to a 1/4-inch thickness, then cut out cookies using a raindrop-shaped cutter. Transfer the cookies to a parchment-lined baking sheet and sprinkle lightly with black sea salt and blue sanding sugar. Bake in a 350-degree oven until golden brown at the edges, 12 to 14 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper; add more dressing if needed, reserving a little for fish. For the rub: Combine the ancho powder, cinnamon, cumin, salt, brown sugar and black pepper in a bowl. Mix to blend. For the fish: Brush the top of the fish filets with canola oil, and sprinkle them with salt, pepper and about 3 tablespoons of the spice rub. Let stand for 5 minutes, then grill the filets, spice-side down, over direct heat until the fish is lightly charred and comes away from the grill easily, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook another 2 minutes to sear on the reverse side. Move the fish over indirect heat, cover the grill, and cook until the fish is just cooked through, another 3 to 4 minutes; the fish should be just firm when squeezed lightly on the sides. Remove the fish to a platter and let rest for a few minutes. While the fish rests, grill the tortillas over direct heat until slightly charred and just warm, about 5 seconds per side. With a fork, flake the fish into large chunks. Drizzle with the remaining slaw dressing and top with cilantro leaves. Serve the fish family-style with the tortillas and butter lettuce (for wrapping), and the avocado relish, tomato crema, and cabbage slaw in bowls on the side. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Grenache Blanc]&quot; 67925,&quot;Caramel Ice Cream 2 cups sugar 1 1/4 cups water 2 1/2 cups half-and-half 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 9 egg yolks 3/4 cup sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup Crema (recipe follows) 2 cups heavy cream 1/4 cup buttermilk Instructions: Caramel: In a small, heavy saucepan combine the sugar and the water. Be sure all sugar granules are washed down from pot sides (you can use a pastry brush dipped in water to brush down the sides). Cook over moderate heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until color is golden brown and the mixture smells like caramel. This will take about 10 to 15 minutes. When it is a deep golden color, plunge the bottom of the pot into cold water to immediately stop the cooking (otherwise the heat of the caramel will keep it cooking long after you remove it from the heat, and it could burn). Immediately and with great care, pour the hot caramel onto a large sheet of greased parchment paper on top of a baking sheet. Set aside until cool, then crack into 1/2inch pieces. Ice cream: Combine cream and half-and-half in a medium, heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil. In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until thick and pale yellow. Pour in the boiling liquid and stir until combined. Stir in the vanilla. Strain into a large container and refrigerate until cold, or place in a bowl nested in a larger bowl of iced water and stir occasionally until cold. Stir in the Crema. Pour into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturers instructions. When ice cream is done, fold in the reserved caramel pieces. Store in freezer 1 to 2 days. In large bowl whisk together cream and buttermilk. Cover and set in a warm place (a gas oven with just the heat from the pilot light for example) for 8 hours. Place in refrigerator. Can be kept for up to a week. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewrztraminer, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 67926,&quot;Butterflied Tea- and Orange-Brined Roasted Turkey with Cumin-Coriander Compound Butter 5 oranges 2 cups kosher salt 1 cup bourbon 1 cup sugar 12 black peppercorns 12 plain tea bags 6 whole cloves 4 bay leaves One 14- to 16-pound turkey (not kosher or self-basting), butterflied 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 2 teaspoons cumin seeds 6 cloves garlic 1 tablespoon paprika Instructions: Remove the zest from the oranges in wide strips using a vegetable peeler, applying only gentle pressure so that most of the white pith is left behind. Reserve the zest, juice the oranges and strain the juice into a small saucepan. Add the zest, salt, bourbon, sugar, peppercorns, tea bags, cloves, bay leaves and 1 quart (4 cups) of water. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let the mixture sit for 30 minutes. Pour the brine into a plastic container or pot large enough to hold the turkey, add 5 quarts (20 cups) ice water and stir to combine. Submerge the turkey, adding more ice water if needed. Weight it down with a plate to keep it submerged and refrigerate at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. Drain, rinse and pat the turkey dry. Place on a large paper-towel-lined cutting board and let sit out at room temperature until it reaches room temperature, about 1 hour. Place the butter in a medium bowl. Pulse the coriander, cumin and garlic in a food processor or mini chopper until it resembles a coarse paste. Add to the bowl with the butter and sprinkle in the paprika. Stir until completely combined. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Pat the turkey skin dry again and rub the compound butter evenly over the surface, also pushing some underneath the skin of the breasts. Lay the turkey in a large roasting pan as flat as possible. If the pan is a bit small, tuck the wings behind the back with the drumsticks resting on the ledge of the pan and place a large rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil at the bottom of the oven to catch drippings. Roast, basting the turkey with the pan drippings every 30 minutes or so, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh registers 165 degrees F, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 30 minutes before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67927,&quot;Chicken Cutlets with Orange and Arugula 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano A little fresh grated nutmeg A handful flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 1 orange, zested 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 eggs, beaten 4 small boneless, skinless chicken breasts, about 6 ounces each Salt and freshly ground black pepper Olive oil or vegetable oil, for frying 2 seedless oranges 2 yellow or orange tomatoes, seeded and diced 1 sprig fresh oregano, leaves finely chopped, optional 1/2 small red onion or 2 to 3 scallions, chopped 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 cups baby arugula leaves Instructions: Combine the bread crumbs, cheese, nutmeg, parsley, and orange zest in a shallow bowl. Put the flour in another bowl and the eggs in a third bowl. Cut the chicken breasts horizontally being sure not to cut all the way through to the other side so it will open like a book. Once the chicken is butterflied, lightly pound the chicken between waxed paper, parchment or plastic wrap into 4 large, very thin cutlets. Season the cutlets with salt and pepper and coat with the flour, then the egg and then the bread crumbs. Heat a 1/2-inch of frying oil in very large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the cutlets 1 or 2 at a time, depending on the size of the pan. As cutlets are done, transfer to a baking rack to drain. Cutlets may be served room temperature but you want them to remain crisp. While the cutlets cook, working next to the stove, peel and section the oranges and dice. Add them to a large bowl along with the tomatoes, oregano, if using, onion, extra-virgin olive oil and salt and pepper, to taste. Toss and when ready to serve fold in the arugula leaves. Transfer the cutlets to serving plates and top with mounds of orange and arugula salad before serving. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Vermentino]</p><p>&quot; 67928,&quot;Farmer&#39;s Breakfast 2 tablespoons butter One 5-inch-wide piece of country ham<br> Honey, for brushing<br> 3 thick pieces breakfast sausage<br> 3 thick slices bacon<br> 2 large eggs<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Crispy Bits Breakfast Potatoes, recipe follows Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 pounds red potatoes 1/4 cup olive oil<br> 4 tablespoons butter, melted<br> Instructions: In a large nonstick skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-high heat. Brush the ham lightly with honey, then fry it until the texture is firm, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet. Next, fry the sausage and bacon together. The sausage is ready when browned nicely, about 3 minutes per side; the bacon is cooked when crisp, 7 to 10 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet. Pour out the excess grease but do not wipe out the skillet. Add the second tablespoon of butter to the skillet and heat until melted. Crack the eggs into the skillet and fry for 2 minutes, sprinkling on some salt and pepper. Flip the eggs and cook them for another 45 seconds. Serve the eggs, sausage, bacon and ham on a platter, plus a pile of Crispy Bits Breakfast Potatoes. Bring salted water to a boil in a medium pot. Add the potatoes and boil until nearly fork-tender (but not falling apart), about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to dry thoroughly, then cut into wedges.

Add 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips and 1 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil to a heatproof glass bowl and place the bowl over a simmering pot of water. Let cook, stirring the chocolate, until it has melted completely, about 5 minutes. Pour into the prepared pan, covering the bottom. Place in the freezer until set, 1 to 2 hours. Mix together the powdered sugar, marshmallow creme, peanut butter and milk in a medium bowl until it has a soft, doughlike consistency (this mixture is incredibly sticky, and you may need to use your hands). Remove the pan from the freezer, then wet your fingertips and press the marshmallow filling down over the chocolate in an even layer. Sprinkle the peanuts on top and press lightly into the filling. Set aside. Add the caramels and cream to a small saucepot and cook over low heat, stirring, until the caramels are melted, 5 to 8 minutes. Spread the caramel over the marshmallow filling and place in the refrigerator for 5 minutes.<br> Meanwhile, melt the remaining 1 1/2 cups chocolate and 1 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil in a heatproof bowl over simmering water. Spread the chocolate over the top of the caramel, then place back in the refrigerator until chocolate is fully set and hardened, about 1 hour. Using the parchment, pull the candy out of the pan, then run a knife under warm water and cut into 14 bars. Cut 6 of the bars into small chunks to be used in the salad. (Refrigerate the remaining bars for another use.) For the pudding: Meanwhile, combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt in a medium saucepan. Whisk in the egg yolks, then the heavy cream. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it&#39;s thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and pour the mixture into a heatproof bowl. Cover with plastic wrap pressed against the surface of the pudding. Refrigerate until cooled, about 1 hour or up to overnight.<br> For the salad: Add the cream and powdered sugar to a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Reserve 2 cups whipped cream in a separate bowl for the topping. Fold the pudding into the remaining whipped cream, then gently fold in the apple slices and candy bar pieces. Serve the salad in individual glass jars or bowls garnished with dollops of whipped cream and sprinkles. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio, Moscato]&quot; 67932,&quot;Dubliner Steamed Mussels 4 ounces thickly sliced bacon, diced 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped onion 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1/2 cup dark beer 1 pound mussels, debearded and scrubbed 1 tablespoon butter 1/4 cup sauerkraut 4 ounces cooked fingerling potatoes, halved Kosher salt Instructions: Heat a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium heat; add the bacon.

First, design your centerpiece. I drew 3 artistic shapes onto cardboard and then cut out the shapes to make templates. Roll out the PlayDough and cut long ropes that are about an inch wide and 1/2-inch deep. Place a silpat baking mat on a baking sheet. Using the template as a guide, recreate the shape with PlayDough formed directly on the baking sheet. I also used concentric circles to form all of the base pieces of the centerpiece. I used 2 (12-inch) cake rings, a 10-inch ring, and an 8-inch ring. Lightly coat the inside of each ring with vegetable cooking spray. Set the rings on baking sheets covered with silpat baking mats. Now you are ready to cook the sugar. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. When the sugar has cooked, add the color. I used a whisk to mix in some white color. Then, I added red but I did not mix it completely. Let the heat of the sugar mix the red. Immediately pour the marbled sugar inside the cake rings and inside the PlayDough forms. Allow the sugar to cool completely. To stick the sugar pieces together, use a blow torch. The process is using the flame to gently melt the place where the 2 pieces will be joined. I \\glued\\ my largest upright piece to my largest circle. Make a few passes with the flame and you will see the sugar start to melt. Use that process to put all of the pieces of the centerpiece together. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]&quot; 67935,&quot;Dr. White&#39;s Orange Cream Cake 4 egg whites, room temperature 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1 1/4 cups sugar 6 egg yolks 1 cup all-purpose flour 3/4 cup orange juice 1 teaspoon double acting baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup water 2 cups whipping cream 3 tablespoons powdered sugar 2 tablespoons grated orange peel Instructions: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a large bowl with mixer at high speed, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Beating at high speed, gradually sprinkle in 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating until each addition is completely dissolved. Do not scrape sides of bowl at any time. Whites should stand in stiff peaks. Set aside. In a large bowl with mixer at high speed, beat egg yolks until thick and lemon colored. Continue beating, gradually sprinkling in 1/2 cup sugar; beat until pale yellow. Reduce to low speed; add flour, 1/4 cup orange juice, baking powder and salt until well mixed, occasionally scraping bowl with spatula. Using a spatula, fold the egg white mixture into the yolk mixture until just blended. Line 2, 9 inch round cake pans with waxed paper; do not grease. Pour batter into pans and bake for 40 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool cakes in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans and cool completely on racks. With fork, prick holes in cake layers. In a small saucepan over medium heat, boil 1/3 cup water, and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar for 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup orange juice. Drizzle evenly over layers and let stand for 30 minutes. In a small bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat cream and powdered sugar until soft peaks form. Fold in orange peel. Place one layer on serving platter and spread with 1/3 of whipped cream. Top with second layer. Frost top and sides with remaining cream. Garnish with orange sections or candied orange peel and fresh mint sprigs. Refrigerate. For best results in whipping cream, chill the bowl and the beaters beforehand. For a variation on the orange cake, spread a thinlayer of marmalade between the layers. Dr. White also calls this cake \\waxed paper\\ cake and warns not to forget to remove the waxed paper before icing, as he once did. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato]</p><p>&quot; 67936,&quot;Bbq Shrimp Pie 4 (4 to 5- inch) tart shells, cooked 2 pounds sweet potatoes, roasted and peeled 2 oranges, zested and juiced 1/2 cup light brown sugar Pinch ground cloves 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon cinnamon Pinch salt 4 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper 1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary 16 jumbo shrimp, peeled in center, head and tail intact, about 2 pounds 2 teaspoons seafood seasoning 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup beer 1/2 cup seafood stock 1 lemon, juiced Instructions: For the Sweet Potato Filling: Process ingredients until blended.

To the water, add the lemon halves, garlic, thyme, coriander seeds, bay leaves, salt and wine. Bring the pot back to a boil, then add the lobster and cook until bright red, 10 minutes. Remove the lobster from the water and set aside to cool. When cool enough to handle, remove the tail, claw and knuckle meat and reserve the shells and bodies. Keep 2 pieces of claw meat whole and reserve. Slice 1 tail lengthwise into 4 pieces and reserve. Dice the remaining tail into large chunks along with the remaining claw meat and knuckle meat. Set aside. For the risotto: Warm the chicken stock in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the reserved lobster shells and bodies to the stock. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, season with kosher salt and a pinch of crushed red pepper and saute until the onions are translucent, 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat with the olive oil and onion.

Combine the ricotta and sugar in a small bowl and whip until smooth. Add the mascarpone and stir to incorporate. Be careful not to overmix, or the mascarpone might separate. Fold in the pistachios and dried cranberries with their soaking liquid. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip and pipe the mixtrue into the cannoli shells. If you don&#39;t have a pastry bag, put the filling into a plastic bag, snip off 1 corner, and squeeze the filling out into the pastry shells. (Do this close to serving time so the shells won&#39;t lose their crispness.) Refrigerate until serving time. To serve, dust with confectioners&#39; sugar, using a sieve. Serve chilled. Prepare a sanitizing solution of 1 quart of water and 1 tablespoon of household bleach. Rinse a large stainless steel or enameled stockpot or soup pot with the sanitizing solution and pour the milk and cream into the pot. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring as necessary with a sanitized spoon so the milk doesn&#39;t scorch on the bottom of the pot. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the lemon juice. Continue stirring slowly until the milk curdles and white curds float to the top. Remove from the heat and cover. Wait for 5 minutes while the curds solidify slightly and become firmer. Rinse a colander and a large piece of muslin or several layers of cheesecloth in the sanitizing solution. Wring out the cloth to release the excess water. Line the colander with the cloth and set the colander in the sink or over a large bowl. Using a sanitized perforated spoon, gently ladle the curds into the colander. Let the whey drain for 30 minutes, or until the ricotta is still moist but fairly dry. After about 15 minutes, lift the edges of the cloth toward the center of the colander to loosen the cheese from the cloth and facilitate draining. If the ricotta is still too liquid and runny in texture after 30 minutes, gather the edges of the cloth together using 1 hand, wrap a piece of kitchen string around the gathered cloth to form a bag, and tie it closed. Hang the bag containing the cheese from the faucet or the handle of a kitchen cabinet door and allow the excess whey to drip from the bag into the sink or a bowl. If adding salt, transfer the ricotta to a sanitized bowl and stir in the salt. Place the ricotta in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator. Use within 5 days. Yield: 3 1/4 cups Cut the egg roll wrappers into circles 4 inches in diameter. Roll the wrappers around mold or pieces of aluminum tubing that are 1-inch in diameter and 4 1/2 to 5 inches in length. Moisten the overlapped flap of dough with water to seal each wrapper. Heat the oil in a large skillet until hot but not smoking, about 350 degrees F. Add the shells, still on the tubing, and fry, turning with tongs as necessary, until golden brown and cripsy on all sides. Remove immediately, using tongs, and stand the tubing on end on paper towels to drain. When cool, slip the cannoli shells off of the tubing.

Preheat the oven to 450 to 500 degrees F, then tear the punched-down dough into 4 pieces and roll each out on a floured surface. You want to get them roughly circular, about the thickness of a silver dollar, and 12 inches across. You can now either keep these in the refrigerator, stacked and separated with olive-oil-rubbed and flour-dusted aluminum foil, until you&#39;re ready to cook them, or you can put your topping on and cook them straightaway. Pour a large glug of olive oil into a hot frying pan. Add the mushrooms and toss briefly in the hot oil before adding the sliced garlic and the thyme. Fry until the mushrooms are cooked and smell fantastic. Drop in the butter and toss the mushrooms in it to make them tasty and shiny. Season with a little salt and pepper. Add the tomato sauce to the pan and stir. Cook for a few minutes, then add the spinach (in batches if you need to) and stir again. Simmer away the liquid until you&#39;re left with a thick, tasty mixture that&#39;s not too moist (otherwise it will burst through the dough when you&#39;re cooking the calzone). Divide the mushroom and spinach mixture evenly between the 4 pizza bases and spread it out nicely. Top with pieces of mozzarella and season with salt and pepper. To make your calzone, carefully lift the far edge of the Pizza Dough and pull it over the top toward you - you basically need to fold it in half (imagine it looking like a big Cornish pasty!). Crimp the edges so none of the filling can spill out. Place the calzone side by side on a floured baking sheet, (use 2 if needed), pizza stone or granite slab. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes on the bottom of the preheated oven until the dough is puffed up and golden on top and the filling is hot. Sift the flours and salt onto a clean work surface and make a well in the middle. In a large measuring cup, mix the yeast, sugar and olive oil into the water and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well. Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it into the liquid. Keep mixing, drawing larger amounts of flour in, and when it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in with your clean, flour-dusted hands. Knead until you have a smooth, springy dough. Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and flour the top of it. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place in a warm room for about 1 hour until the dough has doubled in size. Now remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a bit to push the air out with your hands - this is called punching down the dough. You can either use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in plastic wrap, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straightaway, divide the dough up into as many little balls as you want to make pizzas - this amount of dough is enough to make about six to eight medium pizzas. Timing-wise, it&#39;s a good idea to roll the pizzas out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them. Don&#39;t roll them out and leave them hanging around for a few hours, though - if you are working in advance like this it&#39;s better to leave your dough, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator. However, if you want to get them rolled out so there&#39;s 1 less thing to do when your guests are round, simply roll the dough out into rough circles, about 1/4-inch thick, and place them on slightly larger pieces of olive-oil-rubbed and flour-dusted aluminum foil. You can then stack the pizzas, cover them with plastic wrap, and pop them into the refrigerator. &quot;,&quot;[Barolo, Barbaresco, Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino]&quot; 67967,&quot;Green Curry Vegetables Kosher salt 2 cups small broccoli florets (1 small crown)<br> 2 cups small yellow cauliflower florets (1/2 head)<br> 2 cups sugar snap peas (6 ounces)<br> 1 tablespoon canola oil<br> 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and light green parts only, plus dark green part, thinly sliced, for garnish 1 tablespoon minced garlic (2 to 3 cloves)<br> 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger (a 2-inch knob)<br> One 13.5-ounce can coconut milk<br> 1 to 2 tablespoons green curry paste<br> 1 cup shredded carrots 2 cups finely shredded Napa cabbage<br> 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (1 1/2 limes)<br> 1 large avocado, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br> Instructions: Bring a pasta pot filled with salted water to a boil. Set up a large ice bath alongside. Blanch the broccoli and cauliflower in the boiling water until they have softened slightly and the broccoli is bright green, 2 minutes. Remove the vegetables to the ice bath. Add the snap peas to the boiling water and blanch until bright green, 1 minutes. Remove to the ice bath. Drain the blanched vegetables on a large baking sheet lined with paper towels, patting them dry to remove excess water. Cut the snap peas in half crosswise, put them in a large bowl and set aside. Heat the canola oil in a 12-inch saut pan over medium-high heat. Add the scallions, garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the coconut milk and 1 tablespoon green curry paste and bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the paste. Stir in the broccoli, cauliflower and carrots and simmer for 7 or 8 minutes, to meld the flavors and finish cooking the vegetables. Next, stir in the cabbage and lime juice; cook until the cabbage is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt. If you prefer more spice, add another tablespoon of curry paste and cook another 3 minutes, stirring. When you are happy with the flavor, remove the pan from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes. To serve, gently fold in the avocado and garnish with scallion greens. Serve at room temperature. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 67968,&quot;Beets With Creamy Balsamic Vinaigrette and Mint 3 cloves garlic, unpeeled 2 large beets (about 1 pound) 1/3 cup 2-percent plain Greek yogurt 1 tablespoon low-sodium vegetable broth or water 2 teaspoons white balsamic vinegar 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons fresh small mint leaves 1 tablespoon roasted or raw unsalted pistachios, chopped Instructions: Wrap the garlic cloves together in a piece of parchment paper; wrap each beet separately in parchment. Place the garlic and beets in a microwave-safe dish and cook for 3 minutes. Remove the garlic and set aside, still wrapped. Continue to cook the beets in intervals of 2 minutes, until they can be easily pierced with a knife, 8 to 10 minutes. Let sit wrapped in parchment to complete the cooking process and until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the yogurt, broth, vinegar, oil and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Peel the garlic cloves, mash completely and whisk into the vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper. (Alternatively, make the vinaigrette with the microwave-roasted garlic up to a few hours in advance to allow the flavors to blend. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.) Peel the beets using a paring knife and cut into wedges or slices. Arrange on a platter, drizzle with the vinaigrette and sprinkle with the mint and pistachios. Serve immediately, while still warm. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 67969,&quot;Glazed Pork Noodle 10 ounces dried rice vermicelli noodle 4 pounds pork, sliced 8 ounces minced scallion whites<br> 8 ounces minced yellow onions<br> 3 ounces fish sauce<br> 6 ounces sugar<br> 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper<br> 9 ounces vegetable oil 1 cup fish sauce 2 cups sugar 2 cups white vinegar 3 ounces lime juice 1 tablespoon samba chili, optional Romaine lettuce Bean sprouts Cucumber, sliced Pickled carrots, store-bought Daikon, store-bought Crispy shallots, store-bought Instructions: For the vermicelli noodles: In a medium pan, bring 2 quarts water to a boil. Add in the rice vermicelli noodle and stir to separate, then turn off and let it sit for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain in a basket and rinse with cold water, separating the noodles so they don&#39;t stick together. For the glazed pork: In a medium bowl, add the pork, onion head, yellow onion, fish sauce, sugar, black pepper and 6 ounces of the vegetable oil, and toss together. Let it sit in the fridge for about 2 hours. Heat the pan over high heat and add the remaining 3 ounces vegetable oil. When the oil is nearly smoking, add the batches of pork and pan sear until medium golden brown, then turn the heat down to medium low, flip the pork over and let it simmer for 30 minutes. For the chili-lime fish vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the fish sauce, sugar, white vinegar, lime juice, chili and 1 cup hot water and stir until the sugar dissolves. Let it sit for 20 minutes before serving. Line 4 bowls with some chopped romaine lettuce, bean sprouts and sliced cucumber. Top with the cooked rice vermicelli noodle. Place the cooked glazed pork on top of the noodle bowl and add the pickled carrots, daikon and crispy shallots.

Place the salmon, skin-side down, in a large resealable bag. Pour in the marinade and close the bag. Lightly massage to coat the salmon with the marinade. Place the bag flat on a sheet tray. Marinate for 12 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. Preheat the broiler (on low if you have a low and high setting). Line an 18-by-13-inch sheet pan with foil and fit with an 8 1/2-by-12-inch wire rack on one side. Drizzle or brush the rack and aluminum foil with some olive oil. Remove the salmon from the marinade and sprinkle with salt. Place the salmon fillets side-by-side, skin-side down, on top of the rack. Spread the broccolini in a single layer on the other half of the sheet pan and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle the broccolini with the crushed red pepper flakes and salt. Broil on the top rack until the salmon reaches 135 degrees F, 5 to 7 minutes.<br> If desired, remove the salmon skin from the fillets before serving. Serve the salmon and broccolini with a side of Coconut Rice. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Melt the coconut oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir. (This creates a nice fat barrier to ensure well-separated grains of rice.) Add the coconut milk, salt and 2 cups water to the pot. Give it a good stir and cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, then immediately lower to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, then take off the heat with the lid still on and let the rice rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place the shredded coconut on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Bake until golden brown and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve with the lime wedges and a nice sprinkle of toasted coconut. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sparkling Shiraz]</p><p>&quot; 67971,&quot;Sea Bass Crusted with Sesame Seed Candies 16 sesame seed candies 1 cup panko bread crumbs 3 teaspoons freshly chopped tarragon leaves 2 teaspoons freshly chopped chives 3 tablespoons canola oil, plus 4 tablespoons for cooking fish 2 pounds fresh seabass, cut into 6 portions 2 teaspoons stone-ground mustard Salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Grind the sesame seed candies into a rough powder, leaving a few chunks for texture. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix the 1 cup of bread crumbs, fresh herbs, ground sesame seed candies and the 3 tablespoons of oil together in a small bowl. The oil should wet the crumbs and will help to keep the crumbs on the fish. In a large hot skillet add 4 tablespoons of canola oil. When the oil is hot add the fish and sear 1 side until golden brown. Remove the fish from the pan to a large oven-proof serving dish and allow to cool slightly, around 3 minutes.

Place chicken in a bowl and season with grill seasoning. Add egg, half of the grated cheese, bread crumbs, parsley, and a serious drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil to the bowl. Mix the meat and form 12 large meatballs. Squish the balls to flatten them a bit like mini oval meatloaves. Be careful not to form the balls wider than your bread. The flattened balls will stay put on your sub, no roll-aways! Bake the meatballs 15 minutes until golden and firm. Switch the broiler on. While the meatballs bake, heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and garlic and cook 5 minutes then remove the cloves. Add crushed red pepper flakes then tomatoes and stir in the chicken stock. Season the sauce with salt and pepper and simmer 10 minutes, adjust seasonings and stir in the basil.

Drain. Place a large pan on medium-high heat. Coat the bottom of the pan lightly with canola oil. Tear off rosemary needles roughly and toss into pan. Add sausages and pan-grill until browned on all sides, turning as needed. By the time the sausages are ready, the risotto will be ready. To make the risotto: Wash and cut the potatoes into small cubes. No need to peel. Put potatoes in a saucepan, and cover with water. Add a sprinkle of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, turn heat down and simmer about 5 min until al dente. Drain. Heat the oil in a heavy, medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add the minced shallot, drained potatoes, with a pinch salt, and one ladleful of stock. Cook, stirring continuously, until the stock is almost fully absorbed. In a separate pan, saute the mushrooms in a bit of olive oil and toss gently until they begin to brown. Continue to add the stock to the potato mixture, one ladleful at a time, or until the potato is tender and creamy on the outside, about 5 to 10 minutes. Test it. If it&#39;s too soft, you won&#39;t need to add any more liquid. If it&#39;s still got a bite in the middle, you can add a bit more stock. Add the mushrooms, and cheese, and stir. Add the butter, and continue stirring, adding a bit more stock if needed. Begin to &#39;press down&#39; into the risotto with your spoonula so that some of the potatoes get mushed which will help to build that &#39;creamy&#39; texture. Finally, add a handful of washed baby greens (arugula or baby spinach) and stir until just wilted. Season with salt, and pepper, to taste. Place a spoonful of risotto on a warm plate and top with a single large juicy lamb sausage. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Gavi, Vermentino]&quot; 67992,&quot;Baked Cannelloni 1 19oz pkg Johnsonville Italian Sausage links, decased 2 tbsp Olive oil 1 med Onion, finely chopped 4 oz Mushrooms, finely chopped 12 oz Mozzarella cheese, cubed or shredded 2 Egg yolks 6 tbsp Butter 6 tbsp Flour 3 cups Milk, (not skim) 12 Cannelloni pasta shells 1/2 cup Grated mozzarella 1/4 cup Shredded parmesan 1 tsp Dried Oregano Instructions: Make the filling: In a large skillet over medium heat add olive oil, onion and mushroom cook for 5 minutes allowing the onion to soften and the mushrooms to release liquid.

Make the cinnamon-roll crust: Lay the remaining piece of dough on a lightly floured surface, and spread 2 tablespoons of the butter evenly on top. Combine 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a small bowl, and sprinkle evenly over the butter; gently press with your fingers to help the mixture adhere. Roll the dough up into a tight log. Trim and discard about 1 1/2 inches from each end, and cut the remaining log crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Arrange the pieces, cut-side down, in a snug circle on floured parchment paper. Lightly dust the pieces with flour, then gently roll out into a 10-inch round. Slide the parchment onto a baking sheet, and refrigerate until ready to assemble the pie. Put the dark and golden raisins in a medium bowl with hot water to cover. Let them soak until tender, about 5 minutes, then strain. Make the filling: Peel and core the apples, cut them into 1/2-inch-thick slices and toss with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the lemon juice in a large bowl. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the firmer apples soften but hold their shape, 15 to 18 minutes. (The softer apples, like McIntosh, will get very soft and saucy.) Add the flour, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and the nutmeg and salt, and stir until the juices thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, stir in the raisins and let the filling cool completely. (The filling can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 2 days.) Fill the dough-lined pie plate with the filling in an even layer. Invert the cinnamon-roll crust on top, and peel off the parchment.

Keep adding the milk mixture bit by bit, stirring well each time (be sure to get into the \\corners\\ of the pan, as flour often lurks there). Once the sauce has fully come together, turn up the heat and boil for a minute or two. The sauce will thicken considerably. Remove the pan from the heat.<br> Add two-thirds of both of the cheeses to the sauce while it is still hot and combine well. (It may be a bit lumpy, but that is fine.) Season to taste with salt and pepper and add to the pasta mix. If the cheese sauce thickens too much, add some of the pasta water. Stir everything together and spoon into 4 large ramekins or a shallow 3-quart casserole dish. Sprinkle the top with the rest of the cheese and the breadcrumbs and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese starts to bubble and the topping goes brown. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling]&quot; 68026,&quot;Chicken with Morels 1 - ounce dried morels, soaked for 30 minutes in 3 cups very hot water 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper All-purpose flour, for dredging 1 ?4 cup clarified butter 1 ?3 cup chopped shallots (2 large) 1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves) 1 cup Madeira wine 1 cup (8 ounces) creme fraiche 1 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Photograph by Charles Masters &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Riesling, Moscato, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68032,&quot;Chips and Fish 1 gallon safflower oil 4 large Russet potatoes Kosher salt 2 cups flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper Dash Old Bay Seasoning 1 bottle brown beer, cold 1 1/2 pounds firm-fleshed whitefish (tilapia, pollock, cod), cut into 1-ounce strips Cornstarch, for dredging Instructions: Heat oven to 200 degrees F. Heat the safflower oil in a 5-quart Dutch oven over high heat until it reaches 320 degrees. Using a V-slicer with a wide blade, slice the potatoes with the skin on. Place in a large bowl with cold water. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne pepper, and Old Bay seasoning. Whisk in the beer until the batter is completely smooth and free of any lumps. Refrigerate for 15 minutes. Note: The batter can be made up to 1 hour ahead of time. Drain potatoes thoroughly, removing any excess water. When oil reaches 320 degrees, submerge the potatoes in the oil. Working in small batches, fry for 2 to 3 minutes until they are pale and floppy. Remove from oil, drain, and cool to room temperature. Increase the temperature of the oil to 375 degrees. Re-immerse fries and cook until crisp and golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and drain on roasting rack. Season with kosher salt while hot and hold in the oven. Allow oil to return to 350 degrees. Lightly dredge fish strips in cornstarch. Working in small batches, dip the fish into batter and immerse into hot oil. When the batter is set, turn the pieces of fish over and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain the fish on the roasting rack. Serve with malt vinegar. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]</p><p>&quot; 68033,&quot;Chocolate Macadamia Nuts 3 1/2 cups whole macadamia nuts 3/4 cup corn syrup 21 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar, optional 1 3/4 cups unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder, optional Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the nuts in a large mixing bowl. Add the corn syrup and stir until evenly coated. Place the nuts on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven. Using a wooden spoon, transfer the nuts onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet pan. Do not touch them, as they are extremely hot. Let them cool at room temperature, or if possible, place them in the freezer because the cold nuts will help the chocolate to temper. When completely cooled, break apart any nut clusters that may have formed. Place the cooled nuts in the coating pan or in a large mixing bowl. Slowly add one third of the bittersweet chocolate, one ladleful at a time. If you are using the mixing bowl, fold the nuts until they are thoroughly coated and the chocolate has set. If you do not fold immediately, the chocolate will set and the nuts will stick together. Add another third of the chocolate and fold thoroughly until set. Add the remaining third and fold thoroughly being sure all the nuts are well coated. Separate any clusters of nuts that may have formed. If you serve the nuts as they are, let the chocolate set completely. If you decide to move on to the next step, do not wait for the chocolate to set completely. Add the powdered sugar or cocoa powder and stir until all of the nuts are well coated. If you&#39;d like to coat half of the nuts in powdered sugar and the other half in cocoa powder, start with the powdered sugar. Before serving, place the nuts in a sieve to remove any excess sugar or cocoa powder. The nuts will keep at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. How to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres): Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate&#39;s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Syrah, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot]&quot; 68034,&quot;Human-Friendly Dog Cookies 2 cups whole-wheat flour, plus more for rolling 1/2 cup cornmeal 1/2 cup wheat germ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3 large eggs 1/4 cup carob chips 1/4 cup honey 2 to 3 tablespoons water, as needed Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking sheets. Put the flour, cornmeal, wheat germ, and cinnamon into a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the eggs, carob chips, honey, and 1 tablespoon water. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together and form a smooth dough. If it feels too dry, add more water. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest 10 minutes. (Can be made ahead and refrigerated, just let it warm up a bit before rolling.) Dust your counter with some flour and roll the dough out until it is 1/4-inch thick using more flour as needed so it doesn&#39;t stick. Cut into shapes using a dog bone shaped cookie cutter, or use a knife to make the same shape. You can re-roll the scraps and cut out more cookies. Place on the prepared baking sheets and bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the cookies are well browned. Remove them to a wire rack to cool completely. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio]&quot; 68035,&quot;Spicy Clam and Corn Chowder 1 tablespoon EVOO 1/3 pound lean bacon, chopped 4 large ears corn on the cob, kernels cut off and cobs scraped 2 tablespoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, chopped 3 to 4 small ribs celery with leafy tops, chopped 2 fresh bay leaves 2 jalapeno or Fresno chiles, chopped or thinly sliced 1 red onion, chopped 4 cups chicken stock 3 to 4 heirloom tomatoes, chopped 4 pounds littleneck clams, scrubbed 1 lager beer Sea salt and freshly ground pepper Hot sauce, for serving 3 English muffins, chopped into bite-size cubes 1/2 stick butter (4 tablespoons) 2 tablespoons hot sauce 2 tablespoons fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. For the chowder: In a soup pot or a Dutch oven, heat the EVOO over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the corn and cook until the kernels are lightly browned at the edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the seafood seasoning, thyme, garlic, celery, bay leaves, chiles and onions, and cook until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, then turn off the heat. For the croutons: Arrange the English muffin cubes on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Toast in the oven until light golden. Melt the butter with the hot sauce. Place the croutons in a bowl and toss with the parsley, seafood seasoning and the butter mixture. Return to the rack set over the baking sheet and bake until deeply golden. Let cool. To finish the chowder: Place the clams and beer in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid, and season with sea salt and pepper. Cover and bring to a boil, then cook at a rapid simmer until the clams open, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard any unopened clams. Divide the clams and the cooking liquid among 4 shallow bowls. Ladle the corn chowder over top and garnish with the croutons. Serve with hot sauce. Cook&#39;s Notes: You can make the chowder base up to 5 days ahead. Cool and store in the refrigerator, then reheat over a medium flame. Buy the clams within 48 hours of serving and cook them just before you&#39;re ready to serve. You can store the croutons in an airtight container or in a foil pouch until ready to use. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Ros]</p><p>&quot; 68036,&quot;Macaroni and Cheese 12 ounces elbow macaroni, cooked and drained 2 teaspoons paprika 2 cups white sauce, in sauce pan Salt and pepper 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded 2 tablespoons butter 1 tablespoon dijon mustard 1 cup plain bread crumbs Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Add the butter and cream cheese and toss to coat with the flour. Using a pastry blender, two knives or your fingertips, work the fat into the flour until the mixture looks like moist cornmeal. Sprinkle in the water, a tablespoon at a time, gently working the mixture into a shaggy dough that just comes together when pinched. Gather the dough into a ball, then divide it in half and form into two disks. Wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes. For the filling: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and saut until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the potatoes and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes have softened, about 10 minutes. Add the green beans and bell peppers; cook for another 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl with the chicken pieces and set aside. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and whisk in the flour. Continue whisking over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes (it&#39;s OK if the roux colors -- I like the nutty flavor), and then add the cream, milk and vermouth. Continue stirring over medium heat until the mixture thickens, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan, thyme and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper, then pour the roux over the chicken-vegetable mixture. Stir to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool. Roll out one of the disks of dough into a rough 12-inch round. Line a 9-inch pie plate with the dough so that it overhangs the edge by about 1/2 inch. Dock the dough in the pie pan by pricking the bottom with the tines of a fork. Add the filling to the lined pie plate. Roll out the second disk of dough into a 10-inch round and top the pie. Crimp the edges to seal. Cut slits in the top of the pie to vent. Place in the freezer until the crust feels frozen, 10 to 15 minutes. (At this point, the pie can be wrapped in plastic and then foil and frozen for up to a month. See Cook&#39;s Note for baking instructions.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush the pot pie with egg wash, place on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 40 minutes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 68046,&quot;Haricots Verts en Salade Green Bean Salad 1 pound green beans 2 teaspoons burnet 1 tablespoon chives 1 tablespoon chervil 1 tablespoon tarragon 2 tablespoons parsley 1/2 cup oil 2 tablespoons wine vinegar 1/8 teaspoon fresh black pepper Instructions: Slice the beans in two lengthwise if you wish and boil them in salted water.

Melt a nut size bit of butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Place the slice of bread and the cut-out heart in the skillet and toast lightly, about 1 minute. Crack the egg into the hole, season with salt and pepper and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining butter as needed to brown and crisp the toast. Flip the egg and cut-out heart, then season with salt and pepper. Cook another 2 minutes for a runny yolk or slightly longer for a set egg. Transfer the egg-in-a-heart to a plate and sprinkle with paprika, if desired. Serve and use the toasted cut-out heart for dipping into the yolk. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Riesling]&quot; 68049,&quot;Serving Spoon Breakfast Vegetable oil, for frying Four 10- to 12-ounce pieces red snapper, rinsed, patted dry 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons seasoned salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon garlic powder 2 eggs, beaten 1/3 cup breadcrumbs 1/4 cup chopped onions 1/4 cup chopped bell peppers 2 tablespoons seasoned salt 1 tablespoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 2 eggs Two 12-ounce cans salmon, deboned and juice drained Vegetable oil, for frying 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 8 eggs, beaten Instructions: For the snapper: Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Whisk together the flour, salt, garlic powder and black pepper. Dip the fish evenly in the eggs, and then in the flour mixture. Fry until golden brown, then flip and finish cooking on the other side. Do not over-cook. Set aside and keep warm. For the salmon croquettes: Mix together the breadcrumbs, onions, bell peppers, salt, garlic powder, black pepper, eggs and salmon in a bowl. Form into nicely round patties (proceed AS IF you were making a hamburger patty). Pour enough oil into a heavy-bottomed skillet to just cover the bottom and heat over medium heat until hot. Fry the croquettes for about 4 minutes per side. For the eggs: Melt the butter in a skillet. Pour in the eggs and scramble to desired consistency. Serve the eggs with the snapper and salmon croquettes. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Ros]&quot; 68050,&quot;Churros with Chocolate 1 cup water 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, plus more for dredging Pinch kosher salt 1 cup self-rising flour 2 eggs, plus 1 egg yolk Peanut oil, for frying 6 ounces specialty flavored chocolate, chopped Instructions: Special equipment: Piping bag fitted with a large star decorating tip Make the dough by heating water, sugar and salt in saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the flour all at once and stir vigorously for 1 minute on the heat to dry the mixture out. Remove from heat and transfer the dough to a stand mixer bowl; mix on low speed until there is no longer steam escaping from the dough. With the mixer running on medium, add the eggs, 1 at a time, incorporating completely until a shiny, smooth texture forms before adding the next egg, and then the egg yolk. Scrape down the mixer bowl with a rubber spatula between each addition. Transfer the dough to the piping bag. Pour oil into a large heavy bottomed pot to a depth of 4 inches; heat over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F. To fry the churros, carefully squeeze the dough from the piping bag directly over the oil in 3 to 4-inch lengths, cutting the dough at the tip with a butter knife and gently dropping them into the oil. Turn frequently with a Chinese strainer or tongs until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Work in batches to prevent overcrowding the pan and allowing the oil to reheat to 375 degrees F between each batch. Drain the churros on a paper towels and then toss in sugar to coat while still warm. Melt the chocolate in a glass bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Arrange the curros on a serving platter and serve the chocolate sauce alongside. Enjoy! Cook&#39;s Note: Self-rising flour makes the churros a bit lighter and fluffier, but all-purpose flour works just fine. Pick your favorite flavored chocolate; I love the flavor of orange and chocolate or even bacon chocolate with these churros! &quot;,&quot;[Rioja, Tempranillo, Garnacha, Pinotage]</p><p>&quot; 68051,&quot;Snappy Gingers 2/3 cup unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup sugar, plus sugar for dusting the cookies 1/4 cup packed brown sugar 1 egg yolk 2 tablespoons blackstrap molasses 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon ground espresso 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon allspice 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt Instructions: Special equipment: an electric mixer with paddle attachment Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Let the leaves soak for 20 minutes, then drain and rinse to remove excess salt. Drain the leaves, snip off the stems (reserving stems), and lay the leaves on a towel to dry. In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of salted water to a boil, and stir in the rice. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook rice until water is absorbed, about 17 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet, add the onion and saute until soft, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and saute one more minute, until aromas are released. Add the lamb and cook until the meat is well browned, breaking it apart with a fork while cooking, about 15 minutes. Add the oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the feta and remove from the heat. Stir in the rice, parsley and mint. Place one leaf on a flat surface, vein side up, shiny side down. Place a rounded teaspoon of filling in the center of the leaf, near the stem edge. Fold the stem end over the filling, then fold both sides toward the middle, and form into a roll. Squeeze lightly in the palm of your hand to secure the roll. Repeat process with remaining leaves and filling. Line the bottom of a 3quart heavy saucepan with reserved stems, trimmings and any leftover or torn grape leaves, and arrange bundles seam sides down, packing them close together in layers. Combine the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil with 3/4 cup water, the sugar, and lemon juice, and pour over the stuffed grape leaves. Place a small, heatproof plate on top of the stuffed leaves, cover the pan and simmer over low heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until leaves are tender and most of the liquid is absorbed. Serve warm, garnished with lemon slices and mint leaves. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Ros]</li></ol><p>&quot; 68069,&quot;Sauteed Asparagus and Snap Peas 1 pound asparagus 3/4-pound sugar snap peas 2 tablespoons good olive oil Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper Red pepper flakes, optional Sea salt, for serving Instructions: Cut off the tough ends of the asparagus and slice the stalks diagonally into 2-inch pieces.

Add the salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes, to taste, if desired. Cook for approximately 5 to10 minutes until al dente, tossing occasionally. Sprinkle with sea salt and serve hot. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Vermentino]&quot; 68070,&quot;Cranberry Tangerine and Candied Ginger Tart with Cardamom Crumbles 1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 4 ounces unsalted butter, very cold and cut into 1-inch cubes<br> 6 tablespoons heavy cream Butter, for greasing 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar 2 tablespoons tangerine zest 1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon ground cardamom 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon ground ginger 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 6 ounces unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 3/4 cup granulated sugar Zest of 2 tangerines 6 cups fresh cranberries, washed and dried<br> 1/2 cup candied ginger, cut into small pieces 1/3 cup dark brown sugar, packed Instructions: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br> For the tart dough: Combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Add the cold butter and toss to coat. Pinch the butter and flour together until the butter is flaky. Start to rub in between your fingers until it looks like coarse cornmeal.<br> In the center of the bowl pour the cream. Using a rubber spatula, turn the flour over in the bowl repeating until the cream is absorbed. With your fingers press the dough to form a compact disc. Remove the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill, about 1 hour.<br> Working quickly, roll the dough into a 13-inch circle and carefully place it into a greased 10-inch tart pan. Gently fold the excess dough against the sides creating a reinforced crust. Press down the dough, trimming if there is extra that extends beyond the pan. Chill for an additional 30 minutes.<br> Place kitchen parchment paper over the chilled dough, fill with weights, beans or raw rice are prefect. Bake, 15 to 18 minutes. Reduce the oven temperate to 350 degrees F. Carefully remove the parchment and continue baking until the tart shell is golden brown and fully baked, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside and allow to completely cool.<br> For the cardamom crumbles: Begin the cardamom crumbles in a bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, with the sugar and tangerine zest. In the palms of your hands, rub together the sugar and zest to release the tangerine oils. Add the flour, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger and salt and mix at medium speed until small clumps of dough form. Dump onto a sheet pan. Chill until needed. This can be made up to 2 days ahead.<br> For the cranberry tart: In the palms of your hands, rub together the sugar and zest in a large bowl. Add the cranberries, candied ginger and brown sugar and toss well. Fill the baked tart shell with the cranberries, top with the cardamom crumbles and bake until golden brown and the cranberries begin to bubble up through the crumble, 45 to 50 minutes.<br> Remove the tart from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature. I prefer waiting an hour or longer before cutting the tart. This gives the very juicy cranberries time to cool, allowing the tart to set up. I&#39;ve even let it sit all night on the counter. &quot;,&quot;[Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Sparkling wine]</p><p>&quot; 68071,&quot;Grilled Sweet and Tangy Pork Chops Four 1 1/2-inch thick center cut bone in pork chops Neely&#39;s Seasoning Salt, recipe follows Sweet and Tangy Glaze, recipe follows 2 tablespoons kosher salt 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1/4 teaspoon celery seed 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup tablespoon real maple syrup 2 tablespoons ketchup 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 1 dash Worcestershire sauce 1 dash hot pepper sauce (recommended: Tabasco) Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Instructions: Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
